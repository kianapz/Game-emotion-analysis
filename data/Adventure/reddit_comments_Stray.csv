18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine. It‚Äôs probably around 10 hours tops. It‚Äôs quite simple but exploring as a cat has a charm to it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs a fun game. Interesting story, cool environments, good amount of exploration, and even some light puzzles and combat. The game itself is fairly short. Probably less than or around 8 hours for a playthrough. If you‚Äôve always wanted to play a game as a cat though it‚Äôs a must buy for sure."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"At $20 it is a good buy imo.  It's not hard, it's definitely not complex or deep in terms of gameplay, it's just a game where you play a cat in a strange world seeking friends and answers.  It has mild puzzle, stealth, and ""combat,"" sections, but mostly about exploration.

&#x200B;

If you go in looking for some profound and challenging experience you will be disappointed.

&#x200B;

If you go in looking for a heartfelt game where you get to be a cat you will get you 8-10 hours of enjoyment and feel happy."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It has a very cool cyberpunkish vibe and if you like cats, its extra cozy imo. Not a long game, but still a good time."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Its more like a visual novel to me. You talk to robots, you bring them things they need. It even got some tears out of me. There are also puzzles and stealth parts."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"IMO a good quality game is not meassured by how many hours do you get out of it.

One of my personal favorite games is Fire Watch it's about 6 hours long but such a great game. Visuals, sound design, story, everything is really cool. Also the game does feel longer than it is actually"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Stay IMO is exactly what it‚Äôs advertised as: a fun little cat game. The ‚Äúmixed‚Äù reviews IMO mostly came from people thinking it was going to be some mind blowing game of the year epic or something, versus the reality that it was a cute little cat simulator. 

Hell, when it released it was only $30 because they knew it was a short and simple game. It took me around 10 hours or so and is well worth it. It‚Äôs not mind blowing but it‚Äôs a fun and pretty unique little game."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's not super long but it's cute. My cat was super interested in the cat on screen, and kept trying to sneak up on it, but would bolt when I turned it to face him. 

If you like cats you will probably like the game, but if you are strictly a dog person you might not be as charmed."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I thought it was great, didn‚Äôt understand the hate. It was a cute, simple, straightforward game that had a satisfying finish and gorgeous graphics. Definitely no replayability, but it‚Äôs good to experience."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,">Novelty of playing a cat

That‚Äôs about it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"No, it‚Äôs pretty boring just moving forward and hitting x the entire game. People just liked it because ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù. The environmental storytelling is good though"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's just a walking simulator...
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"it's one of those games that absolutely wouldn't have gotten any attention, but it initially launched as an exclusive for the ps5 so it got a lot of praise and more of a spotlight for that simple fact (see death loops 10/10 reviews for another example). it's honestly nothing to write home about"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I really did not care for it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I had a lot of fun with it.

I believe I spent about 6 hours on it. I'm not sure of the replayability, but I had a good time."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If it wasn't about a cat it would be dismissed by most people, so just ask yourself if that piece of it would bring you enjoyment."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Overhyped

Its cute but boring"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I bought it as a cat lover and the idea that I could play as a cat in the game. Had no idea at the time about the robot stuff. I was perfectly content being a cat seperated from my family trying to make it back home.

There was a certain level of endorphins released while playing. Brought my blood pressure down the little of it i played"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's overrated, and boring."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Fantastic. Made me realise how I much I wanted to play as a cat in a video game.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's decent, but it was waaay overhyped just because ""lol u can be a cat, so random"""
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's boring. The main thing that pushed it was twats going ""omg kitties"""
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs the same thing over and over.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,The game is 5 hours long on average. People who say that it's 10 hours are probably expecting you to play it twice or something lol.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I thought it was great fun
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,6-10 but I loved every Nya-no second of it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Good fun, not super long

It's not really an action game (a few action sequences), so just make sure you want an atmospheric exploration game with light puzzling."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Extremely overrated. 

First hour or so you should really enjoy, but then you realise there's not much about it unless you want to finish the story or just enjoy lazily exploring a city as a cat."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I had to stop playing because my cat was getting too confused by the cat noises.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Great game. I played it for 10 minutes.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs surprisingly meh.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I loved it. It‚Äôs short. I think 8-12 hours. Being a cat is dope.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I think most of the hate stemmed from it having  meme energy on the internet, and that fueled the attention more than the quality of the game.  I remember it making top five lists for the year for a lot of categories.  While I think it's novel, and a good experience, it is not so great that I would consider it a must-play for that year it came out.  I could see that backfiring and attracting a more varied audience for a niche game - and as such - attracting more negative reviews.  

However, it has a unique feel - and so if you're looking for a pallet cleanser, it might scratch that itch."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs charming but like if it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúOMG CAT ‚âΩ\^‚Ä¢‚©ä‚Ä¢\^‚âº‚Äù‚Ä¶ people would be able to see it‚Äôs kind a meh game that takes 8 hours tops and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ ok.

If you can get it cheap, it‚Äôs great. But I think the people that spent $30 overpaid"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's pretty good, nothing incredible but good. I'm just kinda unreasonably salty it won indie awards over say Tunic. Feel like it got weirdly high mileage out of you playing as a cat"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If Stray didn‚Äôt have a cat as the protagonist, nobody would‚Äôve played it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,It's kind of like Myst in a lot of ways.  I think you'll like it more than you'd think.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I found it boring, couldn‚Äôt play it beyond a few hours. The cat mechanics are clever and really well done, it‚Äôs just a shame they didn‚Äôt put the same effort into the world they built. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,My wife and I both enjoyed it greatly
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It's very okay.  Free was a fine price.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"No, it's 5 hours. It's a walking simulator from a cats perspective with a press ""A"" to progress and nothing happens. It's atmospheric at least, but that's about it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Very mid tbh
I got bored about 2 hours in but I can kinda see why people like it, esp if you're a cat person which I'm not lmao"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I kinda hated it. I found it a mostly boring puzzle game that makes you waste your time. There are some fun Alan Wake style action sequences but not enough for my taste. It may be one of my least favorite games actually.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Stray is a short game but tells a cute little story without narration, it is a game to experience as a short experience and is touching in a heartwarming way."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I was so excited for the game when it was frost announced. A puzzle/detective game where you play as a cat? Awesome.

What we got instead was a mediocre platformer with poor excuses for puzzles. It was about 4 hours of boredom for me."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I loved my time with it, and felt sad at the end that I was leaving. It‚Äôs like a point and click adventure really, full of charm though. The music is fantastic too, was plenty of times when i‚Äôd just vibe out with some bleep funk on the radio. I‚Äôd recommend if you like indie games, cyberpunk, robots or cats in any ratio."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I liked it. Not the most robust or challenging game you'll ever play, but it's got an interesting story and some good production value. The puzzles are clever, but short-lived. Pacing is a little random.

Overall it's a great game to get on sale, but don't be surprised if you're left feeling like your meal could have been a little larger."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Neat concept, but I got bored after about an hour"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I didn‚Äôt love it as much as others seem to. I really enjoyed the first hour or so where it‚Äôs mostly about just being a cat - exploring, leaping about and so on. No game has let me do that before and I was really liking it.

But then as it goes on it introduces combat and stealth sections, and I lost huge amounts of interest at those points - I‚Äôve played a thousand combat and stealth games before and those elements felt completely unnecessary in Stray. It just felt to me like the developers had a great angle for a unique experience, but then couldn‚Äôt help but make it as ‚Äòvideogamey‚Äô as they could.

I‚Äôd rate it 6/10, because I did like it enough to finish it, but it just didn‚Äôt hit the spot for me that it seems to have for others."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I love cats. I have owned many cats. My gf and I have 2 cats.

This game was boring af üòÇ

Still love cats. They're better irl"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It was a pleasant experience that wasn't expected. Played it on psplus but never fished it (kid preferred to use it as a cat petting simulator) but it looked and played great.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Maybe 9 to beat it. Was amazing.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,There is nothing good about this game beyond the novelty of playing as a cat.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I was glad I played it after I was done. It was adorable and my cat really enjoyed it also
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"One of my all time favorites to be honest. Visually the most gorgeous game I've ever seen (Im personally a sucker for the nature/cyberpunk aesthetic) and though simple, the story kept me really engaged"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"You‚Äôre asking the wrong question. It‚Äôs not about quantity of hours. It‚Äôs about the quality of those hours. As with any game ymmv in that regard. For some it was a monumental experience. For me it was a good time with a nice story that didn‚Äôt overstay its welcome, which was about ten hours."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Very chill interactive experience tier puzzles. Like 10 hours as others stated. I played it in like 5 sessions and found it worth my time, though a bit unmemorable."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Its a fun game with cool aesthetics, but I couldn't help feeling like they could have done a lot more with the concept."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It has a good atmosphere, but the ""story"" and the gameplay will disappoint if you have big expectations... It's a fine game, but that's it.

You ask how many hours I got out of it, well, personally kind of wish the game would have been a bit shorter \^\^"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2024-03-06,"I loved it, but I didn't play it to make it to the end as fast as possible.

Fundamentally it is a puzzle/walking/adventure game with not very difficult challenges, combined with moderately tricky action/escape sequences- a number of which I had to play multiple times before figuring out how to make it through.

The real joy of the game is not in the ""figuring things out"", it is allowing yourself to relish the world it presents (which is beautifully rendered) and slowly learn the story of what is going on.  The cat is rendered and behaves in a delightfully cat-like way.

If you enjoy the atmosphere, the cat-ness of it, and the emotional story, and give yourself time to take it in, then you'll enjoy the game.

I took it in a leisurely fashion, tried to complete as many of the side quests as possible, and reached the end in about 12 hours.   I found the end to be beautiful and moving."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I loved it. Didn't have any pre conceptions but it was one of the best games I played this year. As others have said it is pretty short but well worth getting.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"As a video game doing video gamey things, it's not that special. But as a 'cat walking around for 10 hours' experience, it's amusing."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Very fun little game. I recommend it to every cat lover lmao. I've got a plat in less than 8h.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I really liked the game. I had about 10 hours playing it but was really in no rust to finish. I tried to see where I could nap and explore all of the corners. It‚Äôs a fun and enjoyable experience to hang out in, but if you are out to beat it the game would probably get thin quickly. 

As a side note, there‚Äôs not much replayability to it, but I really want to go back there. I would love them to release an update or DLC that‚Äôs just cat‚Äôn around the map with lots of stuff to knock over or looking for the best sunny spots to nap. Sometimes, an hour of chilling out as an orange cat is the sim I really want."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,10 to 12 hours and I thought it was amazing. I want a Stray 2 open world game now. MOAR KITTAH!
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I loved it. It's 10-15 hours or so. I enjoyed the story. It's simple gameplay. You're a cat after all.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Loved it. Ended up getting all the achievements in it too cause it was so fun.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"For a cat person, Stray got such cute little detail that they can relate, and that amplify the experience they have playing it. its more like a one time experience game, with little to none replaybility. yet, the few hours spent in this game is worth it. 

Would highly recommend if you are a cat person OP. would also recommend if you like chill short games. wouldnt recommend if you have grudge against cats in general."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I found it touching
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I really enjoyed it! As an adventure game it's nice and simple with an interesting investigation plot with a cool art style.

If you can get it cheap it's a worthwhile play."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,i liked the game.Played it for around 10 hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It's pretty boring and I dropped it after an hour.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,No. It's cute and charming but really shallow and over in about five hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"The idea seemed cool at first but the novelty wore off after about 4 hours. I finished it once, won't be revisiting it. It's an ok adventure game with puzzle solving."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs a massive disappointment relative to the high reviews it got but a good time if you go in with realistic expectations. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a 7.5 with +/- 0.5 margin
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's a good game, I think it's worth the full price imo so if you get it discounted then definitely. I played through it once and got 12 hours out of it according to steam."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It looks nice but gameplay it a bit so so. It's basically a modern take on a point and click adventure game with ok game design. If that is something you'd be interested in and if you like cats you'll probably love the game. It has great atmosphere and good esthetic design.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's a neat little 10-15 game depending on how good you are at puzzles and how often to stop to look at stuff. 

10/10 one of my all time favorite games."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's barely a game. More of a walking simulator. If you're into that and cats then you might get something out of it, personally I would say go spend your money elsewhere."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,No it's not it has no gameplay realy to speak off and it took me less than three hours to get the  platinum blind it was a joke this was a game of the year contender lol don't waste admittedly a very small amount of time on this.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I‚Äôve played it a couple of times (probably more than 30 hours) for fun and speedrun practice. It‚Äôs a fun game with a neat story. I love playing it over and over. Do recommend giving it a try.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I think it‚Äôs a good game. I was invested in the world and was keen to uncover the story. 

Probably 8-12 hrs?"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs a great wind down at night game.  It‚Äôs pretty short though.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Yeah it‚Äôs good and short.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's a very good game, probably 10hrs top to finish it. I played it over a weekend, and got all of the achievements except one. There's an achievement for completing the gangs in 2hrs, which after playing it I almost tried because if you know where to go and what to do it seemed like a very manageable achievement to get. Just never tried to get it. If you can get it on sale for less than $20 totally worth it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs not very good.  It‚Äôs Uncharted with a cat and the whole gameplay is just pressing X
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I have 7h of playtime and finished it while a exploring a good bit but I very much enjoyed it and don‚Äôt feel like it was a waste of money.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I loved it. It‚Äôs a short game, but a fun and entertaining ride."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I wasn't a fan personally.  The gameplay is kinda cool and they absolutely *nailed* the expressiveness of the cats (my cats literally would not leave the TV alone the whole time I played, they thought *real* cats were in the TV).

There's some cool environmental puzzles, some cool collection stuff, a lot of meaningless missables.  But the story... absolutely killed the experience for me.  Without spoiling anything, the game was very much teased as a sort of cozy ""cat adventure"" in a futuristic cyberpunk world but the story focuses way less on the *cozy cat adventure* and almost entirely on hamfistedly jamming political views down your throat with a cyberpunk backdrop.

I wanted to have fun in a futuristic adventure world as a sharpy animated cat.  Instead I got about 10 hours of ""DAE think late stage capitalism will inevitably lead to fascism and the apocalyptic downfall of humanity??? Isn't capitalism *horrible????  Guys???  Guys??? Hey did you know capitalism is bad????  Guys????""*

I fucking get it, I don't care and I dont need to be reminded every single dialogue, I just want to get this cat back to his friends :(

The ending is also >!painfully sad.  Fair warning.!<"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I liked the aesthetic and the ""people"" quite a bit. I'm not a cat person whatsoever and I enjoyed the one playthrough."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I lost interest after an hour and never went back. I think the game is less than 5 hours long.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"If I remember correctly it's like 8 hours. It was pleasant, a vibe, and I liked the story and world. 


Definitely worth I'd say like 30.


Certainly a novel gaming experience. Basically AC with a cat.

I don't really understand the outsized vitriol the game got. It's a solid made game with a fun twist. Wish there were more like it. 

The only gripe I had was the rat popping light minigame in the first major level. Felt unnecessary. Just being a cat running around was way more fun than that kind of action filler bullshit used to make idiots feel like something is exciting when the setting itself is evocative enough."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I finished it in 22.4 hours, which is much less than I expect to get out of most games, but it was worth it.  For this type of game, I would compare it to the cost of going to a movie theatre."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I put 29.2 hours into it. But I think a good chunk of thst might have been sitting/sleeping in various spots. Or my kid just panning the camera around the cat and making it meow. Did I mention there‚Äôs a dedicated meow button?!?!
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs a very fun unique game. If it‚Äôs cheap on sale I say get it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It was cute and fun. The puzzles weren't terribly difficult but still enough to make you scratch your head.

It felt good to finish, wasn't a long game by any means, but there's lots of unwritten side stuff you can do and explore.

Doesn't need a sequel but did really show off the cat controls"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Holds a special place in my heart as the first game i played after an unexpected hospital stay and emergency surgery where i was away from my wife and home for 3 weeks. Sure we completed it in like 10 hours, but i loved every second"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Fun game. Took about 10 hours. Good exploring,  graphics and environments. Meow button is cool."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a fantastic 10/10 game in my opinion. Great atmosphere, great story, fun gameplay. Only problem is, it's short. I have, I think 20 hours in it, over two playthroughs. Once as a blind playthrough, and once as a guided playthrough to find all the secrets and get all the achievements.

If you like cats, it's absolutely 100% worth it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs more of an experience than a game. Only took me 5 hours to beat it playing casually and focusing on story
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was fun to play with my wife, who doesn't normally like to play games with me.

I would let her play until things got a little dicey, then she'd pass me the controller to get through it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If you go into it with the expectation of playing a cat as it wanders through a cyberpunk city, what I recall it being advertised as, you‚Äôll get that for the first third of the game. It shifts to become something different for the rest of the playtime however. If you approach it as a weird dystopian story from an outsider‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs not bad."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I think it was a short game, I wanna say 4-6 hours? That's if you do everything like collectibles and trophies. 

It's even more fun if you have a cat. I spent a good 15 minutes making the cat in the game meow and confusing the hell out of my real cat lol."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,There's a Meow button.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I finished it twice
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's objectivley bad gameplay. 

The biggest pro is ""cat"" and it really doesn't offer much more then the feeling. But if you really love cats it's probably a good game.

I say that as a person who likes cats."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,One of the best indie games Ive ever played
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I couldn't finish it.  I found it very boring.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Not bad. I got a good 20 minutes out of it before I returned it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs a cute game. The environments are interesting and fun to explore (there isn‚Äôt much exploration to be had but still cool to look around) and the gameplay, while very barebones feels great. I don‚Äôt know what fairly cheap is but for $20 or less it‚Äôs definitely worth playing"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I loved it. Everybody knows it as the cat game but it's actually one of the best entries in the cyberpunk genre in recent years.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I was pretty bored but it was cute at times.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I got it on PlayStation plus, it‚Äôs a good game but I wouldn‚Äôt spend more than 25-30 on it"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I was disappointed by how short it was. Didn't find the ending satisfying either
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,What did Google/YouTube say?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I found it to be boring
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,"Gameworld made me ponder what had happened in the past. If you are into environmental storytelling, I personally think the gameworld was wonderfully crafted."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Length üëè doesn‚Äôt üëè dictate üëè quality
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"The game has amazing world building, fun mechanics that don't overstay their welcome, a solid ""show don't tell"" storyline. I'd rate it a 10/10. It's short, but you get a lot out of it. One of my favourite gaming experiences of all time."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Very short. It‚Äôs an enjoyable game and one of the few to get the waterworks going but my platinum was about 6 hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's short, but was a decent exploration experience."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"i found it enjoyable, but there's very little replay value"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It's fine. It was maybe 6-8 hours. I certainly wouldn't want it to be any longer.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I beat in 9 hours total. it's a good game, can't say I didn't enjoy it"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I have 5.5 hours on steam in 1 playthrough with 50% of the achievements but I think I actually saw everything in those hours, I just didnt scratch the carpets or walls enough to get more achievements. I would only buy on sale though for like 20 bucks"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,where are you getting it cheap second hand?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It was fun for a bit. I got really bored halfway through and by the time I wanted to play again it was removed from the free games.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Played about 4 hours of it. Was fun for a bit just chillin catting around being a cat but haven't gone back. Glad it was free though.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"yeah, it's a pretty basic twist on a traditional point and click adventure game. Fun, you won't get more than a day or two out of it, and there isn't much replayability."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I really enjoyed it, but it is fairly short.  About 7-9 hours.  If you have a PlayStation, you can just get a month of ps plus and play it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Mixed reviews? You gotta stop paying attention to whoever you're paying attention to then.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Around 7. I enjoyed it, cool atmosphere, nice story, beautiful environment. Made me cry like a baby."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Got like 16 hours for the plat. It's a delight.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"To know the shortness, I would say that you can speedrun it in under 2 hours by just playing the game again. I'm honestly surprised more people don't have the speedrun achievement.

I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a laid back game, but it is visually beautiful"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's good, around 6.5 hours."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs honestly a good time. They really nailed the cyberpunk dystopia atmosphere. Story is pretty decent also. Not very long, you can finish in under 10 hours"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It was enjoyable. I platinumed it mainly because it was easy to do so. I had fun. Got it for free on a monthly games deal but something I would pay over $20 for.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Play it and then Watch Creator.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Took my 9yo son 8.5 hours to beat it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I personally liked it but I can see that it wouldn't be for everybody.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Loved it - felt different, had an engaging world design. The only thing I didn‚Äôt do was the speed run trophy. It was a bit annoying."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I think my first play through was about 8-10 hours. To get all the trophies was about 20-24 hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs fun but trying to get the trophies pissed me off.  Overall a cute game, nothing amazing though."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Played the story in 5 hours. Didn't get all side things collected so could probably push 2-4 hours more trying to get them
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's a very short game. Cute, but short. I actually don't like short games though. I liked it, but it was over way too early."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Pretty sure it‚Äôs on game pass and psplus
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"If you get the platinum, probably 10-12 hours. If you do one playthrough it‚Äôs only about 4-6 hours, depending on how much you explore the details. It‚Äôs a great deal if you find it on discount"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I liked it, it‚Äôs very cozy and bittersweet"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I enjoyed it. A good looking puzzle style game that is non stressful and has a story. I enjoyed it but I'm the ""100 percent when I play discovery games"" guy so I got around 20 hours out of it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"If you enjoy a nice post-apocalyptic world to explore, you'll like it. I think it's a really specific niche. LIke in Horizon Zero Dawn my favorite part was just trying to explore and find little clues about what happened to cause the apocalypse. I'm just a sucker for post-apocalyptic worlds."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I got like 8hours out of it. It's pretty fun but very short. I'd wait for a discount.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I turned it off after half an hour.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It's amazing and I love it but it's way too short. Maybe 10 hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I got 7 hours out of it. I had an absolute blast with it. Puzzles were fun, being a cat is amazing, and the gameplay is fun. 

I played it for ‚Äúfree‚Äù on Ps plus."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I got bored about 3 hours in, and I was really excited for it to come out"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Once the charm of playing as a cat wears off, it‚Äôs pretty standard platformer fare. I got bored a few hours in and stopped."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs not super long, but it‚Äôs enjoyable. At a discounted $20 on Steam that is fair"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It‚Äôs an excellent game. I‚Äôm not even a cat person and I still think that it‚Äôs the best PS5 game that I‚Äôve played so far.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's fun. A bit above average in my opinion, so it's ""good"" but not ""amazing"". Gameplay was solid and I had no noticeable bugs (PS5). The novelty of playing as a cat was definitely fun. 

I think I played through it in about 10 hours. I only went back for the easier trophies, but didn't 100% the game."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I've played 5.4 hours. I really enjoy the world and exploring it. I didn't much care for the action sequences. I still have it installed, but IDK if I'll get around to finishing it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's essentially a walking simulator with a cat. The gameplay itself is very basic platforming with some simple combat. About 10 hours of gameplay depending on how much you explore.

For $20 I think it is a fine game. I enjoyed the art style and the cyberpunk/android environment. One of the few walking games I enjoyed. If you watch trailers and it looks interesting you will probably like it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I had loads of fun with it mostly because I like cats it's fairly short
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"great little game that knows exactly what it is and doesn‚Äôt overstay it‚Äôs welcome. i actually would agree with it winning indie GOTY, the atmosphere, world building, and aesthetic are all amazing"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,found it boring
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"it's fun, cute, and pretty. it's very short for the money, and pretty simple with some super minor puzzles. i think if you can get it for $10 or less it's worth it"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's good but perhaps not for everyone, some people may think it's boring if the don't feel the atmosphere."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I liked it a lot! I think I finished it in a few hours. Maybe around 6hrs I wanna say?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs for cozy gamers. My girlfriend loved it, as did her best friend. They spent a lot of time just knocking shit over as a cat.  In my opinion, it‚Äôs a perfect game, in that it delivered exactly what it advertised and did so very well.  If you didn‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs perfectly fine. It means you weren‚Äôt the target audience."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs just okay in my opinion. Nothing special, yet I really enjoyed playing it. It‚Äôs not too long and I found it a really chill/relaxing game to play. Other than that nothing special like I said."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,My cats love watching me play but I get bored easily.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Great exploration game, I think about 12 hours. If you like cats or dystopian future, it‚Äôs amazing"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If starfield can be considered a horrible game, then I'd say that Stray is below that in it's barely even a game. It barely has any sort of player input and you could change the whole cat aspect of it that isn't required by the setting and then what are you left with?

A linear exploration game.

It was somewhat fun uncovering the world and the perspective was cool, but I've played similar in a different where you transform into a smaller creature that's needed to get through puzzle/exploration areas but it had the added bonus of having combat."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äòs an ok game, carried by graphics and the fact that you play as a cat."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's relatively short, but it's fantastic...

I'd rank the experience higher than a handful of longer more ""mainstream"" AAA games easily..."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's cute, it's interesting, and meowing at security cameras who nod back never got old.

But it's short. I usually take a *really* long time finishing games, and I completed this one pretty fast. If you can get it for cheap, I'd say go for it - it's more fun than a drink at Starbucks (or even 3)."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's s lovely game, but GOTY candidate was a stretch."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Is it a good game? No

Does it have a cat in it? Yes so it‚Äôs 10/10"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was a great game for me and my wife to relax and play over a few hours together. It was fun, quirky and different to other stuff. Definitely worth playing."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Stray is most definitely a game. I can assure you, with a 100% guarantee, that it is one of the games I've played."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs a great game. It‚Äôs creative, fun and endearing. I spent 13 hours on it as a completionist. I did everything in-game and all but 2 hidden PS achievements. There is a varying degree of difficulty in the puzzles. I liked the storyline and if you love cats, it‚Äôs even better."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I loved it. If you don't want something too heavy and with simply game play, Stray is the go to.  It's kinda therapeutic."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Think this would be a great candidate for a switch port
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a walking simulator with some very light puzzle elements and a few opportunities for very basic combat.

The atmosphere is cool. The NPC's you don't really develop a connection with. 

It's just....ok. If you like cats or have someone just getting into gaming, it's probably going to be worth it. 

If you are expecting a deep narrative experience with a rich story or riveting gameplay, that's not this game."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's a walking simulator but you're a cat.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's fine, it should not have won best indie last year lmao"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I got maybe 5 hours, and then stopped playing.

Wasn‚Äôt bad, wasn‚Äôt great. It was available on PS plus extra, and I felt like there were other games I‚Äôd rather play more than it.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs worth playing for cat people."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a good game that is overrated. While I love cats, I played almost 10h and I was bored most of the time."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Stray is a great game. 7-8 hours long or so. Deserving of a GOTY nomination to recognize its originality. Jealous you‚Äôre playing it for the first time!
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs not spectacular or anything, but it‚Äôs still enjoyable."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,i suggest watching rantons review about that game
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a charming indie game with lovable characters and an atmospheric world.  However, not a terribly lot going on in terms of gameplay or challenge. It's pretty ""on the rails"" as a game, with just a few explorable hubs."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was a cute, moderately fun game to explore. Pretty short, maybe 10 hours max, I beat it in maybe 6 or 7 hours doing some of the extra stuff but not a ton. It was fine, not super memorable, but if the idea of hopping around as a cat and talking to robots sounds like fun, it's worth a shot.

I mostly got a lot out of it because my dog was obsessed with it. Every meow had him staring at the TV, fully engrossed."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If you like cats you‚Äôll like this game. I loved it. Short and sweet, interesting concept, and the ending made me teary eyed. I‚Äôd give it a go!

Edit: Also has a banger soundtrack"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,its okay for an idie game
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I really enjoyed it, characters all had a nice charm too. If you like adventure games that aren't challenging, it's great."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I got bored about halfway through it and never finished it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a good story wrapped around an okay game. It's also made being a cat feel very cat-like. Like you just want to get up high and knock shit off shelves and damn that's satisfying.

IMO it was worth the $30 price tag it originally had, so if you can get it on sale, even better. I'm gonna say 6 hours start to finish, but I'm not certain. I played with my kid so we spent a lot of time goofing around."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I love it, but be aware that there isn't much in the way of skill-driven gameplay, and not much replicability either. It's more about experiencing a charming and interesting world. I absolutely recommend it, but it's not the kind of game you should count the hours on."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I hit that meow button so many times
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You have to go in knowing that most of the game is exploring as a cat.  That's it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Meow... üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"6 hour little point and click adventure game. Gameplay design is fairly simple but there's good variety, so it feels fresh the whole runtime. 

If you do not find the idea of embodying a literal house cat to explore and play interesting, you probably will not like it. It is very much about the central gimmick of being a cat."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,stray is even better knowing that that one crazy pirate Empress girl went batshit over it in her message
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I loved the game for the introductory missions and just being a cat. Once the actual game started it got real old real quick.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's about 10 hours. 

It's a simple but very atmospheric and unique game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and pre-ordered the physical copy for ps5 for 30 dollars and didn't regret it. But I was very excited for it and enjoy those types of games to their fullest extent. I can't say I've played much that's *quite* like it. But I also like to take my time with some games. The story is, like the game, short, but also like the game, interesting. There's a small collectible component in one of the initial areas and some fun little achievements.

Given the length, I'd say it's worth 15 for quality. Otherwise wait for a sale for it to be 15-10."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Playing it at the moment and loving it. Isn't super long and you basically just jump around a cyberpunk city (small areas) as a cat. But the visuals are lit soundtrack is bangin and it's relaxing as fuck.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Stray was my 2022 GOTY and made my personal top 50 games of all time list.  It doesn't hit for everyone, but when it hits, it *really* hits.  It's well worth the price tag, and it's eight to ten hours long."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I loved it, but I'm a major cat guy. I have 4 of them. So walking around as a cat exploring and solving basic puzzles was awesome."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I'm really glad I played it. It isn't the longest game (I have 10 hours on it), but it was an enjoyable one."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"About 7 hours or more. I spent most of my time admiring the attention to details. The graphics are good and u don't need a tutorial to play it. Just know your key bindings and explore. Solve mysteries and exploration, that's the game"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Enjoyable. It‚Äôs a 6-8hour game. It is a fairly simple game but looks great, has some decent enough puzzle aspects and is something a little different."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Its not just a good game; its a 10-15 hour work of art, in my opinion."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I was bored with it within the first couple hours.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Good experience, and it was around 5 hours for me and I was playing extremely slow."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Just play it, don't be a pussy"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I got probably 15 hours out of it because I went for all of the trophies. It isn't a huge game but it is an interesting story and it is remarkably fun jumping around as a cat.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's just long enough to be ineligible for a refund.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Don't pay more than like $20 for it, but it's absolutely worth playing. For what it's worth, I got it when it was free on PS5, loved it enough that I ended up buying it on Steam"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Being a cute cat is fun, but the ""combat"" is rough. After several hours against the first enemies, I had to put it down"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs a fun game. Not crazy difficult and relatively short. But it‚Äôs cool and has a dope style. Cyberpunk? Retrofuturism? Idk something inbetween those. If you can get it cheap go for it
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I love cats , so yes for me"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's very short but it's a beautiful experience imo. Slightly biased as I'ma big lover of cats but it's full of charm and really captures the 'cat' experience.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Stray was really fun.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I loved it, but I also lost my 19yr old cat at the time so it really helped me at the time. I'd still recommend it, it's unique if nothing else."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I adored it. I spent maybe 8 hours on it but I‚Äôm not hugely experienced with this style of game so it took a minute for me to catch on to the objectives. If you like the cutesy idea of being a cat and listening to robot music for 8 hrs, then it‚Äôs def a good game. Not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea!"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs a good game, and one that‚Äôs relaxing and chill. It‚Äôs not intense or frustrating. Just a nice kickback game."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Are there any sad moments?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's fun. There are some moments that are a bit annoying, but it's fun. One of the main issues is how short it is"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a great game. Got about 8hrs out of it. Mostly quiet platforming and world exploring and finding out the story through lore, punctuated by frenetic running away at moments. If you love cats you will love the game. Really moody and atmospheric, responsive controls. Loved it and definitely worth it if on sale.

The cat has a lot of character."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,6
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I loved the art and the story. I think I completed it in about 6.5 hours but I think it was definitely worth it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's a pretty chill, charming and easy game. If you want more, you may be disappointed. It is a good game for what it is trying to do. Playtime is probably around 6-10 hours."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Its nice fun little game that lasts probably around 10 hours.

Bonus: if you have a cat irl you can watch it circle around the tv confused about the cat talking on screen ;P"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Personally, I think it‚Äôs ok.   

It‚Äôs a standard platformer with the main selling point being you are playing a cat and it‚Äôs atmospheric storytelling. The graphics are quite beautiful and the story is ok.   

It‚Äôs not a bad game, especially for indie standards but I didn‚Äôt understand the hype of why it got nominated for GotY. There is no DLC so getting it second hand won‚Äôt result in you ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù and it is a pretty easy plat if you are a trophy hunter. It‚Äôs a pretty glitch free and ok experience but got a lot of underserved hype because cat game imo."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It is an inexpensive games with a mix of both positive reviews and negative reviews among the community. I believe you are on the right path to finding out the answer. Good luck
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Worth a 10 note no more
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Platinumed it on ps5. Got it for free when it released.  

I played through a few times with my kids probably got about 12hrs out of it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I think it's cos it might have gotten more hype than it really needed or deserved tbh. It's just the 'cat game'. But that year the hype and novelty of ''the cat game'' meant it was talked about in the same vein as GoW Ragnarok and Elden Ring so many people were probably disappointed
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The best about the game: music, lighting, environments/levels, story
The worst about the game: often clunky contextual controls for jumping
Overall: great package, sweet story and definitely a game to remember"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I loved it, one of my favorite games on PS5 and the graphics and art are fantastic"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I thought it was phenomenal. Then again I don‚Äôt have much time to spend on video games but I personally liked it. Don‚Äôt know how much time I‚Äôve put into it but pretty long
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yes. It's simple and enjoyable. I'd describe it as a quirky eye candy game. I played it with my Wife, we loved it. It's more of an experience and less of a hardcore gaming thing."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Story and mechanics are straight forward. Can finish it during daylight. That said, game is good. You can feel the atmosphere it sets."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I loved it. Wasn‚Äôt particularly fan of the first hour because I didn‚Äôt get the mood the game was going for. Then all of a sudden I felt very cosy playing this game and was actually sad when I got it over with. Definitely in my top 3 games played this year

It lasted 8h for me. You could probably get around 12h tops if you go for the platinum"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Bought it and never played it
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's amazing. If you like cats that is. It's very good in letting you do cat things. 8-10 hours one playthrough. Max 20h platinum trophy. Totally worth it considering it's free or cheap. Had more actual 'fun'/entertainment than with Elden Ring, which I had played right before."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Not my style, so I did not enjoy. At first it seem unique, but when I entered the ""large maze"" - I gave up. Walked around for prob an hour until I gave up and had no idea where to go. Total playtime prob 2-3 hours of mine."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Well, beside playing a cute cat, it's a real basic exploration game with nothing more to do than wandering."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"8.4 hours according to steam.  was a fun little game, def worth a try"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Not much of a spoiler so just gonna say that you can idle in the game and I wish I could use the game as a screensaver sometimes to just hang out with a cat
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"6 or 7. It‚Äôs charming and has memorable visuals, but not much in a way of engaging gameplay or replayability."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs not complicated. It‚Äôs not hard. But it sticks to you. And like some other post-apocalyptic pieces, there‚Äôs a real emotional sticking point to the retrospectives on contemporary times. I found it very worth the price of my subscription but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it. And certainly not at full price."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs *solid*, but not particularly challenging or even really very engaging. It has everything a game needs, so to speak, and it‚Äôs real cute and well-crafted, but once you finish it you just feel a bit empty and disappointed. A lot of ‚Äúis this it?‚Äù

But if it‚Äôs cheap, by all means buy it. It‚Äôs not a bad game at all, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not *a lot* of game. It‚Äôs a nice starter, not a main course."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs short but really fun and relaxing. Would never play it again but I‚Äôm glad I went through it once
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I played through it once, I had a lot of fun. There is an achievement for completing it in under 2 hours, which I‚Äôd imagine is a targeted speed run, but it should give you an idea. Fun game, worth ¬£20 or so."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I had fun with it, but it is very short"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Boring af. 

Interesting world, boring gameplay. in only got praise cause people like to play as a cat..

A solid 4 or 5/10"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It is a walking simulator but as a cat. Got some light puzzles and combat. Kinda liked it more than I guessed.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I found it fun but I got stuck at the end and haven't finished it yet
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ita a good game with a good story but it's short.  You can rush through it without exploring in 2-3 hours but if you look for memories, explore and do little side quests you would probably be looking at around 10 hours.

It's certainly worth playing at least once."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's fun! It has an interesting story. You get to play as a cat too which it doesn't happen often. Definitely worth playing it
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I think I played it for 5 hours? One regular playthrough and then another speedrun to clean up the leftover achievements. I enjoyed it both times, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back to it. Kinda done everything there is to do. Although I have a friend who‚Äôs done probably about 30 playthroughs, mainly trying to improve his PB, but he also downloads mods inbetween playthroughs to shake things up a bit."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"From what I understand, it's more of an artwork than a game. Not much replay value or unique gameplay, but it has a pretty art style."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just played for a few hours. Thought it was kind of boring and hoped for more interactions.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was decent - can probably get 2 playthroughs out of it with the 2nd one on the highest difficulty or the trophy speedrun.

Was refreshing in how it was an original idea at the time."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"i quite liked it, its realy coosy but its only around 5-6hours playtime."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I didn‚Äôt get too far before becoming bored and giving up but I wouldn‚Äôt say that makes it a bad game. The gameplay and graphics are great if you like that kind of game.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I got the platinum trophy which is rare for me to try and do. It took around ten hours. The game is pretty simple but really charming. The short length also works in the games favor. It always moves things along before a section gets boring. 

I get why some people who paid $40 were disappointed with the length. If it's on sale for like $20 that seems more than reasonable to me though."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Stray is a game targeting people who love cats. 

If you aren't into cats, it's probably going to be an okay game, done in about 20 hours.

If you love cats, you'll spend those 20 hours just scratching up the couch, all while meowing, simply because you can.

I'm a cat lover, so for me, Stray hit all the right paws, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a fan of cats."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was ok, what was there was well done but not enough to it for me."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's fun, it's creative. But it's also very short.

[https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790)

I wouldn't pay over $20 for it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It is enjoyable. Not too long. It runs well on the Steam Deck.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Just a simple arcade runner, nothing more."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Though its not for me, my wife loved it. She is a cat lady who mostly enjoys retro adventure games.

Wasnt me, so i'm not sure on the hours of gameplay"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I enjoyed the heck out of it. Got more then 10 hr, prob 15-20 but I play slow and flip a lot of stones. It wont be for everyone, its more about the story and setting then the action. Its kind of an interactive Miyazaki movie."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It didn't do much for me. The novelty wore off after about an hour for me.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's about $34.99 worth of game
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's successful at what it sets out to do. If you can get it cheap and want to play Cute Cat Game then get it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It was a nice experience, but I can‚Äôt see myself replaying it. The story was okay, but I wasn‚Äôt really into it"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,Yes you play as a cat
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,"I played it for a bit but lost interest for other games.Just like Baldur's Gate 3.But that one is another bag of cats(don't like the combat system,no hot chicks characters to play,etc).I was planning in resuming playing it but like i said.There was so many other games that were more interesting for me."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,Will Check this one
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,"I really like this game, took probably 10-15 hours to finish. However it‚Äôs a zero 0% replayability  factor for me. Definitely a one and done."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-30,"No, got bored after reaching second area and quit playing. Controls are clunky and the game is super easy."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-31,"Depends on how you play. It's an experience, an adventure with amazing atmosphere and storytelling. Take your time and you'll enjoy it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-31,It's peaceful if you want that type of game. I enjoyed but didn't complete.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2024-01-01,"It's nothing special, but it's not bad. It's just a very generic game"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2024-01-05,Okay yes the time span of the game sucks!!! I wish it was longer however the game is extremely detailed in my opinion and has so many features that bring the game together all together it's an awesome experience to play also emotional for some
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"This is exactly it. I see some folks deride it as a shit game. Its definitely not shit, but I wouldn't call it great. I'm a cat person and I fucking love cats, but the people who called for it to be a GOTY were huffing the litterbox dust. It definitely has charm to it, and it's worth checking out on sale, but it's nothing that's gonna be remembered by gamers as a whole in a few years."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,What kinda car?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Even though I have to say I didn't *feel* like a cat. Click X to jump here. And then click X to jump there. Those prompts really killed the immersion of swift and sneaky cat movement for me.

But world building and press key to meow were good!"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Isn‚Äôt it also on game pass?
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Ten hours? It's barely two for a full blind playthrough and about three maybe four to get 100% if you are slow.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"10 hours is a huge stretch, unless you're going to go for all achievements including a 2-hour speedrun."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I took my time and played it calmly, still only took me 6 hours from start to finish."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I have played and my opinion:

 - Story and atmosphere are really good (8.5/10)
 - Gameplay is okay (6/10)

The novelty of you being a cat is fun, but not for very long. The ""parkour"" is pretty railroaded, making it very easy and the opposite of frustrating (I personally see this as a plus).

Some puzzles are a bit tough to figure out, not because they're very hard, but because it's not always obvious what you need to do and the solution might require you to do something seemingly unrelated. Very little subtle hints as well.

Also a relatively short game, but honestly the perfect length. Any longer and it would have dragged on and have become boring.

Definitely experience the game as an exploration game. Just walk around, get a feel for the levels and atmosphere, talk to everyone and gather as much information as possible. Don't attempt to just rush the storyline."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Do you think a 7 year old would be able to play? We just got a PS5 for the family, and my 7yo daughter is feeling left out."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yep, I played it this time last year in the week between Christmas and New years eve. Horrible weather outside and ate good holiday food. 10/10 comfy as fook."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Tbh I feel like a 120hr game will inevitably have a lot of repeated actions, there's more change you'll drop it. Short games are much better in this regards"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"They were separate, somewhat unrelated questions, but agree with your sentiment."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I feel the same about Journey
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Exactly how I feel about Edith Finch
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Fire Watch is an awesome game!
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Although I agree there is a limit to this. I can enjoy a 6  to 10 hour well crafted linear game for sure with good replay value but stray is barely 2 hours with no gameplay or replay value at all to speak of and the one mechanic it has is clunk and poorly handled.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Honestly the story was deeper and more emotional than I expected going in, I thought it would just be a cyberpunky cat simulator but I was pleasantly surprised!"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Well it was nominated for GOTY at the Geoff Awards
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It got hate? It seemed to me like it was very well loved.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I don't know what you consider ps5 exclusive because Stray was available on PS4 too from day one.    
Agreed that it wouldn't get that much attention if not the circumstances, but it was more about good release date and hype because of cats"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Most games are
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Also the story feels incomplete, near the end you would expect to at least see certain characters that showed up at the beginning of the game but it never happens"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Exactly. I just started it last night, and you couldn't be more correct. It's a pretty weak platformer, and there's very little to interact with so far anyway."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I stopped once all the ""people"" showed up and the town.  I have no idea how far that is into the game, but it was after many puzzles."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,The first question was about quality. The second about quantity.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Cyberpunk game...political? No way. How is that possible. It's almost like the setting is inherently political.

18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Intro and ending
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,When the cat gets the backpack though...
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I disagree in that its the best game ever made for RPing as a cat. 

Not that it has any competition üòÖ"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I think some folks call it ‚Äòshit‚Äô because their expectations were way off from reality. They were expecting a full open-world Cyberpunk with cats from a studio with a couple dozen developers. Wasn‚Äôt gonna happen. But with expectations in check, it‚Äôs a great little game. 

I do agree though, absolutely not GOTY material, but again, it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be. It‚Äôs fine for what it was - a cute little story about a lost cat in a ‚Äòcyber‚Äô-style world."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Haven‚Äôt played the game but it did seem like the game earned its GOTY *nomination*. It definitely wasn‚Äôt GOTY but seems like it was an excellently executed game. I currently have it on my wishlist on my Series X, just waiting for a good sale on it."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I just don't call it a game because it isn't.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,its also a gorgeous game too
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"But goats, they will be remembered."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It'll be remembered. Not because of it's actual gameplay, but still remembered."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"People calling it to be GOTY were mostly trying the rile up  Elden Ring fans, which generally worked."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I wanna say Honda Civic, but I am not a car guy. Can anyone confirm?"
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I feel bad that you‚Äôre getting downvoted because you happened to post that reply _just_ before you saw that I‚Äôd edited my original comment‚Ä¶

18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can run around holding the jump button to make the transitions more seamless.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can also turn off the prompts in the settings. Still no free jumping but it‚Äôs less immersion breaking if you need it.
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It used to be on PS plus extra or premium, whichever one is basically Sony‚Äôs game pass. That may be what you‚Äôre thinking. Not sure if it is anymore however."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,No
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I'm sure they'd love it, but you might need to help them out in some of the trickier bits."
18s9kb3,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"üíØ.  It was the first game my 5yo nephew played (kinda) well without frustration.

Yes, while Cyberpunk *as a genre* leans into specific themes, it's not always as ham-fisted about it and it doesn't *have to*.  You wouldn't normally expect a game about a cat trying to get back to his friends to actually just be 10 hours of completely unapologetic political commentary that just happens to have a cat in the background, even if set in a ""cyberpunk"" setting.

The problem was that it had so much hype surrounding it: the reveal trailer was one of the most interesting I've seen for ages, with such amazing atmosphere and tone. Combine that with Internet cat frenzy, some of the news that came out about how they'd been working on it for quite a while and spent a lot of time trying to replicate realistic cat movement, everyone's imagination went wild on a hugely innovative game.

The atmosphere and tone in the game itself is great, and the story behind it pretty cool, but the game behind it is very simple. Movement and platforming was fairly simplistic and there isn't much to it beyond following the story and the cool world they created. This was reflected in its price, and is clearly all it was ever really meant to be, but expectations are guided by hopes and dreams sometimes.

I thought it was a fun game. Great atmosphere and a nice story, chill to play."

Cat jumps are point A to point B in a very brief instant just like the game did, which is why it was restricted that way. I'm sure you don't mean it should jump like Mario but maybe you're thinking of Little Kitty Big City, where the jump has more freedom but is more floaty which kills some realism. Stray has more realistic environment so it would be jarring if the cat jumped like that.  
  
Cat is small enough to go under cars and if it crawled they'd have to add invisible walls because cats can virtually crawl anywhere. They let you explore roofs? I thought the cat feel was the thing they nailed compared to the rest"

Regardless of the genre or scope, that ought to be the bar for a GOTY nomination, right?

>Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.

Again, I think you're mixing up meanings here. There's a difference between a game with low interactivity and a game with little substance.

I love games that function as storytelling devices rather than highly interactive gaming mechanisms. I simply think there are better examples of the genre than Stray. 

>A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn‚Äôt automatically bad.

I agree. But once again, I did not claim Stray was bad, merely that I think the scope of its ambition is stretched a little thin by the relatively bland gameplay. I'd rather it committed one way or the other."

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"She looks just like my Szyslak. However, he has done nothing notable with his life except turn my hair gray to match."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Where is the supporting cast?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Literally the only actor I've ever cared to meet
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Method acting at its finest.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,My cat could definitely get a job as a cat voice actor. She's great at meowing on demand. And without demand.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Absolutely beautiful, 10/10"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Cute kitten!

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,She's one of the only cats that can legally unionize.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Hope we get Stray II
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Is there any proof at all ? Not saying I don't believe OP but this is just a picture of a cat lol
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,How much did she get paid?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Reminds me of my cat that I had to put down last year :(
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Was expecting an ‚Äúask her anything‚Äù at the end of that sentence.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Peak acting
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"She did really well, but method acting is getting a bit far..."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Does Lala do autographs?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,The voice catress*
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Adorable baby girl she diservers a gamer award.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I can't believe that game got nominated for game of the year.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Deserves to be treated like a movie star with an acting reputation like that.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I'd love to see behind the scenes videos of the recording sessions
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,The first 30 seconds of this game is still a better live story than twilight.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Any stray cat could have been the cat voice actor for Stray.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Stray is overrated.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Awwwwww. Little meow.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-17,Fun fact: she is about to star in the new Hairy Pawter game

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I was wondering why a photo of a cat got 50k+ upvoted and then I remembered *this is the internet*
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,They're taking our jerbs!
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"She did a great job! Congratulations, Lala."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Where‚Äôs the AMA?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-15,Can she jump? Because you can't jump in stray
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Voice actor lol.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I like her better than the Bayonetta lady
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,This made my whole night. Truly.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,please tell her I love her

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"I mean no insult, but I hope he was prodded to make specific vocalizations."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Ok, but can we appreciate them using an actual cay?

So many dev teams and shit will have a voice actor meow, because I guess real cats don't cut it."

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I love her
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"How does the concept of animal voice actors even work, do they attach a mic to their heads and just hope for the best?"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Hey Qu√©bec, saviez-vous que c‚Äôest Jo√´l Legendre qui faisait la voix du chat dans Caillou?"

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,The orange cT that was used for reference should sue for having it's likeness used
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"God, taking jobs from gingers everywhere they can!"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Typical Hollywood.

Always some supermodel playing an everyday Joe."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Only a matter of time before she's on the cover page of tmz for doing hard-core drugs and causing a scene
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Where is her Grammy ?!?!?!?!?!?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,The legend

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,For some reason the blurriness and artifacts on this picture is very comforting. Looks like a photo from a digital camera in the early 00‚Äôs.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I have an ex named Lala and this strangely matches her vibe.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Did they hire actual robots to ""voice"" the robots?"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Chris Pratt in the love action adaptation tho

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"It's not Cheddar, but it's not some common bitch either.  Lala gets my upvote."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"I really liked Stray, it was a nice one off adventure with some really nice art design. Cat was cute but I hope he reunited with his friends in the ending."

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I'm currently playing that amazing game
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Tell her to use her clout to get us resolution of the cat's story. It ends before your ultimate goal is accomplished. STUPID.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Probably has a SAG card and everything.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,My dog thoroughly enjoyed her performance! He was on his (back) feet watching her and trying to get into the tv.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Loved your work Lala, good job"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I own this game and anticipated it like few other games. When I got it I played for an hour and was so let down it has sat on a shelf. Should I go back to it? Does it get better or even great?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,u/Dusty5paw Can we get an AMA with her?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Cat voice cat

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Am I the only one that thought the Cat in Stray sounded nothing like a real cat?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Did they have to cause the cat discomfort to make hissing / negative emotion type of cat noises ? How does that work , u cant just tell the cat to ""act angry"""
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Wasn‚Äôt there a teletubby named Lala?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Cute, looks like one of my neighbours cats"

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Why didn‚Äôt they use her likeness as well? She‚Äôs way cuter than the model used for the game.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Did they make her join SAG?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I‚Äôm playing this for the first time and all of my cats are so intrigued!!
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Nothing surprises me after the voice actor of Gordon Freeman.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Lol can you imagine the recording room?

Voice Director: ""Take 32! Alright, say it a little slower this time!"""
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,How is that game - is it worth getting?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I think she didn't even know that and don't give a fuck actually. Just give her some food.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,omg she's so cute

I think it was the 4th achievement I got, the one before was meowing 100 times. I got all of the being-a-cat related achievements before getting to the big tree city thing which was scratching things and jumping 500 times."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Same, haven't finished it but I've been meowing at everything. Once I saw it light up a string of lights I was like... What other secrets does meowing hold?!"
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Seriously... I spent a lot of time just doing stuff... finding all the spots to chill at and let the cat nap.. it was a chill experience. Also the paint.. and making paw prints.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"I know nothing about this cat in particular, but she was probably trained for film/TV (like the character Goose in Captain Marvel, a cat in a cat food commercial, or the monkey in Pirates of the Caribbean). To take another guess, the cat may be naturally chatty, and so the trainer worked to develop her into performing different types of vocalizations on cue (a cute meow, hissing, yowling, etc). After the casting director got over their initial ""I have to cast what now?!"" they probably started asking around in the niche animal actor community and someone was like ""Oh, I have the perfect cat!"". Other considerations that the casting director probably had to account for (besides a cat who sounded appropriately cat-like) would be the range of vocalizations the cat can perform, their willingness to perform in an unfamiliar sound studio (I heard they were worried Goose wouldn't like the actors in their alien costumes since they were totally unfamiliar), their willingness to perform directly in front of a microphone, and their willingness to perform over and over again (I think Jack the monkey could be difficult to work with at times because he got bored of doing the same thing)."

My most talkative cat was a Russian blue and I dearly miss him. Interestingly enough, when he died recently, my next oldest male cat, a tuxedo, started meowing a lot more. I think he's taken the place of leader and representative of my cat pack. He's the one who tells me when a bowl needs filling and meows at me when I come home like his big bro used to do even though he didn't really do it before.

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Did you really just call a game where you hold forward, and press X to win ""groundbreaking""? Fuck me."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Elden Ring wasn't groundbreaking? Lol, yes it was. It broke the internet. If Elden Ring isn't groundbreaking then Stray is an average game.

As for American Football, I agree its better to watch but basketball is infinitely more fun to play."
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,there's so much vertical environment in Stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 9/10 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,So they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes ""meow""."

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,Its a relaxing adventure/puzzle game not a domestic feline simulator....

113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,I'm aware what it is. I'm also aware of what it's not. It's not for me.
113blzj,2023-02-15,2023-02-16,"Plenty of relaxing puzzle games allow you to jump and explore, though. I find exploration and freedom in a game relaxing in itself.

But weird to imply that jumping would some how not make sense because of the game genre. Besides, you can jump up on to most things in the game."

w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Tons of words are the same between them is what I'm realizing haha. Probably more similarities between those languages than English and German
w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and Romanian are all romance (as in *roman* languages) - they evolved from Vulgar Latin (the Latin of common people, as opposed to classical).

You will get a lot of similarities, not just in words but in grammar too, like how every word has gender, the existence of ""the"" (la, el, le, las, Los, etc), the general-to-specific word order

Big yellow cat (becomes big cat yellow):

* gros chat jaune
* gran gato amarillo
* grande gato amarelo
* grande gatto giallo

#---------

You will realise that the Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Icelandic), Scandinavian (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish), uralic (finish, Estonian, Hungarian), slavic (Russian, Ukrainian), romance languages, Greek and the indo-persian languages are similar (like the word *father*, pater, pitar, Vater, fa√∞ir, padre, batko, pateras)

I mean, even the word cat, gato, Katze, gat, qut, Chat


I make this point because in India, the northern languages, based on sanskrit, is more similar to all the languages I said above, than it is to the southern languages (based on old-tamil). The southern languages don't have a ""the"", there isn't a 'is' (es, ist, hai), words do not have genders like in Germanic and romance languages, a lot of concepts of gerunds and grammar are different, like you know how you would say ""I **have** *a* cat"", ""**Tengo** *un* gato"", ""**Ho** *un* gatto"", ""**habe** *einen* Katze"", ""ya **maru** kota"", ""**paas** *ek* billee hai""

In tamil it's ""ennakku *oru* poonai irukku"". Literally, ""to me, one cat exist""

So er yeah when so much is different,

#never ask an Indian if they speak Indian

It's not even close to **do you speak European**, it's like *do you eat stuff?*


sorry I got carried away"

Ended up getting it free with PS+ which was a nice surprise. It's a good and unique game, but  $30 for 4-7 hours?

Also, for such a short game at $30, I shouldn't fall through the map or get my character stuck forcing me to restart from a previous checkpoint. I mean, it's 7 hours max, you couldn't make sure it worked? I had to reload saves 3 times because of bugs.

The story is cute, but the (text) dialog is bad, or just poorly translated. Not sure which. The end kind of pissed me off, but I won't spoil it for you.

Overall, no, not really worth $30 unless you like short games or just really want a unique game, which it most definitely is.

One of the required trophies to platinum is ""beat the game in 2 hours."" That should tell you something right there."

Overall, no, not really worth $30 unless you like short games or just really want a unique game, which it most definitely is.

One of the required trophies to platinum is ""beat the game in 2 hours."" That should tell you something right there."

That's not entirely true, pretty much every surface has a jump prompt, and places that don't usually have something that you wouldn't be able to walk on to excuse not being able to jump on it, so it's pretty much a jump button that only works when there's something to jump on in the first place."

w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Calling things that cost money ""free"" is so /r/latestagecapitalism"
w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"It's free with subscription to a certain tier.  That sentence is factual.  It could be discounted or not discounted at all at a certain subscription tier.

Edit: sure it's ""included"" with subscription to a certain tier.  But I guess the essential tier games are free?  Who knew all y'all are so specific when they all basically mean the same thing.

Keep the downvotes coming, i don't mind.  Like i said, i guess the ""proper"" way to say it is ""included"" but I still stand by my opinion.  It's also free with subscription.  Because it could be discounted or trialed or whatever with subscription, the fact that it's free is true, just as much as the fact that it is included is true."

w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,I think term you are looking for is it's 'included' with your paid subscription.
w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Nothing is free if you have to pay for something to get it.
w8lnzg,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"If you pay for a subscription, and the purpose of that subscription is to give you games, you're effectively paying for games. That'd be like subscribing to Game Informer and getting a free magazine.

If the subscription has another purpose that you pay for, but also happens to give you games, the games are free. Similar to getting the Gamestop Pro Rewards which happens to come with a subscription to Game Informer.

I went into this knowing it's a short game, but I don't mind that. Not every game needs to be long. I'm a busy person, so I appreciate experiences like this. The gameplay is simple but engaging, and the audiovisual design is worth the price of admission."

this is probably already known by most people here but for anyone who doesn't know, you can let the cat sleep for an hour to get the productive day trophy. at first I was like, aw cute it sleeps but why lol. also wanted to know if I had to let him recharge. you don't. it's mostly for the trophy and for ambiance. you can fall asleep next to the music robot (forget the name) after giving it a piece of sheet music you want played as well. could make for a good nap time for you as well lol. just thought I'd mention for anyone who didn't know!"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I'm about 3 hours in. I personally feel like this is really fresh and so creative. I'm a big fan of games like Inside, Limbo, Journey, Abzu, Edith Finch, etc... So I'm biased! However, I feel that people are focusing SO much on the cat that they're missing how rich and thoughtfully constructed the game is. The gameplay is as simple as it could be‚Äîbut it works. That simplicity allows the player to enjoy all of the intricacy of the world; the culture of the robots, the curious nostalgia of this post-apocalyptic landscape, the sweet and optimistic relationships between characters, the spectacular soundtrack. It's not for everyone. But I certainly don't find it boring, the pacing seems quite effective. I think it is a game that demands a lot of the player, however. It is kind of only interesting if the player allows simple aspects of the game's world and environment to become the meaning of the experience. I think that if it's taken to be almost meditative‚Äîif its pace is accepted‚Äîit has a lot to offer. And it's so clearly a labor of love!"

Like occasional clipping, the animations can be a little jerky, and most importantly the game sometimes really struggles with implementing vertical gameplay in a compelling and atmospheric environment. What I'm saying is that there's A LOT of times when you clearly see that you should 100% be able to climb a building or something using the very prominent ledges and whatnot but the game just won't allow you to.
But that's honestly about it. Other than that this game is literally everything we've been waiting for, it really doesn't disappoint."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I hate the game. It's overpriced if you don't get it for free with the playstation plus. You can't argue it's not. It's 5 hours long if you just play through your first time without looking for the collectables and it's $30. Most of the game is scripted such as the jump ability. Not being able to jump freely removes all difficulty from the game and pretty much makes this game nothing but a walking simulator with a story and a few puzzles. I know I'm going to get hate for this but it's the truth. This game is over hyped only because you get to play as a cat. If you played as a human nobody would praise the game.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Does anyone know how this runs on PS4? I have a slim and can't afford the upgrade to the 5 right now. But I still really want to play this game!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Great game!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,The cropped thumbnail had me wondering why PSP was back.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I'm really dissapointed I don't have a ps5. Really wanted to play this.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"From looking at the thumbnail, I was very confused as to how and why they were referring to the PSP."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"At first, I liked the idea of a game like this, but, the more that I think about it, this would be a game that requires a lotta patience to sit through. It's like that one other indie game with a strange player character who has a cool red scarf who *also* has to go from point A to point B for no particular reason."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Is this PS4/5 only??
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. I just realized that I might be able to play PC games instead on the Switch now that I have a laptop after seeing the posts about this game.    


I have a Dell XPS 13 with i5-1135G7 and 8gb of RAM. Can I play this game?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"The city will look up and shout
""Save Us!""

And I will whisper,
""no"".


""MEOW!!!!""."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"This game is great, i just wish it didn't make me so motion sick after playing for a while. Not even sure what causes it"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Shame it isn't on Xbox.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Jajajaja

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Psp stray confirmed?

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Will gladly try it for 4.99 or less.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,wish we had it on xboc
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I forgot about this game. Looked pretty fun

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Is this the game about Kowloon Walled City that finally got released? I've been waiting ages for this to come out!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,is it just me or does the cat look weird somehow? I cant put my finger on it it's something with the shape of it's head or the eyes and the jaw that is just off.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Well, time to begin my journey."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Why is this so hyped? From what ive seen it‚Äôs a short shallow puzzle game
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I want this as a wallpaper. Anyone got the sauce on a HQ version?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's a pretty world with good music. That said, it feels like more of a mini game in last of us than full out game."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,loved ‚ÄòJourney‚Äô I think this is right up my alley
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Okay but the ending is kinda ass if you care about the cat more than the robots.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Watched a friend's stream of it and fell in love with it, I need this game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,nice marketing
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,cant see how anyone will enjoy playing as a cat lol
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Genuinely considering buying a playstation just for this game
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,A new PSP game in 2022?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I played for a few hours last night. I found all the music sheets, got the poncho, got the 3rd item from the vendor,  and opened the safe, but I'm still looking for a 3rd energy drink can and a 4th notebook. I have no idea what I'm doing but it's fun."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Can you modify its appearance like be a Serbian fluffy cat or what?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Inb4 downvotes but everything I've seen of this game so far makes it look like a strand game.

You just fetch quest shit and run around.

Is this true?  If so pass for me but you do you, it's fun to watch at least."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Wait! So it's out for the PS3? Sweet!!!

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,The new Cat Simulator is looking good!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Loved this game!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I got to chapter 3 last night after work. Even though the game is linear feeling with puzzles that aren't very challenging, I'm loving the game. I feel like they captured the life/personality of cats very well with what you can do (i.e. pushing paint cans off the edge just because you feel like being a little bastard)."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Its fun to do cat things without being a cat
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Name your cat ""Batman"". You will be severely disappointed."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I would poop my pants and sit for days for this to be on xbox..
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Good for kids? Or are the spoilers in this thread too much to handle?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Pspspsp is pretty witty.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Is there an actual story you're either meant to follow or have the option of following? 

Is there a reason to go back after beating the game? 

Are there missable trophies?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,This looks cool
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"After Elden Ring, might be my second favorite game of the year.

there is a zen like mood in that game. its  super chill."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Took me a moment to realise that the ""PS""s not only stood for ""Playstation"" but also set up like the sound you make to get a cats attention. lol"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Does anyone think Nintendo Switch will get this or is it unlikely?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,[removed]
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,How much $ do you all think Sony paid the developer for the game to be a PS Extra/Premium freebie?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Cat
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I love the game. But considering the whole game is about being a cat, I feel they could have worked more on the cat models look and aniamtions cause theya re kinda janky and rough."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I need to buy this
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Shame they excluded half the console players.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Is the game worth buying
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,DANTDM just played it yesterday
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,LETS FUCKING GOOO
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Absolutely loving this game. 

Playing as a cat in such an oddly unique robotic world makes things so interesting that it's difficult to not want to know more of what happened and what is going to happen."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,About to play it right now
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I can't wait to play it.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,This is only on PlayStation?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I've been waiting for this game. I heard about it a couple years ago, and then it vanished off the face of my world.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I‚Äôm so excited to play this.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-24,I wouldn't mind keeping this cat.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-24,Just started occasionally meowing at the wife and kids - quite amusing their reactions.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Yes. Thank you. I added this to my Steam wishlist the minute I saw the gameplay video. Such an amazing concept. Very creative.

Oddly enough, Stray seemed to be an experience where I knew anything I imagined, no matter how cool, wouldn't come close to the actually finished product. I have high hopes for this one!"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It's really good so far.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I got a similar feeling from Firewatch. Exploratory and ambiance.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Cloudpunk sorta. It‚Äôs a softer, sometimes lighthearted voxel-styled cyberpunk game.

Selling point is being a relaxing hovercar drive around game.

Similar chill vibe."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Lost Ember
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I've gotta second Flower as far as the chill vibe, though it doesn't have the intellectual depth that Stray has (dealing with hard subjects like poverty, human greed, etc...) Flower is literally just drifting in a field as a gust of wind and hitting all the flowers until the field lights up and brings you to the next little maze. 

As far as the theme goes, Detroit Become Human has that futuristic wasteland/ AI-taking-over type of vibe and it's got a really good message to it too. Plus you can make choices throughout the game, giving you different outcomes based on what you choose.  If you haven't already played this one of course lol, I know it was pretty popular when it came out"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It‚Äôs an older game, but prior to playing Stray it reminded me of Tokyo Jungle, the gameplay is not at all similar but wandering around a city as a small animal has its similarities."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Spirit of the North is similar not in world design, but in general concept; you play an animal and just get dropped into the world with no real idea what's actually going on, at the beginning.  And as you progress you learn more and more about the environment."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,The closest thing is Machinarium honestly
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,>!That‚Äôs the only thing that kinda disappointed me but I also would‚Äôve cried!<
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-22,I‚Äôm hoping we get a sequel or DLC where that happens
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-08-17,"For real, I went through the whole game like ‚Äúyeah, gonna reunite you with your buddies‚Äù And then B12 dies and I can‚Äôt pick him up and take him with me in hopes of finding someone to repair him. And then the door opens and I think ‚Äúthis is it, even closer to finding my pals.‚Äù Nope. Fuck me. Overall loved the game though."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Possibly my favorite game of all time is called Inside. It's a simple left-to-right puzzle platformer of sorts with an intense moody atmosphere and mysterious/eerie setting. Not too long, but definitely worth multiple playthroughs. And the sound design is absolutely on point. I'd highly recommend it, especially since it's not too long."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I enjoy my big AAA 60 hour open worlds, but a nice short little game like this with great polish and atmosphere makes for a superb pallet cleanser"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I prefer short games now. I don't have the time to play long games. It's reached the point where if a game is supposed to be a huge, sprawling experience it kinda pushes me away from trying it.

I work constantly all week and maybe have 3-4 hours to play a game every couple weeks. I can't play all these 100+ hour games like I could in high school and college."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"My ideal length for games is 20 to 30 hours. I‚Äôll happily play shorter games but not longer games.

- The Pathless

- The Last of Us

- Spider-Man 2018


Games I will play:
- TLOU2 

- Spider-Man MM

- Stray (started yesterday)

- Firewatch

Games that are too big for me 
- AC: Valhalla

- RDR2

- Cyberpunk


I‚Äôd happily take suggestions on unique, beautiful, fun up to 30 hour games."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It would have been nice if it were a little longer as long as the gameplay was more varried

I would have hated if they extended the pop-a-bug section."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,There's an achievement for doing the whole game in under two hours. I'll give it a go now I've played through it once. It'll be an interesting challenge.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,How many hours did it take you?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Can't wait to play it. I think of games like this (Journey, Abzu) kind of like a movie experience. I usually spend around $30 at AMC for a ticket and popcorn, and if I really like the movie I'll watch it multiple times (at home or sometimes even again in the theater) and catch new things the second watch through."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Also can you just paw things off a dresser or counter just to be an asshole? Wouldn‚Äôt be a cat game without that.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Hopefully you can chew on a plant and then throw it up a couple minutes later as well. I‚Äôll refund if I can‚Äôt.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,My cats do that in real life.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,You can‚Äôt even jump in it. It‚Äôs a huge letdown for me
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Motion blur is often a culprit that causes that. See if you can disable it
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Sitting in a cardboard box will help keep you oriented. Make sure it's the smallest one you can fit in so your body is making 4 points of constant contact.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Aside from motion blur as others have mentioned, excessive monitor brightness can cause it in some cases. As well as too wide FoV if you're playing on PC on an ultrawide."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Me too. Turned motion blur off like I do for every game, but started feeling sick after about 30 minutes."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Turn off motion blur. It's literally used to disguise framerate drops. I turn it off in every game. Just the stupidest ""feature"" ever."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I'm having the same issue, which is pretty usual for me sadly. If they'd add a FOV slider or something similar, that would help a lot."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Welcome to my life. Can I ask you about some others? The last of us? The Witcher 3? V rising? 

Also if you can turn the FOV up on anything that helps tremendously"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Check the fov and see if it can be changed. That always gives me motion sickness.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Its not motion blur. You have no frame of reference where you're looking. Turn the pointer thingy on. Makes it Purrfect
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Turn on the crosshair and focus on it during gameplay.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Oh no! I get motion sickness really easy so this worries me
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,My favorite spot to sleep is >!Clementine's Flat!<
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,wow what a game
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Just to make sure you are on safe side. Make sure your computer can run this game. I bought this game since I was visiting family, and my older PC which is like 6 years old couldn't run this game. A lot of people are having trouble with the game off Steam. 

Apparently something with PS5 exclusive allowed people to get the game for free."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,its not supposed to be an open world nor a challenging game if thats what your expectations were
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I thought A Short Hike and Obra Dinn were incredible art-wise but I don‚Äôt think they appeal to everyone.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I had to pause and take a minute to regain emotional stability after the dreaded fall at the beginning of the game.. Still upsets me just thinking about it.

Losing your cat is one of the most painful experiences in the world. I am sorry to hear that you had to say goodbye, and I hope that you find peace, comfort, and joy in remembering the love you shared with her. <3"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-29,I love the linearity. Whenever i play a nonlinear game i feel like i have to discover everything and do every side mission or i will miss out
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,You can play it for free. New playstation account plus the PS+ Extra 7 day trial.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Is the game only five hours long?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I mean if you just run through the story, sure. It took me like 3.5 hours to go through the first little town. If you just enjoy the world and being there it adds so much

But either way 25 seems like a fine price for what I got"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"6 hrs of story gameplay. You can do whatever the heck you want along that way, so I don't see the problem, the point of this game is to simulate the cat life. But if you only play game to finish them then I don't think any of these type of game would worth it for you."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I don‚Äôt get how people have the correlation that length of game = price of game. Should shorter movies cost less and longer cost more? Dont they both have the same level of effort and craft (to a degree/depending)?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,That‚Äôs the price of a meal you eat in 15 minutes.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Only 5 hours? Wtf?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah I‚Äôm no hater, I‚Äôd like to play this because it seems like a pretty good game. But no way is it $30 USD good, not for 5 hours of gameplay"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,yeah I see alota people complaining about it being overpriced for a 5 hour walking sim. But the allure of the game is the ambiance and being emersed in the beautiful world. If you wanted some complex long gaming experience. Prob should just play a different game as thats not the intended experience.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"What they call walking sim I call adventure game. Find the thing that makes other things do things. But instead of pointing and clicking you're a cat with very satisfying movement in an amazingly rendered world.

People are losers"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,That's maybe not much for you but for people that are working min wage (10.79 euro ish here)  it is
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yeah I find it absurd the amount of people who focus on price to length ratio. Sure that‚Äôs fine if it was less than an hour long or something but buying lunch or a movie ticket ‚Äúcan‚Äù be around the price of the game and yet no one complains about spending 20+ concessions to see Thor in imax but oh no this price is stupid. If the game doesn‚Äôt interest for the price it‚Äôs at now then just wait cause there‚Äôs plenty of people who think the price is exactly what it should be. There‚Äôs just something so entitled about complaining about something like this. If you only have a certain amount to spend and you want something that‚Äôll last you longer that‚Äôs understandable but don‚Äôt get mad at the game.

It will tell you how many memories in each chapter you have out of how many there are so you know how many you‚Äôre missing.

But what it actually comes down to is a beautiful game with well thought out gameplay and a clever story.  Plus you're a cat and can push things off shelves."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,But tech demo sell very well on ps5

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"> I was expecting some kinda skyrim levels of free exploration

Expecting an indie walking simulator to equal a AAA production heavily focused on exploration is not as reasonable as you may believe."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a ww2 simulator. There arent any tanks. There arent any air planes. Not even so much as a m1 Garand. You cant shoot enemies. You cant even storm the beaches of Normandy. It's just so simple and empty.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I thought this was a copypasta and the Skyrim comparison was gonna keep going
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Wow. All these incredibly enthusiastic posts with nothing but rave reviews are suddenly seeming so disingenuous.  
    
Can't jump in a cat game? What a joke."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I kind of wanted customization too, but to be fair I guess it's based off of an actual cat so they wanted it to look like him lol. still would have been cool to make him look like my cat though"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,You should have been expecting nothing so whatever you got is good then
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"This is great bait haha

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Rubbish. It looks to me like we're getting exactly what was promised in the trailers. AFAIK there was no indication about the game's length ahead of launch. Now that it's available and reviews are out, folks can decide whether or not they want a longer game and if this is worth the price of entry. But let's not start slinging mud at developers and suggest they're spamming us. We can do better than that."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's the same with all generational transitions though. Ideally you wouldn't be paying $600 to enjoy just this one game, you'd be buying into a new platform with a range of games to play. Of course, everyone's different, but I'd say that the PS5 probably isn't worth it (yet) for most folks."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It's not the same thing at all... Stray is more directed and of a smaller scope. Love it so far.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"They are completely different types of games and it's unfair to compare them. Stray has a much, much smaller scope, there is no combat, and it has a bigger focus on puzzles. Also, Stray isn't an RPG, its a linear adventure game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Can't compare the two to be honest.

I'd compare Stray to like.... Shadow of the Colossus. Linear on rails sort of experience. Literally nothing to compare when against cyberpunk.

That or like The Quarry or Until Dawn and such. It's more an interactive movie than it is a ""game"" if that makes sense. My gf is absolutely loving it and I love to watch her enjoy that. Me myself? I'd rather play Elden Ring or Returnal."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It's called marketing
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Effective viral marketing and it had a successful teaser post get popular on this subreddit a month or two ago.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Was watching a friend play it on twitch, i think they spent 4 hours just pushing objects off of ledges and giggling about it."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,30$ for a 4 hour game really detracts from my desire to purchase it. Guess I'll wait until it goes on sale.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Haven't played it but watched a review and 2 things cooled my enthusiasm for it:  
1. There is no actual jump button. If you position the cat in a direction it can jump, it will say press x or whatever and the game completes the jump for you. This would take away from the fluidity of the immersion for me.  
2. The reviewer said he beat the game in 5 hours. That's like indie game short. For something that's been this hyped up I would have expected at least 8 hours of gameplay."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Overhyped for a $30 game?  

That seems harsh.   Had I paid $69.99 for it, it'd be upset.   For what it is on initial play through, and going back for trophies..

7 hours on my first play through, got about 45% of the trophies blind.   Talked to damn near every character in the game.   

$30 sits just fine for me.   

It's a pretty, indie, cat game, with some weird Sci-Fi elements...

No complaints."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Inside was great. Made by the same people who made Limbo I believe, which is also really good."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"That game was cool. Little easy and short but really cool atmosphere.

Gameplay reminds me quite a bit of some older (but more challenging) games like Prince or Persia, Another World, and Flashback.

Blackthorn is another rad old game that‚Äôs similar, but with a shotgun!"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I have a feeling you don't know Limbo. If you don't, you'll love it. I've played inside once. I've played Limbo about 6 times already and I don't replay games. Like at all. (It's from the same studio, their previous game, absolute masterpiece)."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yep. I mean, folks can enjoy whatever they like and I don't mind if people prefer longer games. That's totally cool. But the crowd who totally dismiss shorter games and accuse devs of being lazy or whatever... they're missing the point by a country mile. Games like Inside are examples of shorter, beautifully-crafted experiences. I'm not suggesting that folks have to like them - to each their own - but it's the dismissal and naysaying that annoys me."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Inside is awesome
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,So you ever heard of this game called‚Ä¶ Little Nightmares
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yep, that‚Äôs me with Red Dead. 

The grind of a massive map, doing tiny little tasks. I enjoy the idea of it, but then I actually get into it and‚Ä¶ aaaa"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I love strategy games and I always struggle with this. I‚Äôll have a free weekend and just dump hours into an EU4 game. Then a month later when I have time, I load it up like ‚Äòwtf was I even doing?‚Äô and start a new game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,If you don't lock yourself up in a bunch of side quests you can beat cyberpunk in around 20 hours

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah, it's pretty easy you can do it in around one and a half hours so there is a lot of time to spare"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Around 5 first time and 1,5 while doing it for the second time for trophy"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Good bothunter
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,This is a bot
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Anyone got the ‚Äúbring in a dead bird and leave it next to the bed‚Äù collectable?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,you CAN scratch up carpets and the occasional wall.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,That's actually the way you solve some of the puzzles.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yes...  I literally knocked every paint can, bottle, coffee cup off every ledge I could while playing through."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes. Repeatedly
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I feel this.  My cat eats every stupid ass thing.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,So do mine
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Motion sickness is always the first thing I turn off.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"So I need to become an actual cat, got it."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Don't close the box though, or no one will know if you're alive or not."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Is this serious? If it is...
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Why this homie getting down voted he is dead ass right.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I actually like motion blur. I know that sacrilegious to say but I don't care. I understand that it can be implemented to hide frame drops but I still like it. I don't think that it's bad just because it has a purpose other than it's surface value. 

I'll keep it on, even when my 3080 is pushing solid 120+ frames."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,[removed]
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I get major, major motion sickness (even riding in the passenger side of a car in the front when someone else is driving makes me feel sick anymore, a common issue for people with migraines), and I felt fine after turning off motion blur and capping the FPS"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I love that spot too. So cozy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah the fall had me go ""oh no nononono NO"". The murrs of panic and pain had me teary eyed."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I explored a fair amount, and I got about 6 hours of game play. Which isn't a bad thing. I think if the game were longer it might have felt a tiny bit dragged out. 

I think it's really worth the price. The movement, music, and world building were all great. It's been a long time since I've played a game that's just it's own thing. Nothing complicated, no in depth mechanics. The game is what it says it is and honestly it was an incredibly refreshing experience. Perfect game for a ""non-gamer"" too, if you're trying to get one of your loved ones into the hobby. 

That said, I absolutely love cats so my bias may be speaking a bit here."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Depends on how much you explore and how much of the backstory/collectables you are hunting.  

There is an achievement for finishing it in under two hours, but I'm looking at an easy 8-10."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I finished the game in a single playthrough, being curious and talking to everyone, rubbing against legs and everything.  

7 hours of gameplay beginning to end.   

Netting about 45% of the trophies blind."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"My son just finished it today, it's not that long"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I've played 8 and I'm at 40 something percent, so not necessarily. I've also missed some of the collectibles. 

If you are only doing the story and not looking around at all, then maybe, but even the first level is large and complex enough imo that it'd probably be difficult unless you've played it and are going for the achievement.

I bought it before it came out and I really don't regret the price."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I'm currently at 6 hours, trying to get all of the achievements, and I've only reached the mid-to-end portion of the game. However, I did spend around an hour of my time just  exploring, appreciating, and casually messing around as an adorable kitty.. It's definitely something I never realized I wanted to so badly in a video game! XD"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Movies typically have a much shorter range of runtimes. And much shorter run times overall. 75 minutes minimum to what, 150, 180 max. The significant value metric isnt quantity here.

But games can go from 2 hours to 100+ in some cases. This spread is enough that most people would pay significantly more for a long game with the same quality as a short one. Time spent becomes a significant metric, because quality being equal, I'm getting much more value out of a longer game. With such a long spread in playtimes, significantly more development effort is also spent on longer games than shorter ones.

That's not to say time is the only metric, of course."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yup. Even still if you get enjoyment out of it you're paying $5.00/hr to have fun.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"As someone who games 40+ hours a week, I can't afford to be dropping $30 on something I can knock out in a few hours. Bigger and longer doesn't necessarily mean better, but I have played plenty of excellent games (including some masterpieces) that I was able to sink 100+ hours into at a cheaper price than this game. If it ever drops to $10 I'll give it a whirl."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,25$ can feed you for a week in some places
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's a game about being a cat, not sure what you expected lol. This isn't going to be some Mass Effect level of story."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,What exactly did you expect?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Wtf to what? It‚Äôs a small indie game. Did you expect skyrim with a cat?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"You can blast through the game skipping story and all the meat of it rather quickly.  Hell there is an achievement for beating the game in under 2 hours.

But, If you're just playing to play, and curious like I did... Expect about 7 hours."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"If you want to buy the game just grab the PlayStation version of gamepass. Half the price ($40 vs $21 here in Canada) and you can play it and all kinds of other shit. 

Literally why it was a day one service game was to motivate people towards this. Just cancel before your month is up. Don't allow auto renew."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Totally. Cats are way better
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"That‚Äôs not the problem of the game developer. That‚Äôs the problem of the customer. The game is ‚Äúhalf a game‚Äù according to the playtime argument, and it‚Äôs half the price of a standard PS5 game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-31,thank you so much!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,No YOU'RE a towel.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"lol, yeah, I couldn't even finish Death Stranding. I kept waiting for it to be fun, couple hours in I gave up."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Death Stranding broke me too lmao. I stopped playing a little over halfway through. great graphics and music. cool backstory. but just got tried of making sam walk, esp when I was carrying heavy things for transport. ugh :("
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"As a prior cat owner, no you wouldn't. 

Oh you meant in game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,That and I wish I could control the jump instead of jumping where it tells me
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I didn't even realize I'd missed a joke, until I got this far.."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,They always respond to German.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Imagine paying $30 for a 4 hour walking simulator.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Lmao people are allowed to dislike something you like Jesus. Just because it's indie doesn't mean people can't dislike it because it wasn't what they were looking for.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I heard there's a Grumman F6F Hellcat.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Star Wars simulator. There arent any AT-ATs. There arent any TIE Fighters. Not even so much as an E-Web. You cant set blasters to stun. You cant even have the high ground. It's just so simple and empty.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's about a ""cat"" not a ""gat"", I can see the confusion though."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,That's exactly what stopped me from buying it. I was ready to buy it on launch but I watched a review last night where the guy was trying to be enthusiastic but still mentioned the prompt based jumping and I was immediately turned off.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Right? The viral marketing tactics for this game are insane. It doesn't even look interesting.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"You are jumping all the time, but you can only jump if you have somewhere to jump TO. Cats don't just randomly bounce up and down (unless maybe playing with a ball). They walk or jog along, and the lithely jump to a specific ledge, or down, or whatever. You can jump loads, and really are jumping all the time, it is just a jump with deliberation."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It sounds like people got their expectations way too high thinking this was supposed to be some big cat RPG when it's literally never been advertised as such so I'm not sure where all this confusion is coming from. It reminds me of people getting angry about lightyear because Tim Allen wasn't in it and they couldn't understand or fathom the possibility that a product could be different than how fans would imagine things to be due to hype or expectations that grow to a fever pitch so we end up disappointing ourselves all on our own (generally speaking)
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Well, with how Reddit and other platforms have hyped it up, I'm not surprised he thought that. The hype for this game is unreal, this studio produces indie, linear gems like What Remains of Edith Finch, and this detail is lost when people describe and hype this game as the next huge thing, the game isn't trying to advertise itself as something so grand, it's own fanbase is doing that sadly."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Have you played it? How is what he said wrong? Cause I‚Äôm playing it right now and it‚Äôs pretty boring
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Who says we're expecting a Skyrim style RPG? The point is it lacks basic features. You'd think you can free roam and jump around whereever in a game like this.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,same. I was so freaking excited the moment it started and I could start playing with the other cats. This game could have had no real story to it and I'd still return to play in from time to time just for the pure joy of getting to be a cat and explore lmao
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"The developers confirmed over a month ago the game would be eight hours in length. I'm going at a moderate pace, and it looks like the game will take me six hours to complete, so the game is about the length they said it would be."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Gamers are seriously some of the most miserable fucks on the planet lmao
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Sure, you're drunk"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,Truth hurts I know and cod sucks nowadays but I mean if Sony fans were more honest about these games the truth wouldn‚Äôt hurt so bad lol
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Hardly an edge lord reaction, the game does nothing unique and is a walking simulator."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,What!!!!!!! Thank you!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,This coming from someone who plays Mouse Hunt.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yea that was my thought process going interesting it. Would love to support the studio in whatever way possible. Appreciate the input!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It feels a bit like Half Life at times
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,There‚Äôs some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. You mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Me: Is this Resident Evil?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-29,It's amazing how off guard it catches you. I remember getting low key jump scared when I noticed them.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I ~~love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"They‚Äôre not the same but in terms of the overall world-building, lore, design etc. Stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yes, this is a real thing

Didn't realise wholesome cat game was also >!a psychological horror!<"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. I hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,"the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I had to take a break because I kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Shit chasing me in games always gets me.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Otherwise its only 30 bucks. I have the premium ps plus and I'm still going to buy it. I like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I think it‚Äôs the higher 2 tiers
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's on the ""extra"" tier. But, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and Stray is only 30."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,None is you pay 30 euros
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. If I want a game I'll pay for it.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yes, it is. The animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. You can meow as much as you want if that helps."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Pro tip: After you have played for 30-45 min or so (and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around), you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. 

This makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump & knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. 

It works really well like this IMO because the jump points are (with a few exceptions) very intuitive. So much so that I wish the devs had put in a pop-up early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah. It's kind of annoying. There are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,This is true. You also can't jump any time either. Idk why but for games that bothers me. I just want to Assassins Creed every possible surface! Lol
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,[deleted]
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"The story is very linear. The puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. The majority of the gameplay feels like a point-and-click adventure in 3d. Small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of A Plague Tale.

I was hoping for a game where I could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. In terms of difficulty/challenge, it isn't a difficult game. And the puzzles aren't 'hard'. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, I do not think it's your type of game."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It feels like I'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Skillup has a good Review on it.

and ray tracing!

Edit: I thought I saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe I'm misremembering."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Not really. It's literally good looking game about cat. That was it. Thats the extent of the marketing. That was enough for everyone else to market it for them. For what it is it's great, would I pay $40 for it? Nah. But it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do I care. 

Good game. Could it be more? Sure. So can everything."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"This is why I haven't finished the game yet. I've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. Also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. I will have to go back to one chapter Cuse I went to the next area, not realizing I was"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Point 1 makes it a no buy for me. I haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. My little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. You think he is too young?"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I wish I could just enjoy Flower but I'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. I know it's 100% my fault. The setting is beautiful.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. You‚Äôre going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. Some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. People come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. Climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. Then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. Unbelievable game"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs.

Legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. 

Absolutely incredible game. 10/10. 20/10 on acid."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy Stray would also like Little Nightmares. 

Both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange & unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesn‚Äôt require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,"So I had the misfortune of playing Limbo *after* I played Inside. It's hard for me to want to go back to Limbo knowing I could replay Inside instead. Something about Inside resonated more with me than Limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. 

I also have to admit I think Inside is the better game. Visually, game-play, and sound design just hits more. Seems like the studio took what they learned from Limbo and applied it to Inside."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,Agreed. Why dismiss these shorter games? What have you got to lose? I'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shoot-loot-shoot-loop on repeat. But you're right: everyone has the right to their own preferences.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Wow, wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be THAT short. Stray has been my most anticipated GOTY so it‚Äôs a bit disappointing to hear that it‚Äôs not longer but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs jam packed with great content! Would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like it‚Äôs dragging on."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Not sure why this is so downvoted. I can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. And tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,TotalBiscuit's spirit lives on. There is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. Some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I agree with you. Fov slider should be in every game by default. I was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. Im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. I will upvote you if it helps.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. It wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. Just more of what it‚Äôs already doing."

It‚Äôs very much a cat simulator lol"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Why is everyone being so pissy? 5 hours is very short for a game of this quality and it wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable to aim for 8-10 hours. 5-6 is pretty short.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah for sure. No chance a studio could make it more than 5 hours and still be fun. Literally a gaming impossibility. Just straight up not possible to make a game about a cat more than 5 hours.

Edit: Just wanted to reiterate it would be absolutely impossible for a studio to make a game about a cat any longer than 5 hours. Maybe in a few years but unfortunately we just don't have the technology or the creativity to get there currently.

Edit 2: Guys, guys, I get it. It's IMPOSSIBLE to make a fun game about a cat longer than 5 hours. What did you all expect, it's a game about a cat...?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah, but what's the end game crafting system like?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes. Every game that is longer than 5 hours must be equivalent to skyrim. Obviously.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Four hours in and no regrets.  I've spent more on visual novels.  Different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. 

It's also not purely a walking sim. There's puzzles etc"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,$30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. Get a better job
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. So $30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since I haven't played the game I don't like or dislike it myself. What I tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. It's like buying Bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival Ubisoft open-worlds."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Ok I will keep looking for sure
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven remake. There arent any katanas. There arent any grappling hooks. Not even so much as some rice. You cant kill for Lord Gohda. You cant even be a ninja. It's just so simple and empty.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yes.

When my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, I noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up.

100% realism confirmed."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"So wait, you CAN jump?  Cause the person I replied said there's no jumping at all."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"This is sounding like a morbius situation, but I think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. Is this game actually considered good or not?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. Kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Lol true. I‚Äôm super happy with the game tbh. I played for hours yesterday and didn‚Äôt feel bored ever once.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,The OP of the thread you're talking in said that.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,"I played it for 4 hours. Yes its not perfect game and not much to do but this is only first step into new era (i hope) you play as a cat in a nice back alley world and explore streets and help some robots but you cant forget your main goal to get home. Yes it lacks more movement control, cutscenes, better side quests, longer and more emotional story, harder puzzles and little more action. But we must not forget that this is an indie game where funds were limited. I would love game like this with AAA budget. And high price is because its small studio. Its like local farmers are more expensive than store."

All of those games are very focused. Not sure if I would call that style ""simple"". Stray is incredibly focused. You play as a cat and they went to 100% cat movement for that. And that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Neon White is also Annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so I disagree with the premise here."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. Considering their resources, I think its beyond my own expectations. The puzzles are pretty simple, but I kind of like it."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah same, I was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. Meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. Would love to see that kind of thing"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,"Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul¬†can only get out of limbo¬†when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and¬†buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the ""you  can't jump"" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn‚Äôt about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don‚Äôt really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Cat.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some ""obvious"" hints."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes they are
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yes. By a fair margin, too."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I loved blackthorn too!!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I'm not?
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I was being sarcastic because the guy who made that comment is a moron.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Nah bro, it's either a 5 hour game or a skyrim type game.

NO ROOM FOR IN BETWEEN RIGHT?"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Whenever you find yourself asking ""Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?"", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,What there is not to like? I would love a game where you are exploring cities like this and having a story. Its cute. I love singleplayer story games and i play only these games and im happy for each one like this to release. Is damn factorio worth 30 bucks? It looks like damn 2000 game and there are still fans defending it its a perfect game. Yes it is maybe in its genre.
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-21,"She‚Äôs also a huge cat lover, that‚Äôs why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!"

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Fair point. Missed the sarcasm first run. Too caught up in people's shitty takes. 

You're right there's a lot of criticism to be leveled. I myself am in the ""I don't fucking care"" category. 

Games just fun for a lot of people. I love watching the gf geek out about it. In the end that's all that matters."

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,You can like a game dude that‚Äôs cool and fine but I‚Äôve played all consoles and pc for a while and without a doubt Sony fans hype everything too much at least factorio has more hours on content and a system in place to learn and grow in this game you walk like a cat for a few hours it‚Äôs a funny idea but everyone is already overhyping a game that shouldn‚Äôt be a hand full of hours for the price same with AAA stop trying to charge me 70 for the same games it‚Äôs dumb and we aren‚Äôt getting a whole lot for the money

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"100%. Friends have been saying how their non gamer gf wants this game. 

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I came into a gaming subreddit to read and talk about gaming?

Is this not the place for that? Wild.

Edit: to respond to the coward briar_thorn who responded and then blocked me lmfao:

Your analogy is close but unfair. Liking baseball and then going into the ""HOCKEY"" subreddit just to shit on hockey is different than liking baseball but with the desire to learn about other sports and going to the ""SPORTS"" subreddit and commenting on a post about hockey.

This is the GAMING subreddit and Stray has been getting a lot of buzz the last few weeks and I'm always looking for new fun games to play so I pop into the threads to see what people are saying about the game. 

When I saw someone say it was only 5 hours long, I found that very surprising and disappointing. 

So you're saying I can't comment in any thread about a specific game in the GAMING subreddit if I don't buy that game?

Weird take man."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Pivoting at its finest. You tried to respond to my response saying I didn't understand your sarcasm, not realizing that if you were actually being sarcastic it would mean you're agreeing with me lmfao. 

And then saying I ""escalated"" with more sarcasm when you were the first one to add any sarcasm to the convo and my sarcasm was just a response to your supposed ""sarcasm"". Amazing lol

You're not very good at this my friend üòï"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Agreed. I was just surprised to hear it's only 5 hours long after seeing it advertised everywhere the last few weeks and all the hype and anticipation behind it, 5 hours is such a short burn.

And about sony fanboys. Sony is almost only idk platform or what to release great singleplayer games. I got myself ps4 just to play exclusive games and as i have stated i only play singleplayers. We have kingdom hearts, last guardian, bloodborne, uncharted series, horizon zero dawn and west, god of war, persona games and probably some others im forgetting. Thats why i like them. I dont care about sport games or simulator ones. I want to experience stuff not grind the money for new car or player. Im not interested into multi player."

w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Gaming is a pretty wide hobby my dude. 

I like baseball but it would be weird to walk into a hockey game, which is technically still a sport but one I have no personal knowledge of and can't contribute anything meaningful in a discussion about, and start arguing with actual hockey fans about why their sport is bad. 

Seems to me like you're just looking to argue with people on the internet and found a comment chain you could latch on to and coop some of that secondhand indignation about the length of a game you don't even care about. Which is fine, you can be a little contrarian gremlin and get it out of your system. But yeah, it's wild someone chooses that life."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Yikes. If you perceived my original statement as sarcasm, it goes to show how unhinged you are lol. Discussing this any further with you would be the equivalent of trying to argue back with a Karen. Have a lovely day."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Its wild. People taking to the mats off shit. Would I pay full price for it? No. Am I disappointed at that even basic jumps are scripted? Yes. Do I like the concept and theme of the game? Yes. Do I like how they did it? No.

There was and is wild potential. But you're totally right it could've been SO much more.

I assumed an 8 hr game. But watching the gf play it I'm like yeah idc. But, it is dope how for some people, they're able to love it much."
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Lmao yes I very much was
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,You know you are proving my point listing off single player games like they only exist on that console lol! And you know you are losing the point when you compare this overhyped game to ice cream at least people don‚Äôt call the ice cream the best of all time and the best ice cream of the year lol!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Nah bro I know you were serious. You genuinely believe that just because the game is about a cat, it's impossible to make it any longer than 5 hours, since only games with mass effect type stories can have more than 5 hours of content. 

Heard ya loud and clear mate!"
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Oh so you agree with me then that 5 hours is short AF? Dope!
w31w2a,2022-07-19,2022-07-25,You clearly dont understand what i mean with ice cream reference. People are paying for it because they want it and dont care for its price. Same here we wanted a good cat game and we got one finnaly. And about these exclusive games yes they started to port them to pc but who wants to wait 5 years to get to play a game and get mostly crappy port.

I played the game for about 1 hour last night and while i find it fun some of the comments in here were spot on. its beautiful, however if it really is only another 2-3 hours of gameplay, thats not very cool. the game just kinda tells you where to go without shoving it in your face, and while its kinda hand-holding its a nice game to get stoned to and just chill playing this cat. the idea is really cool but i thought it was more of an exploratory game where you had the freedom, its much more linear than i realized which is ok in some respects. 

i was like ""man, that sucks if theres only 2 more hours of gameplay"" and was going to refund due to this, but then i realized i have a little girl that would LOVE this game in due time. She is only 2.5 years old but i know she will love this game in the future, so i guess im gonna decide to keep it for what it's worth i guess. 

If i was single and stuff i would refund. $30 for 4 hours or so is meh. only going to keep it so my little girl can try one day."

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I install surveillance cameras for a living.

BOX CAMERAS DON‚ÄôT MOVE THAT WAY.

IF (and that‚Äôs a HUGE If) they‚Äôre motorized, they pan side-to-side and that‚Äôs it."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Does this game actually look this crappy
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Imagine writing this about a game 15 years ago.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Jabba no bata
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,cats=iluminatti
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Cool!üòä
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Because story reason.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Same here, but then there were robots with hearts in their faces, so I was fine"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,AWW
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Pretty sure, the cameras nod when you‚Äôre going in the right direction"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Lol my son showed me this exact spot last night
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,That's a happy security guard getting a moment of quiet relief from the every day drudge.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is this on ps4?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Gotta say this is a very cool game more so if you love cats
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Aw! I want to play this game so bad - ever since I saw that first announcement I just couldn‚Äôt wait. But my cat of 13 years passed away on Sunday and now I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll react to the game. I mean just seeing a black cat in a parking lot ruined my entire day yesterday so I may have to wait to play. :(
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Someone have to mention the previously bar tender when he said ‚Äúhe took a screwdriver in the knee‚Äù
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"""yea I completely agree, maybe just a bit political but I 100% agree with you"""
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I'm terrified to play this game, I assume we'll see some sweet kitties dying."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"This game seems really quirky, is it any good?"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's pretty good so far I am about an hour in. I made a video on YouTube with commentary about my reactions to it. I'm enjoying it and I hope it does well for the future!
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Must be Caturday üòÑ
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Just saw this game on Steam today. Looks like it‚Äôd be pretty awesome!
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Nice small details
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,When I noticed it took me a few minutes to get going again and same for the next one
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Given Ive seen about 2000 posts for this game in the past 3 days

I take it I should play this game"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I need this game so badly.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,So cute man\\
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Bro playing in a potato
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Kinda related but how do you post videos here? I don‚Äôt have the option when I go to make a post but I see videos here all the time
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I want this game, but I only have a Switch. I'm outta luck this time. 

Now I want a Steam deck."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"‚ÄúYou know the plan‚Äù
‚ÄúYes‚Äù
‚ÄúDo they know I‚Äôm here‚Äù 
‚ÄúYes‚Äù"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"¬´¬†Who‚Äôs a good boy? Yes, that‚Äôs you!¬†¬ª"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,That's because at this point in the game B12 was still trapped in cyberspace and was trying to get your attention.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,As someone who operates CCTV for a living I can confirm that every time I see a cat I will look at nothing else. I've missed 5 burglaries but never mind
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Woah I didn't realize they still made PS2 ports for games
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Apparently someone hasnt realized that theyre being directed where to go by every electronic device around lol
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I want to play this game but I don‚Äôt want the cat to be anything but warm and cozy and happy with no danger or sadness. But oh god it looks awesome
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,What tf are you playing on? A ps2?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"It's their version of saying, ""I know!"""
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,There‚Äôs a story reason for it it‚Äôs not an Easter Egg
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I was laughing when I found out about this on accident üòÇ
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Are we supposed to just trust the cat is meowing?? Where'd you even get this? The main stream media?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,The game is way too expensive for what you get but I like seeing the funny videos on it
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Is this game any good ? The premise looks interesting but the quality looks below average
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Is this a fun game?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,This is stray when you try to run it on galaxy s9
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,They will irl too
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"I'm glad this was part of the PS plus ultra super turbo edition and knuckles. It's a cute little game, and my son has enjoyed watching the kitty (who looks like one of ours) go through a fun adventure. I wouldn't have paid 30 bucks for it, but I'd definitely recommend getting it on sale in the future."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Wtf
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,The game looks off and it seems to be growing it‚Äôs own fan base
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,wish physical was here on release :(
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,:)
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Really enjoyed this game was just massively let down with the 4 hour play time
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Ya know, I always wanted a game like gta to have a choice to choose gameplay of an animal. I'm just saying suicide bomber pigeon I'm down lol"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,That's cute! Guess it's another way to say hello behind the scenes
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Is this game on Nintendo Switch?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I just got this game and I love it so far!!
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Is this a beta? Why aren‚Äôt the graphics as good as I thought they‚Äôd be?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,What a genius game
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,wow this game looks like its from 2012
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Them security guards find the cat too cute
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"When the cat fell, it broke my heart"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Woooooow.........................................
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"It should be illegal to share something like this on the lowest settings of a new game. 

Really makes this game look like crap :(

(It's not ugly, promise. Looks more like Control when you actually play on something other than a potato)"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,New strand type of game
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I‚Äôm sorry how do you share videos on gaming? I thought it wasn‚Äôt allowed
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Is that the lowest graphics settings?  

Looks nothing like the IGN gameplay I saw on youtube"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Meow Meow Meow Meow Meow
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"On one hand: i want to play the game.

On the other: I‚Äôm too afraid to see any ‚Äúdeath‚Äù scenes because then it‚Äôll make me sad and worry about my real life cat."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-08-11,"Hey guys I have a question for those that finished the game Stray. What are the life lessons you can learn from the game? Moral lessons, painful truths, any lessons"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Yeah, it was B12. :)

Also yeah, thats basicly all I do in this game. Trying to find out how to make all the robots as happy as possible... and sleep-listening to absolutely amazing makeshift-guitar songs. I love this game."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Yep, the first security camera it shows you a cutscene of it following you, and not too long after is where you start to see TVs light up."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is it the walled city of Hong Kong?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This seems more like someone trying to run the PC version on the chromebook they got from school
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It looks like shit here, was hoping this was low settings and not how it's supposed to be."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Man this looks like some PS2 graphics.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's some dude running it on lowest settings highest gamma

 As someone whos PC ran on a hamster wheel for some time, the look is familiar"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Nah, I‚Äôm playing it on PS4 and it‚Äôs not nearly this bad."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's a GIF
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"While a good idea, this specific information is pretty on the nose right at the start, so you didn't lose much of a secret. Enjoy the game"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I am not following this sub, not even a single gaming sub. Still here."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This game has like 3 hours of content and already people are ruining it with reddit posts lmao

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,how tf is this a spoiler? the whole game is literally just walking around as a cat.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,If you‚Äôre on iOS Apollo has a feature to mute keywords for spoilers
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Yea the social media bots are going insane promoting this game.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Spoilers or ads?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Lmao Im grinding the game to completion pretty much asap to avoid exactly this lmao
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This is a game I was definitely very glad to pre-purchase and play before anyone could ruin it for me. Lol. I suggest purchasing as soon as you are able and ignoring all footage :) now I want to sneak my steam deck into work and play more haha
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This is the way.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Same same. Totally invested. Never been interested in the tv before this
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I already watched that ad
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Mine too was interested for a brief couple of minutes. Was able to snap a couple of pictures before she lost interest.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Same! He hasn‚Äôt looked away the entire time I‚Äôve been playing.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,[removed]
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,how tf is this a spoiler and the entire game is just walking as a cat. there can be no spoilers.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Go to the home screen and select Settings > Accessories > Controllers. There you can change or turn off the volume on your controller.

Maybe leave a note to yourself that you've done this so you don't think your controllers are broken at a later date because you forgot you turned the speaker off."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"This gif is rough, whatever it's from. PS5 looked vastly nicer."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I was about to ask why a brand new game (that looked gorgeous in all the previews) suddenly looks like something from Garry's Mod.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,End life pc trying to run this game. I played on ps4 and it was much better than this
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Looks like a combo of gif compression, Reddit compression, and maybe low settings, cause even on a PS4 this game looks absolutely *amazing*"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I've been playing this on my PS4 slim, looked fine to me. OP must be playing the game on a potato PC."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"i think its just bad lighting tbh

everything is washed out and flat, theres no shadow depth or directional lighting going on

i run into this problem in lots of open world games with weather patterns. cloudy day in-game, between buildings, sun is low, all leading to a flat image that looks like a ps3 screenshot"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I'm honestly kind of disappointed with the graphics, and I have them cranked all the way (except for motion blur) on PC. It truly feels last gen. It's not horrible, and certainly doesn't distract from the game, but there are some visuals hat have been done much better in other games. Textures are kinda low res in some instances, even when the level is deisgned to have the camera very close to the environment and things are clipping constantly.

edit: is anyone seriously trying to argue that the shape of this lamp's light should look like this and that no games have ever done it better? https://i.imgur.com/D2GRZhp.jpeg

further edit: What I'm referencing with the textures is that generally I can sometimes tell pixels apart with random things, which is not that bad in my opinion, but there is at least one texture that is just hilariously pixelated. I can't currently go back to the spot where I saw this, but there is one Outsider's house that is basically a library, and there is a spot in the shelf where you can lay down. The pillow right next to that spot has honestly unacceptable textures for an object being brought so close to the camera (the camera gets really close when you lay down somewhere). If you want a clipping object, go to Momo's house and find the ball that is basically buried in the floor, or just walk in front of some robots and clip their legs. Also there is a bucket somewhere in the alleys that got stuck in the floor and started making loud noises. It happened to my friend as well, with the same bucket, so I think clipping is an issue. But to be fair, in comparison to some EA games the clipping is virtually nonexistent.

None of that are issues in the sense that I will stop playing the game. But the graphics could be better."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"That game is a basic platform style game with linear levels and the occasional open-roam areas in-between so not that unique but you play as a cat and can do cat things. So the whole game is more-or-less dedicated to paying the **Internet Cat Tax**.

I'm enjoying it. Playing as a non-humanoid for once is refreshing and enjoyable even if the game genre itself isn't that special."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's a really effective ""grassroots"" marketing campaign, we've seen it with other games before. This one has a cute cat so of course the Internet is going to run with it"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,these are paid advertisements.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's astroturfing

People are being paid to post about it on Reddit and write positive reviews on steam

That's all"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I mean, it looked great. Cyberpunk setting where you play a cat. Good looking graphics, too. On paper it had a lot going for it. I wishlisted it as soon as I saw the Steam page, but didn't preorder it, because images don't equal gameplay.

There's definitely marketing going on but I can see why people would talk about the game because of its appealing elements.

It's off my wishllist now that I've seen the reviews. I wouldn't part with money for it, even on steep discount, because a simplistic on-rails, semi-walking simulator is not what I'm looking for."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I mean, do you like cats???"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"If you played it, you‚Äôd understand. It‚Äôs a really cool game."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The cat? Mostly.

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"If you like cats and relaxing games then definitely worth it 

It's a pretty short (around 6 hours I believe)"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's just that type of game that is mostly about the journey and enjoying the vibes. If you're looking for some advanced gameplay, there is none. Still, it's hella fun and relaxing doing cat things."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's good at what it is. Some people can't wrap their head around the fact that there's an audience for it, though, and can't get over the fact that it's short and the gameplay is simple - surely that makes a game bad?"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,i actually really like it. i found it really charming and different from the start. you can tell a lot of passion was put into this game and it really shows with all of the environments and what not.  besides there being a cat the visuals are really freaking cool and the cyberpunk aesthetic is not disappointing
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I liked the prospect of seeing the world in a different way (i.e. as a cat or some animal), but that is ALL this game has.  
  
Same dystopian landscape. Robots. Tiny, narrow streets.  
  
Every jump in the game is scripted and there is absolutely no reason to be careful. You can't even walk off an edge if you wanted to.  
  
Shoot, this is a cat simulator game and you CANT FREE JUMP. That's right, no jumping unless explicitly told by a prompt.  
  
I truly wanted to like this game and i was waiting for its release, but this is clearly just a half-assed game trying to ride the internet's obsession with cats.  
  
I mean look at all the reviews. Within an hour of the game being playable it had THOUSANDS of reviews most of which said stuff like ""I see cat, I play cat"" or some other nonsense. I highly doubt those reviews are based on the quality of the game itself so much as the novelty of the protagonist (if you want to call them that since the story isnt about you)."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Given the number of posts from people with their cats in front of their tv. I think it's just the crazy cat owners of the world. Sure there's some overlap with Reddit, but the main correlation is with owning a cat."

why do people care about reddit karma anyway"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Not much to do or show off, so yea they are at the bottom of the barrel now"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I beat this game today and can safely say it's the most boring shit I have ever played.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It‚Äôs getting ridiculous for a game that has like 5hrs of gameplay. But alas, we won‚Äôt hear about this game in about 2 weeks time. Just gotta wait it out."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Not saying it isn't. But why would they choose the most low-quality gif possible, showing off one of the main features people are already talking about?"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,How much did it take? I want to buy it but I'm afraid it's gonna take me only 3-4 hours.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It‚Äôs a little lacking in gameplay but I immensely enjoyed it. The only thing exceptional about it is the music. I would recommend it if you like atmospheric games and cats
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,No and no
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's the most boring game I've ever played and I love cats. I tried to play up until the 2 hour mark, but just couldn't. So I got a refund."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,If you want to pay for a 4hr tech demo then sure. It's way too short and the allure gets old fast.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's free with the new psplus right neow!
But yes, from the little bit my son and I played earlier this evening, it is definitely worth dipping your paws into."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Yes and yes

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It already has happened.

Steam and PS. 

>And how much does it cost

Too much for what it offers. ($30)"
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Steam and Playstation for sure. $30 US. Or a PS Plus Extra subscription.
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Costs me $17 for PS extra, which also includes the on-demand catalogue. Money absolutely well spent."

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,... but why not?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's crazy that a next-gen console would look better than the 5-10+ year old computers that most people use?
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It is very good at what it is. Some people are like ""that's not long enough to be a real game"", ""that's too simple to be a real game"" (it has some real light puzzle solving but is mostly a walking simulator with the gimmick that you traverse the space in catlike ways). As someone on board with it for what it is I think it's great. $30 for something that size is a bit much but I'll accept it for the quality of polish and animation."

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Within the game, no, it‚Äôs not the walled city.  The city‚Äôs nature is important and gradually discovered in the story.

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"This is most likely what rhe other guy said, lowest shittiy settings at like 15 fps, running on a toaster. 

I've got a decent PC and my game looks beautiful, it doesn't even look that bad on older consoles like on the PS4 is still looks beautiful, it's just missing the detail and clarity that better hardware can produce, but still looks nice."

There hasn't been a single big movie or show or game that hasn't been spoiled for me in the last 5ish years or so. I blame streaming and marvel movies lol. Either way, it takes me a long time to get to finally experience things so always having everything spoiled just ruins my interest in bothering with that thing in the first place :/"

It's just a giant shame that they decided to take the great strength of a cat - jumping and agility and completely throw that aspect of gameplay down the drain."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"did you put ""grassroots"" in quotations because these have been mostly paid advertisements? I get this sub isnt that great. but it's not hard to figure out these posts with 50k upvotes of a video of a cat walking around with ps2 graphics wouldn't generate 50k upvotes."

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Don't worry reddit just wants to hate on what's currently popular. They'll complain whenever Ubisoft releases their bajillion hour open world games and then complain when a game is not that. Just play what you enjoy

I don't have any issues with Stray (and would definitely be buying it myself if I had a next-gen console), but I understand why people would rather spend their money on something they'd get more use out of. Times are tough."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"lol, yeah I was just asking why the CCTV is reacting like that in game. guess people is so sensitive that they thought I am talking trash about the game.

just played the game abit, minor spoiler but the answer is, the cctv is controlled by a AI asking for help"

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"For reference, 24fps is standard for movies, and pretty much always has been. Also most modern tv shows are delivered at 24fps. Any higher and the movie/show looks horrible, like a vhs home video or soap opera.  This is like 10.

On that note, I actually prefer some games lile RDR2 to run at a lower, more cinematic framerate. Feels like I'm playing a movie. 

But this is just sad."

Your actions are limited and only available at on-screen button prompts. The fact that the story itself only takes 3-4 hours to beat. Lacks depth and replayability. Not worth a $30 price tag, imo. Maybe if the game was like 10 bucks I probably would've reconsidered keeping it and beating it, but as far as it stands now, I've got better things to spend $30 on, like toys and food for my actual cats."

Can you name a better one? You can scratch up drapes, knock stuff off shelves, fit through tiny spaces and meow on command. Very cat like, very fun

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-22,"Not sure where you're looking, but that's not what it shows on steam. Stray may have had more people login at peak (38k vs 40k), but current player count shows Elden Ring up by ~5k people. I'd link it, but this sub doesn't allow links in the comments for some reason. Just Google the steam stats yourself and you'll see. 

I also guarantee Stray's numbers will drop off dramatically in a week or less, once more people start beating the very short story mode Stray has, they'll see that there's just no depth or replayability value to the game at all. 

I mean, you're trying to compare a small indie game like Stray to a AAA title like Elden Ring and it's laughable, to say the least. Elden Ring hit over a million concurrent players on steam at its launch, while Stray hit a measly 60k lol. The Stray sub has 10k members, while the Elden Ring sub has almost 1.5 million members. I'm not sure what point you are trying to get across, but it's a stupid comparison."

w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Clearly it's an issue for you otherwise you wouldn't be asking
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"You speed-ran the game, great for you, some people are looking to enjoy themselves and experience a game, they don‚Äôt have to rip through it.

This sub shockingly has a lot of opinionated douchebags in it, no one‚Äôs impressed if you speed-run games, except yourself."
w3fwq2,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I didn't say anything about that, just saying that comparing it to an unreleased game is bad practice since we don't actually know what the unreleased game is like"

by your logic, its a failure, and you are mad just because lots of people playing a relaxing cat game atm."

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Ok but buying the game 4 times is just weird.....

It's literally ""hold button to parkour, except it's purrkour,"" the game. There's maybe a twenty minute segment where there's actual gameplay (when you get the killer light) and a couple stealth segments that were kinda fun, but that's about it.

Good on you for enjoying it though."

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"I love this game! But... it would have been so easy to show the Cat reuniting with his friends. Yes, I saw the video that proves he was just a hop, skip and jump away from his home when he finishes, but what if they were out looking for him? Cats in this world seem to have a slightly higher brain function and they seemed loyal. Maybe it's a set up for more? All I know is that I was thinking about and striving for that reunion the entire game.      
  
It doesn't lower my opinion of the game, but the fact remains, I wanted it so bad."

Then when my dad came back from abroad I found out he bought me a copy. Then when I upgraded to ps4 I bought a digital copy. When I switched to Xboxone I bought a digital copy.
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Did your sleeve fit the games case without tearing? Many didn't since the PS5 case and PS4 case are tiny bit different. They either sent the wrong size or only had one that fit the smaller case. I was able to request a new sleeve for the PS5 version.

But then a post in r/gamecollecting posted their Stray collection, and I didn't know there was a Japanese collector's edition.  I wanted the soundtrack on CD, and that version had a price drop, so I grabbed it.

Then, they announce the Switch version.  THAT CE in Japan has some really cool stuff like an art book and some resin figures, so I ended up pre-ordering it on Play Asia.

Then this week, I saw that the Xbox one was very cheap on Woot.  I figured, why the hell not at this point.

I figured it's supporting the devs at the end of the day, lol."

Little Kitty, Big City is also on Switch I believe. So probably PS too, not sure, didn't look up platforms (I only know Switch because I was reading some thread where someone mentioned a bug and I saw Switch was like 1 week or something behind on the patch that fixed it)."

People made entire breakdown videos on the story to try and work out what some clues in the game meant in terms of what led to the state of the world and how much time had passed. Since the game came out certain people have wanted to pass it off as just a gimmicky cat game because it didn't impact with them rather than just accept it wasn't made for them, easy to play that card I suppose.

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"Counterpoint: You play a cat who never reunites with his family. 

The story literally starts by dumping the titular Stray into a nightmare failed robot utopia and that is the last of the stray's family you see. You never reunite with the other kittens you wake up with in the opening of the game. There is no resolution to the loss of your siblings or even knowing what happened to them.

Additionally, you *play* as a cat-like creature but the game doesn't even pretend that the cat is an actual cat. As soon as you encounter the AI it treats you like a human intelligence that happens to be in a cat body instead of being a cat. Suddenly you're an *active* member of the revolution against the current system instead of being, you know, a **fucking cat**.

Yes, it has interesting lore and I would probably care about it a lot more if the main protagonist didn't involve a cat acting like a goddamned shitty manga isekai protagonist in a cat body instead of being some random ass cat."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,You say emotional payoff but you don't even get to see the kitty reunite with its friends at the end. I liked Gone Home and Firewatch but the story in Stray was passable but not enough to carry it IMO.

The game has a great story with solid world building, lore, mystery and emotion.

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"Actual platforming would have been nice. The devs went to the extent of making the perfect animations for a cat jumping around and then tied them all to a ""hold button to do X"" thing rather than give me an iota of control or chance of failure."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"The problem isn't that it's a chill cat game, the problem is that people acted like this game is a 10/10 GOTY game when it's just a simple, pretty looking indie game with the complexity of a shape sorting toy. The game was hyped completely out of proportion.
 
Like, you can't seriously sit here and tell me that Stray is on the same level as Elden Ring, God of War, Horizon or Xenoblade."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,Something like ravaging endemic bird populations?

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"I'm not disagreeing, but being different doesn't make it immune to criticism.

Like, why not make the platforming a little more engaging than ""hold button to purrkour""? Why not have more sequences where I have access to the ability to fight back against the creepy crawlies after I've spent so much time just running? Why was the culmination of the game just push block puzzles and narration?

**Why did I get zero emotional payoff for fighting my way through a robot religious and/or political revolution but didn't find my other kitties?**

Like, literally the entire first moments of the game is about how you're a member of a pack of adolescent kittens and you get separated from them. It's your setup, your call to adventure, and the whole reason you're going through all this shit is for the payoff of the reuniting moment, and you don't get it."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"You did.

And since I wasn't blunt enough, apparently, let me be more blunt: Stray is a fucking walking simulator with an extravagent animation budget for what it is. I guarantee that if it wasn't a well-animated cat doing cute things to distract from that it would have gotten 6/7 out of 10 at most because there is literally no real meat to the gameplay beyond some very basic puzzle elements.

I can give you more criticism if you ask, or you can bigger off. I really don't care which."

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Agreed! The game could've played more with the idea of a story about a cat doing cat but instead they just made a generic story about an AI scientist. Missed opportunity!
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,">Counterpoint: You play a cat who never reunites with his family.

I actually love that aspect of the game, in a cliche Disney movie the cat would have its happy ever after, but in the real world....it is just a cat, it will muck around chasing bugs until hopefully one day it ends up back at its pack, people have actually broken down the area on youtube and tried to work out where the cat would end up, but I personally think we don't need to know this, the cat was just a vessel to help deliver the story of the underground city, I guess that was lost on you. 

But ultimately this is just all sounding highly subjective and we are back to where we started with different people liking different things.

OP just came to show off a collection they were proud of and didn't ask for opinions on the game, but you can't help yourself of course, I know you added the ""Good on you for enjoying it though."" to seem wholesome but it was just fluff on top of what you really wanted to say."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"As I said to another user I loved that we didn't see that, in a cliche Disney / Pixar movie you absolutely would get that fluffy happy ending, but this game was trying to be real about what a cat is, a cat is....just a cat. It will chase some bugs and get home eventually, but I personally felt we didn't need to see it, I absolutely love the ending, but it is also fine if you don't.

My point all along is we all like different things and these people who started dumping on the game just can't appreciate that because they only see through their own lens."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"This is one of those games like Animal Crossing where you either love it to pieces or you find it unbearably dull.  I'm definitely in the latter camp.  The game had a cool atmosphere but the fetch quests were so boring and unimaginative it really tarnished the experience.  Also a huge missed opportunity to have actual cat parkour and platforming in a game, instead they opted for ""Press A to play animation"" which was severely disappointing.

As far as story goes, I mean it's okay.  I don't see how it's anything super special to write home about.  Look at a game like Undertale, made by one dude, and has multiple endings and a huge cast of well-fleshed out characters (not to mention actual gameplay).  Stray is just kinda standard videogame story fare in comparison.  If the protagonist was anything other than a cat, we wouldn't even be talking about the game right now."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"The comment above is also acting as if all games aren't some variation of hold x to do xyz. In a single-player game like this, the story is the point. Stray nails the story, nails the art, and nails the world building."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"You keep posting the review scores. A lot of people liking something doesn‚Äôt prove it‚Äôs quality one way or another. Bandwagon fallacy.

Anyways the reason the game got so popular was 100% just the funny cat. I can guarantee that if you didn‚Äôt play as a funny small animal it would be half as big."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"The game can have all that but if it fails at including actual gameplay then I really don‚Äôt consider it a game. Why not just make it a movie or a book or something else at that point? I don‚Äôt want to play a game with barely any gameplay because that just makes it not fun

Also I don‚Äôt care what steam reviews say, I don‚Äôt base my opinions off the beliefs of other people"

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"> Like, why not make the platforming a little more engaging than ""hold button to purrkour""?

I think this is a deliberate choice, as someone whos favorite genre is the 3D platformer ive seen many people play them, or non platformer games with platforming elements and especially in the latter people were often frustrated that the platforming parts were stopping them from progressing.

If they're mainly in it to be absorbed by the story and atmosphere and the fails of platforming could ""take them out of it"" then thats probably worse.

Ideally of course you would have both and the easy platforming option would be a toggle (although ive seen too many people suffer  due to pride, always chosing the hardest difficulty, no accessibility settings etc despite having less fun in the end that way). Which i believe is also why a lot of hard difficulties nowadays are pretty tame.

Personally of course i would enjoy the game much more with better platforming that goes without saying, but i genuinely believe a lot of people could have gotten very frustrated by it in a game like this."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,".....but those are just some cats. Life doesn't work like that, usually. Would a cat behave like that in real life? Would he be out searching for his friends or would he just get on with his day and move on with his life? 

Nothing is immune to criticism, but your criticism is you didn't get the story ending you wanted. Well, that just wasnt the story that was being told. How was the story going to loop back to that cat group without it being awfully forced? 

As for the gameplay, moving through the environments was satisfying enough for me. It was a welcome break from more involved or demanding titles. I was able to hand the controls over to my kids and we all had a great time with it, either playing or spectating."

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"> I guess that was lost on you. 

Okay buddy, so I'm just going to throw this out: Pretending I just didn't ""get it"" because I have a different opinion is pretentious as fuck. Get that shit out of your system. The very minute you  discard a different opinion because you think the other person is shallow is the same minute you lose your critical thinking skills.

And I'm going to explain why.

Every good story needs an emotional climax to resolve it. Every good story establishes a conflict or stakes for the protagonist which offers a solid conclusion to the story by the time they've reached the end point of the story. It doesn't have to be a happy ending or even the end of their character arc, but it needs to be an ending.

Stray simply does not end, narratively-speaking.

The protagonist, the Stray, is left with a clear narrative goal: Get back to the other kitties. And then nothing happens there. It's an emotional clickbait to draw you in and then does nothing with it.

The rest of the narrative is you performing tasks that can be done by a fucking cat while an AI tells you how awesome you are because you're a cat.

>I know you added the ""Good on you for enjoying it though."" to seem wholesome but it was just fluff on top of what you really wanted to say.

I am not wholesome but if people like you want to call me out for being critical,you're damned right I'll go into detail. You basically said ""tell me how you really feel"" for saying I don't like the game, so it's Beyblade Let it Rip time baby."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"It is a happy ending for the cat though, they just don't show the reunion."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"I haven't played Stray, but I feel you.  Happy endings are such a boring trope."

this may blow your mind but not everyone feels the same about it as you, some people value story WAYYYY higher than game play, and they love the interactive experience Stray delivered....fine if you don't but you talk in a way that really seems like you believe your opinions are ""the way"" and everyone else is misguided.

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"You're pretending you were being constructive in the first place.

You literally said ""well what about real life?"" and pretended that actual narrative constructs don't exist while talking about cats,while also pretending that what happens in real life should be satisfying in a fictional, narrative perspective."

this certainly does seem to be your opinion"

{appends final wholesome comment to pretend to be overall wholesome}"
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Just because your opinion was longer than mine doesn't mean it was an argument.
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,I mean I posted what like 2 sentences actually about the game I‚Äôm not doing a very good job at being salty I guess

And did they ask for people to be positive about Stray in the comments either though? Op decided to post it so they should accept that there will be both positive and negative comments. That‚Äôs just how the internet works. 

Also I wasn‚Äôt even criticizing op I was criticizing the game so why would it even affect him?"
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,If someone doesn‚Äôt value gameplay then honestly they‚Äôre just not a fan of video games at that point. I‚Äôm telling you now if all games became like stray with barely any gameplay than most people would be upset and stop playing games altogether
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"I've seen so many of your comments all around this thread and you just seem overly angry at the kitty game.

Take a breath my guy. It's okay, promise."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,"I always feel weird when people critize others minimum requirements for a purchase. IMO it's a matter of taste how one will value a product before purchase (it may change when/after playing the game). If people want to apply some form of dollar/hour metric, it also won't hurt the industry. Especially compared to supporting MTX riddled games. 

Unless it becomes an excuse for companies to apply the same metric to jack up their prices there's no reason to criticize them."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"Yes, and I pointed out that they don‚Äôt get to have that abided by, nor get to stifle any opinions that are shared when they opened themselves up for it but starting a thread on a open forum."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"So you were basically commenting ""You're a big poo head and I don't like you."" 

Neat."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"Brevity might be the soul of wit in some cases, but in your case, not so much.

In any discussion with dissenting opinions, having a longer opinion allows you to explain more ideas about why you disagree with someone. My opinion was long not just because I am a wordy boy, but because I used words to explain why I felt the way I feel about Stray's narrative core.

You basically responded with ""Lol no I disagree"" without explaining why you felt Stray's conclusion was, and I quote, ""an incredibly satisfying, if melancholy, conclusion.""

How was it satisfying? Literally nothing happens to the core protagonist, the titular Stray, and they are just an observer to the events that unfold. Because they are a cat, they have no emotional investment in the ongoing narrative and their own jump off point, being separated from their fellow kitties, is never resolved or addressed."

it is still so clear that you just can't grasp that this is not a universal objective truth, it is just how you feel about it"
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"> I‚Äôm just kinda annoyed people call it a video game when it really shouldn‚Äôt be considered that

Why do you care so much about what other people call things? Why does this even matter at all? Why is the definition of ""video game"" something that needs to be protected so badly that the discourse on things like this is littered with shit fits about it?

It makes no sense. Stop wasting energy on things you don't like. Just ignore it and move on."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"It‚Äôs a video game, whether you feel it should be or not."

You need to learn the definition of ""video game"".  Might wanna check Wikipedia."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,That's why there are different genres of games? You just don't like this type lol. I hate racing games I think they're incredibly boring but you don't see me out here saying racing games shouldn't be made because theres no enjoyment to be had out of them. It's like you don't understand the concept of people liking different things than you

no need for such language 

I don't not like not, but I don't not not like you..."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"It's always interesting to try to communicate with someone who feels like a conversation about opinions can be won or lost.

Stray makes several friends, one of whom goes through an existential crisis and eventually sacrifices himself for you at the climax of the story. You see everyone you met and helped along the way as they react to the lockdown being lifted. In the end, the zerks are no longer a threat, the robots can now leave the city, and Stray wanders out into the world to find his family. It may not have been tied up in a neat little bow like you like, but it was a reasonable choice to end the game there. Personally, i enjoy stories that don't feel like they start and end with my attention.

The story wasn't about Stray or his family. It was about the robots, their lives, how they came to exist in the way they did, and resolving their conflicts with the zerks and the lockdown protocols. Stray is only your vehicle through the city and pov for discovering their world.

Just because you didn't like it doesn't mean it wasn't good. It means it wasn't for you. Just because you say a lot doesn't mean you say anything insightful or even useful. And just because you're quick to insult people doesn't mean your condescension is earned or justified. It means you're kind of a dick about your videogame opinions."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,I like arguing with people online and I was bored
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt consider those video games either. They‚Äôre interactive movies. Minecraft story mode is like that and it‚Äôs on Netflix!
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Yeah but racing games have gameplay. I mean look at every genre of videos game and they all have gameplay. Even the most simple of games have gameplay
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"when they're needlessly hostile and snide? yeah, it's a bit aggressive. Let them enjoy the kitty game and find another one to play."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,I hate this game too but this is just being pedantic at this point
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm appalled that arguing is seen as entertainment."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"Then you don't know the definition of ""video game"" and are just making up your own definitions.  Just Google or Wiki any of those games and it clearly states that they are video games.  Webster dictionary's definition also confirms.  Goofy thing to deny facts, but ignorance is bliss I suppose and you are free to do you."
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"And stray has gameplay. You just dislike that gameplay because you see it as ""not enough"" but I'll take the gameplay of stray over the gameplay of a racing game any day"

1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,Yeah the small amount of gameplay it has is terrible. Like the platforming in the game being basically automated. Is that really fun to you?
1e50y39,2024-07-16,2024-07-17,"Playing stray is/was very fun for me yes lol. But I don't consider ""platforming"" to be the main gameplay of stray either"

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I‚Äôve never played stray before but have they made a BMO reference at all
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Sweet Jesus! At first glance my smooth brain thought this was a screenshot!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,This game made my heart so full. It was such a simple answer beautiful story. You cosplay looks so good! üòç so fucking cool! üñ§
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,This brings me much joy
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"That is some A+ work right there. I know a lot of the focus is on the head, but everything else seems very commendable as well. Lots of detail for the ragged look."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Great job!!!! Like, this is the best!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I just finished the game yesterday so seeing this in real life is giving me fuzzy feelings. Amazing job.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I have no idea who that is but this is sick

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,LOVEEE IT!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,That‚Äôs awesome! Stray is probably my most favorite new game of the last few years. And my cat seemed to enjoy watching me play through it.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Never seen or read(?) stray, but this looks damn cool."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Sweet
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Pretty neat!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,This is to good for reality
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Stray was a rare 10/10 game
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Looks amazing!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,So cool! Great job OP! üòä

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I am in love with this! You did an amazing job!!!!! I‚Äôm blown away. Love that game so it‚Äôs so cool to see it irl!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,genuinely thought this was from the game and had to do a doubletake. Good shit man
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"DUDE this is awesome!! Great work, can you make that robot noise they all make as well ?"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Amazing!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,This is not the momo I expected or came for lol
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,How does he see where he's walking?
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,love this so much! you did a great job

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Now *that's* a handsome man!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I visited my brother who had this on Steam and I got hooked and beat it in 3 days. Pretty much played it anytime we were at his house. Would play it again. Awesome cosplay
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,STOOOP this is too amazing holy shit!!!! You‚Äôre dedication to details is astounding! You did this great character justice ‚ù§Ô∏è
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Luv momo
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"What was that super creepy NPC from Pirates Cove in Borderlands 2.... Edwin? Amethyst? Idk, but the hat and shirt took me there and now I'm uncomfortable."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,I‚Äôm still impressed by your cosplay. Amazing.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,AWESOME!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Dopeasf
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"A) Fantastic!
B) First time I‚Äôve seen a Cosplay of this!
C) Stray was a great game!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This makes me want an arcade machine from Kung Furry costume.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Say, was this taken during the Ozine Fest last sunday? I think I saw you XD"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Now you have to go find a tree and stare at it
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,BEEMO?!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Coolest cosplay I‚Äôve seen in a while. Keep on rocking bro!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Stray was my GOTY for 2022! Of course I love cats so I‚Äôm biased lol
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This is so good !!!!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Sweet.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Well done! I actually just finished the game <5 minutes ago, and I loved it. A bit sad though that we only get use the defluxor for such a short time"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,That is sooo good
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,I love this

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This is awesome!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,YOU DON T KNOW HOW MUTCH I WANTED TO DO THAT
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Legit thought this was a screenshot from the game
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,That is an awesome costume. Love it!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Sick
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This is epic
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Aw man this is so great, I‚Äôm going to replay Stray tonight."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Dopeee
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,BMO is the only mo for me
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,this looks sick great job
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Dang

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Omg I love it.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,That‚Äôs sick
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This is absolutely incredible!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Fire
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,HOLY AMAZING
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,This is so dope!!!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Oh my gosh yes!!!!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Beautiful work!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Omg it‚Äôs perfect!! I loved seeing this, you did an amazing job! So cute"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-05-23,epic!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-08-02,omg this is so good
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-08-16,Hello!! I‚Äôm thinking of making a similar cosplay in terms of the mask. I would like to know how you made the screen :) Ty!!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"haha sadly no, Its just a static screen I made of the default expression, mostly because I wanted it simple and easy to see through"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Thank you for sharing the files! When I first played this game, I *knew* someone was going to cosplay Momo perfectly, and that someone is you!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,[removed]
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-06-23,Alright now... Uhh I don't know how to begin
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I was absolutely in love with the first city area (where you meet Momo), such a cool ambiance !"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Fantastic concept... played it all the way through.  Never need to pick it up again.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,It was okay
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I love this game so much. I'm a big fan of soulslike and it was so refreshing for me to just play a chill relaxing game with a great story.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I see right under the eyes since the face is made of pc fan mesh which is perforated plastic, the leds do affect my vision a bit but im able to navigate myself in a well lit area."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I mean, it has to! I have so many questions that need answers!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Good, that game had a really chill vibe that was really cool."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Wait really??
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I personally prefer games that don't overstay their welcome. Stray felt fresh the whole way to the end.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Hollow Knight is a fantastic indie game. It‚Äôs pretty cute, very hard, and hours and hours of play"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I've never experienced motion sickness from a game in my life before but Stray put me in bed, head spinning, for hours after jumping around the first robot area for a while. I was looking forward to it so much. Tweaking some settings fixed it and I was able to finish it but it ruined the experience so much. :("
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,It is. But i was slightly let down by the lack of roof climbing in the upper town.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Agreed. I just finished Season and it was wonderful as well.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Really? It was alright, nice idea, got tedious and the bots took away from the fun with the cat for me

The level of promotion this game got was impressive, that‚Äôs for sure"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Daddy likey Momo
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Sit down.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I‚Äôm not going to lie, I saw this on my popular feed and immediately jumped to the comments hoping and praying this was here."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,So glad someone posted this <3
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Oh yeah, I‚Äôm thinking daddy likey Momo"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Probably due to how limited my visibility is at times HAHSHAH
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Same, I thought there must have been some sort of crossover I wasn't aware of for a second"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I made it from scratch using foam! I scored the lines with an old soldering iron and made thin foam strips for extra detail. it velcro to the back of the head. The main reason I made it from scratch was to have it proportionally accurate to the head since the game models have tiny heads compared to their body.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Right? Instant regret for not finishing it yet.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"For the fabric bits (the neck, mask and gloves) I used neoprene fabric since it's thick and durable tho not recommended if you live in a hot country. The finger pieces are made from eva foam and hot glued on."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"At the moment no, I do have progress pics scattered throughout my Twitter but I will consider making a video soon once I finish another photoshoot!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Ngl, was a bit sad it wasn't that haha"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,And I thought they meant the kpop idol lol
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,Which one?
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Well was it any good? Did it look complicated to do? Was their anything unique about it?
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"is it gaming related?

Ok then, bring it on"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"So, where do I find all these cosplays that you speak of? Because no matter how I sort the posts, I see like 1 cosplay post for like at least 10 none cosplay posts."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Really

You mean the first 5 minutes of the game......? If your patience is like this all the time don't even bother playing it lmao"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,What?
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,How do you see through?
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"I thought it'd be like old fashion slide projectors,
where you could slide different expressions in and out.

It'd be cool though.

Again, awesome work!
You just made my day üôÇ"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"It can't be that hard to program 2 or 3 faces with a switch or timer between them, the problem would be seeing through the pixels though"

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Thankfully they priced it very reasonably at launch (30 USD).

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Exactly how I did ours but I only lit the eyes, was surprised at how easy it was to see out"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I NEEEEED to see the kitties get back together. We need to see that face rubbing tail curling action!!!
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,He guaranteed it.

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"It was nice not to have to spend weeks (or months) to get all of the trophies. Some were a little difficult- like the run and avoid part, and the first time I tried a sub 2 hr run I was 1:59:56 and it didn‚Äôt count. üò≠ next try was like 1:46 tho. Totally achievable, a decent challenge that won‚Äôt break your spirit like rdr2s observe / kill/ photograph every damn species. I felt totally satisfied with the little package that stray was and not overwhelmed. It‚Äôs just a nice casual fun game."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Hollow night is right at the sweet spot where difficulty feels great. It‚Äôs sooooo satisfying to feel yourself learn with every try. Then you beat a boss and if you were to attempt it again you‚Äôd probably beat it immediately, where it took you 20 tries to get there. Fantastic game."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,I got all achievements in hollow knight including the pantheon of Hollownest one. Still waiting for Silksong if it‚Äôs ever came out.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Same here. Not as bad but even worth tweaked settings I could only play in little bursts or by watching stand-up on another screen at the same time so my focus was elsewhere.
Still loved the game though!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Yeah, I'm thinking Daddy likey Momo"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"People keep asking, if daddy like MoMo..."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"I like twice 

Likey likey"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"Wow, never thought it was foam from the pics - it looks amazing!!!"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"I giggled it, and apparently, it's near Momo's apartment? The second notebook I believe."

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Yeah true but novadays they are all over the place and most of them are low effort (not talking about this one)
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"First 5 minutes of gameplay maybe but I died a lot.

Also the only reason I quit was I saw the ads and there was actual dialogue. Yet, by the time I stopped, not a single word has been spoken."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,With their eyes. I think.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"It looks like it is a printed mesh, so there would be holes in it"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,LCD screens are actually transparent. They're just usually in a monitor chassis. You can remove the panel itself and do all sorts of neat stuff. My personal favorite is using it as the side panel for a PC case.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,[removed]
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,It could be something like a one-sided mirror
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"Jokes aside, it looks like they painted a mesh screen"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Absolutely.  Don't regret playing it.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,"I used 5v led strips for the ""backlight"" so I just had them for the top and bottom infront of my mesh so they're not seen when i turn my head. The eyes and mouth have their own leds using 3.7v cob strips and made a stencil inside to prevent led bleed. The little knobs under the jaw are actually the dimmers I installed to control the brightness since when I first made this mask in october, the leds were always too bright and would constantly overexpose on camera (as seen in my old posts)"
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I literally cried at the end because I was so upset the kitty family didn‚Äôt get back together. (I was also PMSing, but still)."
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,"I feel like they really dropped the ball on that ending. It could have been so sweet but instead I was left sitting there thinking ""wtf where are all my kitty friends?"""
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,I was hoping the main cat would find the cat friends and take them all back to the town to be friends with the robots.  I figured that was why the robots always got the heart face when you rubbed on their legs.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,He‚Äôs gonna like the way he looks.
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,Same game publisher as Stray right? Annapurna
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,I honestly want them to do a crowdfunding if it‚Äôs money they need to make Silksong

11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-27,I might be having a stroke but I swear to god I remembered meeting up with my kitty friends in the end of the game. Like we all walk off together. I'm crazy??
11dbmur,2023-02-27,2023-02-28,My prediction/hope for the ending would be that the cats live happily together with all the seemingly lonely robots that you encounter.

Some people want to know nothing.

You want to know nothing. And that's okay, but it is the *most* strict you can be on spoilers, and you shouldn't expect everyone else to bend to your rules. It's on you to avoid spoilers like this.

Also, is the knowledge that robots... are in the game... that big of a deal, because spoiler alert: >!THEY'RE ALL THE NPCS. It would be like knowing humans are in Elden Ring!<."

Somehow that kept getting me as I played Stray. It's a game where you can do cat stuff, but it's not really a game about being a cat, because a cat would just want to do cat stuff and wouldn't be capable of all this questing and purposeful action.

I choose to believe that we're really playing as B12, and the cat just happens to *really* like treats and laser pointers so we're able to control it."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"What *Stray* gets right is how well they lean into the environmental storytelling.

It‚Äôs a walking simulator with some simple puzzles, but it absolutely *nails* the ambience. Not just the environments, but‚Ä¶ *damn* these guys researched themselves some cats. The player controlled cat does a very good job of feeling authentically *cat,* even while you‚Äôre running around doing very *not* cat things. The robots do a better job of being human than I think actual human models would, and the world teases that exploration nerve *constantly* with little secrets and peaks of places you‚Äôre going to next. It knows how to get you to say ‚ÄúOoh, what‚Äôs over there? I want to go over there!‚Äù About the place it‚Äôs just about to send you to. 

To be fair, I own cats, and that seems to be a big part of where this game plugs into your brain. So if you don‚Äôt like cats or are indifferent, it might now work as well for you."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Are you saying the steam reviews are fake? 

The publisher for this game is Annapurna Interative, they've published many games before Stray as well which have also been highly recieved. Neon White, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, Artful Escape, Journey. They've had an almost flawless record (we don't talk about 12 minutes), so why do you think Stray of all games would ve astroturfed?

The main reason as to why it's popular is because it comes from a well known publisher, it was advertised heavily in many of Sony digital conferences, it came for free with people who had PS Plus, it released a few days ago, and the protagonist is a cat. Of course people are going to be talking about it."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"RAM pronounced like the animal... or ham.

Ramen is pronounced rah-men.

This isn't some old timey english word where american and UK english pronounce it different because somewhere along the lines america simplified it while the UK keeps it closer to its european french/german/italian/etc roots.

So which one is it that you're pronouncing incorrectly?

RAM and ROM are 2 related but very different things. If you're pronouncing RAM as ""Rahm"" then you're pronouncing those 2 terms the same way, and you think that's right for some reason.

The other option is you're pronouncing ""Ramen"" as ""Ram-en"" which is equally wrong."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"It's not as interesting as it sounds. Yes, all these concepts are there but most of them don't actually come into play. The robots could as well be humans because they don't act different at all. You being a cat doesn't really matter, it gets briefly acknowledged at one point and then everyone just takes it in stride that you're a cat acting as sapient as a human. The plot itself is not uninteresting but feels very ""painting by numbers"". The visual bit is honestly the strongest selling point."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Or cats evolved their IQ to higher functions (physical form is purrfection, thank you) over the course of centuries."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"I really liked the game except... I'm a cat, where's my cat dark vision?"
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Well obviously it‚Äôs not just a game about being a cat, cause then you‚Äôd just be sleeping for 16 hours a day, waking up and meowing for food, scratching the lounge, pushing a cup off the table, and then zooming through the house at 4am. Then you‚Äôd just repeat it again the next day."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Now there's a game idea. Cat puzzle game, but you don't control the cat. You need to convince/trick the cat into helping you by using laser pointers and treats."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Another thing it does right is having incredible sound design. From the ambient noises to the music to the cat sounds, it's one of the best *sounding* games I've ever played."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"I'm a dog person, still wishlist this game and pre-buy it and enjoyed all the way"
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"What I really enjoy about this game is the sort of lack of direct direction... If that makes sense. Idk if it's intentional, but I seem to pick up on it from more experience gaming compared to my gf, but I'm noticing some yellow neon signs and whatnot that vaguely point you in the right direction. Or an AC unit on the wall has little strings blowing out of it to grab your attention as a ""hey, you can jump here"". 

It's so refreshing compared to constant quest markers and arrows, or having every jumpable surface have that yellow edge (like mirrors edge I think?). Even better when you turn jump prompts off."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Yeah, but there‚Äôs a cat"
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,I was more going for portal was a short and sweet game that tried something outside the standard mold. There's certainly nothing mechanically groundbreaking about Stray.

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Tons of people liked it, and I think that alone speaks volumes about what they did right. What would you have added, though? Saying it's ""hollow and boring"" doesn't tell me what it's lacking. It tells me that it doesn't interest you. I have not played anything Shenmue, so I don't get this analogy.

In terms of cinematic features, I enjoyed this as much as The Quarry. In terms of peacefulness, Stardew Valley. Everyone has different tastes in games, but if you think adding something would improve it, I'd love to hear about it."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"The only reason I think it was expensive is cause it wasn‚Äôt a long game. Without knowing what wages they paid and their expenses and only looking at it from a buyer‚Äôs point of view I see it more as a 20 (US) dollar game. But I don‚Äôt mind paying a little more to support the game as I liked the story and atmosphere and I admit I have no idea what price would make the game feasible. Plus it‚Äôs a smaller developer and we need to se more of those succeed, especially if we don‚Äôt want to see all big games dominated by Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft (seems a lot of the big third parties are getting bought out). I doubt at 30 dollars they were just trying to rip people off though."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Do you think trailers are spoilers?

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"> RAM and ROM are 2 related but very different things. If you're pronouncing RAM as ""Rahm"" then you're pronouncing those 2 terms the same way, and you think that's right for some reason.

I can't even understand what you're trying to say here. I do pronounce RAM like rahm, but ROM like rawm, so they're not the same at all? And rahm is basically indistinguishable from ram in my accent so RAM and ramen sound exactly the same.

Anyway good lord, _who_  _cares_. The things people argue about on reddit..."

w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"Understandable points, but not every game lends itself to the same ""standards"" as other games. It's a question of genre, game feel, game essence, vision and intended playing experience. 


The devs have made decisions about the game's content and functionality that - in their mind and experience - best conveys and delivers on their vision and type of game they're going for. 


Your expectations are by no means unreasonable and I'm almost 100% sure that the devs have brainstormed along those lines as well (especially the traversal mechanics I can feel have gone through a lot of iteration). 

However, at the end of the day, they decided to create a game that is less about mastery or freeform traversal and more about the feel of the world and the experience of being an actual cat in it. A cat that can easily jump to / get to any point in its reach (marked nav points) but has to find those paths first (investigating your surroundings as a step in the game loop in order to make the player stop and REALLY look at the world and atmosphere they've crafted). 


I think this just isn't the right game for your tastes and that's fine. What I personally don't quite understand is your tone and choice of words making the development of a game not suited to your taste seem like an attack on the industry by the devs and their publisher. To me that seems to be just a rather nonsensical leap in logic. 


As to your question what games I've ""dev'd"", I am not at liberty to tell you about most of them, but I've been in the business as a programmer for 4 years, a project manager for one year and now again as a programmer I am working on an unannounced Dune survival game with Funcom."
w4v3tp,2022-07-21,2022-07-22,"I'm curious what games you have in mind when you say this. I haven't played Stray, but I've loved some of the stuff that Annapurna has published: Outer Wilds, Sayonara Wild Hearts, What Remains of Edith Finch. Some of their stuff isn't especially long (Gorogoa, Florence), but the experiences felt unique enough to be considered more than just a tech demo."

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs no photo mode. Such a beautiful game.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,[Me while playing the game](https://c.tenor.com/p9ES0a18O6cAAAAC/abed-community.gif)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Never finished the game because of that. I've been doing this on this sentinel since game release
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I'm surprised Squeakosaurus hasn't sued yet
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Go knock some shit off of someone‚Äôs shelf
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Truth 

My cat put me in a  wheelchair"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"There are two robots playing mahjong prior to this. You can jump onto the table and knock their game pieces away. Then sit and watch as they pick up all the pieces, only so you can know them down again."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Can you get stepped on as a cat in this game?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Can you scratch and bite someone after they pet you for no reason?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I also want to say along with tripping bots the score is fucking great! Thanks for listening.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"The best was when he gets the backpack, flops on the ground, then pretends he can't walk. Perfect cat simulation."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"The first area has a door that you need to scratch on to be let in and out. I made that poor robo let me in, then let me out, then let me in, then let me out. 10/10 perfect game."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Quiero jugar esto pero no tengo consola o PC :(
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Do they also sleep for hours but decide it‚Äôs playtime just as I try to go to sleep every damn night??????

Ugh, my cat is lucky he‚Äôs so cute"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,It makes you feel like Catman
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,So much so my three cats watched the YouTube 16 min intro like crazy...when it stopped..they kept begging for it again. I might buy it just for that.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I am truly so sad that this is PlayStation exclusive. üò≠ I just wanna play a cat that trips people, meows for food constantly, and only wants to be pet for 3.5 seconds before murdering your hand."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"I haven't gotten this far yet and I'm about to go again today

I'm 100% stealing this for the discord lurkers to watch"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Me, every time I feed my cat. He doesn't get it that he should be ahead of me or to the side. Not between my feet."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I LOVED fuckin that dude up
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,that innocent meow after lol. 'What happened?'
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,If I can‚Äôt knock a cup/glass of the side of a table I want no part of it.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,my cat literally every time i try to use my feet
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,this game really makes you *feel* like a cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Where are the stairs? Also, where is the shit to knock over?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I also have to hit anything that is on tables or shelves‚Ä¶
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Dam looks fun lol the way ppl be playing is more like cat attack game lol just violence lol
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,When i first did this i both watched in horror thinking i killed him while laughing my ass off
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Very accurate. Lol. But she was cute as hell with her little ""mew"". I couldn't be mad."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Not to mention all the knocking things off shelves
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I cracked up when I did this by accident and then made it my mission to walk between everyone's feet.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I play the game like an RPG and knock everything over, climb on every ledge for no reason and meow at all NPCs . 10/10"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Oh man, I died when I first found this out while playing last night! I couldn‚Äôt resist repeatedly tripping one of the robots while they‚Äôre walking down the stairs. Also, how we can knock stuff off counters and the paint buckets. God, I love this game."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Loving this game so far and probably one of my favorite releases of the year. Very different from the other games I‚Äôve been playing lately and it‚Äôs a great change of pace. A couple things I would add to the game is to be able to name the cat and choose the fur color and pattern. Also jump into boxes and go nuts.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Meh. Our dog strategically lies in the hall doorway. Nightime, I swear you can hear Muttley's ""hehehe""...."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Is this made using unreal engine 5?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I once tripped an npc in this game and then he glitched out of existence
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Unrealistic, you didn‚Äôt sit completely still just out of the way until the very last millisecond"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Just finished it it was amazing
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Cat.exe
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,my sisters cat does that all the time
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"As a cat owner myself, this is way too trueüòÇ"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Bro the cat is unfazed how heavy is this thing? The fat one i own even moves back when i accidently walk into her in the dark
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Wait until you discover the walls of giant eyes.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I've spent like an hour doing this so far. Just good, clean fun."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I was hoping to have a bit more catching prey, biting the head off of it and taking it somewhere as a gift. Not enough Cat Nip action either."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,This entire game is just orange cat activities
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Do not the cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I tripped one on accident...every time afterwards was completely on purpose :)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,So that‚Äôs gotta be the first trophy you earn right?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,This falling behavior is from an experienced owner trying not to get the wail of a banshee. Funny stuff though.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,is this the new Cyberpunk dlc?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,"My kitty will do this sometimes. Unfortunately I'm so clumsy that I end up accidentally stepping on her, which I sometimes suspect that she does on purpose because it leads to several minutes of my petting her and apologizing."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,I felt that vibration.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-08-03,Constant battle with my cat at home
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,is this all an ad? How is every post I see from this sub on my homefeed from this game?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,[deleted]
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Man, the developers of Stray really capture how to astroturf perfectly."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,made with gifycat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Its ok. When everybody is ready, we can talk about how this game would be a total failure if not for the big majority of people who adore cats"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Well I'm sold on this game now, who thought being the ass hole cat would look so fun"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Was going back and forth between this and GoW for the steam deck and ended up with GoW. But dam this game looks like more fun the more I see gameplay lol.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Can you lick your own arse?.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Is this game out finally??
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Game?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,The colliders are so seamless
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Game of the year 10/10
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I wonder how much money they‚Äôre spending on social media marketing.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,When my cat does this to me she just gets yeeted across the room.... I'm like 30 times her size.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I love how doing cat things is intuitive to the game.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,100/100 for the game!!  Such a beautifully done game!
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,This game sucks.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"It doesn't really. The cat stuff is gimmicky and doesn't add anything to the game. You could've replaced the cat by a robot, a kangaroo or a Tibetan mastiff and it would more or less have played the same.

Stray is not a cat game, it's a robot game"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,They need to make a 'taking a shit' simulator and spruce it up with good graphics.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Best game of all time, that's it. Elden what? Sorry couldn't hear it. Elden what?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Wish I had a PC hopefully getting one for Christmas and will be playing that game immediately! :)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"If at one part you climb on my desk and piss in the box holding all my Lego set sticker sheets like an asshole yeah it's pretty accurate.

Fuck you Target."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I wish there were actually people in this game not just robots. Would be better if it was modern day world
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,[removed]
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Fucking asshole, how dare he kick a cat wtf?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,This game looks like trash lmao
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,People will play anything nowadays. Gaming world is sad right now.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Everybody wants to be a cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"I was buying a game for my bf yesterday and wishlist this game cause the style alone, but just because if this video I'm buying it because I know it will entertain me way to much"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,This game is *almost* convincing me to buy a console so I can play it. I only have a Switch‚Ä¶
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Is Stray an open-world game or does it have levels in order you need to complete?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Oh shit was that an achievement I missed??
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Jumping up on that one guys chest while he was sleeping and then he immediately fell in love with me was one of the best optional ones for me. I also liked that you could rub legs on half the NPCs
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Finally.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,What game is this I need to play it
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Stray really makes you FEEL like a cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I was just going around doing this
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Rofl my tortie tries to do that to me.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I didn't love this ""game"", but it's sure is pretty..."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"\*sees review that's trying to relate to me\*

\*turns back and ignores it\*"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,10/10 game I definitely need to buy this
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,those are some long arms my guy no wonder why he feel cause a big  legs Jesus
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Only of the guy then got up and apologized profusely to the cat
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I‚Äôm still looking for the idiot in the bomber jacket and gold chain
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Can you throw down a vase from a table while someone is telling you not to do it or shreds garbage bags just to make your owner cry/have a meltdown out of spite for humans/robots?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,The amounts of time my cat has done this to me. (I'm the one who won the clash)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,‚ÄòStray really makes you feel like a cat‚Äô IGN
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,What game is this?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Where can I play this? Doesn't look like it's on Xbox.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I've never tripped on a cat before. Stepped on plenty of them though.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Is this an achievement, I feel like it should be an achievement."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"did a cat fact check this, or are we just assuming we can comprehend cats now?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Is it open world?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,What game is this?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,that's a really heavy cat apparently
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Its a game about a fucking cat of course
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Everybody wants to be a cat‚Ä¶
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Is this game on Xbox?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,BadƒÖ beem bada boom
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,standing here I realized you were just like me trying to make history but who's to judge the right from wrong when our guard is down I think we'll both agree violence breeds violence but in the end it has to be this way
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,The knocking things if the shelf is the best part also
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,The bosses of this game are dogs?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-08-11,"Hey guys I have a question for those that finished the game Stray. What are the life lessons you can learn from the game? Moral lessons, painful truths, any lessons"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Are you sure she's NOT a cat?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I spent way too long tripping the walker in the first area because I assumed there was some sort of puzzle where tripping him at the right spot caused something to happen. As far as I could tell, it does not."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,You should have her play this game.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Glad it‚Äôs not just me. I tripped that guy every time I ran past him.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I've been trying to do this to the one in the first level where these guys exist. Fucker keeps recovering like he's only got a buzz
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,It's called searching for hidden achievements
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I hope you immediately asked to come back in.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,And scratching every rug and sofa!
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Woke up this morning to my 100$ headphones cord completely changed through....won't make that mistake again
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"The ending was incredibly bittersweet for me. I hope they do content updates or even dlc, because the ending left so much open."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,What they need to add next is DLC or mod pack to let you change your kitty. I want my black n white oreo (miss her so much)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Speaking of emotion the fall at the beginning and the cat walking like it was heavily injured made my wife cry and get nightmares
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Tbh i thought this game would be kind of a potato the world looked very interesting from the trailers but playing as a cat looked kinda dull i never thought id be so attached to a cat and her robot friends
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Frigging companions can make such deep comments. I like one that talks about the thesseus' ship problem explained with his own body.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I'm hoping for a short dlc of some kind :)
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Didn‚Äôt this just come out like 2-3 days ago?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I just downloaded it today but haven't had a chance to play it much. How long does the entire playthrough take?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I have soooo many unanswered questions. Loved the game but would have preferred to see our cat being reunited with its cat family on the outside. Also when did zurgs evolve into those weird big alien eyes looking at us throughout The Sewers chapter?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,"Even a simple lore book or website would be great, explaining wtf is up with >!The giant eyes in the hive!<"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Because a cat's the only cat, Who knoooows where it's at"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,until it's time to do cat shit
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I want to be the cat but no playstations in the house. It'd be something if a game about cats brought me back to Sony though. Probably would sccop one if I see it in a store- a PS5 not a cat.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,But ain't nobody want to lift no heavy ass rats!
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Kssss√üsst ahhhhh
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Yep, and there are a few points in the game this is even relevant.
I literally knocked over a box onto some guy's head and found out a few minutes later I had to for story progression."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"You can knock stuff off everything, its amazing"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Yep. You also scratch the shit out of carpets, walls, couches, etc."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Haha it just falls over at first and that is exactly accurate to when you try and put a harness on a cat. Love it
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,That purring is so satisfying and comforting.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"I was hoping for something to happen with this bot, like it dropping a can of energy drink or something. But I did it 3 times and nothing special happened, except the robot seemed tired so I stopped messing with it."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Warning: the game has 5-6 hours of content total and most of it is an on-rails linear experience for the main quest with small pockets of exploration to gather items that are only helpful for completion, but don't affect gameplay.

I just found myself disappointed, thinking that you would use feline agility to maneuver quickly, but the movement feels clunky and all jumps are on rails, you get to a ledge and press a button and the game does the rest for you 

Fantastic cat simulator, but a very meh game in my opinion"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Looks like the ad posts are working than.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,The game is still a walking simulator but as a cat. Very very little gameplay
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,[deleted]
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I really wish there was an achievement for tripping someone!
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Is this possible in game?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Its a strand type game!
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Oh boy I hope dunkey is playing this game
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"The entire game is pretty much photo mode, and the sleeping spots all have a nice scenic zoom-out on them."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,My cat would rather be dragged around the house than willingly walk in a harness. I laughed very hard at that scene.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I started learning Spanish and this is the first sentence I‚Äôve been able to read in the wild.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,There *is* an achievement for napping in one of the sleeping spots for over an hour so...
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Its on PC as well
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"There is a puzzle that specifically requires you to knock something off a shelf to wake someone up.  So yes, it absolutely is a thing."

While it's fun and gorgeous to look at, all the people saying that it only has 5-6 hours of playtime are correct. If you had a console it's on or a PC I'd say go for it, but unless you've got a list of other games you've been wanting to play on that console you're gonna drop a lot of money for a relatively brief experience."

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"It's a linear story-driven puzzle game with explorable areas in each chapter/zone. You solve puzzles by doing cat things, like scratching things up, knocking things over/off of other things, meowing, jumping on things, hiding in boxes, making barrels roll by walking in them, and carrying small objects in your mouth.

In my honest opinion the game isn't perfect, there's some issues with pacing and I think everyone, critics and fans alike, would agree that it's too short. It is absolutely gorgeous though to the point where it's almost harder to get a screenshot of it that doesn't look like a digital painting. It also has a charming story to it that's discovered partially through collection, encouraging exploration of the larger city areas."

simple social acnowledgement like that is usaly pretty wholesome in real life so in a game it can really help make things come alive.

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"I think the most disappointing thing about the game for me was the pacing. The slums are incredibly well crafted, but as you move up through the other levels they start to feel a little more rushed with less stuff to do. 

It's a beautiful game and amusing to play, and I really wish there was more story to explore, but I'm happy with my purchase for what it is: a nice little puzzle story game with a cat as the protagonist"

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I think its that the game is $30 and is a handful of hours long with little to no replay-ability since there isnt much else to do past the main story line. 

Also the story is about dystopian robots enslaved by people. OLD AS FUCK nothing original and the story isnt about the cat"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,You mean the people they paid to do it for them?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Well, that‚Äôs just naive."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Prolly going for integral.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"No, but it seems like you have never walked in your life.  
Here is en explanation,  when you walk, you perform an automatic task, your brain just assumes that it can safely move the foot, and since your weight is always on your back foot in case of an unexpected obstacle Adrenaline kicks in, your brain tries to lift the foot up and also use your back leg for more force, so basically a punt.

You will stumble but won't fall, this is why leg under the table don't magically make people fall unless you put extra force to make them fall, and cat weights basically nothing...

It is alot easier to trip someone running."

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Cats are literally gamers.

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I feel like it could get the same treatment Little nightmares had. Short but very fresh and charming game with lots of mysteries. What about a dlc with the other cats trying to find their lost brother? Or something incredible like the humans did survive, only those in the walled city 99 didn't because of the bacteria?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"The first time I played through it took like 8 hours but that's because I'm the type of person who has to mentally map an entire area to make sure I don't miss any collectable or easter egg. The second time I went through trying to clear achievements and just barely missed the I am Speed achievement for completing the game in under two hours. 

I will say trying to do the speed run has its own charm, kinda gives you that nipped-up feeling."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,A lot of people are quoting 5-6 hours. A streamer I watched took five hours and 6 minutes according to the YouTube video he posted but he might have cut out a part or two that I watched live because I thought he was closer to 5:30-6
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Took me 3 hours and 58 minutes and I thought I explored a decent amount
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Well Amaterasu is a god, and it was just an endgame achievement. The cat in Stray is inspired from one of the devs cat named Murtaugh, an ginger tabby that used to be a stray."

If you knew where you were going and just kinda ran through the whole game until you reached the end it doesn't seem that difficult to get through it in under 3 hours.  


I'm probably gonna go back through and try to 100% things, but even if you didn't it fares pretty well on the dollars per hour of entertainment compared to seeing a movie."

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,You can also get your head stuck in a bag and spend a few minutes trying to shake it off. And at the beginning when you first get the backpack you lay down and walk weird and stuff for a while just like real cats do. It just captures c a t so well
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"theres also a moment where one bot tells you not to distract another one hes working with, and you can go sit and meow next to the distractable bot and he drops a can of paint a about two stories, making a shop owner bot come out of his shop to clean it, giving you access to the shops interior. im very early in the game but am really liking it. only downside is there's no navigation hud as far as i know and it can be daunting to find your next quest item"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,That‚Äôs all you need in a game?

Seems like they coded it that way to prevent clipping since they don't have animations for falling on an incline or into objects."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I was tripping the guy that walks around the slums and eventually he fell over and didn't get back up. Cat murdered a guy.

In actuality I think the character glitched into the wall and got stuck"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"They have a lot of other acknowledgement like that on other aspects, but unfortunately not in that one."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I‚Äôm about to leave the slums and although reading this is a bit of a bummer I still agree that I‚Äôm still happy w my purchase
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I liked the tasks more in Untitled Goose Game. It can be played with 2 players as well. Stray has better graphics and some haptic feedback on PS5. But the fact you can play Untitled Goose Game with a friend makes it better imo.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"UGG is more gameplay, Stray is more narratively focused."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Both are kind of easy puzzle games.  Goose game is more creative, but obviously Stray took a lot more work.

Neither are what I would consider good value for money if you want something to sink substantial time into, but if you're looking for a relaxing zero-consequences game, I would recommend both"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-24,"I think it‚Äôs a very good comparison. Both have the incredibly satisfying ‚Äúpress button to make animal sound‚Äù feature, both are short but super fun and memorable. Both involve using an animal‚Äôs natural behaviors in clever ways to complete puzzles and achieve goals. Partway through Stray I commented to my partner ‚ÄúThis is gonna be just like Untitled Goose Game, where everyone is obsessed with this game for like a week and then forgets it ever happened‚Äù.  

The big differences I‚Äôd say:  
1. Style/ambience/setting: UGG is cute, bright, cartoony, and looks like normal everyday settings. Stray is that cyberpunk dystopian Hong Tokyo vibe that‚Äôs so common right now. I get lost a lot in Stray, never in UGG.  

2. Game overs: The cat CAN DIE(game over) idk why this isn‚Äôt being mentioned more. It‚Äôs not gorey or anything but it still was distressing to me.  

3. UGG had more in terms of gameplay aspects and achievements to complete whereas Stray is much more narrative driven. Stray has some completionist stuff and a handful of gameplay oriented achievements but it almost reminded me of something like Life is Strange or Gone Home in terms of how the emphasis is really more on plot slowly unfolding.  
Stray will likely make you a bit misty eyed at points but I don‚Äôt think Goose ever had anything that serious."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"A couple of them do. It zooms in on your lil cat and then slowly zooms out, and a handful of them have accompanying music to go with. If I didn't use wallpaper engine a few of the shots would be my [wallpaper right now.](https://imgur.com/a/Tsdm3g4)"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,I made sure to curl up for a nap next to the musician every time I turned in a new piece of sheet music for that same vibe.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"It's not a lot of game, but it's one hell of a vibe. And sometimes that's what I'm looking for, so it was a hit for me.

It's a bit rude to claim that folk that are into that are 'jerking off to it' though. Let people like things."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Honestly? Yes. Cat is all that is needed to make me like this game. They could have had absolutely 0 story and nothing but you running around climbing on things to knock stuff over and scratch everything up and I would have still been sold on it, because I enjoy it on those merits alone. Add in the visuals, puzzles and story and it's a cute little game that's fun to play. 

Will I play it forever and ever or get 6000 hours out of my purchase? Nope. Do I regret playing it? Hell no. Not every game needs to be an open-world AAA hit with years of replay value and complex gameplay, sometimes a silly little game about cats is enough."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"It's a fantastic linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain. And then you discover connections with those robots while exploring a world that sadly echoes aspects of our own. 

All while doing fun cat things.

I legit cried twice by the end 

I don't know why some people don't get how some gamers really legit love this game"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"It's a cat simulator with a decent story that tugs at the heart a little bit. That's all that ever needed to be. And for a lot of people, that is more than enough. Just like there is a lot of people who do not care for a game selling point to be the story, there are a lot of people out there who don't care for the game selling point to be the mechanics of a game.

It's perfectly fine that this game is a short one with a focus on a tight story while also being a Cat simulator."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"But also, this game was going to succeed just based on the trailer alone since the internet loves cats.

Much of the excitement is genuine.  Even I love the idea without planning to buy the game anytime soon because I have other things to play and can wait for a sale."

I paid for this game and I‚Äôm spreading all the cat goodness all over every social platform I use. All my friends are spreading it all over the internet. Hell, I‚Äôve been anticipating this game since the first time the gameplay went viral."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Please name another adventure game where you play as a housecat.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"No, I meant intuitive, though realizing that gameplay might not be for everyone. Most expected cat behavior advances the game. There have been times I just scratched something up or dropped something from a rooftop for fun and it became a storyline. The game runs on visual hints on where to go and what to do."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,This is the part in the comment section when it make you remember that you are at Reddit.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"i have nipples, can you milk me greg?"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I have nipples Greg, would you milk *me?*"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Aye, laddy. Then that's alright."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"*TRIGGER WARNING* 

-This game has 0 gore, there isn't even real violence. 

-No emote dances, loot boxes, or online multiplayer. Shit it cost money! It's not even free!!! And it has a ending?!?!?! ü§Æ Wtf is that shit?

- ABSOLUTELY 0 anime ~~titties~~ females for me to make my waifu.

Honestly guys avoid this soyboy shit. Fml lib fit gamers trying to push walking as a agenda in everything now."

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Color me surprised
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Lol I dont like paying $20 for a movie either. Not sure why you assumed I was okay with that either. 

Now that I see you‚Äôre a reddit psychoanalyst, I‚Äôm done here"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Yup. I feel like if it was 20 it would be a better deal but still good.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Yeah you can run through it really fast but I spent a lot of time talking to everyone and poking around every nook and cranny.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,You also get an achievement for getting the bag stuck on your head lol
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Dude that part had me craaaacking up. Then just, flop."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Why people have been complaining about this I have seen. However, I believe that is actually a good thing for the role play as a cat. Because, as a cat, you are never lost. You're exactly what you need to be at the right time. Even if you have no idea where you need to be at what time. You'll figure it out."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I'm glad it doesn't, they give you context through narrative and environment"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Holy shit is that how I progress? I fucking catted around the city for so long trying to figure out how to get to that big sign. On second thought, don‚Äôt tell me. I‚Äôm having too much fun being a car. Mroow!"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,B12 can give you hints if you ask and meowing usually highlights a direction you should go.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Yes
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,You need to get rid of the spaces the the spoiler formatting to work.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Speaking of glitches, I just had a glitch where I walked out of an apartment and there was a leg stocking and a cloak hanging in space, not animated or being worn, just hanging there. It was still there after a game reload, too."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,">Will I play it forever and ever or get 6000 hours out of my purchase? Nope. Do I regret playing it? Hell no. Not every game needs to be an open-world AAA hit with years of replay value and complex gameplay, sometimes a silly little game about cats is enough.

It was a great gaming experience for my daughter and I that happened to line up perfectly with a few afternoons that were just too hot and uncomfortable to do anything outside.  If I put a total of 10-12 hours into the game by the time I finish a second playthrough getting all the memories/backstory, I'll consider it a great use of $30."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"You are absolutely entitled to love this game, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Reddit hasn‚Äôt jerked off to this game since it was announced"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I get that ads are posted a lot on reddit but I think people are genuinely underestimating how much people like cats and want to play a game like this.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,">	since the internet loves cats.

Eeeyup. I don‚Äôt play many single player games bc I like to play games w friends, but I immediately bought this game on steam cause I wanna get high and play as a cat. That sounds like a great time"
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Absolutely, my wife and I are playing through the game and it's very fun. People are going to be excited and there is a lot of natural excitement.

Doesn't change the fact though that a lot of comments are artificial and warning people to consider what they are reading sometimes with a little bit of caution doesn't hurt. If you read something and think it might come across like an ad, it very well might be."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,Everybody is baffled by the fact that the devs know some cat behaviour that every cat owner knows.
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"I think the full phrase would be ""artificial"" word of mouth."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,You can then run through the paint and leave temporary trails of colored pawprints
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"I dont just shit on games. But I get what you mean. I shit on games That I believe are predatory or if I disagree with a point. People do that on here. It‚Äôs Reddit.

In either case and to your point though, it really *isnt* adding anything sometimes, so I will try to cool it."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,"Those AAA $60 for 10hr games suck too. I didnt say AAA is better. 

I am saying the reason some people including myself dont like this game at this price point and it is too derivative of a topic that‚Äôs been beat to shit and the one thing seperating it is pretty lackluster. 

On top of that, you have games coming out at $30 that offer hundreds of hours of replayability."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-29,"I have not played stray and have no opinion, but your reasoning is dubious at best. Essentially, you are saying that most games are overpriced and mediocre, so you should not point out when a game is mediocre and overpriced."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,What do this game added that is new and different?
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,I don't understand how internet veterans like gamers are surprised by the popularity of cat content on the internet.

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"Weird, it showed it working on my side- text is all censored."
w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Sure. I'm just saying there is more to the game and it's not just a shallow novelty

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Ok and I‚Äôm not arguing everyone should like it. I just think it‚Äôs sad people have to go out of their way and complain over something they‚Äôve already made their mind up about. Let cat people enjoy the cat game.

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-23,Yeah my advice for people who don't want to see posts about commercial products would be to avoid a subreddit that is entirely dedicated to a type of consumer product.

w5fmg6,2022-07-22,2022-07-22,"The gameplay is being a cat though. You solve puzzles by climbing on top of things, scratching things, crawling inside barrels and boxes, knocking things over and meowing. For some people, myself included, that's enough to be enjoyable and found meme-worthy. I understand the appeal isn't for everyone, but I just wish people would let others enjoy things."

1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Stray is a 10/10 video game. It is magical how they pulled off the amazing post cyberpunk grunge graphics, gameplay, and story perfectly. 

The npc's and ambiance make me want to just chill with them for a few hundred years."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Awesome game! I'm still trying to beat it in under 2 hours
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"The thing I hate most about this game is its length. I was like I want to be a cat for longer. Game was like nope, that‚Äôs all you get."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Absolutely loved this game. GF wanted to get a cat after playing it. üêà
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"As much as I love cats, this game was really underwhelming. The gameplay is pretty minimal, and so is your ability to affect the world. Sure you can knock over some individual pots, but you could do that in HL2, twenty years ago. Climbing looks impressive until you realize you're just holding a in the direction you want to go and autopilot the rest.

Really the only thing this game has going for it is a nonverbal cat PoV character, but you have so few options to actually do car things that it makes me wonder what's the point."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I loved this game
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I just started playing it today!! I am loving it so much.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Would've loved the game if it didn't felt like it was in assist mode all the time
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"You can't never be ""late"" for a game, at least with single player games.


I know it's normalised to preorder games and play them on launch (even if they are ridiculously broken). But playing old games is perfectly fine, and you will save money on the process as well."

1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I don't quite get why anyone likes this game it felt like a rip off for it's small price. I played through 100% in about 3 hours and due to how short the game was I felt zero connection to anything whatsoever . I feel there is a limit to how short a game can be before it has no emotional feelings to it and I easily get emotional from games in general if I've really invested time in them but each to their own of course.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,I‚Äôm waiting for it to hit $15.  It looks great but I‚Äôm not paying over that to play as a cat.

1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,I really enjoyed this game. Obviously because I love cats and own an orange myself. The puzzles were fun and doing little cat things were cute. People hate on it because it was so short but that made it a nice treat. I hope there's a second one in the future. I can't believe it took them this long to do a game like this.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,The vibes of this game are immaculate. The music and the slums area especially have soul.

1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Great game, perfect length for a fun quick adventure, but quite a bit of side stuff and hidden things to find.  I really enjoyed it."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,I have so many photos and videos of my two cats sitting and watching the tv as i played.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,Still remember the chills I had when encountering zurks for the first time. Disgusting! And I cried like a baby in the end.

1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Such an amazing game. Pretty sure the only one I've ever played that made me cry
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Lost my cat some time ago, she got hit by a car. Decided to play this game because I missed my fluffball, loved the game, story progressed to the part, cried again like never before."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I waited and waited for this game, as I'm on Xbox and got it the day it came out. I'm so surprised I didn't hear more about this. 

This game is super fucking chill and cozy and the music in ambience is like none other. I wish as a cat I could explore the entire city just remove those damn parasites. 

My fingers are crossed we get a sequel or something."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,really a masterpiece isnt it?
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I was always wondering why this game is quite often labeled as a horror game?
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I loved this game but there was not enough breadth to it in my opinion. Once you do the story and all the memories there is almost nothing else to explore.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"This has been on my list for a long time, how good is it? I haven't bought it and can't find it at my local library to play but honestly I just want to see how my 3 cats react to it lol"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I really wish stray had character customisation because I'd love to play the game as my real life cat

But yes, great game."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I‚Äôve played through it twice, heard about it but had to wait till it made it to Xbox. First time to go through the story, second time to complete all of the accomplishments and just explore. Great game, good for young teens but may be a bit intense for preteens."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I couldn't play, the opening scene with the cat falling down and losing his friends made me too sad"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I haven‚Äôt quite finished it yet and I love the visuals and music. I do think the gameplay is sort of clunky and leaves something to be desired. Great vibes though, certainly worth checking out."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Ugh so good but too short.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I got my copy but I need to wait for xmas! Better late than never!
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I was so excited for this when it first came out but I was never able to play through it. We had to put our car down the week before and when I first turned the game on I cried and had a hard time keeping it together. I'll get back to it one day.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,This game is a masterpiece and gives a different vipe
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,super fun game!
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Wow
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Ah yes the game that I keep forgetting that I have in my pc
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,I want so bad for them to do an anthology series. All in the same world but different locations and animals.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,I really like it when the cat looks back at the camera and its eyes catch light like you would see with real cats.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Yeah, I can‚Äôt stand cats (a menace to nature) so this game is not for me.¬†"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Maybe a dlc where the cat wakes up a abandoned robot, and u need to find out who switched u off. And at the end u can go up and actually see the outside world this time"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"It's mever late for cat, cat, cat!"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,While I would like to be able to support the developers because I‚Äôve heard so many good things about it‚Ä¶ I hope it is free on Epic some day. That‚Äôs probably the only way I will play it.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Same, and the npc's are so chill"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,the world they created is just sublime
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,I love that I can just relive chapters. Have the sleeping cat as a wall paper while Im afk
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Part 2! We can do fetch quests for all the now freed robots and help them solve other issues in the city. With our group of cats that will have a cozy home in the city.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,My wife and I had the same complaint the entire time. Nobody wants to pop pimples with a blacklight. The sentinels were a little better until that point when you have to heard them like sheep into a corral while they take one-hit-kill shots at youüôÑ
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,You mean like an Open World type. Well I want too.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,[removed]
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,The ending of the game absolutely wrecked me. I just sort of sat there for a good few minutes. We went all that way...
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I found the ending really hopeful.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"The Speedrun Achievement wasn't that hard actually, for me at least but I also used a YouTube Guide Video.

However the Achievement for not being bitten by the small grabbers in the Chase sequence.. Boy I that was hard"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"I found the game frustrating at points because it's quite linear and there's always a very specific next task that you have to achieve, but there were a few times where it's not at all obvious where to go or what to do and I found myself kind of looping around the map a lot just trying to brute force some progress. The environments are really visually busy and complex which exacerbates the problem. Great art and vibes, and I get the appeal, but I personally found it somewhat boring and frustrating in the end."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,The world they made is great and personally I liked the gameplay outside of the infection sections.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I agree, the game looks like just a glorified walking sim imo and tbh,most people probably just enjoy it just because there is a cute cat."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Agreed, it's kinda a let down of a game leaning heavily on the love of cats, which i definitely have.

I would never begrudge someone for enjoying it, but I'm glad to see we're past the point where Reddit was clamoring for it to be named game of the year/decade."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,I got it in the recent Steam sale
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Ugh, I've been wanting to play this game for a while now. I have an old orange that means the world to me. I guess I'll take the game off my wishlist at this point."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-19,"ok, downvote me all you want, CAT NEVER dies in my book."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Yeah, same."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,mmmmidontpractice Catteria
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"I'd buy that and play it in a heartbeat. The devs nailed cat behavior and the physical ability of cats (agility, crawling through small spaces, etc). I loved playing as our little orange cutie and doing cat things along the way like knocking stuff over, scratching (the ps5 haptic feedback made that so satisfying), napping in cozy spots, and of course, jumping onto the chess board to ruin the game lol

We need more! ü•∞üêàüß°"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,This is the way...
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"I want to dig through places, find stuff for the bots, and maybe a bonus for knocking over everything i can"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Played through this with my 8 year old... she was NOT okay.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"And they don't even just force you to the next part, they leave you there with B12 until you're ready. Cheesy as hell but it took me awhile"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"At least there is hope he found his family

https://youtu.be/tEOEczZQHbo"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Shit, I lost it on the first level when you got separated from the rest of the litter."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"I made the big mistake of hitting the 'meow' button during this scene, and it somehow made it even sadder."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"Yeah, maybe don't post end game spoilers on a thread about someone playing the game for the first time ffs."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,It did end on a hopeful note.  Still a sad story.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"That chase was hard. Took me a few tries.

I'm on that last bit in the prison yard"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,I played this game with my 3yo sitting in my lap. He freaking loved it. By the time I tried for the 2 hour achievement I had put about 60 hours into the game and had every corner memorized. I did it in 1 hour 37 minutes.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"It is fun for a while, but nowhere near ""GotY"" or ""most innovative gameplay"" that people kept touting. It doesn't do anything particularly new or exciting, but it does have a cat, which I guess is enough for people who haven't played a lot of creative videogames."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Just for the sake of clarity, the cat is fine.

It's a sad ending, but no kitties were harmed in the making of that sadness."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,Imagine a cozy apartment that the cat can customize lol. Stuff like that would be crazy
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Yeah not really fit for that age. There's another game called Little Cat Big City thats different in that there's no adult themes
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Was thinking of getting this for my 9 year old, purely based on the fact you can play a cat. Without any major spoilers, can you give any indication of why the game/ ending might be traumatic? I'd rather avoid if it's going to cause more pain than fun"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Played it with mine, he loved it. Got a little freaked out at that tunnel with the eyeballs, and he was sad at the end, but on the levels of any good movie. I hear you though. 

Playing brothers with my older son was a mistake though. :0"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Yeah that would be a lot to deal with as an 8 year old and you'd not see it coming.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"What next, make her read the Warriors series?"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,You had over 2 years to play it. Not my fkn problem you didnt play it. Get over it.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,You had over 2 years to play it. Not my fkn problem you didnt play it. Get over it.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,It‚Äôs kind of a modern take on an old school Lucasarts/sierra adventure game. I think it stands out because modern games are all open world sandboxes and stray refreshingly isn‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs also why some people don‚Äôt like it it seems.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Little Kitty Big City!
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"I'll preface this with the fact I have an extremely empathetic child. She loved the game and would play it again... it's more sad than anything, but my daughter reacts strongly to seeing others in grief. 

The game is appropriate for the age."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"It‚Äôs just a really *nice*, but *somber*, game. The whole thing is set sometime after humanity destroyed itself, so there‚Äôs just an underlying melancholy to it. It‚Äôs not relentless or anything, but depending on how much your kid has thought about the big stuff it may inspire some questions you might not have been ready to answer."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"If your 9yo loves cats, I would steer toward Little Kitty Big City. More comedic and light-hearted."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"there are some spooky little critters that will stick to the cat like suction cups and hurt the cat, as well as some drones that might zap the cat too, for what its worth. none of this is graphic at all but might cause some amount of stress, maybe ? the ending is about as bad as any sad moment in a pg movie so you dont need to worry too much about it"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Yeah it was litterally just the ending with b12 that did it. She thought the eyes were funny. lol.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,Brothers was an amazing game. One of my favourites.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-18,"2 years is a very >short< time if you‚Äôre also fully employed, have other comittments, and maybe some other games already in your queue. So, no, posting end-game spoilers is just a general no-go."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,That's the one!
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Great thanks! My daughter is also quite empathetic, so I'll have a think about it"
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,She loves little kitty big city!
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Oh absolutely, it was brilliant. Just a little much for my son for several reasons. I didn‚Äôt realize how heavy the ending was."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,"Has she dealt with the concept of loss and what that means? Or does she at least understand it? That's about the kind of heaviness you can expect through the game's story and world. It's a prevailing theme, so I don't think it's too much to say."
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,The ending made my wife and I cry and I'm in my 30s so ? It's hard to explain without spoilers. It's age appropriate. The ending is just sad but also happy in a way. It's bittersweet.
1hg3kl3,2024-12-17,2024-12-17,meow too. high paw!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"I love this. Please, let‚Äôs normalize hobbies being something you do for fun and work to improve on. Not everyone does art for a living."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Dude this is a thousand times better than anything I could of done. It looks great but more importantly did you have fun drawing it?
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,PUSS IN BOOTS
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"This is really good! Im not an 2d artists so take my 2 cents for what its worth, but so much of that game is about the setting and ambience that i think youre piece would be furthur elevated but creating a scene of some kind behind the cat. I dont even thinnk it would have to be something specific from the game but could even be something abstract like just the color pallet from one of the scenes or areas you explore from the game. Keep it up!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Blend those color borders together. Also, you did great on the eyes and everyone knows eyes are the hardest."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Yeah, this is good!  Keep drawing, keep trying and your skills will improve, but don't be at all ashamed of efforts like this!  Good job!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Hmm, this ain't terrible, hell of a lot better than I can do. Well done, friend üëç"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,I need to finish this game. I think I needed one more journal in the first area before moving on but I can't seem to find it when I boot it up
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"It is just missing the texturing. For fur texturing, you draw strands in bunches. Youtube has many tutorials."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,I like the colors and shading. Keep practicing!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Nice!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,I certainly recognised it straight away üòä great job üëç
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,i feel like cats are hard. theres whole ass anime that cant even properly illustrate a cat lol this is FANTASTIC
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Pro tip OP. Literally shade the entire background as dark as you can (super mindful around the whiskers) and I think your colors would look more spot on. Maybe tint the shading dark orange or yellow on the right side since you have probably an incandescent light source above your subject in the reference image (if you used one) and it would balance out what you've already done.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"Perhaps the yellow is a bit bright but honestly you nailed the face shape, it's clearly recognizable as the cat from the game. Great job!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,gj
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Nice :)
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Good job
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Amazing, carry on with more art from videogames"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Pretty good!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"Pickachu, is that you?"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Well, it‚Äôs a cat."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Agreed the colors are mehü´§ , probably shouldn‚Äôt have even tried at all."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,She's beautiful. I'd hang that on my wall. Great job!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,The secret to getting good is to *keep* trying.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Add more layers of colors and you should be able to get more definition from that period art student throughout almost all of my school life. Layers are the key . It looks great so don't let someone else tell you otherwise.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Honestly? If not for the peach patch (say you used more yellow instead) it'd be a really nice colour palette. The contrast on the face looks really cool
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"I love it, keep it up!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Keep up the good work!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Colours arent too bad, the highlights are just hot."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Keep it up, great attention to light"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,nicely done
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"You've got the proportions and general forms right. Keep practicing, you definitely have potential."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,looks cute!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"You didn't mess uo the colors, this is an alternate costume for beating the game."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Blend the colours with the white pencil
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Looks wonderful. Thank you reminding me that I need to finish Stray!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,This is awesome.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Bro that looks so cool! Great job! You're so talented and skilled!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Ur Easily on the road to be coming one of those color pencil artist gurus üòÇ
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Very cute!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,That looks beautiful.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Don't know why... but I saw Monster Hunter in it...
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I immediately knew that cat!!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Needs more headcrabs. Great drawing :3
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,It looks so cute!!!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Bro this is one of the best cat pictures I have ever seen. I am not joking by the way I am not being sarcastic.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I am puss in boots.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Meow.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Work is amazing way better than anything I could produce. I‚Äôve never played stray so the character didn‚Äôt click for me but I thought you drew a cat from Dathomir! Either way super cool.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Love it!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,It's really cute what do you mean? If you asked me to draw that it would look like the cat got compressed
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"Colors are meh, but brooo that looks very good!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,the forehead says MIA???
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Recognized him immediately! Love this game <3
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Good work
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Great work
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,You draw a thousand times better than me
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I like it
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I mean its fine
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,yeah you did a good job!  you did great on the eyes - eyes are the hardest I mean
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Looks great!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"It is about gaming, and this means, it is about trying. 
To play a game and art are similar things. Both need more practice to develop skill. But whom to I talk to? Gamers these days enjoy simple games, I assume according to my sales. Stay curious!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Great work sir üò∏
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"It‚Äôs great, good job!!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Whos your favorite fearless hero?
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"This is really well done! I knew it was Stray immediately without having to read the post title. I haven‚Äôt even played the game, I just know the cat from ads. Fantastic work, keep it up you‚Äôll only get better!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"This is dope, way better than something I would do! What's that weird line on the right? Your signature?"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"This looks awesome!  And very spot-on for Stray.

Did you enjoy your time drawing it?  Because if you did, that's what matters the most.

Keep it up, and have fun!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Very very nice....
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I just want to know why a cat needs a backpack?
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Looks like puss in boots without the hat
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"I much prefer this over the computer art people put up, it's great :)"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Meow
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,M E O W
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"Keep trying, you will get better."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Cute :)
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,You know what they say - greatness from small beginnings
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"Never played the game, only seen a couple of ads. I knew right away who this was, just from the face. Well done!"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Very goodüëç
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I could tell exactly what it was without reading the title
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I like
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-27,"Still great, keep doing the work man"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-27,U tried and u succeeded:)
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-28,I tough that was puss in boots
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Completely agree üíØ! It's always the effort that counts and the enjoyment you got while doing it; you only get better by continuing the attempts.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,I would even normalize doing hobbies for fun and not necessarily improving on them
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Seriously. This is a great first attempt. OP does this a couple more times and it‚Äôs probably gonna look fire.
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,yeah
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Yes
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,He even got the cape
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"exactly. in a few years im sure they can put this side by side with a current drawing and it will show so much progress. as an artist myself everyone should know we go through a ""how to draw anime"" phase and this drawing is already much better than that."
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,Palico
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,"he has a small little robot companion in the game, so he needs the backpack to fit him"
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Perfect. Now the only way you'll get better is by continuing!
12yruq0,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,It's a backpack for his robot friend
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I think maybe it would deserve ""most innovative concept,"" though not specifically ""innovative gameplay."" I mean, besides being a cat, you're not really doing anything we haven't done in games before; a little action, a little stealth, etc. How you go about doing it is a little different because the mechanic is altered due to the cat's movement, but I still think it's more of a uniqueness in concept than anything else."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"As someone pointed out in [the Cyberpunk2077 thread](https://i.redd.it/intn4b03p2aa1.jpg), Steam Awards = popularity contest and shouldn't be taken personally if your opinion is different."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I don't pay much attention to gaming awards, but is there an award for setting/vibe/atmosphere? Stray seems like it would absolutely be a favorite for that. Gameplay-wise it is incredibly generic. Didn't create any sort of new mechanic or anything. But the world creation and the experience for the player is top notch and very immersive."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I really like Stray.

It has a very unique premise, but there's no innovation in its gameplay"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Hitman won Vr game of the year aswell
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Meme votes won. That simple.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Yes. Name another game with a dedicated meow button
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,The Internet likes cats‚Ä¶
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Steam awards are a joke
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,The fans of this game (or any other that didn't win something) just nominated it everywhere to make sure that their favorite game has won something.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Absolutely not.

Gameplay-wise, it's basically the same contextual parkour system we've seen Assassin's Creed use since the first game came out fifteen years ago. You don't get any upgrades and the most innovative the platforming gets is that sometimes, when you jump on an object, it will swing/rotate/whatever to allow you to jump to the next location. Plus, you basically can't fail at it.

The puzzle solving/fetch quests are really basic, as well. Most of it involves picking up the obvious object and putting it in the obvious slot, knocking an item off a shelf, luring a moving machine to give you a platform to reach an otherwise inaccessible area, etc. If you've played ANY 3D puzzle game in the past, you've seen everything stray has to offer except for maybe one or two puzzles where you have to scratch at something on the wall to pull down a sheet or whatever. Sometimes you'll have to go to a place, solve a puzzle, and then bring the thing you get for solving the puzzle back to the person who gave it.

The combat and stealth segments are *sigh* say it with me, basic. The combat primarily consists of running away, except for one segment where you get a flashlight which fries enemies and you have to manage the battery. This then stops being a mechanic about ten minutes later. Stealth-wise, Metal Gear Solid on PS1 offered more variety in the very first area before Snake gets any tools than the entirety of Stray, and consists entirely of avoiding obvious camera cones of vision by hiding behind or under objects and running away for a bit if you're caught. The biggest sequence which combines the two basically involves tricking the floating sentries following you into a room and hitting a switch to lock them in.

It's a very pretty game, and the **story and setting** are very innovative and everything, but gameplay-wise this should not have won an award for innovation."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Oh my sweet child, you're only now realizing industry awards are just pointless popularity contests?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Spiderman, with the default graphics of nowadays 3D games won outstanding visual style."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,mainstream has incredibly low standards.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I didn‚Äôt want to say anything, as I haven‚Äôt played the game yet, but the gameplay looked like your normal run of the mill 3rd person game."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Pussy power.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"But okay, how much *really innovative gameplay* came out last year?

A game where you play a cat, with actual cat behaviors, is pretty good for the past couple years, even if it is pretty much just a walking simulator.

Also, one might want to question the voting block as much as the game's credentials, here."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Although I did enjoy the game, this is absolutely unjustified."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I agree its different, But the 'Gameplay"" isn't innovative. The narrative is for sure.

&#x200B;

I was super excited for stray, until i saw it was all prompt-based parkour. It was a real bummer."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Yeah idk about most innovative gameplay, but the story made my heart warm. 

You can‚Äôt even free run, it‚Äôs all just ‚Äúclick button to jump up on this thing, click button to press lever, etc‚Äù 

Honestly nothing innovative about it besides the wonderful world building and story telling"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I enjoyed the game. But I thought while I was playing it that there was SO much more cool stuff they could have done with puzzles and what not.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I honestly found it hard to stay awake playing it.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I enjoyed the game.  Award, maybe.  What I would have liked was more cat abilities to do cat things.  I was sorta hoping for a cat simulator‚Ä¶."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"i think it‚Äôs definitely innovative enough to be nominated. Even though stray is my favorite game of all time, the gameplay is not the best the game has to offer by far."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"This might be a hot take but ‚Äúinnovative gameplay‚Äù is almost a meaningless buzzword by this point.

I‚Äôll gladly be proven wrong, but I believe that for the foreseeable future of accessible gaming we‚Äôre past the era of games truly innovating gameplay to heights that are such a leap from what came before to the point we‚Äôd have need for a reward based solely around innovation.

I think VR is the one avenue where this can still happen, but it‚Äôs still an expensive niche that most gamers haven‚Äôt experienced. I, for one, have never even physically seen or held a headset in my life, only pictures and videos of other people‚Äôs experiences.

But for normal games, we likely will never see something like Super Mario 64 basically invent gaming in three dimensions, or Halo: Combat Evolved proving that shooters can work on consoles. Or hell, Halo 2 followed that up by inventing matchmaking as we currently understand it.

Groundbreaking games of the modern era are all about refinement over true innovation. Breath of the Wild combined gameplay elements seen before into a singular, refined package, and The Last of Us offers a highly polished but familiar survival gameplay loop packaged with a story that‚Äôs not just good for a video game, but a story that actually stands up among the greats of television and cinema.

But all award shows are popularity contests, and the Steam Awards more so. Stray winning the Steam innovative gameplay award is pretty meaningless and speaks more to people seeing normal gameplay but as a cat being refreshing more than anything else, I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Stray had a very unique concept for a story and theme, both of which are very clearly not gameplay. I loved my time with the game but I don't think it was particularly innovative in its gameplay.

If I had to pick a replacement I'd put the Death Stranding re-release on there; not because I think the re-release changed too much, but because I think it's still unique and engaging enough in gameplay to at least warrant most players to give it a peek."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,My wife who hasn't ever played video games and my two dogs wholeheartedly believe this is the most ground breaking gameplay ever Imagined. The meow button had them all GLUED to the screen.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"All of the awards are just someones opinion. None of them are 'deserved' more than any other, they are just chosen by a sub group of people and put on the fridge."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"What are some examples of competitors in the category? Seems like all the AAA titles are just football v30, futbol v23, FPS v203.  I know there are innovative indie games but I don‚Äôt know OF them. Would like to know for comparison."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Definitely not. Although I enjoyed Stray I found myself wondering if there wasn't the novelty of playing as a cat would the gameplay even be enjoyable? It's very basic and shallow at its core.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,People are basic
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,nah i stand totally with you on this one! there where candidates like elden ring guys come oooooon!
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Yep üôÇ
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Awards are the most pointless thing in existence.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I would have expected Sifu to pick this award up
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,No. Literally any other award it was nominated for.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Yeah this surprised me too. Like what did it do the was really new? Aside from the ability to meow on command and rub against people‚Äôs legs? I voted it for most relaxing. Its not at all innovative
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Most innovative gameplay probably not, personally I didn't see anything particularly innovative in terms of actual gameplay or game mechanics. 

But innovative game design in general, yes. In a world where every game looks like a direct copy of another, stray really stood out as something different for once. I wish more developers would focus on creating something new and unique, rather than recreating something we've played a hundred times over already."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Death stranding won ""best game on the go"".

Personally, that alone invalidates the entire awards list"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I nominated it for the sit back and relax award.  I don't think it deserves the most innovative gameplay but it was an enjoyable game.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"It's the only game with a dedicated meow button, that is pretty innovative"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-07,"Neon White should have had that in the bag for sure. That game is basically nothing BUT great gameplay. Seems like not enough people played it. Stray is nice and all, but not much more than a walking simulator with minor twists."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"To be fair, there was only one other nominated game that seemed to be ""at the front lines of creative experimentation...with newness never played before."" That was Dome Keeper and it was incredibly innovative.

The other nominees were subpar:

* **Mount & Blade 2** is literally a sequel that polished the innovative gameplay of Mount & Blade. I honestly don't understand how this even got nominated.
* **Teardown** could be a Minecraft mod with an updated engine. ""Blow things up in voxel game"" is pretty tired. It deserves the nomination because at least it combines heist gameplay with voxels, which is at least somewhat new. I don't see how this wins though.
* **Neon White** has some novelty with weapons being replaced with ""soul cards"". To be blunt though, it doesn't affect the gameplay very much. It's basically a speedrunner fps (something Quake did in 1996) with a card mechanic that sounds much more impactful than it actually is.

So, we've got Stray and Dome Keeper. Both solidly deserve a win in the category. One game has 97k reviews while the other has 5k.

This is where it came down to a popularity contest."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I found it quite dull and didn't notice anything innovative. Just standard indie game fodder
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"When I fire a rpg at a chess set and it stands there undamaged none of the pieces moved but a cat jumps onto it and rip, putting a entire mini guns ammo box into a vase that moves around but never breaks.....cat knocks it off the shelf and it breaks, also the movement and traveling in the game is really fun ,


, it did quite a bit of different gameplay stuff compared to well....most games (unless someone can name a game that's like stray this year)"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Another shining example of why  the ‚Äúfan vote‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for the majority of categories.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I didn't think I would like it, but once I started playing it was immersive. It's the panic mode that it puts you in that makes the game for me. Because its a Cat, learning how to play the game is just about learning how to behave like a Cat.

Great story too.

I didn't realise people hate Cats this much."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Unfortunately,

I cant think of any games that have had extremely innovative gameplay.

We get soulslikes, FPS, and racing games, as well as outliers that don't deviate very much from those categories."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"No, I think Stray is good, but there's nothing special about it's gameplay. It's a walking simulator adventure game with some occasional puzzles."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Video game awards lost their meaning a long time ago IMO
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I love the game but no, I don‚Äôt think it deserves this."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Here's the thing, can you name a game that came out this year that actually had innovative gameplay?  You can't.  Games that actually have innovative gameplay come out like once every five years or so.  In years that there's nothing really new, you have to give it to a game that did something slightly different, which Stray kinda fits.  It's not that Stray really did anything all that innovative, it's that no other game even really tried."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Lol it feels like a pity award. The game was just ‚Äòok‚Äô
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I dont get it . Stray aint even a game. Maybe call it a cat walking simulator.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,People care waaaay too much about these awards. Gamers cry when something they don't agree with wins as if it makes any difference.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,You're not supposed to pay attention to game awards my guy.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Dude...you play as a cat and you can meow, so yes."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Nothing innovative about it, or really any of the nominated games. The real travesty is that Darktide wasn't even an option for the best soundtrack."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,There‚Äôs nothing Inovative about a platformer that jumps for you. That‚Äôs like calling cuphead a looter shooter. It‚Äôs a terrible take. Most inivative should have gone to something like metal helsinger.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Ehh elden ring won game of the year, and unless you're a souls fanboy, you either enjoy it or hate it. Goty? Not really. Most innovative gameplay for stray? Also not really."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I‚Äôm sorry, in how many games is there a meow button?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Press A to start a mini cut scene every time you move is innovative?  

Zero skill involved, which of course means you can't really progress gameplay wise.  You're just along for the ride, press A until you can find the person or object you need to press X on.

It's a visual novel not a game.  Yeah it looks good and has a neat idea, but innovative gameplay over Teardown or Bannerlord?  What a joke."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Who cares about video game wards?

It doesn't change anything. The game is still the game and a fancy award won't change shit. Consumers shouldn't even care about any awards...that shits for the devs, not everyone."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Should of won the biggest cringe
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"CP2077 won for Labor of Love‚Ä¶. These awards mean jackshit (then again, can‚Äôt the same be said about any award?)"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Stray should not even exsist as a game IMO.  So of course it won an award, because thats what money buys.  Itbhas nothing to do with actual gameplay"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,meow meow meow
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Its a popularity contest. So...

I think it was an imaginative game and I enjoyed most of the 8.2 hours it took me to finish it.

I also voted for Cyberpunk 2077 so you can disregard me if you'd like."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Stray was the best game of 2022
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"The Cats are considered being the Eternal and Universal God Emperor Lords and Ladies of Earth.
Stray is about a cat.
Oh, of course it will be the most innovative game! üôÉ"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I mean, it's all been done before. It's all additive at best. All gameplay and mechanics can be boiled down to ""you mash buttons in a specific order to trigger flavor text"". It's the same with tabletop games, or books and movies - The Hobbit is really just a rehash of The Epic of Gilgamesh. 95% of games are basically the same game you've played 5 years ago but you need a better GPU for it.

What Stray did that was unusual if not innovative was to create a high end game experience that was inviting and engrossing, while being accessible and appealing by most metrics to more casual gamers. It was a super cozy experience on the Steam Deck, just walking around being a cat. It was also mostly non-violent while not feeling childish or hokey. I can see that many of the aspects of the game it some other thief/stealth games, but stealing sheet music and listening to a robot play it feels different than doing a stealth assassination and getting gold coins in return."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,The fact that elden ring beat GOW should show you that the game awards aren‚Äôt actually a good indicator of quality
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"It was the only game from that category that I played, so yeah"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,It didn‚Äôt but it had a cat in it. Not sure if you‚Äôve been on the internet but‚Ä¶cats are kinda popular. And most people can‚Äôt discern between good gameplay mechanics and omg this cat is cute.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"It‚Äôs all because of the cat. People like cuteness. Stray does not deserve this award, however. It‚Äôs not innovate at all. There is nothing special about controls nor its parkour features. If to look at the narrative, it is OKAY. But not the most breathtaking I‚Äôve ever experienced."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I havent played it YET, but isnt it basically a walking simulator? Like with puzzles and platforming, yea. But I heard its a cute game with lots of charm and not much else worth the hype it got.

Heard from many reddit comments. It doesnt sound like it would stand out as ‚Äúinnovative gameplay‚Äù."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Most people just play and fuck everything, they dont really care about this things and its totally fine. Why do you think poor optimized and microtransaction infested titles are most positive?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Huge disappointment in that game. Controls are wonky, story is so so, puzzles are weak,  and I though everyone is sick already of slime, and repulsive imagery with slime and monsters. As if I‚Äôm playing Scorn. Props to designers and artists for those nice models of city.  Everything else is just bad."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Because people voted for it. Don‚Äôt like it? Then get off your ass and fucking vote for something else yourself instead of crying on Reddit like you always do! Fucks sake, it‚Äôs a GAME! Don‚Äôt like it? No one cares, Karen!"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"There were a lot of questionable winners this year. I mean Labour of love CP2077 (just why?), Most innovative gameplay is a walking simulator with a cat and the best visual is a real life based game, even if the category said it shouldn't be that."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I don't know, out of all the nominees for most innovative game, I would argue that stray is the most unique when compared to almost anything other game that came out this year. 

I think stray is a pretty bad example of the steam awards being a popularity contest..."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Yes.  It was a revelation as a game.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,The only people complaining are the Genshin Impact simps.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"unless we talk about graphics (meh) AAA games are not innovative, most games available on consoles are not innovative simply because of the target audience.  


unknow PC-only indie games from obscure websites or indie-centric websites are truly innovative"

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"It was unique in the gameplay because it's wasn't just another animal game like Bee Simulator or Man Eater. You played as a cat, but that was not the whole premise of the game. It was interactive, the story was quite well made, out there graphics,  and the puzzles were complex in design but not in a way where it was limited to be played by a certain age range. Kids, teens, and adults could play this game and thoroughly enjoy their time.

It was popular for a reason, and as others mentioned, it was not worth the starting price because it was a short game, but it was a fun game through and through"

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Innovation apparently means using non innovative gamellay and making it a cat.  I'm working on elder cats and fallout: new catvas.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Was it because of IRL cats interaction with the game?
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,i didn't like the game. didn't think it looked that nice. definitely overhyped by cat lovers similar to High on Life. turned it off after 20 mins of meowing around.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Teardown is just as fun IMO.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,its just measuring how popular a game is
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Imma keep it a stack I don't think it should have won anything.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,It's just for lols don't think about it too much.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,We should have a more honest awards show focusing on gameplay and actual innovation involving unique never before seen mechanics (like the mordor games with the orc generation and how they remember you or metal gears psycho mantis and the old man sniper.)
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Well‚Ä¶ i personally never played anything like it (stray )
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"The obvious winner for innovative gameplay was Immortality.

Was it a good innovation? No. Was it an innovation? Hell yes."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I don‚Äôt know, man.   How many games have you played with a ‚ÄúO button to meow‚Äù mechanic?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Never played, but saw the mini trailer a while back on instagram. Can't believe it blew up so big,"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"i absolutely loved stray but i wasn‚Äôt innovative except for the fact you played a cat, i think it deserved an award for visuals more than anything. it was an absolutely beautiful game and super fun to play"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"My first thought when I see that had won was ""No it isn't?"" I can't even name a game that has, but the fact it's just controlling a cat with fancy animations isn't innovative gameplay. Solving puzzles too from what I can tell, I haven't seen much Stray as you can tell. 

No idea who the award would go to though. Sonic Frontiers maybe? Sonic was the most fun to play in that, despite how shit the game is overall."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I'd bet it has something to do with the fact that they donate money to real cat charities when you buy the game
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I didn‚Äôt play it but watched a few trailers. Not sure of the innovative part.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Gaming innovation lacks
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Cat sim. cant beat that.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"That game just didn't hook me. Once the novelty of ""he he he a kitty!"" wore off, it was a pretty mediocre game...

I think the concept was cool and all, but objectively, a pretty middle-of-the-road game."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I've beaten Stray and, although I like the game and think it's a perfectly good product, it is monumentally overrated."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"it was overall a pretty mediocre indie darling, without CAT CUTE mechanic nobody would have cared about it"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"It certainly deserved an award. Maybe not **this** particular award, but I‚Äôm happy for them all the same."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"I love the game.

I'd give it the cute cat award for adorable cats"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Why the fuck do redditors care so much about steam awards. They are completely meaningless and are fan voted lmao
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,How do you think the Sonic community feels with Sonic Frontiers losing the best soundtrack award to a fucking DLC?
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Pity award for the crowd favorite.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,It was nice to see at least one category not go to Elden Ring. Of the games that were nominated it was certainly the most innovative. 99.9% of games feature a human/humanoid protagonist. I hope Stray starts a trend of games centering non-humanoid characters.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Years ago Clap trap won character of the year! Fucking clap trap?!  So yeah nothings off the table
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Dumb fucking game about a cat.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,So you guys actually pick you favorite? I usually just randomly click through it to get the steam cards for the badge. No one care about my opinion
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"It's a sight-seeing ""game"" at best and has barely any gameplay. It's pretty, but barely on the same category as other games known for their graphics.  


Being a cat is not grounds for winning awards. You practically play as the robot more than the cat."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,I mean awards shows are a terrible metric for anything other than what games made the most money...
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"IMO the opening of the game was innovative; there was no language needed, you just were a cat.  You were offered a rug and you scratched it, not because it gave you a bonus or anything, but because you're a cat and that's what cats do.  I found it deeply relaxing to not have to read anything or have deeper motivations than to just be that cat.  Once you got a robot and an inventory and all that it was just another exploring game on rails."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"The Steam awards were a bit akward this year...
 
I participated to the nominations a few times, and this year you couldn't pick up any game you'd like from your library, but there were only a few games per category which you could pick.

Or I missed something idk..."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"It's all bogus anyway, I wouldn't even be surprised if they paid to get it."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,well lets look at other innovations in gaming this year. which i can't think of off the top of my head. So playing as a cat that isn't cartoonish or a mascot type like Sonic is enough for 2022.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,I struggled to finish it over five hours.  I‚Äôm glad other are enjoying it
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Honestly I don‚Äôt think this game deserves any awards, it‚Äôs just mediocre all around and feels like it was cut drastically short."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"I got downvoted for saying it, but no it doesn't deserve it.

Its a good game no doubt, but nothing in it is innovative. Sure you play a cat, it's cool the first hour, but then it loses all interest and becomes another adventure game like others.

Again, it's a solid game I'd give it a 8/10, but no it's not innovative."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,It definitely deserved some award there's a certain charm about the game even though it's short. Not really that innovative but we can't change it now. Still love the game BTW.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Steam Awards are just the popular vote, and you wonder why a game about a cat won?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"I liked Stray but it is far from being innovative in terms of gameplay. In fact, I think the gameplay was limited by their budget and size. It would have been a lot more free flowing if it wasn't prompt-based though I guess it made it to appeal with more people because it's simple.

In any case, any awards doesn't have to be the sole basis of playing games and appreciating them. People will always disagree with the awards whether they are decided by ""critics and experts"" or gamers themselves like the Steam Awards."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,I voted that
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"The whole thing is like that with all the games. Everyone harps on about indie games being better than AAAs and how much we should support them as gamers, Fuck EA and etc, but when it comes to award time look at who won and was nominated? All of them are big studio names with well known IPs. 

Bottom line, is don't take them seriously people meme voted Hitman 3 as best VR and that game was awful."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Not my personal choice but I'm not ""mad about it"" for a few reasons. The game managed to reach a demographic that does not usually play games, and I think that contributed a lot.   


My SO, who is as non-gamery as they get, really wanted me to get Stray for her even before it was released. I was a bit hesitant at first because I told her if she doesn't end up playing it, I won't either (just not my type of game). She actually spent \~8h beating it and I was really impressed, with both her *and* the game itself.  


Yes, for hardened gamers the gameplay certainly wasn't innovative in any way, but it was able to present very generic gaming tropes (stealth, combat, puzzles, exploration) to casuals without stressing them about it, while controlling a cute cat that can meow on demand. People joke about this, but my girlfriend absolutely smashed the Meow button!  


All in all,  when the game awards came around, I voted for Stray here and there simply on my SO's behalf."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"i love cats but didn't love this game at all.

it was super boring to me."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Don‚Äôt look at me, I voted for Teardown"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Hearing people complain about what other people liked and voted for incessantly is really odd to be honest.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Cyberpunk even won an award, don't take them seriously"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Just like most game awards, these ones are voted by for by all kinds of people. Thus including people you or I think are stupid."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,It is infuriatingly absurd how many incredible games are exclusive to Playstation. In comparison to Xbox exclusives well... there is no comparison. One is in the stratosphere while the other is lying facedown in a mud puddle.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-06,Is this really what you‚Äôre mad about????
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"""Cats are cute. I loved playing as a cat. I'm gonna vote for Stray.""

I imagine that's how it got so many votes."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,But do other games allow you to scratch couches?
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"I dont know, I spent way too much time in the ""fuck your carpet!"" mode that was pretty novel."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Yes the actual gameplay kinda sucks. You can only interact at certain parts. Like you can't just jump on or off anything. Only where the X is. Concept, yes! Gameplay 4/10"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,">shouldn‚Äôt be taken personally if your opinion is different. 

But that‚Äôs the whole reason I use the Internet!"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"All award shows and the like are, which is why I stopped paying attention to them."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Most awards that are voted upon are popularity contest.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"That's my running theory. That was the only category that Stray was nominated in, so people voted for it to win that category because they wanted the game to win awards. The game's development was innovative for sure, but the gameplay wasn't."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"What's the most popular video game?  And which game wins GOTY?

|Year|Most-Sold new videogame|GOTY|Steam Awards|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2007|CoD 4|BioShock||
|2008|Mario Kart Wii|GTA IV||
|2009|Wii Fit|Uncharted 2||
|2010|CoD: Black Ops|Red Dead Redemption||
|2011|CoD: MW3|Skyrim||
|2012|CoD: Black Ops 2|The Walking Dead||
|2013|GTA V|GTA V||
|2014|CoD: Advanced Warfare|Dark Souls 2||
|2015|CoD: Black Ops 3|The Witcher 3||

|2018|Red Dead Redemption 2|God of War|PUBG|
|2019|CoD: MW (2019)|Sekiro|Sekiro|
|2020|CoD: Black Ops Cold War|The Last of Us 2|Red Dead Redemption 2|
|2021|CoD: Vanguard|It Takes Two|Resident Evil Village|
|2022|CoD: MW2 (2022)|Elden Ring|Elden Ring|

So no, I don't think that it's a popularity contest.  I do think that maybe they have a rule that you have to be popular enough to be considered, but more often than not, the most-sold game isn't the winner.

Edit: The last time a CoD game was nominated for GOTY was 2010.  And apparently CoD 4 wasn't good enough in 2007 to be nominated?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Death stranding winning best game on the go is either a big joke that everyone is in on, or the people voting are idiots and took the category literally. Probably a bit of both."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I was one of those that voted stray because I hadn‚Äôt played any of the other games available to pick. If I had played more than one game in a line up for the other ones I obviously picked the best pick for that category. 

Edit: what should I have done then O wise Reddit? Vote for a game I had never played before? Ignored? That doesn‚Äôt really make sense because I really enjoyed stray, it was the first game I have ever platinumed. The game awards nominated it, I chose it, the end. Why are people so pressed about this? The awards are about as useful as Reddit awards. You didn‚Äôt create the game, you aren‚Äôt the company that lost, so I really truly don‚Äôt understand. These awards are not supposed to be serious, they are supposed to be fun. Thanks Reddit for trying to suck the fun out everything when you don‚Äôt get your way üëç"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Sure. Still, I'm curious if it is 100% popularity contest, or 90% popularity + 10% people-actually-think-this."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Yeah, awards in general are usually industry BS, but the Steam awards are especially BS.  It‚Äôs just marketing for a storefront to push engagement."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"They did an award for ""outstanding visual style""


I've seen a post complaining about this award as well.


The description for the award says the category is specifically for games that don't go for real world graphics, and Spider-man Miles Morales won."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Well said; I was trying to figure out how to articulate this. Like, it's not ""innovative gameplay"" in terms of mechanics, but it is ""innovative gameplay"" in terms of atmosphere, perspective, etc. It feels unique in that respect, so it feels like it should win something. Maybe the exact award category just doesn't exist."

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I'd argue that M&B2, even though it's a sequel and not that different from M&B1, is still weirdly unique in its mechanics.

Teardown comes towards a very very technical level of innovation, where the performance and density of the destruction is what made it technically innovative.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I didn't.

I got really excited by the thumbnail and title. But then I skimmed some playthroughs and was disappointed in the gameplay.

So really your question should be: Given these results, why are there not 1,000 cat simulations out there?"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"""Most innovative"" is certainly an overstatement. In a way, Songs of conquest offered more innovation despite only setting out to recapture HoMM3. I'm sure there are more innovative games out there but that is just one that came to mind on top of my head.

Realistically only games with enough exposure win such awards and taking that into consideration I don't think it's silly. In Skyrim I ran over many tables in my kajiit playthrough but the button prompts always suggested ""picking up"" the items. No, I want the game to expect me to throw them on the ground. I'm playing a cat damnit. It was about time that there is a game with proper cat gameplay."

For me, Stray, was an outstanding game since the 12ish hours that it took to beat was more like ""a few weeks"" for me and I truly value the immersion of the games I do play. I don't have much time to ""lose myself"" so when I do spend those precious few hours, I like that I can forget about my surroundings and get lost in a different place. 

Stray was really fun for this even if it was ""easy"" and ""linear"". For what it's worth, I LOVE Hell Let Loose which is far from easy and linear but is similarly immersive. The action of playing the game is more important than the action of completing it. And I agree that there should be a reward for games that offer this type of experience. Stray definitely a great one for it."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I wouldn't call them dumb or blind... people probably knew what they were doing when they voted Stray for this award. Trolls gonna troll.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Yeah. Honestly, it should have won that category. The forced two-player co-op is a major selling point for it. Me and my brother had an insane amount of fun playing it.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Really enjoyed it takes two. Also A Way Out was really cool in how it handled co-op, similarly. And it's made by the same guys! There needs to be more games like that for sure"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Honestly, the protagonist being a cat is something they should have leaned into more heavily than they did.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,How many voxel games have you seen or played? Voxel demolition games are pretty common.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Bannerlord in that list is also a technical level of innovation, where they made up to 1000 (technically 2048 but due to horses having their own AI you are only allowed up to 1000) npcs fight each other, correctly calculate this each time one of them hits the other:

Relative speed of weapon to target

Perks of attacker

Perks of defender

Perks effecting both of them via party leaders and formation leaders as well as banners

Armor of defender

Weapon skill of the attacker

Which body part is hit

Base damage of weapon. Damage type of weapon.

For 1000 npcs, they also do pathfinding, threat assesment, following orders of the party leader, calculate their perks for movement speed of the units (movement speed also calculates equipment load and both you and AI pick up weapons when they need to so it can change during gameplay). All of this needs to happen at the same time smoothly for the game to even work and it does pretty smoothly. Not to mention every npc even has cloth physics enabled. Every single one of them. All of this are  massive achievements technically.

Whenever i see people online esp in reddit not understanding how hard it is to make it work smoothly and downplay the games innovation like that i get a bit sad as a programmer. There is massive work in there that make it all possible and some people think it is the same game with a bit more polish. Gameplay mechanics are not that different but technical improvement is massive, even compared to other titles from way bigger studios."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I've watched other people play.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Thing about award shows though is that they're filled with people who likely never even played any of the games. Why should they decide as opposed to people who at least play them.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"\>Clearly, award shows that aren‚Äôt all player-choice produce more sensible results than this

You should read up on prestigious film awards. To win an oscar, it's generally a marketing campaign worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars aimed at a few thousand people in Hollywood who vote for the films.

All that time, effort, and money is spent wooing all the known judges and their network of friends and acquaintances, in order to get them a little more positively disposed towards certain movies.

\---

Most oscar award-winning movies get awards not because they were good, but because people spent an unholy amount of time and money wooing the judges. This is one of the reasons foreign films almost never win the oscar - even though many of them are standout quality above their peers, the people who make them generally don't have the time or money or connections to run an efficient oscar campaign. Unlike their hollywood-made peers.

\---

**tl;dr** the oscars are a popularity contest among a few thousand hollywood insiders that people connected in the movie industry spend an absurd amount of money and time trying to win over."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Award shows should have a mix of both. Start with people voting for games that sold x amount of copies so that way shitty shovelware doesn‚Äôt get nominated as a joke. Then the judges can take the top 100 games and narrow that down and let the people vote again. It won‚Äôt be perfect but I think it will be alright
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Meh. The Best Animated Film Oscar has been quite clearly be shown that the voters dont even watch the nominees in a lot of cases. They jsut see Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks and check the box.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,People will find a way to bitch no matter what
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"The Academy Awards are still a popularity contest, just not one that the general public can vote in.

The problem is that award shows always insist on creating awards that are entirely subjective and people take it all way too seriously."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"CoD is a great franchise, it's just not trying to be GotY material. It's the snackfood of games while things like Elden Ring are steak. You're supposed to play CoD a lot to get used to it and get good. It's light so you can keep munching all day and it's great at staying interesting and fun despite playing for hours every day with your friends. On the other hand, games that win GotY are typically amazing crafted experiences that are great because they end and you can judge the game as a whole. You're satisfied after a good steak while chips just leave you reaching for a new bag."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"There are years where I wonder how CoD stays the most sold game, in particular 2021, 2017, and 2016.  But still I legitimately think that a number of CoD entries are worthy of at least a nomination for GOTY.

* CoD: 4 needs no introduction.
* World at War kicked off the zombies trend for the industry
* Modern Warfare (2019) for the Clean House mission"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Not a really a fan of tacos so in this case I wouldn‚Äôt vote at all. And why should I have to play every game in the line up in order to vote?

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Within its own franchise, I absolutely agree.  It was more of the same, with a little more polish.  It didn't innovate on itself at all.

What I do appreciate though is its uniqueness when viewed in the lens of the rest of the games industry.  It's STILL a unique combination that nobody else has really replicated or made successful.

Maybe I'm just mislabeling that as innovative.  If there are other games out there with the same grand campaign structure, I would absolutely love to hear about them and play them. üòÅ"
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"So is your take, that because there's voxels and you can destroy them, that Teardown isn't very innovative? There's quite a bit more going on than this face value perspective. Very reductive.

Dome Keeper has 2D voxels with destruction too. ""It's terraria with mods and a new engine"". See how that works? It's easy to be reductive.

In both of these games, what make's them unique is what you do with the voxels and why. In teardown your often not just destroying stuff, your often building paths via destruction using very limited resources, all in order to find the fastest path to complete a heist speedrun. That is what I have not seen any other games do, and what I would call most certainly innovative. Plus, the innovation of the tech used. You can't get anything at the scale of destruction Teardown has, anywhere else."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Teardown isn't a game good to just watch, honestly. Most of it's fun comes from the freedom the impressive destruction system provides. I've never seen such an astounding physics system combined with raytracing.

It definitely got my vote for most innovative. We've never seen such a physics system before."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Most of the top comments say that it won because you play a cat and not because it has tight gameplay.

I see some pretty dumb decisions from the Oscars or Grammys, but the decisions of major video game award shows/publications generally make sense to me. Even when I strongly disagree with an outcome, I can understand it. I‚Äôve never seen or read of any evidence of bribery and the outcomes have never led me to suspect it.

I don‚Äôt generally watch award shows all the way through, I watch some clips. Having said that‚Äîand not knowing what the full extent of commercials and product placement may be‚ÄîI cannot see what your problem would be with trailers. Showing off upcoming games is great. Combining it with awards is great. The trailers bring a bigger audience to appreciate the nominees and winners, the awards bring a bigger audience to check out upcoming games.

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I paid ¬£25 and it was worth it. Much rather a short sweet game than a ¬£70 game bloated with 100 hours of nothing (hi Ubisoft!)
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"But that's not innovative anymore than gluing a clock onto a hammer is innovative.  All been done before in their component parts, this was just mushing them together (albeit expertly mushing them together).  And I'm not down on the game, but I don't see the innovation here other than, as I said, combining existing things in one game.

But really my point is that real innovation in games are few and far between.  I agree Stray isn't very innovative, but neither is Takes Two"

And while I‚Äôd call that innovative when it was first released like 14 years ago, Bannerlord imo didn‚Äôt do much to innovate on it. If there was a category for best combat/gameplay, you could definitely put bannerlord in the convo there since it‚Äôs still M&B."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I don't think I was being unfairly reductive. The gameplay loop is destroying voxels to complete heists. The ""to complete heists"" part is innovative, and the polish of voxel destruction is excellent.

Scale of technology isn't innovative, it's iterative. I'm not saying iterative tech isn't important or an achievement in itself, but it's not the same as creating something brand new.

Don't get me wrong, there is innovation here and Teardown deserves a nomination. I just don't think it deserved a win as much as Stray or Dome Keeper do."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"I‚Äôm genuinely curious how you don‚Äôt see it as more unique than all the other big games this year. All the others were, while good, your run of the mill 1st or 3rd person fare, all playing as humans with generic combat and movement mechanics."

1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Trailers aren't really the problem, they're just a piece of the whole. I don't have a problem with trailers at all. I have a problem with holding TGA up on a pedestal like they're the final authority on game quality when they're being paid to dole out awards as a marketing tool to sell primetime adspace to companies with new trailers to show off. It's the same problem I have with superbowl commercials. How much money did Kojima Productions pay TGA to reveal Death Stranding 2? How much did FromSoftware pay to reveal Armored Core VI? The trailers were sick, sure, but like... let's not pretend they're doing it out of the kindness of their hearts. Award shows usually exist as a thing to attach highly viewed adspace to. And trailers are not the only type of ad they run, there's plenty of traditional advertising during breaks and product placement during the show itself. It's how they make money. They would not put on an award show unless they could make money"

I don't mind a short, sweet game at that price as long as it's got engaging gameplay and some replayability (I've happily bought Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance at full MSRP twice, once on Xbox 360 and once on Steam), but the replayability is key.

I very much doubt I'll ever go back to Stray. It's visually very pretty, but has no real meat on the gameplay bones to make going through it twice worth it."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Mixing components together creates new gameplay loops that didn't exist before. If we really boil it all down then nothing released in the past 10 years was really original.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,That's like saying the cell phone wasn't an innovation because it's just mushed together technologies that already existed. Or maybe electric vehicles aren't innovative because motors run by batteries and cars already existed. That's such a weird argument. The fact that no one stuck those elements together like that before and made it work so well IS the innovation.
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,I did see it as unique. I said that in my first comment. I just don‚Äôt see it as innovative
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Of course they wouldn‚Äôt put on an award show if they could not make some money. They‚Äôre not gonna do it for free. But how would that money influence the voting?

Most businesses are savvy enough to ""bribe"" while skirting legality, so they do it through coercion or other means. I don't believe a company should be allowed within 100 yards of an award show ad if any of their (or their susbidiaries') products are up for ANY category. Not to mention, those publications and media outlets doing the voting are also ""convinced"" to write good reviews. Not every time, but a lot of the time. From a comment in an ancient reddit thread -

>The reviewers are never offered money for a high review score. That is inefficient and obvious. The way it happens is that the PR at the gaming companies puts subtle pressure on the review sites to keep the scores high.  They create conditional review embargos (you can't release your review before X date unless the score is higher than 80), buy ads on the site, and the gaming sites are reliant on the developers for content.  So there is a lot of pressure to keep developers happy on the business end."

That said, to properly gauge for example GOTY (although it depends on the games) you would have to put in 50-100hours into an EldenRing so you can compare it to another game. That summed up, combined with the games (sometimes) being unavailable on the same platform is another hurdle, etc..."

I've got a pretty fucking smart cat. It's even orange! But that little motherfucker does not have the brain capacity to find a random robot the clothing it needs to help it sneak my cat into a factory so he can Metal Gear his way through flying robots to get a specific, guarded battery.

It's not a realistic cat, and they didn't frame it as one."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"You said you haven‚Äôt played it, but debar the gameplay? Having played it to completion I can say it‚Äôs like most generic rpgs in terms of game play. Just that your a cat. Go to area A talk to npc 1 go find npc 2 return to npc 1 solve problem, go to area B rinse, wash, repeat. Get new tool to use as you progress.

It‚Äôs really doing nothing new in terms of game play except that your a cat. Also introducing someone to something is not ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù. I‚Äôm saying it does literally nothing new except you being a cat. 

I‚Äôm not saying the game was bad, I enjoyed my time with it enough. Just does nothing I haven‚Äôt seen before in many other games, thus, making it not innovative."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"When I look at past GOTY nominees and winners at the Game Awards, these things do not seem like real barriers. Exclusives routinely win: BOTW; GoW 18 (which beat out RDR2); TLOU2. Hard games that plenty of critics will bounce off of win: Sekiro; Elden Ring. And long games win: BOTW; Elden Ring.

Of course not every person in every voting outlet has played every nominee. But they probably average more games than actual players do. And both the nominees and the outcomes generally seem reasonable. When I look at all the different award shows together and their different results I just think‚Ä¶ yeah, makes sense. Occasionally it does look like one of these factors (difficulty, exclusivity) may have pushed things in some direction, eg, Sekiro losing to Untitled Goose Game in some award shows. But it can‚Äôt be perfect and it‚Äôs not supposed to be. 

I think a lot of gamers just have this territorial attitude and resentment towards games critics and award shows, maybe because they imagine, consciously or subconsciously, that their intense love of games qualifies them to not only do the job of a critic but do it better. 

But I don‚Äôt think so. I think a lot of gamers with this attitude have tunnel vision. One, they assume that their opinions are universal‚Äîsee the backlash to all TLOU2‚Äôs GOTY wins, like it had to be rigged‚Ä¶ except a LOT of people voted for it in the Player‚Äôs Choice category. I‚Äôm not a fan of the game, it doesn‚Äôt embody what I value in games, and I truly did not enjoy it. But it got its awards fairly. 

Frankly, the players get it wrong too. There have been some cases in the last few years where I think players wildly overrated or under-appreciated something but the critics went the other way. And although that it is just my opinion, it also validates the critics. They‚Äôre speaking to something that a group of players that includes me will understand and agree with, and that means they‚Äôre doing their jobs, same as when they give TLOU2 10s. That may not vibe with me, but a lot of people feel that way.

Basically I just think there‚Äôs way too much unjustified hostility and distrust directed toward games journalism/critics/award shows. We‚Äôre all gonna have strong disagreements with them sometimes, because we all have different tastes and values. A bunch of people think Deathloop is meh and got way better reviews than it deserved, well, I think those people never understood the game‚Äôs purpose and that it presents some of the best innovations to the immersive sim genre ever. Critics gave Ghost of Tsushima good reviews, gamers go further and call it a masterpiece, I think it‚Äôs incredibly meh on almost every level. There‚Äôs always going to be some amount of disagreement. We should be able to stick to substance and argue our views without waging a culture war. Because it really is often completely detached from any substance or purpose beyond attacking games journalism.

An example, I remember seeing people on the doom sub absolutely obsessed with how terrible the gameplay in IGN‚Äôs review video for Doom Eternal was. And there was some argument around the idea that a critic needs to really be good at a game to review it fairly; I get this to some extent, as I do think it‚Äôs impossible to fully appreciate a game until you‚Äôre good at it, and Doom Eternal takes multiple playthroughs to really understand it. But IGN gave it a 9, and it‚Äôs
not realistic to demand that a critic replay a game on its hardest difficulty multiple times before scoring it. Everything written in the review was accurate. What was the problem? It‚Äôs just this territorial thing.

Because sometimes you can read a criticism and *know* the person is wrong because they are unknowingly just describing their novice play‚Äîlike if someone describes a game as slow and/or clunky but you can blitz through it with the grace of a ballerina‚Äîbut I rarely see that in reviews from mainstream outlets. 

I see it a LOT from players. If game critics are held back from experiencing the best of a game by their lack of skill, they do a good job of hiding it; maybe they understand if something isn‚Äôt clicking for them, they might be the problem. They‚Äôre open to that. Players, by contrast, are quick to complain that a game sucks because xyz feels wrong, and even if you know exactly what they‚Äôre talking about, and you tell them ‚Äúyes, that goes away once you get better,‚Äù they stick to their guns. They are very bad at considering that their knowledge may be incomplete."

I think you definition of ""innovative"" is a little bit skewed. Also I never said anything about it not introducing people to the genre just that it does nothing new in the genre apart from making the player a cat, which is also not a new thing, just not common."
1035mfl,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Except it did innovate. Name one other game where you play as a cat with such fluid and well done cat-like movement. That extremely new idea introduced tons of new people to a genre they otherwise likely wouldn‚Äôt have played and it‚Äôs entirely why it was so popular.

Again, the game is unique, not innovative. they have done nothing new and ground break or original. There are other games where you can play as a cat and roam around, think Tokyo Jungle, animations are not as fluid ill agree there but you can, if you choose, roam around as a cat. Or Calico where you can ride a cat but the cat animations look just like a cat.  


If you replace the Cat with a Human(or orc, elf, ect) the gameplay would be the same.   


Now if they made it where you live as a cat, go out and hunt like a cat, and live life as a cat only(realistically that is, Tokyo Jungle *kind off* does this). That I could say is innovative.   


I will say again, and probably for the last time as you seem die hard stuck on this and I have other things I can be doing with my time. The game is unique. the game is good. the game does nothing new other than make you a cat."

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"At least we know why they're called catwalks now. Because, in the hyper-distant future, CATS WILL BE WALKING ON THEM!!!"
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,When?
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,As a person who is allergic to cats this was epic for me

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-26,I did not finish it yet. Seeing your post makes me think I should get back to it and finish it for once.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-26,is it worth it??

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Boring for me.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Just took a massive shit.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"Couple tips: look for a scratchable surface in each area. The first one is the cardboard near where the game starts.

You have to play the sewer level twice. Once where you go through using the fancy flashlight, and again where you leave it off and just haul ass. Don't worry, it sounds harder than it is."
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,How is it? Looks cute.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Walking sim
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,It‚Äôs nice looking but not free roam enough for me. Too guided‚Ä¶like let me struggle to find my way! And let me just blindly jump off of things üò≠
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"I wanted to buy this game day one, but everyone is saying the gameplay is VERY limited.
That you can't even jump when you want, is it true?"
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Some people are too comfortable with clutter.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,people will play anything nowadays huh
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"It was a nice feeling of happyness, sadness and relief. It's been some time since a game made me feel that way."
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Agreed. However was hoping he reunited with the other cats at the end‚Ä¶
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-26,"Loved this game, too. But can't even remember the ending."
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,What platform is that on?
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,Great well now I gotta look

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"If it helps you get started, it's not a long game. 

I just cleared it from my backlog and it only took me three relatively short sessions to play the whole game"
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"Damn, you're stronger than me. That intro put tears in my eyes"

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"In all honesty, its a pretty straight forward adventure game. The gimmick of being a cat would probably get old after a time, but the game is only like 5 or 6 hours long.

>!It also gets fucking WEIRD half way through. Like ""What the fuck is that!?"" levels of weird!<

Solid 7.5/10"

1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,the game is great.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"Yeah, it's possibly one of my favourite modern games.

It's a simple concept, and quite a basic game in terms of what your characters capabilities are, but it's surprisingly complex in the emotions it invokes.

The ending quite literally left me slightly heartbroken. I just didn't want to leave the control room."
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,*happiness
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-10-25,Same. But i think this leaves some room for a sequel where you explore the world above and look for your cat friends.
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"All of them, I think. I got it on the switch"
1ebrx4q,2024-07-25,2024-07-25,"What I find really funny is that, that was only posted after my comment"

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, a little short but otherwise good game."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"This game is so good I still remember it fondly and platinumed it on ps, I liked it so much that I'm thinking to buy it just to give Anna Purna's sh my money cause they deserve every cents of it"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I love this game. When the kitty disappears for the last time.... I feel something very strong and I don't know what it is.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,It was a very fun game. I look forward to seeing more of this world and this cat.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I played this the day after my cat died, even found a mod to make the cat look like mine. It was a beautiful game that hit me hard."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,This is a great game. I haven‚Äôt finished but a very good story so far. Love these kind of stories.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,One of my favorite games even though it was so short. I'm hoping they make another.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Stray was my 2022 Game of the Year and is number 16 on my personal top 50 games of all time list.  Absolutely adore that game.  Teared up at the end, too."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Really enjoyed this one.  The way the story was told and the atmosphere of the world.  Definitely recommend playing through it, and it's short enough you can probably finish it in a weekend."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"One of the best games I have finished in recent years. Perfect length for the story..
I'd recommend watching some making of's on YT, there are some cute scenes, with the cat actor in its motion capture suit.. Some scenes in the game are just random things the cat did while filming.."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Plus the music slaps
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,If anyone has not heard [Open The Sky](https://youtu.be/_b2TcdN9mBQ?si=pyGs4hG3L1foqjwM) by Stupendium I strongly recommend it. An awesome emotional song based on the game
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I hope they never make a sequel to this game, but I'd take a dozen or so spiritual successors that follow the same formula. Such a relaxing and atmospheric experience from start to finish"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I just finished it.  Was amazing.  Hope for more!!
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Loved the game, but I don't think it was that simple at some places, still puts up a challenge :)"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Perfect short peaceful and slightly different game.

Except for that one damn achievement"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Oh I love this game - it's just that it gives me motion sickness after 5 minutes!
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Loved it! And love cats!
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Still my favourite indie game
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Oh man, you should try get a VR headset and play Moss. You help a white mouse called Quill to find her missing uncle in an enchanted forest. Every tiny little thing is so lovingly animated, and Quill is so adorable, you get a genuine cuteness overload playing that game."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I need to plays this game, such cute"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Really immersive game indeed
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I played this game shortly after my cat passed away. It's very close to my heart, and the ending was beautiful and emotional."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-03-01,"Absolutely loved the atmosphere. A rare, simple game that doesn't bore you for what it is. The atmosphere, music,, environmental settings and concept arts just makes you keep going till the end."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-03-01,So mad they didn‚Äôt leave it in the psn store for later members to get they just basically put it right on the normal purchase smh my psn ran out that exact month üò§
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Why‚Äôs it look like he has lips
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,One of the best soundtracks too. Especially the club music! https://youtu.be/nCGs9ruodx8?si=t1NCIiI3f3j6jV_W
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,A lovely little adventure
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Yes, this game was really great, I was pretty disappointed when it was over. I hope there is a sequel in the works as I think I‚Äôve read."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I sobbed violently through the second half of the game
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,An amazing game
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,It really bothered me that you still talk to everyone like normal through the backpack. It made it feel like you were playing as a person in a cat suit instead of as a cat
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Imagine a Warriors game series in this style

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-03-03,"I really was surprised by the game, but I enjoyed it quite a bit"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Sounds whimsical.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I was sad at the part where kitty had to say goodbye to one of his friends.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,The only thing I hated about Stray was how linear it was. It really felt like the same gameplay everytime.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Most of the trophies are cat puns and I throughly enjoyed that, game is good too I guess"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I found it pretty average, a fun first time experience in a small studio puzzle game. Won't be revisiting and forgot about it not long after finishing."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,One big cutscene it is.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Honestly though? It's really overhyped. I played the game as soon as it came out on my PS4 and was pretty underwhelmed. I mean I get it, I have a cat and playing as a cat is a novel experience and shit but charging 30 bucks for a game the size of a DLC is just daylight robbery."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Does it a game? I thought it is a movie! Can I play on mobile?
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Yeah I want to experience this but I hate cats.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I find it nice to have some short games here and there. It's a nice break. Some games just drag on for too long. Titanfall 2 and Portal 2 are perfect examples of short games where their length only made me appreciate them more. 

But gimme some more Baldur's Gate and Zelda too."
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"While it was a little short, they didn't charge full price for it either, so I'm pretty happy with what i got üôÇ"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"I also thought it was quite expensive for the short game duration

But otherwise it was fun!"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Absolutely worth it, we should support studios who make unique games, hopefully a sequel or something new!"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-03-01,I bought a copy around Christmas for this exact reason. It was on sale from Amazon and wanted to give them credit for making a good game.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-07-21,Its nice to support indie studios.

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I bought this to play with my cat. She died before we got the chance and I can't bring myself to play it now
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"Mine died too shortly before the game came out, and I couldn't handle the game. I still can't, hurts too damn much."

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,You can't play it on mobile but you can probably find full gameplay without any commentary on YouTube.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,I dont think so. It's a console game you can get on Steam.
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,There is a movie called strays but it‚Äôs unrelated

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,"That could be. But I'm not sure. There's also the cat's lifespan is short, and his adventure forgotten soon. The loss of humanity. The thousand years the robots were trapped. It's a lot of stuff mixed.

I slept in that last sleep spot and watched the entire animation of the ceiling opening.

What a game. :)"
1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-03-01,Took me days to get!

1b2o3k2,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,Inside was fumkin weird. I loved how the game kept you guessing on how each area needed to be solved.
cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,"I‚Äôm thinking about how this would work in the game, and I‚Äôm terrified."

They met in a cave when it started to rain and my dad ported himself right next to her.

cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,"Exactly what it sounds like. It was originally suggested as Enderman/Skeleton during a livestream but I thought it would look cooler with a Stray. 

You are welcome to suggest some more and I'll try to sketch a few of them out tomorrow morning!

cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,"[Strays](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stray) are arctic variants of the normal Skeleton mob that were introduced in 1.10. Aside from the visual appearance, the main distinguishing characteristic from normal Skeletons is that Strays will shoot Arrows of Slowness (Slowness 0:30)  and are also able to drop them as loot. Also, they don't try to shoot arrows underwater, but use melee attacks, or something like that. You could probably read the wiki page if you wanted a more detailed rundown."
cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,I think the most popular name has been Enderstray so far! Creeper awman is a good runner up though lol

cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,"It could actually work if it kept the Y level mostly the same, so you wouldn't be thrown into the air, or teleported into a wall to suffocate, since that would be a bit too much for a regular mob."

cv6vlq,2019-08-25,2019-08-27,"Oh, it has to be a regular mob? I was thinking something that was even more uncommon than regular Endermen, something that you generally want to avoid altogether. 

I'd accept that it can teleport you into the air but not far enough to deal significant fall damage, just a bit, and it can only teleport you downwards if it can find two air blocks on top of each other where the player will fit. Otherwise, a larger distance horizontally than either direction along the Y."

13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Yes that cats are very real! My dog was obsessed with watching Stray!
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Our cat would meow back at the TV and watch super close
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"My dog would stand in the exact same spot at my TV when we played Stray. He'd gently growl, whine and rarely bark in response to certain things. Making the cat sprint got the best reactions from him."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Loki is a very good name for that dog.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,How is the game? It‚Äôs like 25$ on Steam and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a 30 minute gimmick or whether the campaign is actually good.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,My dog will bark when she see animal on the TV. I cannot ride a horse on Assassin's Creed and Breath of the Wild. :(
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,My Collie X loves it.  And she helps me hunt in RDR2 by indicating game.  But her real thing is that she has a massive  crush on Brian from Family Guy... If he comes on we all get rounded up to watch it.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Our Savannah cat kept standing on his hind legs to paw at the kitty on screen. I would make the cat meow whenever he made contact. Best game.

13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Dogs can see and take interest in the tv now because of its high resolution and I think partly because of a new refresh rate. Before they saw tv screens the way we would if we recorded it in a camcorder with horizontal lines pulsing up it. Now they can actually see it the same way we do. I used to put videos of birds and squirrels picking at seeds and i had to stop because my cats jumped at the tv.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You know what bothers me about stray? The cat never once puts his tail up :( is not happy cat.

""Meow""

13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Do you mind if I ask how old your daughter is? My gf's 4-year old wanted to play this but she couldn't figure it out and kept asking for help.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14, My dog was also super interested when I played this. He went right up to the screen whenever I made the cat meow.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Whenever I play stray, my cat gives the screen the dirtiest look whenever I press the meow button"
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I have not been able to play more than 5 minutes of Stray because of our OES puppy.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Those are some good graphics, I thought it was a photo of a cat til I scrolled far enough down to see the doggo."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"Jeeez, Loki's fur looks so soft!"
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Man you have no idea how right you are.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Cute game, get it on sale."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It‚Äôs about 4-6 hours long. Very neat little world to explore with a fair amount of lore and some collectible hunting.

It‚Äôs got a nice story and some cool characters and environments. Some stealth sections, some light combat, and some great ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù moments.

I played it when it released, and I‚Äôve run through it once more since to finish off my 100%. Personally I think it‚Äôs a great but short indie gem."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I'd say put it on you wish list pick it up for 10-15 $ on sale
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I loved it. I got about 6 hours out of it. Very polished!
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It's pretty good, the main hook is the cool and moody environments and obviously playing as a cat, but the story is decent and gameplay not bad at all."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"With you on this. Made the mistake of putting Puppy Party on Netflix when I went to work a few years ago. Taught her to watch tv, and now we get constant jump scares from within the living room."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Mine used to do that, she is not allowed to stand in front of the tv anymore and has to leave the sofa when she barks. I used to not be able to play anything with animals in it, it got to a point were she barked at Pokemon lmao"
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,This. I was caught off-guard by how horror-like it got.

13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,?
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,We buy a crapload of toys to keep his destructive behavior focused on things he‚Äôs allowed to destroy. It takes him about 7 seconds before he‚Äôs pulling the guts out of his stuffed toys.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"She‚Äôs 10, but she still asked for help. There are some logic puzzles that I don‚Äôt think a 4 year old would be able to handle."
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The dog is going to troll your whole family.
13h08wd,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,We had a husky that was exactly like that.

One day I was sitting with my cat at the pc, he was pleasantly purring away as I pet him and was watching something on my main monitor. My secondary on the left had nothing up, just blank desktop. It swapped to a head on [picture of the main kitty](https://imgur.com/a/3WKY9DL).

As soon as my cat saw that image, he stood up and all his hair was poofed down his spine and tail. Immediately I start shitting my pants because my first thought is he's gonna scratch it or headbutt it. I moved a chrome tab over to block the picture and tried to calm him.  

After that, no more kitties as my background lol.

TLDR; Cat got spooked by [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/3WKY9DL) of the game and almost decimated my monitor."

Then I tried a hand cannon for the first time, and this just took my play to an entirely new level.

I played as a Hunter, so the cannon + knife throwing was a wet dream in combat mechanics. It was flawless.

Well, sadly, as they say, all good things come to an end. By the time Taken King released, the game was forever ruined."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"From the first hour, I assumed Outer Worlds was more of a first person Borderlands in a more Fallout package.  I tried it once at launch and dropped it pretty fast.

Then you get a little further in, and the rapid fire jokes stop coming as fast, characters behave more like people, and the game improves tremendously.  Quests get better, dialogue gets better, it all feels better.  Actual serious scenes happen.  People start behaving like people and less like punchlines.

Still plenty of laughs but they feel less forced.

Felt like they were going way too hard for the ""space capitalism LOL"" or random MCU jokes / occurrences in the first bit.  That whole first settlement and surrounding area.  It was the same joke over and over and over.  Got old super fast without anything to break it up in between."

Started for the atmosphere and horror (devs of Amnesia and Penumbra), stayed in my head for 9 years now because of the theme and story.
Challenged my view on some topics. How the game approaches its themes is imo genius. There are some kind of decisions to make and till today there was one where idk what is the right one to make. 

(For those who aren't into horror, there is a safe mode. Then the Game is basically a Walking Simulator)."

I expected episode 1 to be the least interesting, since I didn‚Äôt really care about rose that much, especially when the other two episodes were based on Control and Quantum Break, which I was excited about. Turned out to be one of the best things Sam Lake has ever cooked up. Absolute comedy gold.

Outer wilds, too (obviously, and if you don't know why it's obvious, I ain't telling you, go play it)

I honestly had no expectations. I just heard it was solid, so I downloaded it. It starts out and I'm like, *""Okayyy, a walking simulator""*. But then it quickly starts becoming kinda scary. Legitimately scary at some points. And then it goes full on science-fiction-philosophical. At the end of the day, you wouldn't be wrong to call it a ""walking simulator"", but the narrative of that game, as well as the setting/atmosphere, really stuck with me.

Also ultrakill, but that was mainly just bc it was good, expected a demo which wasn‚Äôt that great, and well literally the best game I have ever played imo. Demo is only the start lol."

Got it for free long ago and just tried it, i thoughts its just some random shooter game.

Same with Soma"

I knew the game was gonna be good, since Remedy definitely creates some fantastic games but I never thought it would be THAT good. Was my GOTY the game it was released and one of my favorite games of all time.

Recently was Thank Goodness You're Here!, I went with low expectations and laughed a lot with the game even though is quite short."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Soma and the return of the obra dinn

Soma had me expecting a generic horror game with a deep-sea sci-fi theme. Instead I got something that made me spiral into deep thoughts regarding sci-fi things such as cloning, body transfers, immortality,

Return of the obra dinn was just wow, my only complaint is that I can't find another game that will give me the same satisfaction when it comes to solving mysteries"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Control. A friend of mine whose taste I trust implicitly said ""I'm not going to tell you why, but you should play that new Control game. It's right up your alley!""

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"For me, Rain World. Youtubers at the time didn't really give it a chance so I filed it away as a short mascot platformer with high difficulty, clunky controls, and no explanation. 


Picked it up on sale shortly after the DLC. The artwork and music are great and the community has a silly amount of content with artwork and youtube animations. With the DLC came co-op, mods, new game modes, and 5 new character campaigns, up from the base game's 3*. 


Difficulty is because wildlife is procedurally simulated even while they aren't in the room with you, so they can and will leave their spawn and put themselves in inconvenient spots. The UI, the movement, the enemy behavior, and the lore are barely explained in game, and are meant to be discovered by experiment or accident, there is apparently 90 pages of movement tech to learn. It is pretty rough on first time players for these reasons.

While I'm not a fan of hard platforming games I have been strangely obsessed with this one."

I knew nothing. I thought the game was over at the halfway point. I happily >! rode the platform into the flames !<. And then the game respawned me. Wait what? The second half was even more interesting and exciting and funny. 

The stream of insults during the final boss has me laughing to this day. And, when I beat the game for real, and the ending song played‚Ä¶. I just could not believe how amazing the whole thing was."

I was looking for a fresh game to play, spotted this last year, saw it had good reviews, it was low cost, so I said why not?

I didn't know a thing about it. It blew me away, it's a masterpiece IMO.

I even got a print of a scene framed and hung in my office.

Fell in love with the game, the talent behind it, Melina who plays Senua. It's just so good and the first time in a long time I was really captivated by a game. I like that surprise."

At the time, I was somewhat into the piracy scene. I was basically downloading EVERYTHING released on the scene, lots of shovelware apps and games and things, most of which I hadn't even heard of.

Well, Half Life fell into the ""hadn't heard of it"" category, but I was trying out most of the stuff I downloaded. I installed it and fired it up... and holy shit. I knew I enjoyed a game with more story and structure to it - I much preferred Quake 2 to Quake 1 as an example - but Half Life was revelatory.

I saw my friend play the first one when it came out in his dorm and thought it looked interesting - so I figured I‚Äôd pick the second one up on release to get to really play the multiplayer before it died, as most of the shooter games I used to enjoy that were ‚Äúunique‚Äù usually died within a year (Homefront, Brink, etc)

Around 2011-2012 or so (can't remember exactly) I saw it in the pre-owned section at GAME (the UK equivalent of GameStop) for ¬£10, and bought it simply because it was called Yakuza, sounded cool and was ¬£10. The series still wasn't really known in the UK at all at this point.

Me and my brother fired it up on the PS3 with zero expectations and no knowledge of the series other than the word ""Yakuza"", and spent the next week enjoying a game that was nothing like anything we'd ever played before. It isn't perfect, but it was strange, funny, had surprisingly robust mini games, a ""virtual tourism"" feel to it and a genuinely engaging (if convoluted and extremely cheesy) story. We arbitrarily decided to take turns whenever the story switched characters, which made it even better.

Following that experience, I've basically been excited about every Yakuza game that came out since and consider myself a fan, having played all the mainline games and their remakes. But if I hadn't seen that game on the shelf for a tenner, who knows if I'd care about the franchise? Maybe not."

Yes your grace - insanely interesting balance between your family, a failing kingdom, and choices that do in fact come back to haunt you.

Tell tales walking dead - I fucking cried at the end and the realization of why you were being targeted by the last villain was excellent. It was legitimately one of the most heartbreaking endings to a game I‚Äôd ever played. 

Metal gear rising revengance - never played a metal gear game. Thought this might be cool bc of watermelon cuts, and was shocked to find the best gaming soundtrack of all time with a plot so extremely fun that it was a breath of fresh air."

Division came out in 2016, but we didnt buy it until it went on sale on Steam in early 2020 (you see where this is going). We thought hey.. some 3rd person co-op shooter, why not it‚Äôll be fun.

Then COVID lockdown came.. and the storytelling parallels between this game and real life were scarily close. I recall one area of the game where you pick up someones cell phone and you hear a voicemail complaining about their football game being canceled and they wont refund the tickets‚Ä¶ and I just had a conversation with a friend in real life about the same thing. Had a mini freakout when this happened. I am also very familiar with NYC where the game is also set so recognized a lot of in game locations.

It's more of a storyboard with you making the decisions on the main character as he progresses through the story. You have no direct control. You either choose A Or B

The story is fantastic. As an adult game, there are sex scenes. But you become attatched to the other characters and it isn't a pleasant story as it progresses. There are some very difficult choices to make and there are multiple endings and multiple woman to end up dating. The reviews on Steam were what sold me

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I recently finished *Chants of Sennaar* and was impressed by how much it moved me. I thought it was going to be a language puzzle solver but had no idea it would have stealth or horror segments too.

It also did a good job at pointing out bias and how language connects people. The opening area starts with a conflict between the Devotees and the Warriors. The Warriors are being assholes and not letting the Devotees go to their god. The Warriors brandish weapons and threaten the Devotees, so you have to sneak past them to enter the Fortress.

But... the Devotees have a temple in the first area with parts that are off limits. They kick you out if you trespass, so why can't the Warriors do the same thing? Maybe it's a misunderstanding? After sneaking through the Fortress and learning the Warrior language, you learn things about them to make them more relatable. They love music, they traveled far due to their own devotion to their duty, and they simply aren't sure whether the Devotees are good or not. Once you bridge the gap between languages and help them connect, >!the Warriors open the gates for the Devotees and allow them into the Fortress, and Warriors enter the Abbey to enjoy the music.!<

I also loved how each tribe had different names for each other. Like how the Warriors believe the tribe above them are the Chosen Ones, but that tribe calls themselves >!Bards, a people who cherish art and music, and look down on other tribes.!< The Chosen Ones have a beautiful area, but the cracks begin to show eventually - bullying, a caste system, people unwilling to help those beneath them.

And then the ending of the game uses the lines drawn between each tribe to form words in each language. Like how the connections between everyone form the Devotee word for >!God!< and then show the word for >!Duty!< to the Warriors. It was a nice message about how we all more or less want the same thing, even if we have different points of view."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Red Dead Redemption 2. Probably the best game I've played in the last 15 years.  
Never played the first game, and heard a lot of good about RDR2, and thought it was just a good game, but it is much more than that. With the activities, you can actually get attached to some of the characters, and much more. It is in my eyes, truly a masterpiece of gaming."

1. Mafia II because I expected a simple mob-themed shooter and fell into a detailed world with an eventful story. The story changes locations and advances through several decades with plot twists and deep character development. Car customisation, functional gas stations, and even hubcaps that fall off for the driving enthusiasts. I get what Mafia III was trying to do, but it's a soulless flop compared to II."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Mount and Blade: Bannerlord

I had never heard of this game until last year. When I first played it I was kind of unimpressed with the combat. You start as a tribal warrior with a small band of troops, chasing down bandits and running errands for various townspeople. I felt like I died in battle pretty quickly. But that was because I had bad armor and weapons and a slow, unarmored horse.

There‚Äôs a big map you move your party around. If you encounter bandits you can engage them, and it loads a battlefield where a battle is simulated that you take part in as a commander. You can position your troops, have them charge or retreat or form a shield wall. It‚Äôs fun! 

Eventually a lord invites you to serve as a mercenary for their kingdom in a war, where you can start chasing down parties of enemy kingdoms who are real troops, not just looters in rags with farm tools, and take part in 100 on 100 battles, and raiding villages to disrupt the supply lines of enemy kingdoms. 

If you perform well enough, you can ask to be made a vassal to your kingdom. Then you can start raising armies to besiege castles and cities. 

Now I‚Äôm having 1,000 on 1,000 battles. I have a massive party of Elite troops who can take fortified castles defended by 400 men and only lose 40 men. I kill 120 soldiers myself in battles by rushing behind the lines to target their archers.

I haven‚Äôt been this into a game in a long, long time."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The younger crowd probably doesn't know about this one, but *Halo 3: ODST*.

No, it's not just another Halo game. It's not just a first-person-shooter. This game came out at a time when FPS games traditionally had no narrative and no 'artistry' to them. Bioshock has come out only 2 years prior, and other than that, there weren't too many FPS games known for their intelligent stories, and Halo certain wasn't one of them. 

And out of nowhere we get *Halo ODST*, which gives you Halo gameplay, but in a perpetually dark setting, with a film noir framework for its plot. Instead of being an invincible super-soldier on an alien planet, you're a fragile human who's been separated from his squad in a city on Earth. You're goal isn't to save the planet, but to simply locate your team and get the fuck outta Dodge. The most striking aspect is the soundtrack, which finds a home in serenity, sentimentality, and sadness, rather than the bombastic and optimistic tunes from prior Halo games.

Basically, *Halo ODST* is this calm art-piece that seems to exist completely separately from the rest of the Halo franchise. It's often overlooked because it's not a ""main"" Halo game, but it's one of my favorites, and when it came out, people were genuinely surprised by its presentation.

A wicked soundtrack where over half the music is already stuff I regularly listened to or knew about? Check. A solid 10-15 hour campaign with plenty of stuff to do afterwards? Check.

I'm telling you, I saw the trailer for it (To one of my favorite songs no less), immediately fell in love with the style, and found out I could play it THAT DAY, *ON GAMEPASS?* I was flabbergasted at the quality and I'm so happy the studio might get a chance to create a sequel."

Also in the DLC there is a small moment in the quest to recue Songbird after you chat with her at Hansen's party that really serve no purpose for the story whatsoever that kind of also was like wow. Its a pity they kind of squandered the game a little with al the shit bugs, even if they fixed it a little, because as far as AAA games I go, I think is one of the few I really found unexpected stuff.

Hardspace: Shipbreaker; for a game about ""recycling"" ships in a junkyard its has a small story and lore behind thats way better than it has any right to be, considering how simulator games rarely even bother. Plus the game is super chill to play.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"When i first started playing Cyberpunk 2077 i expected a flashy GTA clone in the future, explosions, futuristic cyborg human and lots of neon, it had all of this, but what i didnt expect it would have is the most makes you think story of any game i have played so far, i dont think i have had harder time picking up dialogue options and how the story unfolds in other games, in fact the other games where choices matter i could remember rn that are not shallow were KOTOR or Fallout New Vegas, and those games are not even close at being as deep as Cyberpunk 

No other game has made me think about the human soul or conciousness, is it better to try and postopone or run from the inevitable or just let go, or for example how can you be sure u are not already dead and its just your brain projecting you an illusion because its dying etc.

The other game that comes close to this i can remember is The Forgotten City, but its still far away from the deepness Cyberpunk goes"

Stanley Parable
OuterWild
Control
Journey added to the list. 

For me, Mass Effect 3 took me completely off guard because it was one of the first triple A games you could actually lose in a grand sense. 

I know millions of people were furious about the different endings but the bottom line is most of those lost the game. And I think that the idea that you could lose without the game really telling you lost was incredibly immersive. 

I saved right before I picked because I knew which was the right answer. But then after I won, I chose the other two in succession. You absolutely lose the game and those lackluster others endings are exactly what the Reapers let you see as a good little minion."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This is a game I've never heard anyone talk about. It's called Stories Untold. It's a modern text based game very clearly inspired by nostalgia for the original genre. I don't even really know how to describe it without spoilers but it was fucking awesome and truly unique. The first chapter is actually pretty scary horror even though you're just sitting typing on a computer. And the game surprised me with it's actual meaning at the end, which I thought was really really beautifully done. It's a game I've had friends over to play through as it's relatively short and everyone's always has an ""oh shit"" moment at the end. Very worth the sale price on steam and only takes a short sitting to finish."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The first game that ever caught me completely off guard in a whole (not just one mission) was Red Dead Redemption 2, which has been my favorite game for years now. My brother played it first when it came out but didn‚Äôt spoil it for me. I played it because at the time we had a shared Xbox One with not a lot of space and it was one of the few games on there. There are so many twists and turns in that game that I can‚Äôt even begin to summarize all of them. The main one was what really got me. Even after finding out in Saint Denis, I was in denial. I thought >! ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt kill the only playable character in a video game‚Äô !< because I had never even seen that before. But you absolutely can, and they did. I am so heartbroken about it every time I play. It‚Äôs kind of like rewatching Revenge of the Sith and hoping Anakin doesn‚Äôt turn to the dark side.

Also Doki Doki Literature Club. I bought it because I kept seeing how good it was and wanted to see how a dating simulator could be good. I never read the reviews, tags, or summary (which label it as psychological horror) so I had no idea it wasn‚Äôt actually a dating sim. I named my character Phoenix. When I saw Sayori in her room my heart actually dropped. Seeing Yuri in the hallway, hearing Monika talk about it along with everything else that happens. The absolute craziest part for me was when Monika called me by my real name instead of Phoenix. Now I know they just read your computer files, but at the time I hadn‚Äôt built my own computer yet and had no idea that was possible. Probably the best game to go in blind to, but has a lot of violence and other triggering things in it that it‚Äôs not wise to do"

It allows you to buy the game if you're in Russia, but as soon you enter, you get auto banned for being from Russia. Which is... very wrong in gaming communities? I mean sure, we play to get away from actual reality.. the shitty stuff.. I think it's wrong to do this. I think we as gamers should report the game to steam.

Most recently we played through Outer Wilds, Kena: Bridge of Spirits, and Spiritfarer. I feel like I‚Äôve been living under a rock.

It‚Äôs difficult for me not to min-max the hell out of getting all the collectibles and such, but when I actually slowed down and allowed myself to enjoy the story and watch her explore the game worlds organically, it made me realize I dont really play games for wonder or fun anymore. 

That said, these games made me feel like a kid again, especially Kena and Spiritfarer. I would recommend either to someone who just wants to vibe out and slow-play something story-based"

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The deluxe version ups the ante.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,This game is far deeper than many realize
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The melody of for River still plays inside my head occasionaly. That game's pure art.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"God that game is incredible for being made in RPG Maker and easily one of my favorite games of all time. I have some beautiful memories thanks to it!

If you'll allow me to indulge myself... I played the game a decade ago and it just hit me so hard and made me cry a lot. A thematically on point game with a soundtrack that elevated the story. I think To the Moon is one of the best uses of video games as a medium. 

I told my then-gf about it at the time and she was super interested in it. So I gifted her a copy of the game. She played through it and it moved her as well. Then, maybe a few months later in the early stage of our relationship she plays me an in-person rendition of For River, and it was just so incredibly powerful and touching.
 
Fast forward to only a couple months ago and my now wife is walking down the aisle again to For River. It was really beautiful and special.

So, for a game I played over a decade ago and with less than 4 hours of total gameplay time, it's really left its mark on my life in the best ways possible. I really can't recommend it enough. A short game that's left me with a long and deep fondness for both it and games like it."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Finding Paradise was like that for me. Such an emotional roller coaster
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oh boy oh boy, was this game a punch in the gut. Jesus fucking Christ I was bawling my eyes out, hugging a pillow at the end.

The concept is absolute, batshit INSANELY good SciFi. And with such a simple game (did not enjoy the puzzles though, I just wanted to know what happened next)."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I love dredge music so much 

It's probably my favourite ost after Halo.

And I am shit scared of the game"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This^^ I was recommended by a buddy to play it. Beautiful scenery, thought it was a quick 10 hours play but honestly the story/side story missions are great. Such a simple concept that turned out to be very immersive and fun."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Same. People give me the side eye when I call it cozy horror but that‚Äôs really what it is eh
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Check out the YouTube channel Noclip - Video Game Documentaries. Just today they released a documentary in collaboration with the developers! Literally watching it as I read your comment.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,No other game has me wishing for selective memory wipe technology as outer wilds... How can such a cute lil game make you so sad once its over and you know you wont be able to experience again for the first time...
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Haven't completed this. Keep starting and getting lost about what to do. Worth giving another shot then I take it
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Just started the dlc. Shit is fantastic
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Yeah man, just starting out, flying around in space and doing whatever, and then you get hit with the *event.*"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"just floating around and messing with the physics is so much fun, to say nothing of the story and investigation."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Sorry guys. I didn't get all the hype. I've tried it out. Twice. I did explore a bit. Solved some puzzles... but then I just dropped it. It's not for everyone I suppose.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,And then the DLC blows your mind in an entirely new way.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Meant to download The Outer Worlds.  Best mistake I‚Äôve ever made.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This one never clicked with me. I tried it a couple times, couldn‚Äôt really get into it. Eventually I just looked up the rest of the plot or whatever and I just don‚Äôt think the whole thing connected with me at all."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"For the longest time, I thought it was just another ‚Äúcrashed on alien planet, crafting and survival‚Äù game so I avoided it for the longest time thinking it wasn‚Äôt for me. 

I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ it was certainly not that. The good/bad news is because my ass waited so long, I‚Äôve been doing my first play through in VR (SirXexyz has already informed me that the DLC is required for reasons he teases to no end, lol)."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"FUCKING FINE ILL PLAY OUTERWILDS

i haven‚Äôt seen a game hyped up by its dedicated cult fan base to this extent since, like, undertale"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I've tried getting into this game twice, cause I've only heard good things about it, but the controls felt kinda janky, so it never stuck with me. Glad to hear you enjoyed it, though"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,This is a true example of games as an art form.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"That's a great call. I was generally prepared for an interactive story and walking simulator. But I wasn't prepared for the variety of feelings. Delight. Dread. Devastation. Wonderment. Relatability. Appreciation, honestly. Giant Sparrow really knows how to push all the right buttons."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The main character being >!pregnant the whole time!< is what got me. And it‚Äôs not even like the game tries to hide it either, it just doesn‚Äôt outright say anything about it until towards the end. It‚Äôs neat once you know and go back to see all the foreshadowing and the literal >!baby bump!< on Edith."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Also was expecting a short story based game, nothing too crazy and and was in awe at the end of it! Love watching others play it in youtube too, the reactions, the feels"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The bathtub hit me like a tonne of bricks, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I had to take a break after the factory level
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oh, that one surprised me big time. I went in thinking I'd just get some quick achievements/trophies, but I was HOOKED. Amazing game and music. I couldn't put it down until I did everything. That game is also what helped me pay attention to Anapurna Interactive."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Annapurna really has a thing for "".. and then he fake them out to the right and just dropkick them in the face with emotions they didn't expect"". Edith Finch, Outer Wilds, Stray .. 

Someone over there really knows how to pick 'em."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Really feels like the bathtub sequence is what hits you the hardest
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-14,I removed picking that game up because it was free on gamepass and I figured I could blow and hour or two messing around with it. I finished the whole game in one city and stared at my tv screen in complete silence through the entire credits experiencing every emotion at once after finishing it.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-14,One of the best waling simulator games. I wish gone home was the same kind of experience but that game was just a whole lot of nothing. I'm still kinda mad that everyone was praising it to high heavens.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I was actually turned away from it for a while because I thought its popularity leaned on ""hot chick's butt"" without anything meaningful.

I was in for a treat. Also, hot android chick's butt."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Same. Talk about genre bending. I've been gaming since the original fallout on windows 95. Still sits in it's own category in my head. Hands down one of the best games ever made.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Same. I'd never cried at an ending credits sequence before until then.

That game is a complete masterpiece."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Came here to say this. Nier: Automata was a huge surprise for me. I think it's only the second game I've 100% twice, besides Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

I was actually thinking of playing it again recently, which inspired me to watch the Nier: Automata anime."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Same, but still got the cool robot fights tho, amazing gameplay"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever want to play it again, but man, that was a once in a lifetime experience."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Me: ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna tell them.

Commander: Don‚Äôt you dare."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"That was mine. I was not prepared for a certain boss fight early on. That was when I was like O\_O um...what am I playing? It was not what I expected at all lol, but it was great"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I was so bad at that game. I just couldn't win. I'd get close to the cabin and I'd die every time.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Yes and then the lore is crazy too. There's like a subgame to the game
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oh my God I was looking for this response and seeing yours here made me so happy. The game just has so much beautiful narrative. I >!got out of stage 1 in the room with that bright light !< at like 1 in the morning and it was so euphoric, and I almost cried at the end üò≠üò≠"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Lol, isn't it usually the other way round? Subnautica is a thalassophobia superspreader"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,This was my choice as well.  It started out as a rudimentary survival game and then just got bigger and bigger and more awe-inspiring.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I feel this. I don‚Äôt think it cured my fear, but I know now what steps I need to take to lessen the fear. I even found out that taking the basic seascooter accidentally into the edge of the crash zone is NOT one of the ways to make it easier.

Also, I will not go snorkeling. No thank you"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I went into it hearing a lot of hype about how it was secretly a survival horror game and was curious. The starting area kinda threw me...""oh, everything is colorful and there's manatees and stuff. This isn't bad besides the crashfish.""

Then my intuition told me to go check out the Aurora wreck for gear. The horror found me pretty quick."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I played that game the first time on hardcore (1 life) mode without looking at any guides or wikis.


I will never forget that experience, holy crap.¬†"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This is my choice too. I went in expecting some kind of survival game in the water, but the story blew me away. The lack of hand-holding and how the game just let's you figure it out with subtle clues was great."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"My first time playing that game was magical and idk if anything else will match that feeling. Was going through a rough time in my life when I played it. I messed up some easy platforming and lost the player I was exploring with. I didn't realize losing them would affect me so much and I kinda got down on myself thinking ""go figure, I can't even keep up in a video game"". Got near the end of that section and realized the other player waited for me and even came back to find me. I was so touched by that and we ended up finishing the rest of the journey together."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"A few years back I got it in Ps plus and I started playing it. My teenage brain saw there was no gameplay other than walking and said  ""I'll give it 10 minutes and if it's not fun I'll leave it"" ended up playing the whole thing in one sitting. I still remember going up the mountain with another person and seeing them wait for me when I got behind, and all of the sudden, after not paying attention for one moment, they were gone, nowhere to be seen. I felt so alone then."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I play this game once a year since it came out. Right when I wake up on my birthday. In my top5 games to just sit back, wander, and enjoy the journey until the credits roll."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The end scene of act one when each character is shown looking up at the snowstorm. Incredible
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Not sure about 2, and Before the Storm was meh, but you gotta play True Colors."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I finished it last week and yup it was my first thought. I didn't really know anything about the game and just thought it would be some fun little mystery with the tornado and everything. I did not expect things to get so dark, twisted and bleak. I chose >!save Arcadia Bay!< and it's got the most emotional and harrowing ending I've ever played.  I was just crying throughout the whole sequence and it hurts to think about because of how attached I got to the characters.

>!Seeing Chloe get shot for real, all the moments between her and Max that week disappearing and the funeral absolutely broke me. Especially after their final moments at the lighthouse where, in my game, they kissed.!<

>!And then Max can't even talk to anyone about what happened, not even Warren, because even if they believed her, they could never truly understand.!<

>!I'm playing Before The Storm now and it's nice to see Chloe again plus Rachel. Although it makes her death even sadder. I'm looking forward to the bonus farewell episode with Max and Chloe.!<

LiS is definitely in my top 5 gaming experiences of all time."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The fourth episode really fucked me up. Going from starting the episode with >!Chloe being completely paralyzed!< only to end with >!Chloe being killed, AGAIN!< destroyed me."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This is the one for me too, it made me cry. No game, book or movie has ever done that to me before."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,This game taught me a lesson in my late teens I really needed to learn. It was probably the start of my journey to recovery from mental health problems
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The first LiS is unlike any other game that I've ever played. My wife said it's the only game she's ever played that made her feel like she was watching real people, and I can definitely see it. 

I can take or leave the sequels/prequel but the original has a place on my personal top 5"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oof yeah, we've all been there - brutal."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The DLC was solid too, fit perfectly"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Everyone tells me this and says I‚Äôll love it based on other things I like. I‚Äôve been holding out hoping it goes on game pass but it hasn‚Äôt yet.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I still need to  finish this. I played a bit, got really lost on some rock, and... haven't returned to it yet."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Yep... iykyk
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,That rock and roll gunfight through the trippy hallways‚Ä¶ man that was good.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I can't wait for Control 2
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Control is a game I restart from time to time. It is always a pleasure. The gameplay is fun enough to make me comeback but the story and all the documents to read are adding a thick layer of interest to the game.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"There is so much to unpack with that game. Polaris actually being you the player, Jesse and Dylan potentially being the same person, the whole theme of the futility of trying to control the supernatural"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,X Files meet David Lynch meet SCP is my go-to explanation of the game
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"One of my favorites from the last few years.  If you've never read the SCP Wiki before, I highly recommend you do so.
Control was based on the idea of the fictional SCP Foundation.

Enjoy!"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Firewatch did it for me *during its introduction where you have to pick options for your backstory*. I'd recently been through a breakup, and having to choose between two bad options for why your relationship died hit hard."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I saved that game so many times expecting to die around the corner.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Great game. That jump scare when you lose the radio freaked me tf out. I knew from the trailer there would be a mystery but the resolution caught me completely off guard and I had to replay the game to really make peace with it.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I played it in VR and it was amazing üò≠
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I base a lot of the new games I buy off of their similarities to Firewatch. Some that I've found are The Invincible, The Lake and Nobody Wants to Die."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I gotta be honest, man, Firewatch is the most overrated game I've ever played. The dialogue wasn't *that* interesting and I didn't find it to be anywhere as deep as some other people claimed it to be.

I went in expecting some compelling story and got nothing but average conversations. I get that the characters had some shit they were dealing with and we were supposed to empathize with them but there wasn't really anything thought-provoking about this game."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This. Even though the ""Psycho-Horror"" tag kind of implied that something is going to happen,."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"A friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, so I never really looked into it at all. 10/10 going it blind was amazing in the end"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I never got spoiled. Loved that game
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I was especially not ready for the game to dig into my PC's user file and have Monica suddenly pull out my ***real fucking name***!
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I think about this game a lot. The existential horror of being an NPC in a limited simulation. Nothing you can do, even rewriting the rules of your own universe and existence, can ever really put you on the same level as the ""player"" that you've been programmed to ""love"". And to the player it's a disposable dating sim and even if you wanted to stay with her there's really nothing there except to sit in an empty room together at the end of the in game universe.

I dunno man. It makes me sad to think if we ever really crack AGI and it gets put into things like this for our entertainment."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,As an avid anime watcher: dont ever underestimate the power of anime girs!
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,My friend bought me this game told me to read nothing just jump in ....  yeah
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I have hundreds of hours in this small and cheap game. Amazing design and I'm always wishing for sequel
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The sound track still grips me
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,ftl?
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Glad to see this here. Did not expect much, had an absolute blast and wanted to replay immediately. Using the huddle while struggling with a fight and low health and come out of the huddle owning everything felt great. Used it before I nearly died on the last boss, and it actually brought a tear to my eye. One of the few times a gameplay feature actually moved me, the other being Brothers - A tale of two sons."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,... most important question tho: Did you save the space lama?
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"It being released after The Avengers game, really didn't help it much. I had to argue with several people into trying the game out, and still, only one person did."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Just did my 2nd play through of this after doing my 1st last year. Cannot recommend this game highly enough. It requires attention and to buy into the story a bit but man, what a rewarding game.

That last chapter twist too ü´£"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"You sat down with cozy. I sat down to prove time loops couldn‚Äôt work well in a game. 

Never been happier to say I was proven wrong in my entire damned life."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Y'all gonna make me buy it, I keep hearing good things all the time but I read the description and it seems like something I won't get into. ü§£ But I'll add it to my collection"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"the landscape, nature and town is unbelievably beautiful! 

and yes it's sad."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I caught one of the soundtrack songs in a random Spotify playlist and was instantly captivated, would you recommend the game, even if it‚Äôs sad? Or does it leave you with a bad kind of sad?"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,r/fucktedfaro
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Yeah, HZD has one of the best game stories I've ever played."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I've tried starting HZD about 3 times, and just could not get into the world. Something about it just doesn't click with me, even though on paper it's a game that I *should* enjoy immensely"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I played RDR1 on the PS3, so i knew many characters but i bought RDR2 without any knowledge, had enough ""muuneeeh"" left in my Steam wallet, so i just got it. Western is usually also not my genre.

It's actually a great thing for any artist, that includes game devs, when you can get the players aka audience fascinated for a scenario that is not their preferred genre.

Just like when you play music, like people would like to hear rock, but you play jazz... and you do it so fucking good, that the people will cheer and be happy, that's a serious performance and achievement."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,This game is a masterpiece. It's a true work of art that shows what's possible when thousands of people work together on something for 10 years.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-14,"Dutch was a masterpiece.  They really nailed his narcissistic personality disorder.  I mean, you really buy in and think he actually cares about the gang.   Eventually you realize that he's just using everyone.   There never was a plan."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,My 9 year old lives that game. He ignores the grim overtones üòÇüòÇ
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"When I saw KKB did the ~~soundtrack~~ theme song, I knew it was gonna get *weird*."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oh yeah, festive existential body horror and trauma solving."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I fucking love that game. It rewired my brain chemistry and I‚Äôm grateful somehow
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Proving that narrative games still have a place, although niche"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Hold on, just a little while longer...  

Chills!"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This game was great. I very much enjoyed the story, but mostly it was because of the contrasting experiences between my wife and my playthrough.

I played through on the normal difficulty I think, while my wife chose the easier one. And we both finished our playthroughs at around the same time, but we took *very* different paths and had amazingly different outcomes. She basically got a fairly happy ending, everyone lives, etc. While in my playthrough, almost everyone died and the only one who didn't had to survive robot Auschwitz."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Still my favorite interactive movie. Loved my first playthrew
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I went in thinking it was wacky and absurdist and left with 8 aborted draft emails to my ex who hadn't spoken to me in 9 years. Thank god I didn't send any and got drunk instead.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Way too long to find this. Just finished it yesterday. Really satisfying game with interesting mechanics and a good story. Going in blind and failing is the best experience
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Thats one Hell of a game to go into blind! Youre first impression must be that it was just a generic shooter, right?¬†"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Scrolled too far for this
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I really want to play this but it's no longer available to buy :(
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Same. It seemed like just another horror game to me. Oh boy, was I wrong."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This should be up top.  

I went in expecting another minimal combat survival horror and came out ... I believe the term is ""shook"".

That ending.  JFC.  Profound indeed.

This ""game"" is so tough to describe because you have to essentially explain the entire plot to convey what it is."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Was looking for this, had me contemplating life for a bit."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Roboquest was a big surprise for me. The bigger surprise was how much my brother would get into it. I had done a couple roguelites, but he was completely new to the genre. We've been doing 1-2 runs almost every night since December. It's a great co-op game. Plus there's an update coming out tomorrow!"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This, bought portal because of a steam sale, thought it was just a fun little puzzle game, game somehow went beyond that and is one of my favorite games of all time (especially portal 2)."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Nice. It‚Äôs in my backlog for ages but haven‚Äôt had the motivation to start it. I should
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"To be as vague as possible, it's just darker than most people expected. 

The marketing focussed on the cat, and everyone presumed it would be a cutesy, happy lil game. It is, inasmuch as cats and robots are cute, but it definitely has an edge. 

Good game though."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"As was noted by the other responses, the game has a darker theme than just a cute cat exploring a city. 

If you are looking for a more light-hearted game about a cute cat in a city, I'd recommend [Little Kitty, Big City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177980/Little_Kitty_Big_City/)"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,It's kind of the unhappy conclusion of Blade Runner seen through the eyes of a cat.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,It's a neat wee game (not too long and not too difficult. Casual friendly) linear structure with a few open areas sprinkled between to break things up a bit. It's 1 of those games where it's best experienced knowing less about what's going on to add to the immersion. I very highly recommend it
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Without sounding diminishing it is a story driven walking simulator with some light stealth and platforming. Very casual friendly and short. The games narrative jabs at some deeper issues while having lots of character and good animations. Recommend for a lazy Saturday when you need to chill and other games are too much effort.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The cat is very cute, and you get to do a lot of cat stuff. The platforming of being a cat is quite unique, and the only thing that comes a little close to that is Mirror's Edge.

But, to not be too revealing, there is a darkness and fear to the game. What are the robots terrified of? Why does the city appear to be completely dead? What happened before things got to the state they were in? You may learn about some of these if you play your cards right.

Basically the Dead City is also a character in this game."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Blows my mind that you are the only person to mention this gem.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Same! I stayed away for a long time and finally said fuck it I‚Äôll try it. Now, it‚Äôs one of my favorite games ever."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The gradualy harder cursing and brutal executions from the main characters is what made that game for me. Especialy on one of the final chapters (behind the war crimes) and if you melee an enemy he just goe apeshit on him, loved that detail!¬†"

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,went into it blind with friends not expecting much and it has since become my absolute favourite game.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Iron Gate hit the jackpot with that one. From what I‚Äôve heard, they were expecting to sell a few thousand copies. Instead it completely exploded and they sold over 5m in the first week."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I hadn't touched video games since gta on Xbox 360 and this was the first game I picked up to get back into gaming. Was utterly blown away not only by the leaps in technology but the amount of storytelling and narrative in newer games. Probably helped a bit I was on mushrooms when I first tried it but still.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I put a fair bit of time into that. Only finished it once and I had to look up guides to work out where everything was and how to get to places that advanced the plot.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I played the original Destiny on Xbox 360 with my best friend in high school during a time period when he was going through chemo and let me tell you few games hold a special place in my heart like that one.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I like it, but the problem is, it's a real average game. Still, it offers you some freedom, like you can actually betray the scientists from the intro and get him to the enemies when i remember him right."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Celeste is my favorite platformer of all time. Beyond the story, the gameplay is tight, difficult, and rewarding. One of the best games ever made, imo"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The last lines of that game (the main game, not post-credits scene) as the screen fades to black are some of the most heart-wrenching in any medium, not just games. Especially when you think more about the implications of it all."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,I love that game! The soundtrack is beautiful as well!

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Yes it did. I remember feeling like I was violating by being there.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,That was such a different approach to gaming.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Along with outer wilds, I'd add Subnautica to the memory wipe list. The sense of discovery in both games was just fantastic."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"a core design philosophy for this game is that if a place looks barren, it‚Äôs most likely have nothing of interest there. So you dont need to crash land into every surface like you do in dark souls and try to spot POIs"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"My favorite game of all time, but the first time I tried it I played for a little over an hour, didn't understand shit, felt lost and not knowing what to do, thought it was boring af then put it down and didn't touch it for two weeks.

Turns out your only goal (at first) is to explore, just like an archeologist would. That's why the game gives you many things to try and catch your curiosity at the start, such as:

1. The fisherman guy telling about a ""monster"" Gabbro saw at the bottom of Giant's Deep
2. People constantly mentioning Feldspar, the Traveller who disappeared
3. The instrument lady mentioning that you can get to every Traveller by following the sound of their instruments with your signalscope
4. The museum curator asking *you* what you wanna do once you're in space and giving you a bunch of options to answer, instead of telling you what to do
5. The obvious thing that happens 22 minutes after you interact with the statue in the museum

Each one of those is a lead for you to follow. Just pick the one you're more curious about. If you're not curious about any of those, just go explore wherever you feel like it! At some point the game will (hopefully) make you say ""okay, now I NEED to know what happened here"", and you'll be hooked. It worked for me at least, and I was really skeptical if I was going to enjoy this game the second time I picked it up.

Good luck out there, and be curious on your journey."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"This was me exactly! My recommendation: don‚Äôt look anything up. I wish I hadn‚Äôt. Spoiled so much of the experience for me, and hearing people talk about it, I‚Äôm so bummed I won‚Äôt get to experience it for myself.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"That's what got me - survival open world crafting early access yada yada... but it actually got off the ground and fucking *soared*.

I'll admit to a penchant for these types of games (over a hundred hours in Stranded Deep, hi, yeah I'm the problem it's me), so I figured Subnautica would be a good romp through a quick goofy world. What I didn't expect was a relatively polished title with phenomenal animations and an incredibly well-designed world. 

Also, a fully-public Trello board? That's incredible. You could see the whole road map, what feaures/bugs were being worked on, what was in the pipeline for testing, etc. Tour de force on how to do an early-access title properly. Their communication was infrequent, which is normally a problem because the community that grows up around the title will see their feedback as falling on deaf ears, but it didn't matter because their development pipeline was public.

Fuck, I had no idea. Subnautica is the best worst-kept secret in gaming imo, and I'll sing its praises til the end of time. It's definitely still got some jank to it, but only enough that it's endearing rather than a real problem."

Beside open world games, such storytelling games are my favorite type of games like every game from Telltale."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,If you like 1 you should play Before the Storm.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Before the Storm is a bit anticlimactic since it's a prequel, and its big plot beats are the reason the story in the first game exists at all. There's an alternate ending, but the fork isn't until the very end, the game comes right out and *tells* you it's non-canonical and you were supposed to pick the other one, and it's almost as sad. Great fucking game, though."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Not everything has to invoke deep existential thought. Firewatch is great because it gets you invested in the characters and their emotions, combined with simplistic-yet-fun wilderness exploration gameplay and some darker elements. If that doesn't cut it for you, that's entirely fair. But the game is certainly not overrated."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"While I liked and had fun playing it, I agree.
It's held up like some paragon of interactive storytelling, but it's a neat little game with some interesting slice-of-life dialogue. 

I really like it, but it's not the masterfully crafted story with twists and turns, nuanced characters and an epic mystery that so many portray it to be online."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Same here. It was a fun little game, with an incredibly beautiful style, but it fell flat. The game kept hinting that it was going to be deep and philosophical, with a mind melting twist, but it never happened. I was expecting much more. 

Maybe that was the point."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,wait isn‚Äôt the game free on steam?
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Get the multiverse mod and be ready to pour hundreds more on.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,that sound track is one of the best of all time
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Faster Than Light.  An excellent spaceship combat roguelike.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"It's a cold, hateful person that doesn't save Kammy."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"You're either going to love it or hate it. It's a game entirely revolving around *you* wanting to make new discoveries, piecing things together, go out and find places, etc. Nothing is being handfed to you other than some hints or you being observant enough to notice how certain things work. Going in fully blind is absolutely the way to go as the discovery is the bread and butter of the game. I guess you could kinda consider it like a Souls-like storytelling?

If I could erase my memories just to play the game again without knowing anything like the first time I played it, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"For the record, lots of people talk about it making them sad, shedding some tears etc. and I do not resonate with that at all.

It's amazing/incredible/also-my-top-game-of-the-last-decade, but I just thought it was super-cool start-to-finish, a sad moment or two but absolutely not a ""sad game"" imo."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"As a Brit, I think the way they nailed small village aesthetics really helped and possibly contributed to why I was so affected by it, it felt so much more real and tangible."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Oh its a really nice little game, if you like the kind where you are uncovering little stories that build up to a full picture. It's not really depressing (imo)."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"It's a little melancholy, but the scenery is so beautiful and many of the stories are sweet in their own way. Some details may be open to interpretation, and it's implied that the Rapture felt differently for different people. As you would expect, the different types of people viewed it through different lenses. If you were to talk to a scientist, a doctor, a priest, a soldier following orders or a farmer about the biblical rapture, they'd all have something different to say."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,It's like finding a stranger's photos from the past kind of sad.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,It is a great story with HORRIBLE story telling.  You are either playing a game fighting robot animals for loot and experience OR getting this hour long info dump with audio and written exposition explaining EXACTLY what is going on.  I was surprised by the 'twist' because I didn't think it would go that hard.  But then the twist gets beaten into you while you pick up logfile after logfile after logfile.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"It took me awhile to start it because it felt clunky compared to other third person type of shooters. Taking down the robots also took a lot of time which to me felt like a grind. I kept at it though and eventually it became really fun. It took planning to take down the robots and you could do it faster by shooting off their armor or exploding some canisters on their body. You can also lay traps to weaken them first. If you enjoy stealth, you can pick them off one by one too. 

I‚Äôm playing the sequel now on the ps5. The lack of loading time and settings customizations takes it to another level. There is some awe and wonder to see how the game makers created an aged America with little tidbits of stories hidden throughout the land."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Don't know if it was your case, but it's amazing how so many people were wary of a new protagonist at first, believing it impossible for Arthur to live up to John, and then came to eat their words by the end of the game. For me, personally, Arthur Morgan might just be the best protagonist I've ever seen in a game."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"My nephew does the same thing, it's actually pretty impressive that they're able to just completely ignore it haha!"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Definitely it wasn't a game I was expecting to like but I got it for free and was blown away
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"My fiance loves these types of games, she‚Äôs not really a gamer and doesn‚Äôt do well with combat-focused gameplay, but she loves the types of games with decision trees like Detroit.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Yeah! I thought it was just going to be like what people think of when you mention COD to people who don‚Äôt play COD, but it didn‚Äôt take me long to notice things weren‚Äôt quite right that I initially wrote off as glitches until they were impossible to write off.  Then the fucking white phosphorus level came‚Ä¶. Then the twists.   
   
Off course when I was able to reassemble my brain I looked into it to find out there were different endings which I didn‚Äôt hesitate to play through again to get them and see what other weird shit I didn‚Äôt notice.  I almost feel like that first ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù sign was a blatant message along‚Ä¶"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The trailer for it made it look like a generic tough guy military man shooter also which is both a good and a bad thing. It helped with subverting your expectations but I feel that that's also why it flew under the radar so hard when it was first released. A shame honestly.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I think because the game is is from 2012 (12+ years old now), and wasn't a blockbuster.

This is still the game I try to tell everyone about."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Right on üëä
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Did you play The Blind Forest? personally, this one hit me harder. Earlier this year (March-April 2024) I played them back to back with my 5yo son experiencing everything alongside me*. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd slept on both of these for so long. They‚Äôre incredible (story and mechanics) and some of the tightest platforming I‚Äôve ever played. Definitely blind sided by a lot of the feels I was getting, too. At the game‚Äôs climax and end game we both had some tear-stained cheeks. I found it was a special moment for us to share as I wrestled with trying to explain the complexities of everything in the most simple terms (ELHes5). That game is absolutely beautiful. My hope is it made a similar core memory for him as it did me



*his little hands don‚Äôt care for the controller yet so I drove and read everything aloud to keep it moving. and since I didn‚Äôt care about how many times I‚Äôd die getting thru a tight section, I‚Äôd ask him to make the choices of our travel giving him more engagement and buy-in. It was a pretty good system for us"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The narration is dope. ""He had never felt such rage"""
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Yeah, I was expecting Cyber Kitty City Simulator.

>!Not post-apocalyptic stratified robosociety.!<

It's a solid, good game. I still finished it, but I think it's a teeny-bit overhyped because internet and **cat** though."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,That must be good cuz that gameplay trailer is awesome. The animations alone make me want to play through it.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,That sounds pretty cool
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,">the amount of storytelling and narrative in newer games.

It's just CDPR shtick. Their Witcher 3 excels at that as well.

Don't expect rich storyline to pop in all AAA titles, they aren't that far from what they used to be. Story is contextual at most. But there are some outliners beyond CDPR."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,It's also the environment right. The game is very immersive. You can truly get lost in that world. A lot of people don't even fast travel because of how immersive it is.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"power-hungry companies who rule the world, **that one** mission with the prisoner, cyberpsycosis as a whole, the blackwall, ect. ect."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"If you know anything about the nature of Cyberpunk as a genre, then you probably know what you are going to get.

If not, then Cyberpunk is best described as a capitalist hellhole wherein corporations and governments own the very essence of humanity.
They are almost always dystopian and feature themes of depersonalisation, loss of humanity, an invasive technological aspect and nihilism.

It was made as a response to the utopian sci-fi of the early 20th century, with writers like Phillip K. Dick instead focusing on societal collapse or the loss of humanity.
It almost always focuses on the outsiders of society, like those who rebel against the current order or those that refuse to consume the mindless media and/or drugs used to pacify the masses.

If you've seen Blade Runner, you know what to expect from 2077.

So the game is gritty, almost every ending is a downer (with suicide being one of the options) and many quests end badly for at least one character. Characters grapple with loss, legacy (especially with the deuteragonist), who you are and just what to live for.

It's a beautiful game and I love it, but be aware that it contains topics that are hard to discuss for some people."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Cyberpunk itself is very much a critique on modern society and the pitfalls we as the normal rank and file members of society fall into. As a genre that is what it wants to discuss (basically, the perils of late stage capitalism.) Cyberpunk 2077 has a number of missions that engage with various aspects of what that means, very serious and dark topics, in (in my opinion) a very good and respectful way.

Beyond that, the game structure is cool. If you just do the ""main"" missions, you only get a small chunk of the story and limited endings. Doing the secondary missions - letting your V branch out and do things - is where you make your connections, get the rest of the story, make enemies and allies, and unlock additional endings for how you want to solve your core problem.

If you watched Batman Beyond as a kid, one of the main characters in the game is basically Mad Stan. Only, with how cyberpunk presents things he kind of has a point."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I can't wait for their Nivalis game to come out. Though it's a different genre, if it's the same world building it should be phenomenal"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Me and my 2 buddies from work would spend all day talking about it and then go home and play until bedtime.  The game was decent, great even, but that was what made it AMAZING."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I dunno, after putting about ten hours in, it probably ranks in my top 10 CRPGs ever if it keeps this level of quality up.  The opposite of an average game.

Obviously haven't finished the game yet. I'm just extrapolating from what I've seen. The very opening wasn't my thing,but immediately after that it started getting really, really good.

Gunplay feels excellent, story is actually going places, characters are written really well, looks pretty, quests offer a lot of branching paths, does everything really well."

It feels so forced compared to The Stanley Parable, and it stands out like a sore thumb, to me.


The gameplay and the whole game was super nice until that final point, though."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Some quick tips.

Google. Nothing.

Always check your logs for clues and hints.

You're not given an objective, it's pure sandbox. If you're lost, think about the story, what don't you know, what do you want to find out. Go to where you think you'll get the answer.

If you absolutely need to google something go directly to the Subreddit. The Outerwilds sub are experts in subtly nudging you to the answer whilst still putting the onus entirely on you.

I'm not one to gatekeep people who spoil themselves but this game is the exception..Don't spoil yourself."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Go in blind! Look no guides or anything. 100% of the game is open straight after the start and you are free to let your curiosity guide you along!!!
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"i wish i couldve properly played that game, kinda hard to explore when your computer struggles to load whats around you let alone in the distance"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Also - there's hardly any ""useless filler"", just about everything has a purpose for being placed there, telling the story or guiding the player. This I didn't figure out till my second world tour where I essentially went sight seeing, and everywhere I went, I saw things and was like ""ooohhhhhh..... I get it now.... why didn't I see that earlier????"""

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"After playing this game, it really did highlight how badly I skimmed information presented to me, and how strongly I held to my initial assumptions of things. 

Both of those facts really screwed me playing the base game"
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Point 4 is something I noticed has *no* impact on the game whatsoever.

The ""monster"" guides you towards Giant's Deep, searching for Feldspar is a lead, etc.

But asking the player what they want to do provides next to no information to the player, and serves *only* to make them choose their own first line of engagement without thinking about it.

IIRC, that bit with the curator was added because play testers were frustrated by the lack of direction. Safe to say it worked out great."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"The game is meant to be finished, not played indefinitely. You are meant to find broken combos because the enemy isn't playing fair either. It's all part of the genius of this game."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,There are so many really overpowered combos that I feel like it couldn‚Äôt be an oversight. I can think of two combos with the squirrel head statue that turn every round into a win in two hands or less.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,The game desperately wants you to win. Ouroboros is one of like a dozen ways to cheese your way through.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"It is a narrative game. Each act has a card where, once you play enough, will guarantee you to move forward. The point of the game is to experience the game, not to, ""get stuck until you get good."""

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I think it benefits the game. One reason is that most people wouldn‚Äôt even have touched the game if it was really just a ‚Äúcute girls do cute things‚Äù game. Being warned in the beginning just increases curiosity.

Its a puzzlebox, not a sandbox. Sandbox games are like Lego, the point is to see what you do with the pieces and mechanics not necessarily find intended solutions examples: Minecraft (obviously), City/Zoo/etc Simulators, TABS, and Sid Meiers' Pirates. Outer Wilds wants you to solve its puzzles, and each one has a specific solution. You can approach the puzzles in (mostly) any order, but non-linearity in a game is not automatically a sandbox. Zelda 1 is not a sandbox, Collecta-thon platformers are not sandboxes. 

A puzzle box, on the other hand is a collection of interactable pieces that, when manipulated in a specific way, reveal what's inside. That's what outer wilds is."

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Get him on Helldivers 2, see if he's a Bug/Bot sympathiser, or at least picks up on how awful Super Earth actually is.

1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"As the other person said it's unique but from that description I'm inclined to say no. The first and last objevtive you're told to do is ""get the launch codes to the ship platform""

From there, you're an archaeologist. You have a ship log that gives vague clues, you're given a number of planets to explore but where you go, who you speak to and what you find are entirely on your ability to explore, solve puzzles and think linearly, based solely off of your own intrigue to explore and find out about the history of the games lore."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Honestly? No, you probably won‚Äôt. 

The single most important driving factor of the game is your own curiosity. It counts on you to go ‚Äúooo, what‚Äôs that over there?‚Äù And then go explore it. It counts on you to be curious when you find texts, to read all the things and follow the little breadcrumb trails. The onus is entirely on you and that‚Äôs kind of what makes it special to those of us that adore it.

In a universe where you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing or why you‚Äôre there, suddenly and all at once, you understand what you‚Äôre meant to be doing. And then you go do it. 

And then the story is over.

So, no judgement to people who prefer more specific directions and waypoints to guide them and steady progression of levels or skill points in order to enjoy a game, but this one might not appeal to you.

But I‚Äôd still say give it a shot if you can afford to spend money on a game that just might not click with you on the odd chance that you‚Äôll really enjoy it."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"I was convinced I wouldn't like it, since I like linear narrative games a lot. However, I loved this game. 

It has a story, but it's not linear. You can stumble into any part of the story, but it doesn't matter what part you stumble into. Doing so will kind of put you on a track to discover the rest of the story. 

Once in a while, you may be completely lost, but there's a board in your ship that keeps important facts and reminders of things you may want to seek out resulting from those facts."
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,Its 100% unique game. You wont know if you like it without trying.  Everything is unlocked from the start and its up to you to figure shit out by chasing whatever interests you. Definately requires more thinking than your average game.
1er39y7,2024-08-13,2024-08-13,"Some bits that person skipped over. 

One of Dylan's dreams is about how he was actually a girl, and his name was Jesse Dylan Faden. He goes on to say how isnt it funny that both of their names could be a girls or a boys name? Both Jesse and Dylan can be gender neutral. 

Dylan also yells about how Jesse is nothing but a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. 

Theres also the bit that Jesse's favorite author *isn't from the reality she currently lives in*. Thomas Zane - her therapist says he cant find any record of that author existing, which Jesse has no response for. The FBC mentions that Thomas Zane is the writer in the book that Alan Wake writes that in turn writes about him. - confusing bit there, but anyway, Jesse is familiar with an author from another dimension as if she was from there. 

Dylan tells Jesse about how he met and spoke to Mr. Door who is quite obviously Mr. Hatch from Quantum Break. Hatch/Door (notice how the names are synonyms) talks about how he simultaneously exists in every conceivably dimension at once and the existence of other worlds. 

.

I cant properly remember them right now, but there ARE several good counter-arguments to this theory as well which honestly just makes it even more fun waiting for the next game. There is support for both sides of this theory."

15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Make sure to actually spend time doing cat things instead of rushing through the story.

Too meany people just rush through the story and complain it's boring, but if you take your time and actually be a cat, you can meow at people/robots, drop things off shelves, make everyone trip over you and fall, climb to places you're not supposed to be, as well as other cat things.

10/10, would cat again."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"The game looked beautiful, but I found the gameplay kinda boring. I wish there was more to it. Still finished it, but didn't get a huge sense of accomplishment."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Heard you can‚Äôt manually jump, is that true? Cat game where you can‚Äôt jump seems‚Ä¶.wrong."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,I can‚Äôt decide if I wanna play it it not. Kinda sucks to buy a game at that price and it turns out to be boring. My gaming time is limited and I don‚Äôt wanna throw it away
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Isnt it kind of wild that this game went up against God of War and Elden Ring for GOTY? People genuinely voted on this game as GOTY contender.

And dont get me wrong, its not a bad game; but GOTY material?"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,I found it sad that you were only a cat doing cat things only a short while at the start of the game. The rest you're a cat doing human things and for me I think that's such a wrong direction to go for.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,The best part... Meow
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,Tbh I got bored ‚Ä¶ it is a nice game visually . I‚Äôm not a reader for games so that‚Äôs probably what killed it for me
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Honestly, I think that any success this game has had is because of the fact that the protagonist is a cat. That's really all it has going for it. Take out the cat aspect and there isn't really anything here at all"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Boring game play, unfortunately. I really loved being in the world but it was just such boring and stiff game play."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Sometimes I need a break and play a relaxing game after high intensity games, chasing monsters and running from enemies.  

Sounds like a good wind down game.  Thanks for the idea."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"You can't talk about the cat game. The gamers(tm) will swarm because it isn't God of War

I really enjoyed it. The world and level design was lots of fun.

I just really don't understand the fucking dick measuring and vitriol pointed towards this game.

Dudes getting bored have the attention span of a newt. Heaven forbid a game be about story and not murdering people at 15-45 second intervals."

15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Game was very good but felt like a tech demo more than anything else
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,I agree. The game looks gorgeous! It also appears beginner friendly? ü§ûI‚Äôve so badly been wanting to play a game in a cybercity setting so I hope it gets released to Nintendo Switch. I can‚Äôt wait to wander around slowly and soak up the ambiance.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"The novelty wore off quite quickly for me. Loved playing as a kitty, but the gameplay got a bit repetitive."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"In my top 10 games. Take your time and explore the world. Get into the story, it's quite moving what happened to people"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,That looks incredible.  Checking it out.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,I had fun playing it. My partner and I took turns with the sections.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,I loved that game! Don't be afraid to explore and interact with stuff for surprises!
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,Graphics and style are gorgeous however gameplay is kinda sucks
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Hands down one of the most original and beautiful game me and my girlfriend played together, but that sewer part, whew, pretty scary stuff"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"I highly recommend the game. 
There are many people who don't care for it. It's a slow burn game that doesn't have much in the way of gameplay depth. But I think it makes up much more in the atmosphere, setting and the characters you meet along the way. 
It's also quite short."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"it's a nice game

linear sure, but it's story is engaging

good start though, any sort of followup would have to be more interactive, and have more routes to go through"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,I love it. Played it when it first came out. Hope they do another one. Make it longer and add more stuff to do.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Loved this game, it was so beautiful"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,This is a game I really want to play. Thanks for reminding me.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"i bought it so my gf can play it sometime, i want to play it myself but i feel like it would be more fun to wait so she can play it first"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,I loved this game so much! It has such a nice vibe to it.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Love the scenery!! Nice Artwork
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"I mean it's a neat little story, but holy shit it was overrated as all hell. So surprising people thought it was good enough to take GOTY from Elden Ring. Like comparing the tiny little indie cat game to motherfucking Elden Ring feels so strange now."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Beautiful but I found it incredibly boring . I‚Äôm the dumb one who listen to a bunch of reviews written by people all frothed up and half chubbed over a cat
protagonist."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,I love this game so much. I hope they make a sequel.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Wow looks so realistic
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,It really is gorgeous- the colors are amazing! Does this game use RTX? I don't remember
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Looks good.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Overrated game.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Never played can someone tell me if it‚Äôs good or not?
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"I loved this game, but the can‚Äôt catch me trophy almost made me huck my controller through my tv."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"I try like to hell find games my wife would like, this one she absolutely adored. 

Now if they can make a sequel to this and It Takes Two I‚Äôll be set for another couple years!"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,It definitely looked good.  That's the only praise I'd give it.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"The story is okay'ish.

&#x200B;

The gameplay is good, it's fun, but the story went from a cosmic horror to an urban survival simulator to a puzzle game and then stealth game. It was all over the place."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"The game felt very unique and I've had a lot of fun playing it, but I wouldn't exactly say that the story was wonderful or anything like that. To me the story was the weakest part of it. 
It was far too minimalistic to say that it was great."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Stray is probably one of the best games I ever played. I mean the graphics and the storyline is really good, and it's kind of long too."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Remember

Do not the cat"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-22,"Glad I waited to try this for free. Not worth full price, unless you‚Äôre really into cats I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,This sounds like a review a cat would give...ü§®
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"So basically, you don't want us to cat'apult through the game, but instead meow through the game at a cat'asrophically slow pace.  Purrfec... ok."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"I was curious about the game, but you just sold me ... on not playing it. Enjoy, cat lovers."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,Why would anyone do this? It's already boring just reading it.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-22,"I haven‚Äôt played it yet, sadly but surely one day I will!"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,What gameplay? Lol
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,the scripted jumps are the worse part
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"I didn't finish it -- I missed an achievement for a collectible and realized I wouldn't be able to complete it unless I did another run, and the game just wasn't engaging enough to keep on going. Like you say, I wasn't getting a huge sense of accomplishment. If it had a QoL feature to teleport back to previously completed areas I'd have kept playing though."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,Yeah it works like an assassins creed/Batman game kind where you just hold x and it will sort of parkour yourself around the obstacles.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"It does allow the developers to make the jumps look really good and cat-like though. I mean, if you've ever seen a cat jump onto anything, you know that they're incredibly graceful (most of the times). You cant really mimic that same grace if you just let the player jump around willy-nilly."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Depends. The game is visually stunning and the developers really nailed the ""cat feeling"" - you can go and explore, meow, stratch furniture, jump on people's tables and knock stuff down, etc. Half the activities are completely useless most of the time, but it shows somebody took their time actually observing cats. The other great part is the story - or rather the way it is told. The story itself is rather basic and without any major twists, but it is told through interction with your surroundings - there is very little text, only very little cutscenes.

The game is rather short, though, about 8 hours to 100% it, but then again, the gameplay is also rather basic and the game length is about as long as it could hold my attention without getting boring. On the other hand, there is only very little unnecessary padding that would artificially increase the length. Hunting down memories and those 2-3 side quests serves only as an incentive for exploring and didn't felt too forced.

Overall, I do not regret buying it on sale, but if money is the concern here, other games can offer much more content for less. If your main concern is invested time, I say you can't go wrong trying this one."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Wait for a sale. I purchased it on the PS5 for more than 50% off.

I'm going to buy it again for the XSX at full price because I want a Stray 2.

I understand this game isn't for everyone, but this is why we have YouTube. Check it out before you buy. Don't worry about spoilers. The game is pretty much a point-and-click system with an open sandbox design.

I enjoy this linear progression because it prevents the stupid busy work to pad game time too many games have.

While there are a few secrets which can be found, the story is the point of the game, not the play time. Walk around, explore, be a cat.

I do agree $30 is a bit much for an unknown game, which is why I waited for a sale, but depending on your take after playing it will determine if you found value in the game more than $30.

Not many did, and that's fine.

Can't say this game wasn't directed at cat fans, that's for sure."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,the game isnt worth anything more than $8
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"It's definitely boring, stupidly short, and ridiculously overpriced.  It's a great looking game, but that's the only good thing about it."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"If this helps, jumping is scripted. You target your spot, a popup says ""press whatever to jump"" and then you press the corresponding button. This one fact alone made me not buy the game."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"G2A has codes for $15 for PC or PS5. I know people have had issues with them, but I buy from them a lot and so far everything is good."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"It even won indie game of the year in a year when Tunic existed, which was honestly hilarious.  I was laughing my ass off."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"The Game Awards usually likes to put at least one Indie darling in the GOTY nominees with the rest of the big AAA games, even if there‚Äôs almost a zero percent chance of them winning."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Except awesome ambiance, a solid story, and characters I ended up caring about."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Yeah, if you remove the protagonist and interaction system in a game it's almost like it's just settings and dialogue. 

You sound so fucking stupid.

Being a cat is fun, they made a good cat game, they should be celebrated not berated by children tier logic because it wasn't Dark Souls."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Reminds me of people who play j/rpgs, skip all dialogue then call the game boring."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,How old is she? I‚Äôm thinking my 7yo might like this.

15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"THIS is what made me not buy the game.  This was on my insta-buy list but before I did I watched a streamer for a few minutes and saw the scripted jump system. I absolutely LOVE cats and this game looked amazing, but scripted jumping is just not being a cat. So disappointed."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Its almost like they have chapters and a screen that you can choose what chapter to play through. Only reason you would need to do another run is to complete the game in under two hours. 

Just 100% the game like, last week. If you miss anything, use chapter select."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,"Yea I‚Äôm a cat person my whole life, they‚Äôre very graceful. 

I mean, I get that it would be difficult to mimic manually, but not impossible. Just difficult to figure out"
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-22,"Based on the comments I got I won‚Äôt buy it now, maybe wait for a discount like you said. We‚Äôll see! Thanks guys."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"$15 is still way, way too steep.  I'd say the game is worth maybe $5.  I bought it for like $20 a while back and felt ripped off."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Story huh?  Characters you ended up caring about, eh?  You got jokes, for sure.  That's a fact."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,lmao you are getting pretty worked up about your boring cat game.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-20,god you are so fucking dumb.
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"They didn't make a good cat game though, that's the problem.  They made a game where jumping is context sensitive and scripted.  That's fuckin pathetic, full stop."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Like, I loved the concept of a story game from the perspective of a cat and the platforming suddenly works perfectly within the game world. 

I'd like more games of this style. 

I'm not sure what was boring about it..the stories were lovely and the world was vibrant."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Exactly! We never found out if Stray finds their way back to their cat friends...

Also, there were some robots and the fate of humanity, but we all know Lieutenant Cat wouldn't care all that much. Maybe except for B12, but the rest is just a background noise."
15wf4m0,2023-08-20,2023-08-21,"Never even heard of it, but I will now!"

Just the hidden blade is around $125 and the bracer that you have to have to wear it is $80. I think a whole costume like his would total around $800+ maybe. Keep in mind that i haven't looked in a while, so i'm just guessing from memory. Somewhere around there though. Good quality if you have the money though."

K&G sells like, Hillshire farms sandwiches, which are okay -- but they're nowhere near the quality of something out of the QT kitchens on the private label.  Everything they do is good, they're all 24 hours operation and the cleanest facilities I've seen in a gas station/convenience store chain, regardless of location.

Unfortunately, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights were murder from 7pm through about 3am. Iowa City is a full on college party town and the K&G I worked at was the gateway to apartments.

jehaw,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,"That's legit. The K&G brand stuff is kind of eh, and sometimes the product quality can vary. I'm pretty sure the K&Gs are 24 hour stores, but I'm not %100 on that, I know all the ones I worked at and dealt with were. But cleanliness of facilities did tend to be an issue unfortunately...

It's like Fareway and Hy-Vee. For whatever reason, given the choice I go to Hy-Vee because it always seems cleaner. But I love K&G."

I don't believe the managers own the stores, I may be mistaken though. As I understand it Krause Gentle sets up stores where they want to and then populate them with employees."
jehaw,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,"Ah.  I guess it was an assumption based on my perceived lack of uniformity within the design and implementation of the stores.  It seems that almost every QT is almost exactly the same, no matter where you go.  I guess that's just my mind making an ass out of me again =).

Good info.  Cheers mate."
jehaw,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,"It's a pretty fair assumption given the layout varies wildly from store to store. A lot of that has to do with how they obtain stores, often buying abandoned and unused stations and refitting them instead of building new ones. It's cheaper and more efficient. Cheers!"

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,Whew...
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,Why would someone make a game for PC and PS but not xbox. That‚Äôs just asking for piracy. Whatever money they lose from piracy they deserve.

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,I saw a bit if gameplay. At some point it gets quite a lot of fighting against some dark monsters. You meet a professor helping you on your quest and putting some tech on your back.
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,2023
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,the story will be a major factor in the success of the game

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,"No. OP is a legit game nerd. He just likes to talk about games. English is his second language and from his account, he speaks and writes in Arabic. Perhaps he is using online interactions to learn English better. Broken English is common for learners but it just takes a bit more thinking to understand what he is saying."
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,"Eh they've posted on r/Xbox too, and nothing he posted is any different than the usual top posts on this sub. Just a basic question and picture of some game.

Honestly, this whole sub really is kinda just ads in a way. That's why I like it, I get to browse until something grabs my attention or reminds me of a game and next thing I know I'm playing it"
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,Sometimes people just have one thing they feel they can or want to talk about.

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,No! This game has to become a little masterpiece and should be given all its time to achieve that.
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,You should have just reposted this 5 hours ago when you knew your title was bullshit.

Some of my friends in the smaller European countries can get one whenever they want. In other countries it's close to impossible."
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,"I feel bad for thinking they were a bot/shill then, but also, this post implies the game is only on PS (false), and gives the impression the game is out now (also false). So yeah.. I'd like to be more supportive but the content would need to merit it. Thanks for clarifying anyway."
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,So there is a possibility that half the people on here are corporate marketers larping as gamers so they can lowkey advertise or recommend their games to us? Wouldnt be surprised tbh.

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,I might pick up a PS4 if the pre-owned price hits $100-125. It's not worth it for Stray and Detroit for me. Lol. (Not a fan of Spiderman or GoW)
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,I sure hope so

u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,You think you can find those?
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-23,Exclusives and paying for multiplayer are the dumbest fucking things ever and why i hardly play console anymore. I dont pay for games if they are exclusive to one console.
u9jxsn,2022-04-22,2022-04-22,I watch thousands of reviews and all good

patronizing

Your overt politeness comes off as sarcastic and condescending. Don‚Äôt be more polite to people in English than you would in your mother tongue."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"What I‚Äôm about to share is not bragging. It‚Äôs more like a confession.

My game spreadsheet catalogs my collection of roughly 6,000 games. It includes each game‚Äôs title (original and ‚Äúreleased as‚Äù), platform, launcher, original year of release, developer, IGDB‚Äôs critical rating, genre, visual perspective, theme, play mode (single player, co-op, etc), my personal achievements (high score, completion, etc) and the date I achieved it.

Making it, I learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. I think in the end the most important lessons I learned were about myself."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play Kotor 2! (though 1 would be higher on my ratings lol)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Love seeing Outer Wilds with a perfect score, hard agree.

Highly recommend:

-bumping Prey up your play queue. It‚Äôs an absolute banger, and if you enjoyed SOMA‚Äôs philosophical elements, you‚Äôll dig Prey a lot.

-Putting The Forgotten City on the queue instead of ‚Äúeventually.‚Äù It‚Äôs pretty short and sweet and definitely scratched that Outer Wilds itch for me.

-Drop Subnautica Below Zero or put it wayyyy back in the backlog. It was okay but fell way short of the original‚Äôs charm."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Anyone else satisfied that Outer Wilds is 3rd place and Outer Worlds is 3rd from the bottom? Just makes the list look nice and symmetrical.

Im always curious as to why its so disproportionatly loved on reddit as a 10/10 yet ive never actually met anyone who thinks that in person.

I personally have it average rated as a 7.2

4 in gameplay

7 in story telling/pacing

7 in art direction and world design

8 in sound and music

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I would for sure add bioshock 2 to the list of games to play. You can get the trilogy remastered somewhat cheap now and that‚Äôs my favorite games of all time so I recommend hopping to that. Also I‚Äôd play last of us sooner rather then later unless you watched the series. My only addition to your list (which is amazing!) is the borderlands games. Not so much one because it‚Äôs a bit dated and hard to get into but those games are a recipe for fun.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,If Titanfall 2 won't make it into Favorites I will be very disappointed...

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Lovely stuff!
For me, completed story games my fav is Control.
So I was glad to see it so high on your list!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Mate enjoy Prey, it's one of my favourites. I'm sure you will since you ranked Half Life so high."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Dude, I'll be honest, that's pretty cool. I love the play queue, it would probably help me decide what play next."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Keeping a spreadsheet seems so exhausting but so damn useful.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Lol I have the same PlayStation list too, just in my head. Might finally bite the bullet and buy one during the coming holidays. 

Also surprised to see SOMA so high up. I don‚Äôt think I ever got past the last level, the diver guy was too scary  :("
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,What app do you use for this? I'd like to try
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Move these to the top of the TODO list: Witcher 3, Dragon Age Origins, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Bioshock Infinite, Prey, Assassin‚Äôs Creed 2, Chronotrigger, DOOM."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Where is your ""Eh"" to ""Terrible"" list of games?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,My favorite games are your amazing games üôÉ
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No kotor 2?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Do you by chance play EVE? Lmao
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Why though
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I‚Äôve done a similar sheet before. Just a quick heads up:

If you want more ‚Äúobjective‚Äù rankings per se, then you should probably divide games into categories and rate each category accordingly. That way, you‚Äôll get a more complete picture of your favorite game.

Your rating inflation is too high. On a 1-10 scale, if you‚Äôre using the same scale that game reviewers use, then 7.5ish should be the average."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I do the same but a bit different. Mine is all games in one list and then there's a big pie chart with 4 categories: completed, ongoing, not started and unlimited (games that basically don't have an ending like racing, mmo or fighting games). By every game there is a completed date. It's too late now, but i wish i put a started date too so i know how long it took me to complete some games. The list is almost 400 titles now and my goal is to have every single one on ""completed"" by the end of my life. The reason why i started this list is bcs i replayed some games on and on and got bored with gaming. By having this thing, i played through titles that i knew for years but never touched them. There's just something in that green ""completed"" that makes you want to discover what's next."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I DO THIS TOO!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,What's SOMA?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Love the list! But if I may make a small suggestion?  

Do resident evil 2 before 4. Not for story progression or anything, but man oh man it‚Äôll whet your appetite for 4 like you wouldn‚Äôt believe"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Gotta put part 2 alongside the last of us
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"... if you're ranking games out of 10 but using decimal points as well, why not just rank them out of 100? 

(other than that, you've done well if you have managed not to play any games you thought were shit!)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Just wait for forbidden west on pc. It should be arriving at some point next year

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Original Half life is a must if you haven't played it before.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Damn I should do this.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I used to keep a spreadsheet similar to this, then I found out about Playnite. You can import your Steam, Xbox, Switch, and PS games or any custom games and categorize them the same way (i.e., completed, score, not yet completed, want to play). Not 100% sure how you would handle the play queue but I guess you could make that a custom field called ‚ÄúPlay Queue‚Äù and then rank each game (e.g., 10 for Cyberpunk, 9 for Inside, etc.)

It‚Äôs nice because it gives you a visual library since it downloads covers and artwork and also allows you to filter and sort easily. One of my favorite features if I don‚Äôt know what I want to play is to click ‚Äúrandom game‚Äù which essentially picks a random game from your library (you can exclude games you‚Äôve beaten or already played).

Send me a message if you have any questions about Playnite. It took me about a day to set up and I totally abandoned my spreadsheet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Agree with most of those scores but Bioshock at 8.4 is highly suspect. You likely didn't play the title when it first released so I'll let it slide ;)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Bloodborne is at the top of the list of you get a PlayStation. A dude of class
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Add Dying Light to your playlist, its the best game according to me *an expert*"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Fallout 4 rated higher than New Vegas?? HERESY!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It makes me feel so out of touch when I see people with lists of game they've played and it has a ton of different games in it, because I feel like NOTHING gets me excited nowadays.

Last two games I got hyped for were Persona 5 Royal back in October 2022 (and that wasn't even a new game) and Payday 3, which came out recently (but suffers from a lack of update a month after its release).

I envy people who can play very different genres of game and still have fun."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"This is a new one, with only games I mean. 

I often see this but with trophy hunters and completion percentages, difficulty, estimated time, etc. There was a time when one guy on r/trophies posted his spreadsheet and people started popping out of nowhere with their own creations. I swear, every time I opened a thread, it was an ever better one. I‚Äôm talking line graphs, charts, and literally the most confusing shit ever lol.

Good list tho. You definitely have some quality stuff on deck."

Great stats though. I keep my to-do list in a similar fashion and basically try to get a disc in used condition once demand has gone down."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Put the Arkham trilogy on that list.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,It's frustrating me that resident evil 4 is higher on your play list than resident evil 2. I know there are other games between them but that just seems wrong to me.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Definitely don‚Äôt skip then 2018 God of War. The story builds off that foundation and I think it‚Äôs arguably the better game in a lot of ways

Might I recommend Nier Replicant and Automata? My top two favorite games of all time (Automata *then* Replicant). And if you‚Äôre potentially interested in turn based games, I would recommend the Persona series.

All in all though, a great list. People often forget that even 7s are still above average and I think that‚Äôs why some are even a bit upset with the list."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Nice list for sure. Not sure if you want recommendations but Witcher 3 is probably up your alley.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Real Q.  

What metric do you use to rate your games?

Looking at Andromeda with a 7.1, I played it on release and then after several patches and can see maybe a 6.0 

I barely rate on a 1 to 5 scale.

Same style games ish.  

Metroid Dread.  1/5.  Hated the levels and the 1 shot robot zones. The stupid counter mechanic that doesn't work on said robots. (It's randomly timed, yea..)

Hollow Knight 5/5 atmosphere, maneuverability, and customization.   I'd give it 6/5 just for the extra splat noises. 7/5 if Dung Defender showed up throughout the game and yelled NUMA NUMA NUMA at you."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Hades is going to fuck up top of your chart
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Just a recommendation since you have PlayStation on your list if you do get one, I‚Äôd honestly add the entire Metal Gear Solid series to your list of games. The story alone is worth it. 

The legend of Zelda franchise across various games would also be a worthy addition to your spread sheet."

Despite making this whole spreadsheet op clearly doesn't like paperwork"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man if only I understood wtf to do in Outer Wilds
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,some dedication right there son
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list of games that I‚Äôve completed with their difficulty and my hours to complete. Very helpful for wading through a backlog.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,What I am getting from your spreadsheet is KOTOR2 is next on your list to play.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Damn and mine has almost 900 games on it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You are missing out on Sekiro shadow die twice.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I think you should play game franchises back to back. I guess though it depends cause sometimes the games are too similar, but thats what I like to do."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"As someone who also keeps a google doc to track, rank and review all the games I finish, I have never felt so seen by a stranger on the internet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA was a 9.8!?!?

The story was pretty peak tbf, but the ""gameplay"" was kinda garbo.

Except that one puzzle where they spell out to you how the consciousness copying works if you haven't wrapped your head around it yet"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Would recommend putting in life is strange(1, before the storm, true colors)  in the might play section. Those games aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have great stories and characters that can maybe be relatable to you. I don't see spiderman in there either, they are fun games if you like spiderman. The Batman games are must play, people hate on Batman Arkham origins but I'd recommend you play it and Arkham knight. God of war 2018 is brilliant. I love seeing lists like these of people who play games just to enjoy them and maybe walk away with something if not at the very least a good time."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man people really love Outer Wilds don‚Äôt they?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,METAL GEAR SOLID V STILL A MUST PLAY TO THIS DAY
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i am very saddened to see that the metal gear franchise is no where to be seen not even on the pkaystation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,For your own sake move baldurs gate up in the q. I haven‚Äôt been invested in a game like that since Skyrim came out.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I also got a Notion with all my gaming records. I write basically everything, the developer, director, release and beat that, plataform so on so forth. Nerd af"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Tears of the Kingdom and Add spiderman 1 and 2 to the PlayStation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Do you use Howlongtobeat.com? I feel like it works well for this too. I don't even really bother with inputting the completion times, I just use it to keep track of games I played and the make notes about what I liked."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Cool list! I will definitely be checking out your top 3 at some point. Currently thoroughly enjoying my first time through Hollow Knight --> masterpiece IMO along with Elden Ring. There is such an absurd number of extremely great games now, it's hard to keep track, let alone try to play them all. This is a handy way to keep it organized - might do something similar myself."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I wish they'd release Ghost of Tsushima for PC already. It's a sin not to have played it. Ranks up there with RDR2 for me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love this!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Nice! Only thing I would add to that list would be Ff7 remake.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fallout 4 higher than New Vegas? why??? what did you do wrong?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Wanna watch my kids and wife for a few weeks? I have a backlog larger than your played games list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Based on how you've enjoyed the games in that list, the two Ori games will likely break into your top 20."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is cool, I did something similar until I found out about backloggd. You should look into the website, it does have free statistics, ratings, etc."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It just hurts seeing the last of us in the eventuall category

Post again after you beat Titanfall 2's campaign! I wanna see where it places. I NEVER finish sp games, but I beat that game 3x."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Can you elaborate on why Stray is in your top 10? Out of curiosity.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Putting new Vegas that low should be a crime.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Good post, i just finished Forbidden West, you'll love it"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No Dishonored or GTA V? Elden Ring is a favorite, but no Dark Souls?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You rate games very high
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I didn't especially like subnautica below zero. It's a bit dry. (in a non-literal sense)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad you ranked SOMA so high.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Cyberpunk may end up top 5 for you if you‚Äôve never played it. Surely is for me now.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It's cool to see To the Moon on someone's list.  As an autistic man, that game hit HARD.  It left me sobbing."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Feel like if you want to play AW2 you should play control first as you can probably get it much cheaper and it still holds up very well in terms of visuals and gameplay
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you liked cyberpunk before phantom liberty and patch 2.0, youll be blown away by whats new. Its now a great game"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I figured I'd mention that it's ""Baldur's Gate III"", not ""Baulders Gate 3"".  It's possible you don't care, but I figure for someone exacting enough to make a spreadsheet for this sort of thing, you may care about the accuracy of the name."

That final scene with Simon and Catherine on the launch pad was so brutal. Even knowing that Simon was wrong about the coin toss, a little part of me was still hoping he was going to magically appear on the Ark and not his copy."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was about to suggest adding Prey to your list, but I'm glad to see its in there already (assuming its the 2016 Prey). Prey has by far the best level design I've ever seen in any game. the entire game world makes sense from a story and gameplay standpoint. The space station feels lived in, like an actual place that could exist and be run by people and function. And just like real life, there usually isn't just one way to get to somewhere you want to be, and the game gives you tools to bypass locked areas using a bit of thinking and experimenting. 

There's one section where you go into the lab that runs and repairs the 3d screens around the station, and the devs of the game made a 3D color grid test that 100 percent makes sense. Its like the color bar tests used on real life monitors, just pushed into the 3rd dimension. Its a small detail but to me it showcased the amount of effort put into to making a believable environment."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I don't keep Excel I just use google notes on my phone. It's helpful

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Dude i recommend a good app named Stash to track your finished/still in play games
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Please play Chrono Trigger soon, you won't regret it.  

Also, not on your list but Undertale and Night In The Woods are two of my favorite games from the last 10 years.  Just be sure to go in blind to Undertale!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thats a really solid list, its also nice to see that people are able to use 7/10 in a manner befitting of it, i see too many people whining around when a game they like is a 7, dude, 7 is pretty solid."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You might wanna put both Spiderman games in the PS section, cuz they are absolutely amazing"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA is really good, just finished recently. I recommend everyone who loves horror genre."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is a well-kept list, friend! Just a suggestion-- if you enjoyed *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *What Remains of Edith Finch*, add *Everybody's Gone to the Rapture* to your future pile. Think you'd enjoy it quite a bit."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man I‚Äôd love to experience playing Halo again for the first time
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Is the Outer Wilds really *that* good?

I may have to pick it up finally."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love that there is nothing below 'good'.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd move up Origins and Chrono Trigger.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Ghost Recon Wildlands
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Glad to see Soma on your list.

&#x200B;

Soma is an experience I'll never forget.

&#x200B;

Every time it goes on sale on steam for less than five bucks I nab it for a random person on my friends list. Like some sort of Soma Santa."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Kotor 2 isn't worth it. Boom. Just saved you 30 hours

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I gotta say that shit looks beautiful and I wish I can do that for myself and not keep every game I played on a google keep document.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I like that the original Deus Ex is on your list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I thought andromeda top 10 at least
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just use the stash app, it has the best UI out of all of the logging apps and you can open your and others profile on a pc"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yours ""play if I get a playstations"" is the same as mine lol. Luckily Ghost of tsushima and Horizon are rumored to come on PC as of 2024! 

And if I may, I would push up Sekiro (my all time favourite) up a queue."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Phantom Liberty is much better than the original BTW

And I enjoyed CP2077 from the start."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This guy rates games like IGN
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The fact that fallout 3 isnt on here is a crime in itself 

Go play it man !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You should hrs on as well
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Judging by the favourites you are going to enjoy God of War. I would also recommend to play it at least some time with the high difficulty as it is making you to use all in game mechanics, which is great"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Woah, there are some real gems in that queue! Pls also add A Plague Tale series and thank me later"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Don't wait too long on titanfall 2 before the playerbase dwindles again
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Outer Wilds, yeah! Very nice list! Give Deus Ex Mankind Divided a chance. The gameplay and the hub level are very very good. IMO"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Hey, I do too! I make a menu with a 3X3 grid: Fast Track, Laid Back, and Clear Mind, with the categories of play, Desk, Couch, and Portable. Then I have a list of everything else that'll join that selection."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I do the same, I keep track of my finished games with a rating and date finished, all my 100% games, my top 10 and a play eventually list xD:

I did that to reduce my pile of shame of games that I never finished."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bioshock Infinite should be on the top of your list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Baulders
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Cyberpunk being above Half-Life 2 hurts me
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Your top 3 are also my top 3. Outer Wilds is so overlooked

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thimbleweed Park, It will change your life. After that, Monkey Island 1, 2 and 3. After those, the one on your list, Grim Fandango"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Love seeing Far Cry 3 in there. Great story with cool gameplay and deep characters.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just use notion for everything :D
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You haven‚Äôt rated any games below a 7.3?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"To The Moon! üåïüò≠

Games worth playing:

+Black Mesa (Half Life 1 remake)

+Titan Fall 1 & 2

+Space Pirates & Zombies 1 & 2

+Darkest Dungeon 1 & 2 (I have not played the 2nd game yet)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,outer wilds is 10/10? Hmmm might need to get into that then.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I take screenshots, I'll be amazed when i will be older."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I thought I was the only one. Nice catalogue! Mine's ordered by platform(Steam, Epic, Switch, etc). Helped me beat the ""ugghhh what do I play I have too many gaaames"" problem."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I try Stray again? Played maybe 2 hours and wasn‚Äôt gripped at all but a 9.6 is hella high praise
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I clear some of my backlog? Nah I'll just procrastinate and make a lovely spreadsheet
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Great list! You're gonna have a lot of fun.

I have a question though, what constitutes that 0.1 0.2 score differences for you? Cause' I just tend to rank games with a rounded number, the decimals feel like more of a helper for me to rank the games rather than actual scores."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I recommend playing days gone! Its a open world zombie survival game.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yeah portal 1 - 34
Stray-10 not cool"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This chart is epic! Now I know where to keep my list of games instead of having a whole opera island with like 50 cards. Thanks!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd recommend the devil may cry series (besides the 2nd game) honestly most fun i had and being one of my all time favourites. Would start off with dmc3 since that has the best written story and being chronologically the first game in the series, dmc5 has great combat and a great storyline as well but nowhere near dmc3 lvl of storytelling. Overall still an amazing series and a great experience.

(If not, I'd also recommend the gears of war series)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Soma was such a good game that I feel like wasn't spoken about much. The gameplay was kinda meh but the narrative and perspectives were done so nicely.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just as a recommendation, I'd check out Obsidian. It's a powerful note taking app that can let you build a database out of things like this. I'll attach a video of someone doing something similar with movies.

https://youtu.be/t-hKCgGhQuk?si=rdScW0BxcNNo080a

Is it a little more complicated? For sure, but you can do a lot with it in addition to your ratings"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,bro just play fortnite
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad to see Outer Wilds waaaaay up this list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list like this but for what I paid for games. I stopped filling it after a while as you really can't put a price on enjoyment
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"broo Phantom Liberty is must play, especially when you considered the base game a 9.7"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Play the last of us on PS, not on PC."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You can move Horizon Forbidden West to the PC list, its coming out on PC somewhere at the start of 2024. It has a steam page already."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just make categories in my steam library lol

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Move BG3 to the top of your list right now
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Looking at your favorites I would DEFINITELY add Inscryption to that list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Gotta do the witcher 3 mate!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Where Baldurs Gate 3

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thanks for the idea, and I see that you're a person of culture as well (shout out to Mass Effect!)."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Halo is definitely top 5
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd move Deus Ex: Mankind Divided into that queue, it really is a fantastic game.  Looks like you love world building, environmental storytelling, and smooth gameplay and DXMD has all of that and then some.  I'm still amazed when I walk into the bank level and see the level of decoration and detail they just added for fun"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Least basic r/videogames player
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd honestly recommend Far Cry 4 instead of Far Cry 3. They play pretty much identical except I hated every character in Far Cry 3 lol
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I keep a notion database with tags and stats lol. I find it interesting to see on which platform I pay the most games, the percentage of games I finish, etc..."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Horizon forbidden west is supposed to come to pc in I believe q1 of 2024
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You're gonna love The Witcher 3!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Love this!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I would love to see updates every time you finish 2 or 3 games
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,all i learned is you need to play the new gods of war.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Spider-Man 2018 needs to be added
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You're gonna love Phantom Liberty
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Mass Effect Andromeda over Portal? I mean to each their own but I'd love to hear why.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Play Eventually: Modded Starfield hits so fucking hard.

I installed some bug fix mod before I ever made a save file so ill have never played Starfield vanilla."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,is outer wilds that good? Heard so many times its not really worth it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"We have VERY similar taste lol, (main difference is I didn't vibe with skyrim but i just cant stand bethesda gameplay)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just stare at the tittle for a few seconds and think real hard weather it was good or bad from memory

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I keep the games I enjoyed on an external hard drive in case I want to replay them on day. As for the rest, I just go with the flow. If I'm looking for a new game and there's one I'm interested in at the moment, I'll go with it. I find it much better than to stress over ""Oh that looks good but I already have so many games to play, should I add it ? Should I remove others ?"" and other thoughts of that kind."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I use Backloggd for that xd

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play Alien Isolation. Believe me it‚Äòs one of the best horror story games ever created. Especially if you like the Alien universe.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Excellent list. You are doing yourself a disservice by not playing Bioshock Infinite and Dishonored 1&2

I just keep of track wich ones I finished, 

how many do I have in collection, 

physicaly and digitaly and on wich platforms,

some I keep track on wich perepherials I have beaten them like with Move, Lightgun, Steering Wheel, Mouse&K, Gamepad VR etc.

and for some the hours and difficulties I have beaten them, or if I perfected the game on Steam, Gamerscore, PS Platin etc.

Its really fun to keep track what you played and motivates me to beat 1-3 Games a Month, instead as I was a Teenager where I bought 10 Games on Steam, stsrted half of them and finished maybe only one game in 3 Month."

I did and it ruined other games for me, I can't play anything else."

What‚Äôs your criteria/ scoring system?


I‚Äôve been thinking of doing something similar, but when I imagine myself doing it, I could only think if the game is good or bad, so i wanna find a way to rate games besides good or bad"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No offense, but idk why people insist on ranking games. I assume until now this was made just for you, what do the rankings do for you? Idk maybe it‚Äôs a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing because I don‚Äôt really get the various S-F tier charts either. To me it‚Äôs like oh yeah I loved/liked/disliked that game and can talk about the details that made me feel that way but 1-10? Just feels meaningless."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You have enough to play...that is for sure, but if you want something like Detroit become human again (but more Horror) I can highly recommend ""Until Dawn""."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Why do you want to play RE4 before RE2? Surely it would make more sense to play them in order if you intend to play them both, no? Also if you're talking about the remakes don't sleep on RE3. It's not as good as the other two but it's still great if you enjoyed RE2."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Good list. I really wish I played Mass Effect when it was released because I just cannot enjoy the gameplay nowadays as it feels so bad to actually play it. I'm sure back when it released the gameplay was great and obviously it's narrative accolades speak for themselves.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bro really put Stray above Disco Elysium

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"How TF is Mass Effect 3 so high? Or ME2? ME2 is decent, but the main story isn't that good. ME3 is like a 3/10 tho."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Horizon FW and Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves are on PC tho
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You have impeccable taste. What about the shitty games you didn't like?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Bruh, you may as well play titanfall 2 now or in next in line. You'll finish it in 4-5 hours, probably can finish it in one sitting"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"To be fair, when you look at the games that are surrounding it (To the Moon, Papers Please, Gone Home, Portal, KOTOR) I think it's fair to say it's in good company despite being one of the lower scorers :)"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you like Mass Effect my guess is you would love DA: origins, aka the best dragon age game"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Honestly I find Alien Isolation a lot better to look at than to play. It just feels clunky as all hell.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Get a Playstation, best single player games out there. Ghost of tsushima is amazing, last of us and definitely add Spider-Man to that!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,For someone who doesn't have the withcher game complete that's bold...
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You got to play the 3 watch dogs games they are so good in my opinion
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'll say that, in my opinion, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is both better and not as good as Human Revolution. Map/setting wise I think I liked HR more, but gameplay wise MK is an improvement. Even let's you properly beat bosses without killing them! Still absolutely worth checking out as it's a direct continuation of HR.

If you like Deus Ex, you'll definitely love Dishonored. Probably one of my top series by far. Just don't forget the dlc/side games, and consider Deathloop if you like Dishonored. Different setting and not for everyone, but it's very Dishonored-like. 

I also recommend Sekiro, but just know that it is a hard game. You can definitely feel it's made by FromSoft, but it's plays nothing like Elden Ring or other Souls games. Still, I highly recommend it if you can stick it out.

Last, if you don't mind a rhythm oriented game, I HIGHLY recommend Hi-Fi Rush. Came out this year and is personally my Game of the Year (though I haven't played Baldur's Gate or finished ToTK, so that skews things a bit). It's also on Game Pass, so if you get into that, you don't need to pay full price!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Elden ring a story game?

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bro really put games like mass effect and outer wilds above NV and Bioshock

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I need to see this sounds incredible
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,That's so cool to me!! I'm such a big fan of spreadsheets for unusual things! I wanna learn more so I can categorize by genre and see what genres are weighted higher than others to get like an algorithm to suggest games üòÇ
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was thinking about posting mine spreadsheet, because I came with similar idea and kept it updated since 2020, but I don't really want to steal thunder from OP.

Since I'm mostly playing on PS I keep separate sheets for games released on Sony consoles and separate for other platforms (which is abysmal in details compared to PS one). This is mainly due to PS trophy hunting since I'm very invested in it.

My spreadsheet is organized with the following columns:

* sorting nr
* game title
* game series
* dev
* publisher
* PSN / Disc (is physical release available?)
* Ownership (do I own digital or physical copy of game, or F2P)
* HMIWI? (How much I want it? 5-point scale, separate for standard, VR and classic PS1-PS3 games)
* PS PLUS (was it given in PS PLUS)
* PS PLUS EXTRA (is it available in PS PLUS EXTRA)
* PS PLUS PREMIUM (is it available in PS PLUS PREMIUM)
* Hype lvl (only for unreleased games, 3-point scale, low/mid/max)
* Platform (PS 1/2/3/4/5)
* PS5 optimized/improved (only when the game was released both on PS4 & PS5 or received PS5 version at some point, i.e. games have separate entries and trophy lists)
* PS Console Exclusive (Y/N, self-explanatory)
* Currently Playing/Installed (Y/N)
* Owned (Yes/No/available in subscription)
* 100% (Yes/No/Started)
* Percent (trophy completion percent)
* Plat (platinum/100% full completion/unobtainable)
* Plat Diff (taken from trophy guides published either on psnprofiles, powerpyx, PlayStationTrophies or other sites which aggregate guides)
* Plat Time (as above)
* How Difficult I think it was to 100% game? (my plat diff rating)
* Plat diff rating - my own calculation which involves diff & time taken from published trophy guides as well as average percent of trophies & completion from psnprofiles. Results are between 0.55 - 100, where 0.55 indicates game with 1 diff rating which be completed up to 1h and has 100% completion on psnprofiles. New games that have 0%/0% completion and no trophy guide reach rating of \~100 (I round it to 1% to avoid calculation errors).

This effectively helps me to keep track of what to plat next & what to expect from games. Some games are long & easy, some games are short & difficult as well as all the flavors in between.

Rating is spread by centiles & based on calculated difficulty to acquire plat:

0.55-1.29 (i.e., What Remains of Edith Finch (0.89))  
1.30-1.79 (i.e., Bugsnax (1.62)  
1.80-2.29 (i.e., Ghost of Tsushima (1.94))  
2.30-2.79 (i.e., God of War Ragnarok (2.58))  
2.80-3.29 (i.e., Tomb Raider (2.89))  
3.30-3.89 (i.e., Fallout 4 (3.71))  
3.90-4.79 (i.e., Dark Souls III (4.19))  
4.80-5.99 (i.e., The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt (5.63))  
6.00-7.99 (i.e., Red Dead Redemption 2 (7.75))  
8.00-100 (i.e., Deep Rock Galactic (14.58))

Some examples of platinum difficulty calculations from 2023:

Baldur's Gate III: 6.68  
Resident Evil 4 Remake: 3.31  
Diablo IV: 6.60  
Marvel's Spider-Man 2: 1.80  
Dead Space Remake: 2.51  
Alan Wake 2: 2.26  
Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon: 4.07

&#x200B;

* Average Completion on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)
* Plat percent on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)
* score sorting nr
* Rating - Legendary (>90), Mighty (84-89), Strong (75-83), Fair (66-74), Weak (60-65), Awful (50-59), Trash (<50)
* Weighted Score - calculated from OpenCritic score (45), OpenCritic recommended (20), Metaritic Score (35) & my review/score (80, only for games I have at least 1 trophy in).
* OpenCritic Top Critics rating
* OpenCritic Recommended percent.
* MetaCritic rating
* My Review/my rating
* Release Date
* Borrowed (who did i borrowed my physical copy to)

So far, my library has more than 3000 entries of released games on PlayStation systems & I'm tracking 340 games that have been announced.

It also helps me to keep track of what I own, since thanks to it I know that I :

* own 481 PS games (60 physical / 421 digital)
* have access to additonal 675 games through subscriptions"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer Wilds and Cross Code are my two ""off the beaten path"" favorites lately"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I'm playing the DLC right now. The base game is amazing. The DLC is amazing as well.

Landing on the sun station, most frustrating thing ive experienced in a long while until I learned how a trick through trial and error."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I really liked that game but I got stuck like 3 hours in and never went back. I really need to get back to it to finish the story!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,i am still mourning the fact i can never play it again :(
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"How do you know somebody is an Outer Wilds fan? Coz they‚Äôll tell you!

Just kidding I love it, it‚Äôs the most creative thing I‚Äôve played for a long time - but it‚Äôs difficult to get my mates to play it without giving anything away!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No fucking way.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"And GoW Ragnarok will follow. Then Spider-Man 2. Eventually FFXVI.

In other words, if you don't usually play Sony exclusives at launch, they'll be on PC eventually."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,This gives me hope that we will see Spider-Man 2 in two years on PC
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Have a blast, by far my favorite game!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Go in blind, but know this.

If you‚Äôre stuck somewhere, **go somewhere else**. The game never expects you to brute force anything. There‚Äôs an easy way to do everything. All information you need to proceed is given at least three different ways in three different locations."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Godspeed. I wish I could wipe that part of my brain and experience all over again.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play the DLC if you have not
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fantastic game. It was difficult for me to complete the game because of thalassophobia but for people without that fear. Blind is 100% the way to go.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,*KotOR* is definitely in my favorites. It can't not be.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,KOTOR is a 10 for me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I feel that comparing Forgotten City to Outer Wilds just sets it up to be a disappointment. It's a fun mystery, but imo it's nowhere near as satisfying as Outer Wilds"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Played it years a go and still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. Banger.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It holds a special place in my heart. It‚Äôs one of very few games that had me dwelling on its story for weeks.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you like Chrono Trigger, you should check out Sea of Stars. It's a pure love letter to the SNES era RPGs. I'm about halfway through and I love it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Beat every campaign on legendary a couple months ago  for the first time ever in about a month I think I‚Äôm ready for a replay lol, of the first three that is. Excellent series"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"

For some reason as a kid, I played portal 2 and skipped 1 but years later I went back to 1 and it just felt underwhelming compared to the scale of 2. Definitely a great game, but unfortunately I ended up mostly comparing it to 2"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Then he should check out system shock after that since he loves bioshock also
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd recommend black mesa tbh hl1 looks a little rough these days.  hl2 is still decent though.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Its one of those games. A game I wish I could forget so that I could experience it again for the first time.

It starts slow but its very worth it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I do think I'll play those ones eventually!! I kept the Playstation list on the shorter side for the ones the REALLY excite me but the spiderman games do look pretty cool too!! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It looks really good!!! It's in early access so I'm waiting to see if a bunch more content comes out before I start it :)

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Tbh the first time I played, the flight controls and the wonkiness of walking around on Giant's Deep made me quit an hour in. I questioned all the praise it would get on here and eventually gave it another shot before it finally clicked!  
My favorite part of the game is how thought out and intricate the solar system and it's physics really were! I really appreciate how unique each planet is and how it's dynamics worked perfectly with the time loop. I love mysteries so finding out stuff along the way that I literally couldve done at any point with the tools I've had the whole time to solve the final puzzle within 30 minutes. When things finally started clicking and made me feel like a genius, it just made me appreciate how well thought out every single bit of the game and design really was. I had genuine curiosity to find out what happened to the Nomai and figure out the unique physics of each of the planets that I've found so hard to match by another game! And the way music plays into the game, the soundtrack as a whole, and the epicness of score of the final mission was amazing! All leading up to the ending which I felt was super well done, invoking some sort of existential feeling thats hard to explain.  
I cant fault you for hating the gameplay though, since I felt it too when I first played/quit ahahah. Im just so lucky it finally clicked for me, which, if it doesnt happen for you and the physics/story dont connect to you thats okay too!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The ambience/color scheme in that game was unlike anything I've played and sooo cool!! I really wanted to meet the girl in the end though Ill admit LOL  
The section where you feel like you are being watched is so unforgettable though!

Will def check out the Hellblade game !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It definitely is a slow burn! For me a lot of the fun was actually just vibing! Going around and robbing people/enjoying the scenery/hunting/finding a new area/random encounters was such a vibe during the pandemic for me and spending time getting to know the crew and hanging around camp made the big moments/twists in the late game super hard hitting - and the end emotional!!
I do get the criticism I see a lot that it feels like a chore with certain aspects, so I do feel like it gets better if you start to get attached to the characters but can deff take awhile to get there"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The game gets a little bit better until you get to the end of chapter 3, then it gets exponentially better. There's a pretty lengthy compilation of streamers at the beginning of the game talking about how boring it is and then by the end of the game they're, let's just say ""all in."""
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No, it doesn't."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,"I'm not a RDR2 fanboy, it get's a little better but not by much, it stays extremely slow and scripted in missions, the World opens up a bit more to do some side activities but they are not rewarding or anything, just flavor."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The story has 6 chapters, and an epilogue. 50% of the story is told in 4.5 chapters, the other 50% only in 1.5 chapters. However, before some people disagree with me, until reaching that point where the story escalates and you go doing mission after mission, there are plenty of things to do in the open world. Rockstar gives the player the freedom of exploring a full and lively open world, compensating for the linearness of the main missions. Game offers amazing views, from big cities to creepy swamps; vast grasslands to challenging mountainous paths; livestock towns to deserts and much more. The prologue, or the first chapter to be more clear, is very slow. The 2nd and 3rd chapters are where you should engage with the open world the most, to hunt, to play games, to interact with npcs, events etc. From the middle of ch. 4 and onward is a downhill for the story, it becomes quite gripping and may even be hard to follow. But it is definitely a game that has a lot to offer, an incredible detailed world and characters that feel ""real""."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,With how much hype it's getting online in SUPER pumped to be able to give it a move up from the queue üëÄ
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Story wise those 2 deff have Stray beat, I really don't know what it is about Stray but I was just so engulfed in that world! Visuals aren't everything but I also think that game was one of the most gorgeous ones I've ever played with the neon lights and reflections (I also loved the aesthetic of the greenery/nature combining with the cyberpunk). I also loved exploring the civilization of robot people and learning about them! It just holds a special place in my heart!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I read somewhere that they can be played out of order and everyone keeps hyping up 4 to the point I shot it up a bunch out of excitement LOL but if it's better to play then in order maybe I should contain myself and wait ahahah

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Prey and Phantom Liberty are superior.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I read somewhere that sekiro is harder so part of me is just low-key scared I won't progress LOL, I barely beat elden beast by the skin of my teeth. I do really wanna try it though!!

& A buddy of mine told me Ragnarok hits better if you play them back to back so I'm half waiting to see when it's coming to PC and half waiting to see if I'll get a PlayStation. But I fully expect God of war gamea to be 9s or 10s üôè"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Yeah for sure!! I'll DM you a copy when I get home from work! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer worlds was deff not the most fun for me, just pretty visuals üòÇ
I will say KOTOR is deff a good game I can see why people love, but I had the twist spoiled for me and am not huge on the combat system so it didn't go super high, but I think if the twist was a full surprise it would've been up a few slots on my personal enjoyment scale! Great characters for sure though"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,LOL tbf the bigger one isn't in order just the shorter queue!! I feel like I would be in more of a rush to play it if I hadn't already watched the entire game on YouTube üòÇ But I do fully plan on playing it myself some day!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Both incredible games!! But ranked on enjoyment, I had to give Skyrim the edge partially due to nostalgia and being my first RPG! I remember watching it on YouTube as a kid and finally buying it with my own money. Such a special place in my heart!!"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,For the longest time I had New Vegas higher but recently thought back to each game and how much fun I had & moved fallout 4 up. I really liked how New Vegas had a ton more groups to interact with but I think I just personally enjoyed fallout 4 more due to the combat/vibe/and exploration more. Part of it is also that I live in Boston and it was kinda crazy how accurate some of the areas were üòÇ so it was cool exploring and fighting on streets I've been on before. I also loved the story and i filtrating the institute
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I have a fiance üòÇüòÇ I know when we get married next year I won't be gaming much so trying to get through my catalog ahahaba

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Luckily I actually haven't played a game id consider bad yet !! 
I rank based on soo many things but mainly: how much fun am I having? (Does it feel like a chore to do certain parts?) How much am I connecting to this game/how engulfed into this world am I? (Am I craving exploring and finding more? How much do I wanna go home and play this game?) And stuff like soundtrack/gameplay/graphics/atmosphere/story/ending factor in too !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,My memory is kinda bad so sometimes I just like reading back what games I've played and it helps me remember my favorite ones!! Like I look at certain titles and just reminisce what parts I adored. Mostly a time killer during lunch breaks though :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Those ones are ones im considering moving up to the queue once I get through the current ones! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thank you my friend!!
I've actually not had a game I didn't like so far luckily!! If I had one below a 7 id probably just drop it though üòÇ I mostly avoid games I know I wouldn't like too"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Ahaha I'm sorry!! The combat wasn't my favorite and the twist got spoiled for me so it took a bit of a hit for my enjoyment scale :( Still incredible characters that deserved a slot in the Great section !

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You'll love Titanfall 2's campaign. It's relatively short but is still one of the greatest FPS campaigns I've played.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bro left us hanging just like that
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"A lot of it comes from the itch.io racial justice bundle, a few years of Epic giveaways, retro games from various compilations and packs, a few different subscriptions, and all of the games I‚Äôve accumulated physically or digitally over the years.

The spreadsheet has been great for the bundles and compilations, which is where I tend to get lost. That itch.io bundle alone is full of hidden gems."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Impressive!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Glad to see another Crosscode enjoyer. Hella unknown game

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Some people may have already died waiting Bloodborne to coming PC lol. The game released in 2015 when I'm in high school and now I'm employed
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It‚Äôd be great if they‚Äôd hurry up and bring Ghosts to pc

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"If you have RDR2, Skyrim and Cyberpunk in there then Witcher 3 should be a no brainer. Make sure you get the version with the 2 DLCs as it's practically an extra game."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I grew up playing so much Minecraft but didn't feel like it had enough of a story to rank it compared to such different types of games. But with how influential it's been on my life, it would be top 3 if I had to rank it!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You're correct, even story wise I prefer Stray too. Just an awesome game from start to finish"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Really depends on the person. I found sekiro to be easier than elden ring. It is faster but parry focused and more aggressive. The lack of equipment and stat leveling means you don‚Äôt have to worry about having a bad build but you also won‚Äôt be able to overlevel to beat a hard boss. Imo it‚Äôs more satisfying that way so i prefer sekiro‚Äôs combat but both are great games.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Favorite soundtrack? Mine is between NKG and Greenpath.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I struggle giving things low scores (and the ones I REALLY hate I just don't finish so I can't rank) but agree that outer worlds felt p bland, esp coming off of the crew from mass effect. The graphics in that game are one of the compliments I can give it tho, the world's had some super pretty colors!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's fair enough! Did you play it years after it came out? When it was first released it was absolutely amazing, the graphics haven't held up well over time."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Do you file them alphabetically. Like D for doughnut.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You keep them!?

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"All of this most likely wouldn't happened if only a small portion of sonic fanbase just STFU and not being totally a dick. They had the higher ground, genshin fanbase don't give a shit about the award. But some assholes in sonic fanbase decided being radical for no reason to genshin community. Now the damage has been done, nothing but salt and disappointment. While I'm enjoying freemogems although it's kinda worth whatever."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Are we really that surprised? It‚Äôs a F2P game with more downloads than the rest combined.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin impact really isnt a bad game. the only concerning thing would be their buisness model. where if you're vulnerable to such things you can easily spend much more than reasonable.  


you can play the game for free no problem though I've spent like 6 euros on it an had a ton of fun and definitely got my moneys worth of entertainment. updates over the past year have also been significant. Graphics are amazing if you're into the Ghibli/anime aesthetic. exploration is well done and encouraged by scattering interesting sights and treasures all over. and while the combat mechanics might not be for everyone, they're not simplistic.  


and you can't beat the price of free to play  (provided you're not suspectible to overspending on micro transactions)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a Genshin fan I am happy we won, but if people didn't bot for Sonic, it actually would have been pretty close. But IMO Genshin doesn't compare to Elden Ring or God Of War Ragnarok in the slightest. It's like a match to a candle. But alls well that ends well I suppose."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,BAHAHAHAHA
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Is there a criteria for games being allowed in the categories? Genshin didn't even come out this year. Where is my Ocarina of Time choice?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Am I the only one who feels like Sifu got snubbed last night?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09," Never even heard of sonic frontiers. regardless of any sort of drama, there's no way genshin would lose in a popularity vote."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic toxic and racist fans triggered the wrong fanbase(especially Asian Genshin fans),karma. Anyway the game is good and fun,it not deserve all this hate honestly...i voted because i like the game and because Sumeru is amazing,i appreciate the 800 primogems(gift for TGA nominations,not for player voice) but i didn't voted for that."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Did Stray win anything?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As much as I love playing the Sonic games as a child I was actually expecting GOWR to win tbh. Sonic Frontiers feels (to me at least) nostalgic from the characters to the open world but that is just it, nostalgic. The story to me was meh. Also as an old sonic fan, I'm sorry that you have to deal with the toxic side of the community. 

Sidenote: While I do enjoy the Sonic Movies, Arcane and  Edgerunners is just a whole other level of storytelling and visuals. I will be very surprised if they win."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Does this mean we can finally drop this topic and move on with our lives? Even as someone who wanted Sonic to win watching all of this toxicity hurt.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Sonic fans in shambles
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,So whoever has a larger player base wins? What a great category.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Genshin is a great game. Congrats
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Man fuck these weirdo Sonic fans making the rest of us look bad. I just wanted to see the little blue homie win for once but seeing those racist remarks towards Chinese people genuinely pissed me off. Now us normal Sonic fans have to get lumped with these toxic assholes and get treated as a joke.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic Frontiers was so half-assed that I‚Äôm glad it lost. If Sega wants an award, they should start pumping out actual masterpieces instead of technically incompetent games with cringe-tier writing."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I feel like it‚Äôs weird that genshin won out of all of them but it‚Äôs also a free to play game on both pc and mobile so still not surprising
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"All sonic fans had to do was hype Frontiers up by itself, **without** mentioning Genshin and angering the entirety of China. The game was already well received and I‚Äôm still seeing a decent amount of posts on social media about it so there was no reason to start this fight to garner attention."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Does Genship Impact even have an ending yet?

I've heard it was pretty good, but I'm not at all excited about starting a game, and they've only got like some of the story prepared for me, and I need to reboot the game years from now to continue."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah I think I'll stay away from Twitter for a few days after this. Let things simmer down.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,People really like to downplay how popular Genshin is.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,As a old genshin and sonic fan both... I can explain in great detail how it feels to be pulled apart in two directions
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Scrolled through about 100 comments and it‚Äôs genuinely frightening to see how one-sided this discussion is.

If you‚Äôre gunning for Frontiers, you get downvoted, if you support GI, you get upvoted. No exceptions.

(Edit: This comment is apparently an exception. Go figure.)

(I doubt this comment will produce any upvotes, but I‚Äôm tired of trying to ignore all of this, so here I go.)

**I think Frontiers had every right to get as far as it did.**

I‚Äôm not necessarily upset that it lost, but rather that people are celebrating its loss. Of course, I get it, racists need to be punished, and I completely agree.

However, not every Sonic fan is a racist. Far from it.

For 99% of the Sonic fanbase, winning this award isn‚Äôt about beating GI. As far as they‚Äôre concerned, *GI isn‚Äôt even in the equation*.

Reason 1: **Sonic Frontiers was snubbed out of Best Soundtrack.**

You can hate on Frontiers and Sonic all you want, but the undeniable truth here is that Sonic‚Äôs music is almost always top-tier stuff. And Frontiers is no exception. The common belief here is that it should have been nominated at the very least, and so the fans feel robbed of a nomination. Hence, they voted in Player‚Äôs Voice to make up for it.

Reason 2: **Sonic fans want to convey to SEGA/Sonic Team that they have a good formula on their hands.**

Over the last two decades, SEGA/Sonic Team (or SST for short) have been too quick to change or add mechanics to a Sonic game. The whole reason behind their divisiveness is due to this constant experimentation, which stunts an IP‚Äôs ability to maintain an identity. Sonic fans voted in Player‚Äôs Voice to tell SST that this is a really good foundation and that they shouldn‚Äôt ditch it.

Thankfully, SST got the message despite not winning Player‚Äôs Voice, so no harm from it.

Either way, the VAST majority of the fanbase don‚Äôt actually care about GI, which is why you see most of them ask why it‚Äôs even nominated (since it‚Äôs from 2020).

For all the Sonic fans reading this, I‚Äôd like you to know there was a very prominent Sonic YouTuber who told his fans to vote against Frontiers out of spite. Do with that what you will."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Do cat sounds count as voice acting
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,How much free rolls did they get for this ?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Not even rigged
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Award shows are stupid.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Is there not a mega thread for this show? Or we just going to post 1000 posts on it?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,WHAT STRAY DOESN'T WIN????
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Chinese gaming community is among most aggressive ones. Once I've made a mistake and tried to play another Chinese game. It was bad and I shared my thoughts through Steam. There was a guy who traced EVERY SINGLE negative review and in aggressive way answered them by any means necessary.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"AS a reformed rabbi myself, I‚Äôm gonna have to say Bill Clinton deserved that Category"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Are games like Genshin Impact available to win this every year? I ask because it came out in 2020.  If it keeps updating then I don't see why it would for 2023, 2024, 2025...

Imagine a single game being voted Players Voice for something absurd like ten years running.  I'd think they'd have to say ""you cannot win this award multiple times as the same game"" or I could see this scenario playing out."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The malding
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why was it even an option?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Tbh stray should‚Äôve won. -A genshin player
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,All the sonic fans had to do was keep their mouths shut. But nooooo they decided to antagonise a player base with over 30 million people!
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, but Elden Ring is GOTY"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,So a game doesn't have to be released the year of the awards to be nominated?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I feel like most people that shit on genshin have never played it. I for one thought it was completely different than how it is, i thought it was some multiplayer p2w game. It's actually a single player game, with while there is gacha elements, you can have a blast with the game without any gacha. It's single-player, nobodys forcing you to buy anything"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Well.... sonic fans fucked around and found out.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The game awards have truly turned into the academy awards
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,never underestimate what spite can achieve
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Honestly fuck you all for not voting elden ring lmao
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"how in the what?

&#x200B;

kitty cat game should of won"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,At least they were given a chance lmao. Saw the game trailer for sonic and the voice acting is so horrible
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Huh
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,No comment
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Watched the awards in IMAX half the theatre lost their mind Sonic lost.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"God of war took majority of the awards,  lol.    And majority of the time of the award show..."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, they are pretty solid for that, I do think so‚Ä¶ even if the game itself is kinda disappointing, and the gacha is absolute hell."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"All just to spite those sonic cunts (only the ones being assholes on twitter, not the actual fans), I love it. Kinda sad the catto game, and Elden Ring didnt get chosen for this though."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What is players voice
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Based
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Gotta love Wanderer
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Sonic fans were too toxic and Genshin is a 2020 game so it shouldn‚Äôt had been here next to 2022 games but they won anyways so can‚Äôt complain
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Im honestly not mad, genshin may have some questionable fan base sometime but cast that aside and the game is pretty good looking, and I saw some of the boss music and I gotta say it‚Äôs really good, not my favorite game but I do play sometime when my friend want to show me something"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Oh no! Anyway‚Ä¶
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,im just happy anything else but sonic won after watching all the neckbeards REEEEEEEE
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,We did it! Genshin won
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been able to scroll to the downvoted comments so fast
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,thanks to this now i know sonic fans are more toxic than genshin
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Not surprising consider the active playerbase of genshin is 600 times more than the total amount of sonic games sold.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What a Motherfucker will do for allegedly 1600 primogems
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Of course it did.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"So between MiHoYo buying votes, a weirdly racist sanic fan pissing off a massive demographic of Genshin fans and causing a spite vote, and it being pretty evident that sanic fans were botting...is anyone taking this shit seriously?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,You shitting me god of war or Elden ring didint win this one
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"This makes me happy, I love sonic and genshin but considering how toxic and racist the sonic voters were, plus going as far as using bots to vote, they didn't deserve to win"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I‚Äôm sorry but elden ring should have won player voice not genshin.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Not surprised.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,BeryL approves this post.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Some of the awards given really surprised me. Some great games didn't even get mentioned
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"How many of these votes were out of spite of what Sonic voters did?

Can we not vote out of spite, pls (Same goes for Sonic votes, btw)? It's still very likely that Genshin would've won anyway but this doesn't feel valid at all.

After hearing of this nonsense I hoped neither of both games would win. The ""Players Voice"" Award felt like ""Who can gather more votes to tell the other faction to sit down"".. That's not what this should be about, imo. I don't care about sweet revenge.

Congratz nonetheless, tho."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,wtf is genshin impact
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Hey, at least it wasn‚Äôt GoW. Mofo‚Äôs won half the awards but still lost GotY lol."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Neither sonic, nor genshin should have won."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Minecraft should have won players voice
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Well that‚Äôs some bullshit, especially considering the game came out two years ago and shouldn‚Äôt have even been considered for any category."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Genshin who?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I an a Sonic fan and I did vote for Frontiers and I am a little disappointed that it didn't win but I do congratulate the Genshin Impact fans (even though the game sucks please dont hurt me).
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Well, it's not my personal choice, but I'm glad the bots didn't dictate the outcome"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic fans underestimated GI player base and provoked them unnecessarily. They could've had this on the bag, they fumbled. Y'all were right about the Chinese community coming together but people also have to understand that outside Japan, Sonic isn't as popular these days on Asia. Especially the Southeast Asian region. Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand etc., all have HUGE Genshin player/fan base because it's F2P and suits their tastes more. The accusations by the Sonic fans were so absurd lol."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Well, it's deserved. 

I played it for a while, not my thing, but my young siblings (14\~20yo) play it frequently with friends over Discord and I see them having fun and taking part on a consistent community. 

The other games communities are a little individual due to the single player nature. I would vote for Elden Ring myself but I didn't feel compelled to vote, maybe if I played Genshin Impact and hanged around on some Discord server I would maybe feel compelled and encouraged to vote. 

TDLR: Regardless of your taste, it's well deserved."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Still feel elden ring should have won but it let itself down with the lack of content since release :/
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Wtf does the players voice even mean? Like that one time when people were sending death threads via Twitter to Kokomis VA because she wasn't meta? Kinda cringe this particular award
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,At least it's not sonic frontiers
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Wait, how are these games picked for nomination? Isn't Genshin like 2 years old now?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I don‚Äôt respect Genshin Impact or it‚Äôs fans but yikes the toxicity was enough to make me stop caring all together. It was the player‚Äôs choice and the majority of the players chose that game, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Gaming awards.  Stupid on every level.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Game about gambling your money away won players voice? Seriously, why are gacha games even legal?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Idc who won this at all, but genshin is cringe af"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't get how genshin impact won the voice category (probably because I never played it). Elden Ring and GoW Ragnar√∂k voices were top notch
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why was Genshin even nominated in the first place? It didn't even release this year.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Of course it did. Cause Keith Silverstein was part of the VAs
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Okay someone fill me in. What does this mean for Sonic? What the fuck is this a big deal for?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's the only free to play game on the list so I guess it makes sense.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why? Either Elden Ring or God Of War had far better
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Makes sense. One's a free live action gacha game that's already been running for years and had plenty of time to build up a devoted playerbase while the others are one-and-done games.

Now if GI had straight up won Game of the Year, I'd have called bullshit."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09, I was  hope god of war would win
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I lost a reason to put 2020 game in 2022 nomination:/
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I'm happy Sonic Frontiers at least got to the top 5! Sure it was a complete shitshow on the internet with toxicity on all sides and people being buffoons but then again when is that NOT the case on the internet? I was happy to see lots of support for Sonic Frontiers and even though it didn't win, a silver ain't too bad either."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Neither Sonic nor Genshin deserved it. Sonic especially is a 6.5 at best. It‚Äôs only a 9 compared to previous Sonic games.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Well deserved.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why was genshin part of the game awards for 2022? It released in 2020.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Isn't the whole point of the ""Game Awards"" to be about games that released this year? How the fuck did Genshin get on that list?!?"

It's such a shame because of the gacha mechanics it's a 0/10 imo when it could easily have been a 10."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic the Hedgehog was a famous, aggressively marketed and advertised first-party console mascot from the early-to-mid 90's who used to compete with another iconic video game character, Mario.  And he *still* couldn't beat a recent newcomer like Genshin Impact.  Which really demonstrates how, even with Sonic Frontiers getting praise from audiences, if not critics, it's just too little, too late for Sonic the Hedgehog, after so many terrible games in a row."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The one thing I don't get about Genshin is didn't it come out in 2020?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,cool a game from years ago won this year's awards. good thing these really don't mean much.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Booooo!!

-a weeb"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Bull.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Question though. Why was Genshin in a category with games that came out all last year? Seems unfair to pitch a game that's built its fanbase for years against them
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,why is that game popular? someone help me. being serious
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I heard genshin bribed players saying if they won everyone got in game currency
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Sonic fans gave their lives for this battle
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What is a genshin impact?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a sonic fan that wasn't really into the bad mindset of this, I was yes angry that genshin was kinda winning, after all, we waited so long for a good sonic game and when we got it, I was pissed that a game that appeared before this one was winning, my thing is, why did the others not kept their mouths shut to not cause a controversy? Like I know we waited so long and after that, Sega finally did a great sonic game, and people got mad at Genshin cause they were taking away what they have been long waiting, or at least that's what I see, didn't know about the whole bot situation tbh, i'm just disappointed, a bit mad that Genshin won? Yeah obviously, but not too much to cause a tantrum, we are all grown up adults for the love of god"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Having played Genshin I really don't see the appeal at all to it though it's all subjective so to each their own good for the devs. From didn't need more awards I guess üòÇ
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Oh god I bet they do some weird shit to those voices
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I mean, they probably botted the votes, but not as much as Sonic fans.

A lot of the Sonic fans are mad coping at the loss while genshin fans are just making it worse. 

Both communities are really funny."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"ü§£Sonic fans are mad? WTF when's the last time a 3D Sonic game was worth investing time in, right never. I grew up with the franchise and it hasn't been good since Sonic 3. So janky and bad mechanically. I can't believe the game is even on this list."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,All 3 sonic fans must have been devastated.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,WTF
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Is this 100% true & TBH I play G.I. {Genshin Impact} on my PS4 on a daily basis just for the daily commissions, then I free roam around Teyvat for most of my time. BTW There's a YGO! Reference in the game."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why was Genshin even there isn‚Äôt the game like 3 years old at this point?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"We take this w a grain of salt, seeing as genshin isn‚Äôt a real game."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"W. Reasons why people love Genshin:  
5% Gameplay  
10% Story  
20% Animation/Graphics  
65% FAMOUS JAPANESE VAs"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin, a free to play game, shouldn't have been in the same categories with games that had to sell copies."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,I just wanted the blue hedgehog to win at least once... (and genshin to lose ngl)
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I gotta see some sort of huge, detached drama recap at some point. Not denying Sonic fans being toxic (and fuck anyone who was racist in all this esp), but from the two times I looked into this topic the last few days, the Genshin sub was definitely toxic and riddled with their own botting accusations. Seems like that's widely being ignored and those accusations accepted on their face.

EDIT: Last point taken back in light of looking more into it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The fact that a full pay to win game, that has spending very tightly incorporated into the gameplay systems, won a player's choice award is depressing and tad disgusting."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a Sonic fan that hasn‚Äôt gotten around to playing Frontiers yet. This makes me not want to play the game.

This is like that time the Rick & Morty fans went nuts over that dumb sauce and now I don‚Äôt watch the show anymore. Don‚Äôt want anything to do with the reputation that comes along with being a Rick & Morty fan. Now I‚Äôm kinda feeling the same with Sonic."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's always such a shame to me that Genshin actually looks like a fun BotW clone, which there are too few of, but also combines literally all the worst parts of F2P games in a single package."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Why was Genshin an option. It came out in 2020, it shouldn‚Äôt have even been considered."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I've lost faith in my weeb brethren.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm still confused on how a 2 year old game (that was released on every platform FOR FREE) was allowed to enter a popularity contest on this years Game Awards.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The hell is a geshin impact?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Were these votes primogem motivated?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's funny because the game came out over 2 years ago.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"genshin isnt from this year, it shouldnt have been in the competition."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Disturbing
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"So, is that thing supposed to be purely a popularity vote? Cuz anything else wouldn't make sense to me tbh, GI and Sonic Frontier is certainly not better than any of the other listed games. Even then it's still sad to see that these two cheapshots are so popular. And as a long time Sonic enjoyer it definitely sucks that Sonic still loses as is history (>Mario vs Sonic, now GI). However, the community fully did that to themselves. Making your OWN mods lock YOUR Subreddit because YOU are to toxic doesn't deserve a celebration let alone award."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,why was genshin even in? it's 2 years old already.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,This doesn‚Äôt seem like a true measure of game quality. Elden Ring and GoW are objectively better games. But muh anime waifu ig.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"What a shocker a game that utilizes an addictive gambling model and has an average of 64mil players monthly won a popularity contest.  


Who could have seen that coming, when it was up against a niche game that despite having a very devoted fanbase it isn't that large, a niche game with again a devoted but comparatively smaller fanbase, a niche game that is likewise, aaaand a niche game with a small fanbase."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,A pedophile's gambling game doesn't deserve that award
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I've seen about ten minutes of genshin impact gameplay and it looked like a nonsense game with a world/ui ripped straight from Zelda BOTW only done really shittily. I'm shocked it's on the board and I've never even heard of the sonic shit.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I don't think this was deserved honestly. Whilst the Sumeru update in Genshin is one of the best patches so far, for story and the open world, it is still a live service game that is always online and has gambling. I wouldn't vote for Genshin for that reason. It needs to fix that issue before it becomes a game I'd consider Game of the Year. Also the community voted this mainly for the free primogems (Which don't even get you enough to get one 4 star character) 

Sonic Frontiers was really close, and I didn't even like it, but I voted it anyway because I'd rather a singleplayer game, that at least made Sonic fun again, be the game of the year. Especially where the other three games there wouldn't get a chance to win. I would have rather seen Elden Ring or God of War Ragnarok win. Lead by example... seems people want gambling in games huh?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm just saying if they didn't give the players primogems none of them would have voted for it

But i do think it's insane that a gacha money draining game (or any freemium game for that matter) is present on an award show. There are 4 games on the list that don't play on addictive habits of human beings and trying to drain every penny out of their player base. 

Yet they get encouraged to continue this terrible practice."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It sort of bums me out that a gacha game is actually taking home awards. Gachas have sucked the soul out of gaming lol I get it though they're addictive. As far as gachas go, Genshin is king so I guess they deserve it. I just don't get into weeb shit so it's not my thing.

Honestly I was hoping to see elden ring not win any awards because the souls community is actually mentally disabled. Sonic deserved to get one. Sonic finally got his shit together it's been so many years since a halfway decent sonic game came out."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,i think that genshin won purely because it's free to play. of course there are more genshin players than any of the other games (imo it should've been elden ring or GOW)

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Didn‚Äôt the developers say there were rewards? Surely that isn‚Äôt fair (if they had done that)

there was a graph showing a steady rise of genshin vote with a correlation to when chinese fan woke up and vote.

meanwhile Sonic fan actually botted, because after the accusation, there was a abnormal spike in the voting for Sonic. you can't get that kind of spike unless the community was very coordinated with their vote, so the only answer was that Sonic fans botted and it crashed the site."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Whats funny because before he announced the winners he said after removing all the bot votes the winner is genshin. Sonic famboys are fuming. Chat was glorious to see.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I am so happy Christopher just won. The guy is amazing and has such a good personality.  Live chat was toxic chernobyl tho.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,">the sheer power of spite

For real, it's incredibly easy to miss. For example, I recall posts about games warning that things like lootboxes became more predatory. Basically telling people not to support that. Then a bunch of people responds they are going to buy stuff just because of the post, lmao. Perfect example how some simply live of spite. Since there is a real difference between ""nice to know, but my choice still"" and ""for telling what I should do I'm going to do the opposite now, hahaha!"""
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I love how a lot of the spite started with people accusing genshin players of voting to get rewards.

Then genshin players who genuinely liked the game started voting regardless of rewards, just to show they love the game.

And when genshin won, they didn't even get enough rewards for a full multi.

And in the social media circles im in, the MAJORITY who were originally insisting they only did it for rewards are outraged on behalf of the genshin players, because the rewards were so little compared to the achievement of the fans, here.

They're like *""Damn, girl. You're letting Mihoyo treat you like this?""*

Like, even their enemies are stunned by the developer's sheer stinginess. (And if you know genshin fans, pointing out their parent company's stinginess is probably unintentionally the best clapback sonic fans could ever utter)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Whats the context with genshin vs sonic community?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I honestly think they would've won if they just didn't say anything. Genshin players didn't really give a shit about this until the drama started being talked about. And Sonic fans seemed really passionate about wanting this win.

People say Genshin gives free primos for award wins and they might, but when they last gave primos for TGA win it was for best mobile/ongoing game, not for fan voted award like this one.

I'm honestly surprised it didn't win best mobile game but idk I've never played/heard about the marvel game before today so can't really say anything about it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They fucked around and found out.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic fans thought they were just going up against a regular game fandom, they didn't realize that they were also picking a fight with the greater Chinese population.

this was the equivalent of Pearl Harbor."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Let‚Äôs not pretend Genshin isn‚Äôt popular outside of China. Between a middling Sonic game with a great soundtrack to an outstanding new region expansion in Genshin, I think we all know what the better game is."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Basically yes.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"as a Genshin fan, we were more occupied with the new expansion. they added a new tcg mini game system in the game and it's pretty fun; I haven't even got started with the new story yet.

I only looked away when I saw the Sonic fan calling the kettle black and started to shit-talk us. 

imagine having a history of being ostracized and labeled by the broader community and then pulling the same shit on other people. 

at that point, I was like ""I was gonna not even watch this show, but I ain't gonna let myself be talked down by a furry.""

they probably could've won if they didn't piss off the chinese player base."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Bit of a shame that you didn't get enough for a free multi, though. And that's me speaking as someone who didn't really care that Genshin won; at least Sonic Frontiers got mentioned, and was probably the runner-up for that category. I'm more miffed that Sonic Frontiers got utterly snubbed for best OST than I am that it didn't win Player's Choice."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's honestly great. I buy the monthly card and that's pretty much it. Obviously that means that at some point I've paid more than I would for a fully released game but they keep updating the game so I'm paying $7 for consistent monthly content which is a good deal imo. Plus if I ever decide I don't want to I can just not buy the card sometimes but the game is still there with all of the updates
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"In the first round of players choice there where other games that came out years ago like minecraft , apex ,destiny 2 , ffxiv ,fortnite etc. players choice is only about popularity nothing more and wether someone likes it or not you cant deny that genshin is popular."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Probably the yearly DLC areas?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,As long as the game receives updates then it can qualify.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Basically just a popularity contest.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Advertising potential to Geoff is the main criteria.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,I thought it would get best action game but bayonneta is a tough competition
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Tell that to sonic fans. Apparently they think genshin fans aint huge like them.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Best indie iirc
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Best debutant indie game and best independent game
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,As a Sonic fan. Agreed
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"More like annoyed at how us normal Sonic fans are being lumped with the weirdos. Fans like me just wanted to see Sonic win something, we don‚Äôt have anything against the Genshin fans."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Size of the player base means nothing if they don‚Äôt come together. This was a unified effort for Genshin fans.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Dont doubt it. But this was about playerbase size haha
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"sorry about that. if it makes u feel better.  genshin fans are no stranger to this, their twitter community is one of the most toxic. and it ruins the reputation of the whole playerbase as an result. I agree its unfair to the normal fans in both games"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I'm convinced SEGA simply made Sonic for money, then used said money for development on better games like Yakuza for example."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I believe its also on playstation
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Most Sonic fans did exactly what you said.

They don‚Äôt care that Genshin won, they care that Frontiers lost out. The whole reason most people voted for it was because Frontiers was snubbed out of Best Soundtrack."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No it doesn't. And it won't have one for at least 3 or more years so I guess take your time. They come out with new updates every month though. A large portion of the updates relate to the main story (archon quests) And there are interlude storylines here and there. New areas and characters are always introduced so they have something to hook players. But if you're looking to play the main story in one go, it will be a little while heh."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Well I started Assassin's Creed Valhalla months after it dropped in 2020 and still haven't seen an end yet. At least Genshin is upfront about it lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Basically there are 7 main countries in the game and each country has its own set of characters with a unique storyline called the Archon quest. Alongside Archon quests, there are a good number of quality world quests and character quests to complete. At the beginning, Genshin started out with only two countries but it's a live service game and that number has increased to 4 now with Sumeru being the latest. 

If you join Genshin now there will be plenty of content for you to play through, even I started in March 2022 and completed the main storyline just now. I've easily put more than 100 hours in Genshin Impact and I still have tonnes of quality quests left to complete so there will be plenty of content for a newbie.

As for the answer to your question, no it does not have an ending as of now but we'll reach the final region of the game within 3-4 years which is also speculated to be the end of the main story."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Let‚Äôs talk about geography 

The continent is called Teyvat, with 7 nations inside it with an Archon (god) ruling over one of the seven elements and a heaven called Celestia as their boss essentially 
‚Ä¢ Mondstadt and Liyue (Germany and China inspired) - the first areas available during launch 
‚Ä¢ Inazuma (Japan) - released during patch 2 (updates release in segments like 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Sumeru (Middle Eastern inspired) - released during patch 3 (current patch)
‚Ä¢ Fontaine (France) 
‚Ä¢ Natlan (South American inspired)
‚Ä¢ Snezhnaya (Russia)

Outside Teyvat is an area called the Dark Sea where the jurisdiction of The Seven don‚Äôt apply. It is where the losers of the Archon War that survived have fled to and for now there‚Äôs one confirmed area called 
‚Ä¢ Khaenri‚Äôah (an area considered the final frontier of the game)

Story

There were two wars that shaped Teyvat as it is right now: the Archon War and the Cataclysm. The Archon War was a ploy by Celestia to have seven gods rule over the entirety of Teyvat. The Cataclysm was a recent occurrence that happened 500 years ago, it is also the cause of most of the unnatural phenomena that happens in each nation.

There are lots of lore tidbits in the game but they‚Äôre contained in books, items, etc. so exploring is a fun way to learn about it"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"If you‚Äôre not into live-service games, don‚Äôt even bother.  It receives updates very often and is designed to be ongoing, but no, it doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúending.‚Äù  

On the other hand, if you do like live-service games with very frequent new content, then it‚Äôs honestly one of the best choices.  Don‚Äôt know of any other that gets quality updates so frequently."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The main story is currently at middle point with 4/7 main nations released and a region is released once per year.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Most of the genshin community didn't care about the award either. We were enjoying the latest update that was recently dropped. But we started voting mostly because we got insulted.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a Sonic fan, i'd like to say that i agree with everything you said and apologize for every racist Sonic fan. I personally think that the fact that GI gives in-game stuff If they win awards is dumb and should be banned. But it isn't, and GI won fair and square. I voted for Sonic Frontiers not because i wanted to beat genshin, but to get Sonic the recognition the series deserves."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I'm sorry, but Reason nr.1 just shows me how little you know about Genshin.

Genshin has had probably the best and most refreshing music in the industry in the last 2 years. Easily up there with Nintendo, WoW or Square Enix. The OST for the newest region, released a few months ago, is 3.5h long and every single piece is incredible. They've combined traditional middle eastern and Indian instruments with an European orchestra, creating far better and authentic music than say the generic middle eastern stuff Hollywood puts out.

Don't get me wrong, Sonic OST is good and iconic... but GI is just on another level.

I understand Reason 2 however, that's valid."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,probably none
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It did for best debutant indie and independent game
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,And yet they didn't start the drama this time. Sonic fans could have just kept quiet and enjoy their win but they had to be dicks and bring out the racism. In the end they got what they deserved.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,if they kept on getting updates yes apparently. also keep in mind this is for a minor category called player's voice
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,elden ring should have wont but im glad it wasnt sonic frontiers because i think that game is just mid at best
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Well, people said no. 

The award is voted by the people

- A Genshin Player who follows logic"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,60 million monthly playerbase. I don't thats the full amount of playersbase too lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Nah. TGA let‚Äôs ongoing games qualify for any category if they have new content that ‚Äúmerits inclusion‚Äù according to the jury. No matter how old it is
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Haters never care about reason. But I can say compared to old days many actually Appreciate genshin but thats only because they actually bothered to try the game and not take internet opinions as facts.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It was all to spite one guy Im pretty sure. One guy pissed off a community of 20 million people, then this happened."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's a popularity contest. Whatever is more popular would've won.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Stray did get a very good award haul tbh. GOTY was hopeless for them but they brought home some good stuff
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Just popularity vote. Who‚Äôs fans can vote the most for their fav game kind of thing. Only based on fan vote
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin fans didn‚Äôt care about the players choice since mihoyo doesn‚Äôt give gems popularity votes. They only did it out of spite.

We only cared about being nominated in and winning in the *actual* categories. However, we lost in both meaning we only get 800 this year for the nominations alone."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"This was a popularity contest not a best game awards,(though elden ring did win that). Hard to compete with a game that has over 60million daily users."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Player voices are a popularity vote so the game with a larger community will usually win. I know that elden ring is a great game but it still costs money upfront to play and the genre of souls game is too hard for the casual majority to enjoy. Compare that to a very casual friendly f2p mobile game, the sheer amount of voters is just too big of a difference."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Card game with an big-ass open world
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Breath of the Wild - Lite

with F2P gacha system for unlocking new characters / weapons.

And now apparently a CCG when you hit a certain level."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Elden Ring won GOTY. The Player's Voice is a low tier award voted only by the public, and the game with the biggest and most active playerbase wins, it's pretty pointless."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,popularity contest between the players basically. I think the other categories are mostly determined by stuff like the press and reviewers etc while players voice is just the players
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,There where older games like minecraft and fortnite which all lost in early rounds.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The Player's Choice award is for any 2022 release *and* any ongoing game deemed as relevant. 

In the first round, 30 nominees were picked including games like Fortnite, Apex, and Destiny 2."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Its kinda confusing. Its not voice acting its whats more popular is an players choice
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's a player's voice category, not best voice acting category. Confusing name, I know."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It seems sonic fans just wanted it to win because they didn't get nominated for best soundtrack award. But then some toxic part of their community started insulting the Genshin community which included the massive Chinese player base. They promptly started voting for Genshin out of spite and here are the results.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,you realize that elden ring won the main category right? elden ring is a paid game so ofc it would have a lower playerbase than a f2p game

Maybe you should download and play for one day then delete if you don't like it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Massive open world, great character building, great art, amazing world building and storyline, consistent updates giving us a hell of a lot of new content.

It hooks you really quickly, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a bad game. It‚Äôs genuinely good and has a lot of care, time, and money put into but, but then again it also has addictive gacha with pretty bad rates and artifact farming which is just fuckin abysmal, but that doesn‚Äôt inherently take away all the good."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Maybe its not the type of game u like. There are people who find souls game, God of War etc boring because not every game appeals to everyone. The important part is majority and genshin appeals them and thats where its success relies."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,what bribery mihoyo didnt even announce anything. also few people in the genshin community cared until the drama lol. probably a lot of the votes is from the chinese community who are angry about the racist shit
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"A community of 20 million people was pissed off by one guy, who then proceeded to start telling everyone in the sonic community to start botting sonics votes. Im just sad Elden Ring didnt get it."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"There were botting accusations from both sides.

Apparently what happened was that the racist memes were sent to Chinese players. Then, they decided to get involved leading to the influx of votes. On top of that, it was some sort of holiday or Remembrance Day meaning they were bored since all their game servers had to be closed.

The sonic fans saw these huge spikes in votes, but didn‚Äôt factor in the fact of time zone differences and just how huge genshin is internationally. Thus, they thought the genshin players were botting. So, they decided to bot in retaliation.

However, they botted stupidly and added a ton of votes in a short period of time leading to the site crashing. Hence why Geoff called them out yesterday before announcing the winner."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,It can‚Äôt be pay to win if there‚Äôs no PvP at all and you can clear the hardest content there is absolutely and 100% free. There‚Äôs hardly ever a meta and no place to need to be extra strong like you can get by paying. Genshin is about as far from p2p as it gets
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Whenever it comes to anything you like. Don't go looking for the community. I like elden ring and dark souls and GoW. But i avoid these communities like the plague because i know that most people are elitists and care too much about unimportant stuff

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"For one, the game‚Äôs writing is better than anything we've getting for a while now with some surprisingly emotional atory beats, the combat is simple but solid and the soundtrack is straight fire.

The only thing is there are a lot of references to events and characters from earlier games that you might not get if you're unfamiliar with the series and there is slight pop-in issues, but all in all it's a really good game."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Well genshin is that popular and its a single player game gacha or not and the games budget is now more than 500 million dollars.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"They didn‚Äôt promise any primogems and they haven‚Äôt given us any for winning lol. 

Genshin players initially didn‚Äôt vote for this reason and were perfectly fine with giving Sonic the win. Then, all the racist comments and harassment came out leading to Genshin players voting out of spite.

All we got was 800 gems for the two nominations we got. The players choice award didn‚Äôt give us any rewards."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They would have won if they didn't trash talk genshin community and piss of the Asian community. They lost because of their ego and arrogance.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Maybe a wild guess, but if they didn't get nominated for anything else it maybe means the game was mid compared to other games?

It shouldn't deserve awards because it's an okay game compared to previous flops in the franchise, it's a fact not many people played or liked it so it isn't surprising it didn't win any awards."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Claims to not give a shit then proceeds to slandering. LOL!

Totally F2P here, it means I spent 0. The game gives you characters and equipment to complete the game out of the box for free. Dafuq are you talking about?

The only thing I'm invested in is the deep worldbuilding and intriguing story. This is evidenced by the hundreds of lore nut channels on youtube theorizing the big secrets of the world.

LOL at people running their mouth on a game they know nothing about."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It has a nice story, cool characters, a good open world, interesting bosses, beautiful landscape and get updated every months or so. 
That enough to qualify it as a game to me."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's literally the players voice lol. You can't be upset that a popularity contest was won but a game with a larger fan base the most of the other games on this list combined

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't play this game myself but don't judge Genshin if you've never played it. It has obviously done something right. And I'm sure you're oversimplifying things and just hating on it for the sake of it.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,so much salt flows in your blood
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Dude really glanced at the game and decided it was BotW copy üíÄ
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ofc its the dude that joined whitepeopletwitter subreddit that says this

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"I did that with Guild Wars 2!

I loaded it up... hated how different it was from GW1, then quit.

Came back a couple years later, ended up putting 400 hours into it. 2 Minutes grants a poor sense of a game, I suppose. Especially if you come in with expectations that it will match another game exactly. You'll only really note what is *not* like the other game and get disgruntled."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,That‚Äôs not a good reason and he one in 2018 why would he need to really have that award does not make sense
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The devs never promised anything tho... This is just the genshin fandom voting out of spite
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They didn't even bribed lol. Stop hearing misinformation on internet and spreading it as facts. They even told to vote in this category

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,people saw that ER wasn't going to win and wasted their vote on Sonic because it looked closer just to spite Genshin.  it might have won if people just voted for what they like instead of voting against what they dont like.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Elden ring and ragnarok would be fighting for this award but its a public vote so who has more fanbase wins ,and of course ,won by bribery"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah the irony. Most of their toxic sonic stans still in denial while the matured ones moved on.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I think it should've been Ragnarok or Elden Ring for sure, but Genshin has been good too, and while the free primogems are nice, the salt from Sonic fans who will remain in denial is funny.

I think people took this too seriously. It's literally a popular vote, and Genshin is incredibly popular, even for a F2P game. It's just silly to get worked up about."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They literally admitted to botting what are you on about

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"There were genshin players betting for the free primos we're sure to get and a bunch even announced it themselves, acting like it's entirely baseless is silly as taking the whole thing seriously to begin with"

(And by predatory, I mean in the EXTREME sense. Yes, the game is gatcha, but u can enjoy the game without spending money. I have a separate account that cannot use any exclusive characters. While it is more difficult, you can still do quite a bit)

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a Genshin fan, I admit that the amount of primos we get feels very stingy (never said/typed that before, I have no idea how to spell it), but we have already been getting rewards from other awards/nominations, so adding together, it is a pretty decent amount.

Edit: comment below kinda speaking facts"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin has been ""stingy"" since launch. They have periodic moments when they hand out primogems, but these periodic moments are set - anniversary, around Chinese new year, etc. but nothing beyond that.

This is also probably why Genshin is so popular and so liked. It's complicated."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"> I love how a lot of the spite started with people accusing genshin players of voting to get rewards...

> ...when genshin won, they didn't even get enough rewards for a full multi.

In other words, it was totally true"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Wait, so the real headline here is ""Gacha game wins an award by bribing players""?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Some Sonic fan insult genshin Chinese community with racist insult and calling them bots and hacking the vote, Chinese player who didn't care about the award decide to vote Genshin just to pissed Sonic fan. Then Sonic fan decide to attack whole genshin community, which is the stupidest move ever."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"genshin commnunity is chilling when sonic community attack genshin players on twitter, and a very paticular fan arts and some racist tweets get leaked to the chinese community, then game over for sonic fans."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's surprising not many ppl know this but basically a bunch of anons from 4chan wanted Genshin to lose so started to vote for sonic.

Looking at Genshins player base there is no way any of those games stand a chance against their numbers."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Gonna be honest a big portion of the Genshin base didn't care about the choice awards until the drama started. Once you get someone upset in the community, though, all it takes is rumors of free rewards to get the hoard to awaken."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It didn't win most likely because it won last year. Marvel Snap (which I didn't even know it's existence) won instead. Btw marvel owned by Disney, so you know where this is going.."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Not just Chinese. Genshin Impact is massive as a pop culture phenomenon in Asia period. 

It‚Äôs pretty much a household name. Dedicated merchandise shops in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia. Fan run conventions. Heck, in my city there are statues in the roads."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Nah, this wasn't Pearl Harbor. This was more akin to the German attack on Russia during WW2: Bad actors pretending to be good ones and then causing a downfall with a bad choice of action."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Not to mention that Genshin ALSO has a great soundtrack lol.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah it‚Äôs routinely in the top games on PSN
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah Genshin is absolutely MASSIVE, and it's free, and it's on mobile, it's so much more accessible so it has such a clear advantage, weird move for the Sonic fandom to try anything on them just to get assblasted back to Sonic Spinball"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,People just say Genshin is a China game because they're salty. Genshin is way more popular outside China than any of the other games in that category as well with maybe the exception of Elden Ring. And Genshin is definitely going to outlast Elden Ring in popularity as well because it's a live service game. Frontiers is a mid game at best being boosted by a nostalgic dedicated fandom for not being completely shit. I don't think Genshin deserves players choice because I don't believe games that released in 2020 shouldn't be in the game awards but it certainly doesn't belong to Sonic based on the quality of the game either. It would be Elden Ring. In terms of quality there's no competition between Genshin and Sonic.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Sonic stood a chance. The Sonic fandom mobilized, unlike the Elden Ring/God of War/Stray fandoms who didn't really seem to care, but (from what I gather) then they pissed on Genshin fans for no reason and well, it turns out China is a huge country and Genshin is super big there, so they kinda shot themselves in the proverbial foot."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yes. But they could have done it Friday or Saturday instead.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No. Usually when I have problems with it, it's just staying up late on the weekend which is no problem. It's the weekday that's the problem."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Apex legends, destiny, ff14 were all in the list for round 1."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't get it tbh. Why are games not released in 2022 allowed to run for game of the year 2022?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Objectively speaking, they should've at least been nominated for best OST.
Objectively speaking, it IS the best game OST of 2022."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Don‚Äôt blame em honestly.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As a genshin player, don't blame them. Genshin mods restricted the number of times we could post about the awards."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It‚Äôs the one with the lgbt flag. Nobody is posting shit about the awards because I suspect the mods are preventing them. 

I‚Äôve only seen one post that‚Äôs locked with 0 comments from a genshin player. 

I tried posting something with the discussion tag and it was immediately removed for ‚Äúlow effort content‚Äù which is bs‚Ä¶"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Comments like this are why everyone thinks people who play Genshin have zero social skills, jfc."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Man tcg is so fun I didn't even start the new archon quest playing tcg all day. The game gets more deeper complex when u progress pvp is Hella fun and where u git Gud and realize how amazingly made this mode is.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,There are a very great many people opposed to genshin that do not fall under the banner of sonic fans or racists.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The sonic fan base isn‚Äôt that big. It‚Äôs mostly people voting against Genshin. It‚Äôs a gacha game, so of course people aren‚Äôt going to like it winning anything."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"I think that is reasonable yeah, Everybody has a price that they're comfortable with spending for an hour of entertainment from a game. for me if I get about an hour of fun out of a euro I won't feel bad or cheated. Game development is a buisness and they've got wages to pay too.  


I think in the case of the freemium buisiness model my only objection is that there is no cap on what someone could spend. healthy people generally won't spend more than they can afford but I must confess concern for the whales.  


and I think we've all heared those horror stories about kids, tablets and microtransactions ;)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No that's cool. Was a legit question! Played Genshin a bit before, it was a lot of fun."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,SO the same game can just win Player's voice over and over again year after year if it stays popular?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Honestly surprised FFXIV wasn't one of the 5 up there

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah it's only one of the most popular games in the country with the highest population!


Seriously, Sonic fans really underestimated Genshin."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Most of us Sonic Fans knew that Genshin was really popular. It's why most of us were banking on us not mentioning anything.

Unfortunately for us, some junkwads decided to go and poke the tiger while masquerading as part of our community, and made the Genshin Impact community actually care."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"As a genshin player I would also like to add that this whole ordeal was probably blown out of proportion because of the bad reputation Genshin has in general due to, again, lumping everyone in with the weirdos"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Which is directly related to a couple factors like quality and nostalgia. GI has quality and no nostalgia.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah kinda makes sense why it won
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"True, but the vocal and toxic minority always get the most attention. Unless the whole community band together to push away that vocal minority, they will always represent the community in the eyes of outsiders. Tbh, the Genshin community also has this exact problem."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Not every month but every 6 weeks, and they‚Äôve been consistent with this since day 1"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"100% agreed, there is no way Sonic Frontiers‚Äôs soundtracks are remotely close in quality compared to Genshin or Mihoyo in general who has an entire music department, literal concerts held and a Spotify page with millions of monthly listeners.
If anything Genshin could/should have been nominated for best soundtrack this year because the sumeru update absolutely deserves.
The production value is literally insane overall the list of games with soundtracks comparable to Genshin‚Äôs can be counted with one hand or maybe two."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's actually incredible how toxic the Sonic fandom is - or at least, the perception of it (which ended up getting proven here). But....why, though? What's with Sonic that allegedly stirs up angry mobs?

&#x200B;

(Assuming that Sonic community wasn't just used as a smokescreen this time around, which while there's no evidence, isn't out of the realm of possibility)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Fair enough.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, I know people said no. That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúshould‚Äôve‚Äù."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I didn't hear about this. But this just reaffirms can't trust fan voting wild we do fan voting essentially for our elections lmao
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Exactly, why are people salty over popular vote? It‚Äôs exactly that. Elden Ring WON game of the year. Electoral vote exists for a reason."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Omg. I should try it now.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Does dlc make a game ongoing? If it does then why weren‚Äôt games like smash bros on there when it was getting dlc?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ah.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin is a AAA title, this is like saying that Ronaldo is better footbaler than Lebron James. Its true bcs they are 2 different categories."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Elden Ring got Game of The year. No reason to be sad
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ah yes they were totally bot votes and not fan votes like the host annouced.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Looked into it further. Yeah, I'll take that back."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Once in 2 months.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No, I will not"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"On top of that, no one really expected to get anything for the players voice award since it‚Äôs a popularity award. Hence why genshin players originally didn‚Äôt care for it and only voted for it in the end due to spite.

We still didn‚Äôt get anything for it either in the end. We only got 800 for the nominations like we did back in 2020."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Because I have no interest in running around as an anime chick hitting boxes repeatedly in a poorly made Chinese game. I'm honestly disgusted it's in the same list as elden ring and I'm not even a big souls fan.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's not entirely that but the provocation definitely helped a lot lmao
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,How did you know it's a vtuber though? Looks like an ordinary anime pfp to me
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I know the criteria, dumb criteria. 
There's an award for 'best ongoing' for old games, choosing games for the players favourite in 2022 should only involve games from 2022 (especially when the older games are literally bribing their players to get it)
What's the point of holding a show celebrating games from the past year if every year they nominate more and more old games for fresh awards"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ah ok. That makes more sense.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I still have yet to see a source for the free crack for voting on the game? Can you link yours?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Yes i just meant that Genshin was and i didnt too much about the other games
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Both communities have huge issues, but I doubt that was a deciding factor in the voting. This community is full of LGBTQ phobes, classism, and ableism."

It's pathetic that you defend these predatory business practices."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Then perhaps F2P titles should be under their own category. I dunno, putting jt ul agajnst the bigger titles seems like a bit of a runaway move. They KNEW too many people would vote for it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It can hurt, I very highly discourage it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Both Genshin and Tower of Fantasy are great F2P, ToF more though with how many Roll Tokens you can get from exploration."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It‚Äôs like getting angry back in 2018-2019 when Fortnite was winning ‚ÄúMost Popular‚Äù game votes.  Like‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs the most popular game‚Ä¶ period.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"tbh a huge part of why genshin is so popular is *because* it is f2p, not in spite of it. It's super accessible, casual-friendly, and [runs on pretty much anything lol](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgxR7QkjboriJgdqKaZ4AaABCQ) 

Pretty much the lowest barrier to entry for an rpg out there. It's not the most amazing game or anything, but it is probably the best f2p game out there and honestly stands on level ground with some paid games. It's definitely pushed the envelope of that category."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Blame the Genshin haters, first they rallied on Sonic to spite Genshin fans. And then, they created that ""beating up Lumine"" pic and used some slurs on CN. CN spotted it and chose üéª so they rallied everyone to vote for Genshin"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin has been out for two years and has accumulated more fans.  Not necessarily that it is better than GOW or Elden Ring, but GoW hasn‚Äôt even been out that long and is only available on PlayStation.  Elden Ring is absolutely fantastic, but again, it isn‚Äôt a game that was made for everyone.  It was made specifically for a mature audience.  Genshin impact is available nearly on any device that you can think of and has no limitations on availability, and is continuously updated. 

Genshin should have been the clear winner without any doubt."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Lol there was no proof, just people who have no idea how a website works."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The category of player voice was for all game, minecraft and fortnite was also included in the early round of voting.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They could win... But they started attacking genshin community and it pissed many Chinese players who didn't care about this before. And you can't outvote chinas millions of players.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Because they underestimate the genshin community and thinks its not big like them.

Yeah it‚Äôs kinda hilarious how Genshin Impact won Player‚Äôs Voice over Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok, but i‚Äôm going to move on with my day and not really care because I don‚Äôt base my entire life and self-worth on a game

The fact that they‚Äôre so asshurt over one award is absolutely hilarious and pathetic at the same time"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Wait holyshit he was in Stargate? My dad was a huge fan of the show so it always played in the background of my childhood and the guy seemed familiar but now it all clicks! Thanks lmao
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"To anyone reading this.

This is why it's the best clapback. Genshin fans know it's stingy but it's like watching people getting exploited try to justify it like ""Well, they only pay me a dollar a day, but i'm taking two or three shifts so it all adds up to a decent amount"" how dare you suggest I deserve more?

They basically end up calling themselves entitled for even thinking they deserve more than they're getting. And that's sad, cause this is r/gaming where people arent afraid to both express fondness for a game while calling out the bad practices of the parent company, they shouldn't fear being downvoted for pointing out the obvious."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The lower amounts of currency makes pulls rarer, so the pulls are more exciting, which with combination of snail slow powercreep, makes characters more valuable."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Gacha games normally thank players via gems for the player's continuied support in many various ways, like number of downloads, number of years played, any awards. This is normal.

But i'd say most gacha gamers would point at 'giving 5 rolls for winning players choice' as one of the most stingy responses possible.

It's the equivalent of getting top in your school in the hopes your parent will give you an allowance bonus, and only getting 5 extra dollars.

*Over the course of 4 days.*"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Always has been

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,And then being a hypocrite they're the one that used bot and crash the voting site.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don‚Äôt get why Sonic fans would want to be racist to Genshin fans. We‚Äôre talking about western fandom here. It‚Äôs a group of western fans of a Japanese game attacking the western fans of a Chinese game. Just boggles the mind.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why are people so dedicated to this corny ash award ceremony üò≠üò≠.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Where are these fuming sonic fans? The big communities are sharing more wholesome messages than anything. You talking about the minority that happens in every community we shouldn't give the time of day, and just exaggerating them as the whole community when it isnt close to true? There's an extreme amount of people talking about these fuming sonic fans that are nowhere in sight.

I haven't seen sonic fans in the spotlight since the award winner was announced, and every concern they had before was all about bots. Which... didn't they say they removed bot votes, proving there WERE bot votes? Whether or not Genshin won fairly or not the concern of them getting snubbed was legitimate if there were enough bot votes to be mentioned by the game awards production team themselves."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Man people take this shit way to seriously ü§£ü§£
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I see, thanks"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin is a wonderful game that could even be re-released as a complete standalone game in the future once the story is done. It could rival some AAA titles from some big name companies right now, and it's totally free if you are patient and not a gambling addict.

That's how good GI is.

Sadly, like the way of Fortnite, and minecraft before them, people who know jack shit about the game started hating on it and even major issues like alleged pedophilia, racism, etc.

I'm not sure if this stemmed from it being a Chinese game or what, but Mihoyo, GI's creators, are not Tencent which is the shitty Chinese gaming company.

If people could only give it a chance."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Can confirm. I'm living in Indonesia and have been to some cosplay conventions. Literally 2/3rds of the gaming cosplay were Genshin.

Combination of being free, available on smartphones that most people have (a lot of people didn't have a PC/laptop good enough to run Genshin, much less a console) and Waifu characters."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,There's a dedicated merch store in Taiwan? Do you know where it is?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"genshin is also massive in Japan, i just visited and every store in Akihabara has some form of Genshin merch. Right outside the station exit are like 10 poles with character posters stuck on top with free wifi provided SSID GENSHIN WIFI"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"ah yes, Operation Barbarossa."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Oi

Sonic Spinball was fantastic"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Stray probably shouldn‚Äôt have been up there for anything besides ‚Äúhey this is cute‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think there IS a Stray community, just people who like it lol 

There really isn‚Äôt much to talk about with the game"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Actually, people were circulating ""vote for Genshin"" stuff from the first round of the preliminary voting. By that point, it was already fairly clear Genshin stood a strong chance of winning.

What happened was that when the final votes opened, when it hit morning in Asia, Genshin got a spike of votes when the Asians woke up. This led to some sonic fans on twitter claiming that the Chinese were botting, and also a retweeted piece about how MiHoYo was bribing their playerbase to win the award. Those went absolutely *viral* through the Genshin community and the large, national SEA-based Facebook communities *and* CN users who found the translated tweets on their boards just went overdrive on voting out of spite. On the flipside, there were also a bunch of people who got galvanised to vote sonic just so genshin wouldn't win, but that number was a lot lower than the genshin fans motivated to vote.

Pretty much the main difference is just that without some toxic sonic fans triggering the beast, Genshin's margin of victory would have just been slimmer"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Genshin comunity is still bigger than these 4 combined.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,FF14 is old af too.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I've seen this asked a lot here and it's honestly getting tiresome to answer something that can easily be googled.

This is not the GOTY. This category is the People's Choice, or Player's Voice as written above, a popularity contest. Any ongoing game can and haved been nominated here so long as they have had an update recently.

Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Fortnite, hell even minecraft, iirc, were in this category but was booted early because of low votes.

edit: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards_2022

Idiots complaining about the awards given should really shut up and research first."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Honestly it‚Äôs the most unhinged group of people I‚Äôve observed over the past month or so. 

Which isn‚Äôt saying much since we are talking about the sonic fandom. 

The same fandom which gave birth to Chris Chan of all horrid eldritch abominations."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I promised myself even that I‚Äôm going to avoid capping Resin this patch‚Ä¶ day 1 I already broke that commitment lmao
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Thank you.  Genshin represents almost all of the things that are annoying about gaming these days.   Nothing to do with sonic for me.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,all good enjoy the rest of the show.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,technically yes.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As long as it is continuously updated, sure. And we know Genshin will have a major expansion again next year"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Technically yes, but as you can see fortnite and minecraft also in the list, and those are a lot more popular than Elden Ring, Stray or Sonic, but they didn't, because recency bias and not that many people care about The Game awards. And to be honest, Genshin was also not really care about the awards, most player wasn't even know about it and are looking forward to the new update. Sonic had a very real chance of winning if they didn't mock Genshin and wake the tiger up."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Well yeah. It‚Äôs getting constant updates that are essentially on the level of a new game coming out every year.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Yeah pretty much. At least us sane fans are around to keep the balance lol.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Also, the mobile gaming industry is just bigger than PC and console combined. And genshin is available on all platforms."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Also its 3 huge things ""mobile, anime, free"""
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It‚Äôs a surprise how good this game is despite it having a lot against it.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Massive community of around 20 million gets pissed off by one guy.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Well if you want to be pedantic, they had shortened patches recently because of Ayakas last extended run. So not every 6 weeks due to covid. They will be going back to their regular schedule onwards."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't think it's fair to call the entire community toxic just because of a few morons who went overboard here. Just like how the majority of the Genshin community is pretty chill but has a bad reputation for the same reason.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Agreed.

Im just sad Elden Ring didnt get this, but hey, all the games up there deserved to be nominated."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I swear most people who complained don't even realized that people choice is just a fancy way to say popularity vote.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I recommend playing it on PC if you have it, it's not really graphically intensive, and the game is streamlined to be played even on your phone. I don't play on my phone anymore because it's getting bigger because of the updates."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,it probably was just didnt make it to the later rounds or something.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"If Genshin Impact is a triple-A title, then it should not have been in the running for an Indie title award."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Understandable, not Elden Ring? What do you like then? I'm honestly curious."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,U forgot the its the tga that make the rules not u or I.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-12,"Its the TGA. It's not limited to this year, unlike every other awards ceremony in existence.

Just make your own list and it's probably better anyway."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It did? HELL YES (I didnt see the awards yet, just this one)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,*6 weeks
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Wow, did you come out with that answer all by yourself?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Because you can't come up with anything original
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,">running around as an anime chick

Fair.

>hitting boxes

Extremely reductive and silly.

>poorly made

Just wrong.

>Chinese game.

There is some reason for minor concern here. Though the HQ is in Singapore, and the anti-cheat actually shuts off when the game closes now.


You seem to have some rather strong opinions of something you've seen ""just 10 minutes"" of. Do you judge everything in your life that quickly?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Dude, legit no one was voting for the awards. Genshin was second and sonic was winning by a lot, until they, again, commented racist things and made the CN community mad, which again, led to people voting to prove them wrong"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No, that was for the nominations. 

It‚Äôs similar to 2020‚Äôs TGA where we only got 800 for getting nominated but didn‚Äôt win anything either."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Update: Genshin players got 800 Primogems as a reward for GI winning Player‚Äôs Voice Award.

Even if players did not know, they would boycott Mihoyo, which they have done already on a previous occasion."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah even the sonic community don't like those toxic clowns now cause they ended up angering the Asian part and give free advertising that this category exist. Most don't even care about tga. They did just to teach a lesson to sonic community and don't mess with their community.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The thing with bad apples is that, while they are a minority, they still undoubtedly part of the community. It's impossible to prevent the community from catching flak for what the toxic minority does, but be assured that reasonable people don't judge the whole community based on those rotten apples."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Dude, you're attacking Genshin fans for retaliating to an attack. We can also see your commenting history and you've had quite a few things to say about GI.

Sonic fans lose any right to complain about toxicity from other people for starting this shit."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,[removed]
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It has 60 million active players, thats 6 times more than pokemon scarlet and violet have sold."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why's that? There's a reason so many people play it. Great game.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Tof have powercreep issue, your characters farmes for f2p will become useless quick."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Oh yeah if you like the rng portion of the game better maybe. Never played TOF, but Genshin has some top notch exploration."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"If it's literally perfect, nobody would need to mod it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"Ehhh more like misunderstanding. Since we got rewards for being nominated last year after the award show (not whether we won or not, although we did win that year) a lot of fans thought this year for ongoing and mobile game that we also would get them. But they never told us we‚Äôd be getting any, or offered it for a win or mentioned free rewards, and if we were getting some it wouldn‚Äôt be because we won (we did indeed end up getting some this year for our nominations even though we lost in the other categories.)

But genshin doesn‚Äôt give out rewards for fan based stuff so nobody voted for player‚Äôs voice (a fan award) expecting primogems from it. 

Does that make sense I‚Äôm half asleep I feel like maybe I‚Äôm wording it weird. TLDR genshin did give us awards for being nominated so I see why people think we got bribed but they never said they‚Äôd give us any beforehand, we got them whether we won or not so it wasn‚Äôt incentive to try and win, and it wasn‚Äôt for the player‚Äôs voice but rather the nominations for the other two"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,How about playing the game first ü•± goofy opinion
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I really don't think it's right to imply that if a guy uses one of the 5 child characters outta the 60 current chars in the game which are all clothed and aren't sexualized by the game at all means they need to be on a watchlist. Millions of grown women which is like almost half the fanbase also play this game too so it's strange how guys are singled out here.

Not even sure where the little clothing fighting against each other came from, this isn't that type of game. It's literally just anime breath of the wild."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I thought he was trans
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,that was given for 4 days because of the Playstation Partner award and that's it. Edit: and that was even for a thank-you gift
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,they didnt say anything about this award though?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Edit your link, they just announced the reward from this award lmao"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,That and the criteria is still favoring genshin
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"1) They didn‚Äôt promise rewards, the fanbase just assumed.

2) The rewards are for the nominations, not the win. They lost best mobile game to Among Us in 2020, but still gave out rewards for the nomination."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Nuh uh, they don't announce they will be giving currency if we win.

They might send some compensation but its up to hoyoverse and they did not promise a thing. Quite your accusation bullshit"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"In 2020 they gave out in game rewards simply just for the nominations even tho they lost both. The same would have been true this year too, but winning this fan vote made it a convenient excuse to reward for that reason instead. 

But no they didn‚Äôt bribe anyone. Stop spreading false information. Players made an assumption that ultimately didn‚Äôt matter since they would have rewarded us for the nomination for the non-player vote categories anyway."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They were giving primos for nominations.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I‚ÄôM HANGING ON TO THE OTHER SIDE
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I felt the same way when *Ace Combat 7* was snubbed for the music nomination back a couple of years ago. The thing that Sonic and Ace Combat games have in common is that their soundtracks always kick ass!
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I like the vocal tracks but found a lot of the open world music to be kinda forgetful and bland.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin should have won even that one.

They've released 3.5h of incredible OST just for one patch, pieces combining traditional middle eastern and Indian instruments with European orchestra in a very respectful and unique way (unlike generic middle eastern Hollywood music).

Honestly, *easily* the best OST released this year, and *easily* on Nintendo, WoW or Square Enix level of good."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, riling up a fanbase against yours isn't a good idea if you're trying to win a vote lol"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What's CN?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Not only that but the optimization and sheer scale of the game on mobile is unreal. Load times are almost nonexistent, and the map is massive and keeps getting expanded."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What was the deleted comment?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Someone rushed the stage at the last minute during the goty acceptance speech and said ‚Äú I‚Äôd like to thank my orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton‚Äù The gentleman was later arrested
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,So can we have peace?
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Lesson learned. Don't be racist.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't think they would have won either way but it sure must've been a landslide after poking the hornet's nest.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I haven't played Elden Ring and GoW:R was *objectively* a better game in all fields, but Players Voice is a mass vote, and those games only really have a huge following in Western countries, as opposed to the sheer might of Genshin's fanbase internationally (of course, including half or more of which is China)

They didn't stand much of a chance in a voting numbers game"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Probably just because it's a fan base that finally got an okay game after a long time. The internet has been dunking on Sonic games since 06 even though most of them aren't too bad. So to see so many people kind of digging this one, was kind of nice.

Plus, for the race to be between Genshin and Sonic while Elden Ring was there? Normally the games community hates free to play games like Genshin and loves stuff like Elden Ring. I think it was more than Sonic fans, it included people that like memes haha.

Also Genshin Impact was the only game not from this year if I recall. Without the Sonic fan base, Genshin would be the game most hated out of that group for the reasons above. Heck, it's only the Sonic fan base that people consider toxic, not the game."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"Yup, Teal‚Äôc."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Glad I could be a good example lmao. 

Also, the fear of expressing your opinion on liking/disliking a game and calling things out is very valid. I risk being called a pedo or something by mentioning liking Genshin. Others risk getting downvoted for disliking Genshin, even if it is a perfectly understandable reason.

(Srry if what I said was not what u were trying to say. But I felt like it had to be said either way)"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,i mean working 14 hours a day is a bit different than spending like a minute to vote for something. also you shouldnt be doing it for the primogems anyways
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,If i pointed out what i consider obvious you guys would never see me in any social media again
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Has it won an award before? Was it the same kind of deal, vote for us and get currency? 

I don't follow this stuff, I just sometimes vote and sometimes notice who wins and what gets announced."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,This is the funniest part. Going rabid shit throwing crazy that you do what you accuse others of doing to such an extreme extent that you get caught doing it. I‚Äôd say they win the award for craziest fanbase.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin Impact is more popular than sonic and some people hate popular thing, so when Sonic had more vote than genshin in round 2, their pride got over their head and celebrate it too early."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Becuase Genshin Impact = Anime Waifus and thus is only played by pedophiles. /s

I shit you not, I‚Äôve seen people here on reddit who get *super* into that exact mindset to a frankly disturbing degree. Made all the moreso because the sheer *vitriol* those people have for anime artstyles of any kind leads me to assume it‚Äôs *entirely* projection.

It doesn‚Äôt help either that some people *also* treat their own opinions on what‚Äôs enjoyable as objective fact, and then fall into some sort of screeching rage-monkey mindset when confronted by someone else enjoying something they don‚Äôt must be delusional. Or worse, confronted by something they dislike being *popular.*

When those two groups overlap‚Ä¶.? Yeah. This is the kind of shit that happens."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Because ""Popular = bad/hate"" and tbh it's the Sonic fans who started all of this just for being the most vote in round 3 and suddenly attacking the CN Genshin with racial slurs and so the CN community voted Genshin just to piss the Sonic fans. They really did poked the wrong hornet's nest"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"*A* sonic fan from sound of it. Let‚Äôs not lump an entire community into the racist category because of some salty chucklefuck. Not that I have any dog in this fight, but it sucks they had to go and tank the voting."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"As far as I know, we; genshin player didn't care at all about this award. We care more about new update 3.3 contents and Mihoyo's Leaker hunt decree. We just vote for Genshin to pissed Sonic fans because they start throwing racist insult toward Chinese players."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I could count with my fingers of users that care about it. We were just chilling then suddenly out of nowhere some dickheads started controversy.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin has a cutesy anime style which is enough to get a lot of people(mainly Americans) extremely upset for some reason

This is despite its closest comparison maybe being botw which Reddit loved"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"In my experience, Genshin Impact is great if you focus only on the story quests and ignore trying to progress in level and equipment. After finishing the story quests, i'd recomend any player to uninstall the game.

I burnt myself repeating the same route dozens of times recollecting seashells and flowers to level up my characters, and doing the same repetitive dungeon another dozens times trying to get the equipment with the correct substats.

It is not worth it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,">Sadly, like the way of Fortnite, and minecraft before them, people who know jack shit about the game started hating on it and even major issues like alleged pedophilia, racism, etc.

It got hate before it even released. People called it ""BOTW"" clone and also disliked the fact it was gacha.

>Genshin is a wonderful game that could even be re-released as a complete standalone game in the future once the story is done.

I wish they did this though I know it'll never happen. Would honestly throw more money at a complete offline standalone version than I would in pulls."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yes, the ""Stray fandom"" part of my comment was mostly in jest. I doubt there are very active Stray communities."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yea i know i've read some comments. I still think it's dumb
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Wait, who is this Chris Chan?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I do agree that Genshin isn't the best game, but what things would you say are ""annoying about gaming these days"" that Genshin represents?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I would like a list of ""All the things."" 


Outside of being a Gacha game what are the rest of the terrible things it represents?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,3 more years and possibly more lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I tried playing it once after watching a glowing review but that high pitch anime voice was like nails on a chalkboard to me and I turned it off.  I'm sure it's a great game other than that.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"From its inception too. Being shot down as a BotW clone years before even being released, then the twitter mobs alleging -isms, then this."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Which community is it. Because genshins is 65 million active players.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ultimately it's a silly thing that doesn't matter but elden ring deserved everything lol
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Thanks for advise.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Most of the games I play right now are like a decade old so take that criticism with a grain of salt.

Fallout 3, New vegas, silent hill homecoming, destiny 2, grim dawn, cyberpunk2077 and I will be getting back into Witcher 3 when the free next gen upgrade comes in a few days."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Oh sorry for spoiling you üôà But yes Elden Ring got game of the year and some other award too forgot which one. All others basically went for God of War
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Wow, did you come up with that response all by yourself?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Any games but those two deserved the award. 
Sonic Frontiers as I expected anyway, was positively review bombed by children. So we can expect that Sonic, like Genshin's community, is filled with children. And as I said before, both communities are awful. More toxic than MOBA communities I reckon. I would rather have had a non-live service game win the award."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"> Dude, you're attacking Genshin fans 

Please don't lie.

> We can also see your commenting history and you've had quite a few things to say about GI.

Anyone can see my comment history and see that you're lying about this, too."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Its a chinese p2w gacha game that aggressively targets overseas whales. If malicious intent was a game it would be this.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Being able to mod it is part of what makes it perfect: it can be taylored to the needs of the specific person.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Nah it makes sense thanks for clarifying
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,[removed]
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don‚Äôt see why it would change depending on award

Find your Flame hits really hard tho."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Agreed. The soundtrack is fantastic and just keeps getting better every patch.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I really don't know how hard is it to just shut it, take the award, then gloat after all that's over. 

Even if they do gloat, I doubt the majority of the playerbase would care. They just were spurred on after the slurs and the ""beating up Lumine"" pic"

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't think he rushed the stage I think he blended in with the elden ring group and just walked up there with them.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Oh ok, I heard someone say that near the end of the speech but I had briefly looked away. I heard Geoff kind of dismiss it and move on but i didn‚Äôt know what it was about and assumed it was a preexisting meme."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm disappointed it had nothing to do with Guilty Gear.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He didn't rush to the stage though. He casually walked on with the rest of the ER team. And casually got to the mic and said it after the speech.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"did think he rushed the stage, he was already on the stage during the speech, and i guess everyone thought he was part of the team, and then after the speech was doen and everyone was walking away he grabbed the mic and said what he said. 

Or at least thats how i saw it"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,‚Ä¶.no
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What's funny is that people were making shit up like TGA was banned in China when they literally announced you can watch it on bilibili in China.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I think you'll be sorely disappointed if you believe that's the lesson they took from this.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Feels like this could end up in an Internet Historian video. Probably won't but the circumstances surrounding it are fascinating.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,That‚Äôs the best lesson of all
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Lesson learned don't pull the race card when you have no proof
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"65 million active players for genshin, thats more than all other nominies for the goty combined."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What you said is valid. dont worry. I'm glad you said it.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"But seriously though, why do people call Genshin players as pedo?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It won Best Mobile Game in 2021, which from there, the expectation that they would give us more rewards was set."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I mean, is it stupid, trying to stop somebody from having fun with a thing you don't like? Yes, very much. Is it also entertaining when the whole thing blows up in everyone's faces? Yes, yes it is and I love it."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The degenerates that frequent anime themed stuff make the entire community look bad. It's same case for Sonic fans. We hear about weirdo obsessed Sonic fans, but rarely the normal ones because they don't make news."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Genshin only played by pedos? My man you should get 63 Millions of demands by Calumny, quick, edit the post!"

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Hard to not lump a community together when posts being incredible racists to the Chinese and calling an entire player base pedos gets thousands of upvotes and any complaints to it get downvoted/flamed. 

It doesn't really show that those people are shunned by the sonic community, instead it shows that their thinking is widely accepted."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I'm a daily genshin player not involved with any communities and was mostly blissfully unaware of this whole drama. I'll admit that despite not wanting to care about any of this, hearing about some in the Sonic community doing this would have made me want to get involved to spite them too lol. Now with this all behind us, I kind of look forward to about 5 more pulls for a chance at the wanderer lmao."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,actually some of us (to not say most of us) do care about genshin winning because mihoyo(goofy ahh brand) usually gives out primogems when genshin wins an award
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The level of grinding in Genshin is extremely casual compared to any mmo ever.

Like it's locked to 30 minutes gameplay or whatever a day"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yes after two years I finally learned that. I‚Äôm currently cleaning out my quest list to kill my since of fomo & for no own i hope on only for story quest or if the current event is actually fun.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,How did you not bring up exploration lol. It's prob the best thing about it. I usually ignore the story for as long as I can while I just roam around the world. New locations to explore is far more interesting than the story.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That's like every game, man. You have the option of blazing through the main storyline, or be a completionist min-maxer.
That's not a unique thing to Genshin. 

At least in GI, you are limited to 30mins to 1hr play per day by a stamina counter so you won't burn 10-15 hrs doing farming routes. There's also no pvp or ranking or whatever tryhards do to populat a rankings board."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why? Its been explained to you.

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"We are already back to regular schedule with 3.3

But damn, why Ranni no get award :("
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Nah I've been playing ever since PS1 era and have played everything you mentioned down to the bone, excluding CP2077, I'm struggling to get through it rn cause it's so unpleasant and I def will replay Witcher 3 a third time with the new update. You'll never see each game's beauty if you never give them a chance and look at them through rose-tinted glasses. I agree though, Ragnarok is boring as much as I love and ant to continue through the GoW story. You'd love Fromsoft games as long as you have the patience to learn a bit how to play, they're definitely not like the common modern game, a lot more like all the old school greats."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The game is stupid easy and there's no pvp lmao this is a very non p2w game as there's nothing to win

I wonder why security didn't immediately go on stage and take him away; perhaps they were hoping he wouldn't make an incident and just wanted to stand there. Evidently he was not satisfied with only being on stage."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I mean my source IS that I made it the fuck up
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I think technically rushing the stage means going on without permission
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I think that's more of tencent (who's like a huge invester in bilibili) hating genshin because they couldn't buy genshin's developers - iirc they deliberately didn't announce one of genshin's recent awards and got mocked by Chinese users.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The matured ones did. The toxic ones nope still in denial

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"Another tip, don't try to roll for every character, it's a waste of time and money, the game lets you complete almost anything with what they give you for free ( hence why hardcore players complain about the game being very easy).

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That's my take too.

As a long time Old School RuneScape player, when I hear something is grindy my reaction is always ""is it tho?"".

Genshin isn't bad at all when it comes to grind. It's a bit time locked if you're F2P, but there's so much to do you can still easily spend hours a day progressing without spending a dime."

To say a gacha game is not p2w is just not true. Gacha are the worst for it.

That being said, i'm sure you can still have your fun with it and play alot of the content even if you don't intend to spend."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It was immediately obvious by the body language that he didn't belong; constantly eyeing up the mic between translations, glancing at the sides at the likely huge glares from security/staff.

What I'm surprised by is that the audio engineers weren't primed to cut to the feed to the mic after From Software finished up; it would've neutralized the attempted sabotage and allowed security to scoop him up without a fuss. They had plenty of time but in the end, they let him spout his cringe anyway."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-12,Pyrocynical instantly knew the kid doesn't belong there.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"No because he calmly walked up with the others. Did Miyazaki rush the stage? Man just strolled up with the swagger of a ""best director"".

Saying rush the stage gives the impression he ran up near the end and started talking. Fact of matter is he was there prominently the whole speech and was neither escorted off nor did the engineers cut the mic the moment he started speaking.

Production caught sleeping."

zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Remember Chris Chan??? yeah ....
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,And GI fans are just celebrating the win.
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I gotta disagree with this. When people say a game is pay to win,  there's either pvp, or they're saying that progress in the game is artificially money-gated. Since Genshin has no competitive aspect and 99% of the game can be cleared *easily* with literally any characters, there really isnt a progress wall. The other one percent is endgame content and you're going to have a roster that can clear it by the time you really care about it. Even if you don't have the most meta characters, one of the best characters in the game is given to you for free and your free starter characters will be able to clear this game mode with some investment.

I'm not lying or exaggerating when I say that this game is so stupid easy that the gacha system only affects your ability to get characters/weapons you want, and never a character/weapon you need to progress. All a new character changes is your playstyle. Yeah the gacha characters give you more dps but it's the difference between doing enough damage vs doing more than enough damage.

There is an energy system in that timegates some of the character/weapon levelling mats. This aspect is the closest the game gets to a paywall. Even with that in place though,  there's so much content in the game, I feel like you'd have to be playing non-stop for days for that to actually lock your progress. Im willing to bet that most paying players aren't even paying to bypass this aspect - it's only whales paying here because it's more of an inconvenience than a progress wall.  

The game definitely has some very well-deserved criticism. But calling it pay to win just doesn't make sense to me."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"Not really, if a mod fixes a bug, how can it be unstable because of said bug?"
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"""Oh he's just thanking his rabbi, I guess he really was part of From- aaaah shit, I'm going to be fired."""
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,They were fading out and when the guy came to the mic the lowered the magic and brought the mic back up again cause they thought one of the Elden ring team wanted to say something. It looks like they were trying to do their job but got bamboozled
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"GI fans aren't one singular hivemind, they're a vast amount of people with very different opinions. Have some respect for them."
zgllzg,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Aye probably harsh of me to say the audio techs could've done something; rather whoever was in charge or had authority should've instructed them to be prepared to mitigate the attempted sabotage.

15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,What a kitten.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Stray really hit hard. Great game. End of game spoiler: >!I curled up next to the dead robot and pondered the whole time the lid opened. Then when the cat leaves screen for the last time, I felt something VERY powerful, and I don't even know what it was.!<"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,It's a different concept of game for the today's standards
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"So good‚Ä¶ great atmosphere, story, and so many great references to other stories and games too! I absolutely loved it. Wish it was longer, could have played it for another 20 hours."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"ikr! The ending was so sad, I ended up staying in the same spot for like 10 minutes bc i was too sad to move on at first"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Kitty
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I love cats, but I didn't rush to buy the game. I wanted to see reviews before I purchased, and most of them stated while the game is every short, it's very well done. 

I finally downloaded it and played it and was not disappointed. Everything about the game blended well and the different areas adding different immersive elements really brought it all together.

Even with the story (no spoilers), I couldn't help but wonder how it all came to be like this. Every area told a different story, if you looked for it, which I did on the next play through because I had to experience it again, this time taking more time to explore.

It's a haunting game, and I'm so glad I played it.

I'm sure I'm not alone when I say Stray 2 cannot get released fast enough."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,This made me feel both lost and belong.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Stray was a pleasant surprise to be sure. Short game but that kinda makes it work. The atmosphere was incredible.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I was disappointed when we didn't have the opportunity to find its family after opening the gates. But it still was a beautiful game to play, I just wanted to see them reunite."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I was put off a bit by the controls when I first tried it. I went back right before it dropped off PS plus and I'm going to buy a copy now just to 100% it. It's definitely not for everyone, but I really liked it"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Engaging story with a beautiful and interesting aesthetic.  I loved it and hope to see more interesting content from the creators.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I fucking hate cats and I still enjoyed it
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"This game brought so much of the gaming world together in the kind of positivity that not many games manage - I'll always be thankful for the time where my timeline was just filled with people and their cats enjoying the pretty little cat game.

Also, it was a damn great game too. Enjoyed every moment of it and can't wait to see what's next from these folks."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Just bought it yesterday. Enjoying the hell out of what I have played so far. Even before I started though I had to turn cat deaths off.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Oh my, I almost forgot about this game! I bought it a while ago, but for some reason I haven't played it yet. OP, thank you for reminding me about it!"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I thought this was Cyberpunk for a moment like yes.. Takemura wanted our love all along and that's the bitter sweet ending to an incredible game
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I expected the game to be cute but what i didn't expect it to look so stunningly gorgeous on OLED, it was such a beautiful sight!"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,No game ever made me cry harder than this one.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I was gonna stop playing at the beginning when the cat got hurt üò≠ im glad I pushed through tho
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,You didn‚Äôt cry shut up üòÇ
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Bought this game coz of the buzz created by the online gamers and went downhill while playing.Seriously 

wasted my pocket money on this shit."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Loved this game. Gutted I had to save in the control room and there was literally 30 seconds of game left  when I was looking forward to more stray.

Unexpectedly awesome gsme"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I never got that far. I was so put off by it that I gut my first steam refund ever.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I cried too
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I just couldn't play this game

Seeing this cute little guy get hurt and cry for his friends at the beginning was too much for me"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I was playing this and stopped (just got past the prison) because I was not having any fun. I‚Äôm glad people like the game, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,You will hate the ending of Starfield.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I love this game i would like be an open world
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I was disappointed when we didn't have the opportunity to find it's family after opening the gates. But it still was a beautiful game to play, I just wanted to see them reunite."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-27,"I was really excited for Stray because I saw that the cat was running on rooftops in the trailer and I was hoping for the kind of freedom and exploration that Mirror's Edge Catalyst offered. The game delivered that at first, but as it went on the exploration became very limited. Rooftops got replaced with narrow streets with no way to get to the tops of buildings, so after that I didn't enjoy it as much. I loved the story and the world, but in terms of the quality of the gameplay it felt kind of like a school project, like they started off wanting to do something really ambitious but had to quickly wrap it up once the deadline got close."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Oh man me too! I was bummed that I wasn't able to go backwards, I never found all of the flowers for that one lady!"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I was SO SO sad there wasn‚Äôt a roam mode after beating the game. I convinced myself there would be and was so bummed when it ended and that was it.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Yup, this is why I ended up quitting the game, was too tightly controlled.  A similar concept but more open-world would be amazing."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,The bestest!
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Damn that's exactly how I felt! I was like... fuck man... it just felt too real for a moment
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I wish we could have taken him with us. There was something unbearable about just leaving him lying there.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Oh 100%, it was truly refreshing"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Same! I finished it in 5 hours and was so bummed about it. Such an amazing story!
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Yeah, it went by way too fast! But at least with a short game, I can look forward to many, many replays."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I know. I couldn‚Äôt leave the room. That part was devastating. I felt the very end was hopeful though.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,I was actually mildly angry for a week over this.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Yeah I bought it day 1 on xbox but was side tracked on skyrim. Jumped on it today and finished in 5 hours but it was so worth the price of admission!
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I know! I hope the make a larger more freeroam style game in the future because that world was stunning!
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Oh boy, I died 9 times amd got an achievement so there's that lol. Also, search EVERYTHING. Before you move on to the next ""part"" make sure you completed everything that you wanted to. I missed some stuff thinking I could go back, now I need to replay it haha"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,I hope you‚Äôll enjoy it!
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,What put you off?
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Yeah, that initial fall was rough. Please consider giving it another chance though. It‚Äôs a wholesome and uplifting game, despite its sad parts."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,You weren‚Äôt that far from finishing it. It‚Äôs very short.

15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I hated the zerg parts. I quit doom eternal because I could master the double jump drift magic button mash sequence.
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Hahhah I know the feeling, I still get sidetracked on skyrim. Somehow they keep getting me to buy it again"
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"It just wasn't what I was advertised. The controls were not intuitive and at some point I just couldn't figure out what to do. I kinda wanted cat simulator with a touching story and instead I felt like I was being asked to just figure it out. This is one of those games (IMO) that's just as enjoyable watching a let's play, if not moreso."
15xqbkx,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Ironically, I found the game very intuitive. I don‚Äôt recall it having a particularly great tutorial system though."

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Anyone getting upset about the comparison of a laid back, relaxing visual masterpiece where you get to do cat things and a savagely brutal non stop action murder fest needs to step back and get some self perspective. God of War is fantastically fun (for me, the originals, not liking the newer one), supremely cathartic, and a great waste of time. Stray is totally different. It's relsxing mostly. It's neat to look at. It's different. It's not threatening Kratos in any way. It's the latest, buzziest pop culture thing, and it's a nice break from living out violent revenge fantasies."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Christ enough with the Stray references already

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,A little context might help: Stray recently surpassed God of War as the highest rated game on Steam.

That said, I'd just like to mention how much I hate games that try to have it both ways. Like Fallen Order where you swing around one of the most dismembering weapons out there, but no dismembering takes place.

I think if a game can't take the gore, it shouldn't have content that would realistically end in gore."

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"I think he did that to Hercules because he didn‚Äôt want to fight his brother, but Hercules was brainwashed by Hera and wouldn‚Äôt listen to reason. I interpret it as Kratos thinking Why‚Ä¶punch‚Ä¶Didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶punch‚Ä¶You‚Ä¶punch‚Ä¶Listen‚Ä¶punch."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-27,"And the way they pivoted in the latest installment was masterful. It's unbelievable how much more mature of a ""Rated M for Mature"" game that is compared to it's heritage. It's almost metatextual in how it looks back at the franchise with shame in the same way Kratos does his past actions.    
Maybe I'm reading to much into it, but, death of the author means it's valid lol."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Oh yeah he clearly is so much wiser in the new game and there is hints that he is ashamed of a lot of things he did in his past . Such a badass though lol
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,yeah that's why he was so reluctant to get the blades of chaos
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-27,"I once found this in a comment section on YouTube of cutscenes from GoW (2018), but at the scenes where his son goes into full on rage quits in battle. Kratos gets pretty upset at him for doing so and tries to teach him to control his anger. Someone once pointed out it‚Äôs as if Kratos saw his past self in Atreus."

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,yeah I was streaming on my discord because everyone wanted to know if it was actually any good.  they all immediately like why does the cat meow so much.  because O is meow and I like meow noises.  they muted the stream to watch after that. i would also trip the robots and push things off ledges/knock over books as much as possible.  I wanted that full cat rpg experience ya know.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,When I was running away from the zurks for the first time I unlocked the 100 meow achievement as I was spamming the button making sure I would shake them off me. My cat was just sprinting and meowing at the same time haha

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Love the originals. Can't get into the new one. Just feels slow, smile, and repetitive. Enjoying Stray though. Slow and sloppy is great in a random ""be a cat' game, not so much in a GoW game."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"It's decently good and something new, also pretty easy and very atmospheric with a cool soundtrack. It's definitely not the 2nd coming of Christ like the cat nuts on the internet seem to be implying, the gameplay itself is kinda bland if you look at it objectively. In terms of length it's about 4-5 hours long so you decide if that is worth your money or not."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Well, it's not a bad game, I enjoyed it. But honestly a little overrated if you ask me. You being a cat is like 50% of why the game gets so much positive response I think. 

The other 50% is still very valid though! Great story, decent gameplay and an amazing atmosphere!"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Short game, on the easy side, some parts are pure exploration. Being a cat really does carry it. 

However the story, attention to detail, character animation and world design are all incredible. Stray has passion put into it, a rare thing in modern games, and most of your progress is through very catty behavior."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"its cute, i'd wait a few months for when its on sale"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Meh, I'd wait for a sale. It's like ohh cool, I'm a nimble cat, and then all platforming elements are just ""hit A to jump to next ledge"". Like, you can't miss a jump or jump wherever you like.  It feels very limiting."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"It's 100% an adventure game with good visual detail. If that fits your desires, then sure. It's about 10 hours to 100% the game, so at 30 U.S. dollars, you're talking 3 bucks to the hour."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"I love it.  I've already beaten it once and am on my second playthrough. It's cute, adorable, sad at times, but it's unlike any other adventure game I've played.  you're a little kitty!  what's not to dig?"

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Good is an opinion of view ofc, but its well made, cute, atmospheric, controls are easy, sometimes little thrilling, has puzzles, the world is beautifully done, movement mechanics are simple but nice and somehow really immersive for me, the motions of the cat and other little things are realistic enough that they bring smile to my face.

Overall i really like the game. It draws me in, feels comfy, interesting and cute.

It is a good adventure game

Not fully played the game, probably still in quite early in the game. Maybe 1h+ in the game as im very prone to explore. World is not big atleast yet though but there are fun side quests to do on the japanese vibed alleyways"

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,It's great! The atmosphere is amazing
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,100% recommend. It‚Äôs honestly such a relaxing game. There‚Äôs points when it‚Äôs a little tense due to some enemies but honestly the whole game was like a soothing balm for this kind of year.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"I was actually kinda disappointed, there's not much to do except trigger some prompt commands. The cat you're playing doesn't really react to the world (like it sees birds without doing anything), the jumping mechanic is pretty lame imo since all scripted and in the end you just meow or run, no other stuff to do as a cat. The physics are also terrible, you'll walk through anything like it has no weight which is already weird in most games but even more so as a tiny cat. 

But yeah the settings are very pretty and the word they built is very interesting, the gameplay is just too lazy imo. Like give us some actual control over the jumps, add some different stances for the cat that we can pick, some hidden things to find, etc."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"It's not so much a game as it is an experience. There is little actual game play outside of running around on fetch quests, a few sneaking sections, and a few running sections. It's not a complex game at all.

But the atmosphere and story telling are top notch. It takes what would be like a 3-4 for game play and turns it into a solid 9 for an experience. Absolutely worth a purchase, but maybe wait for it to go down to $20. 

Also, it's a very short game. Ther is even an achievement for beating the game in under 2 hours."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Eeehhhhhh...
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Treat it as a narrative game first. Kind of like a 3d Limbo. The gameplay is *there*, but it's not the focus.

The setting is the focus. The atmosphere, the soundtrack, the aesthetic, and the cat's interaction with the world is the focus.


Gameplay is mostly fluid-ish movement, and environmental puzzles.

No waypoints or quest markers exist. You're immersed in the world. You are a cat. If you have cats, you know their lives aren't always action and excitement. There's a lot of just hanging around, being a cat. 



Press O to *meow*."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"No, barely a game."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Stray is an awesome game. I started a second play through immediately after finishing. World building is 10/10.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,I enjoyed it throughly. I took my time and tried to complete everything as I went and it took me a good 7-8 hours. Really good story and fun puzzles. Atmosphere and music are sweet. I paid the full $30 on ps4 and don‚Äôt regret it.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Worth the buy, having a lot of fun with it"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Its fun being a cat but it gets boring fast because the platforming kills your mood

Negative bandwagons are the best example for this: it was cool to hate CP2077 for bugs even though it didn't even have more bugs than any Bethesda game ever. Just underdelivered expectations.

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"It took me a while, but the story is absolutely worth it. Just play it on the lowest difficulty.

Truly though, combat is no longer God of War's most fun part, and I won't say it's okay."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-27,You‚Äôre missing out
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Yeah [the satisfaction of being a cat](https://youtu.be/wb8px-z1y9o?t=30) certainly seems to be the main selling point that turns it into a highlight for some players. The cat behaviour and movement are all very nicely done after all.

Those who just approach it as another game without that fascination naturally aren't going to be as hyped by it."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"I put it in the same ballpark as Goose Game, or Little Nightmares. 

It‚Äôs a short and perfectly sculpted experience that doesn‚Äôt ask too much of you. Just absolute vibes. 

Goose Game is focussed much more on its chaotic energy, I will admit. 

It‚Äôs the sort of game you come back to once a year or so and play on a rainy weekend."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"100%-ing it would increase the hours played - and it‚Äôs said to be an easy platinum.

Would also require a second play through for one of the trophies."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,The gameplay is so bland I think watching a playthrough and saving money is an option.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,The music and the small details does it for me. And the fact you can do dumb cat shit even as the situation looks more dire is my favorite bit
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,You forgot the best part - you can make the sad robots smile.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,The 50% of you being a cat is also very valid.  They went to great lengths to animate things in a way that looks and feels realistic.  The limitations of where the cat will and won't jump to are for the most part spot on.  You can also turn all the button prompts off for a completely HUD free experience so you have to think about where a cat could get to and what it could interact with (a lot of times being places a human could never reach).  The advantages and limitations of being a cat tie into the story and objectives as well.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"The gameplay is walk and press button prompts for your character to do anything, aka it has no real gameplay."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"That sounds right up my alley, how is the soundtrack for this game"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,I do love immerse adventure games
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"I‚Äôm with you. I was a little caught off-guard by how melancholy it is. There were a few times in the game where my wife and I were just like,
Damn. We are going there huh?"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,That sounds good I love adventure games and I wanted to play this because I liked the idea of a cat to play as since my cat past away a couple of months ago and then I seen this game I‚Äôll give it a try
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Really enjoy the game but glad I got it on Playstation Plus, considering the short length."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,I did this too. Upgraded
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,One more question did you upgrade to only extra and got the game. I upgraded to premium... If so.. Well shit. Have to downgrade or research some more. It was very unclear imo when i looked into it. And.. Yeah or maybe im bit stupid :D
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,":( well from your response and same as others gameplay wise the game is not the best but everything else as visual, audio etc. is well done but not worth the full amount, I might as well wait for it to go on sale"

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Imo eve the cat stuff is rough. Using buttons to react to certain things forces weird animations sometimes. Like they didnt plan for you approaching something from behind so the animation zooms you to where they *did* plan.

If it is an single player FPS and it get good reviews chances are I will like it. I might take a quick peek at a trailer before I buy it.

Some developers deliver quality stuff or games I like. FromSoft for example. Barely watched a trailer. Basically ignored it until launch only getting some glimpses of it on the Internet.

There are some franchises I really like. If a new Mass Effect game comes out I'm probably going to play it.

Usually though I do watch a trailer or research a game before I buy it, but I do try and keep it as spoiler free as possible.

I love getting suprised and discover things as they happen. If I play a Star Wars game I want to find out while playing that I am a jedi not via a ""jedi gameplay"" trailer. Even if the reveal is only 2 hours in to the game."

Even small moments like ""press O to meow"" is better find on your own. Might give me a little laugh. If I ever play it now my reaction will be ""yep, there it is"". I recently started to watch the boys and I recognized some of the memes. ""Oh yeah that's that meme"" was my reaction.

I played Bioshock Infinite without really knowing anything about it and I think that made the game a lot better. I did not know what to expect. I didn't even know there was magic in the game. I did the same with Skyrim. Was really surprised to find out I was a dragon born. I did not know i could become a jedi in KOTOR.

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,">Is every single fucking comment praising a product somehow paid marketing?

yes

Everyone knows that _real_ people hate everything - if you're in any way positive about something, you're trying to sell something. Duh."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"If it's a 50/50 shot real praise or advertising, I'm treating it as advertising everytime"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"Now I want to play Mario and only kill the enemies I have to. That's probably how a speed run works, though."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-27,Probably one of my favorite moments in the game was when there were two robots playing a game and I jumped up to say hi and ruined their game. The fact I got a trophy for it was even better lol

w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,I didn't take anything as anger.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,You probably shouldn‚Äôt be in a gaming sub if you never want to see a spoiler ever. Get over yourself.
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"and what? Because the internet exists I MUST know about a video game before buying it?

If I buy a video game I know nothing about are the cops going to come and shoot me?

Lmao, you're trying so hard to have a point but you literally have nothing."
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,Okay what the fuck. That was a god damn trip
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"God you are a fucking dweeb, anyone who wants to waste their money on a game they know nothing about is free to do so. It‚Äôs your money you‚Äôre wasting lmfao


‚ÄúTrying so hard to have a point‚Äù you‚Äôre taking it too serious bro. Get off the internet, go take a walk. Worked up over nothing"
w8j273,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,"You're calling me a Dweeb about something that doesn't affect you what so ever, and yet I'm taking the internet too seriously... 

lmao, okay bud."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I am absolutely loving this game so far. So many little details like this. It's so charming
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"The ""why you do this to me"" walk"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Well my cat just stands still for a few seconds and then falls over, she wont move until I free her."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Wait is stray out
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Every F‚Äôing day it‚Äôs the same BS struggle with my AH cat. 

He knows it‚Äôs time for a walk, because he bitches about if we don‚Äôt go. Get the leash, try to put it on, and I‚Äôm calling A&E for stitches.

Eventually we get the leash on and it‚Äôs the crouch walk until he sees a bird in the garden, and the leash doesn‚Äôt bother him again 

We‚Äôve been walking him every day for the last 3 years."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I have tried to harness my cat because she keeps pulling her collars off. She fights me to put it on and then she flips out and runs around the house trying to escape from it. I stopped trying to harness her after that. If she won't wear the collar, or the harness, then she can stay an indoor cat. 

We have a lot of wild animals around, I don't want an eagle or vulture to think she's bite sized (we've seriously had some massive buzzards fly over our yard, they're pretty intimidating), or for her to get in a fight with a fox, so I want to try to supervise her outside if at all possible. At least until she gets used to it and I'm sure she'll stick close. Also a tether to keep her from hiding under the porch indefinitely. But she won't let me get her dressed. Maybe I'm worrying over nothing, but I'd rather keep her inside where it's safe. 

Also she has long fur, which is hard enough to deal with as it is, I don't need her walking through the thistles and getting THOSE tangled up in her fur too."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Fun fact: Cats actually use what they feel around them with their bodies to navigate along with their other senses. So when you put a harness or sweater on them, it's similliar to making them precieve a wall or some other obstacle in the environment touching them. Which is why you'll see them do this kind of movement, they are actively trying to avoid what they are precieving. It's kind of hard to explain the concept though.

edit: damn my all my years on reddit and now my 5th highest upvoted comment is a cat fact

edit2: Now it's my 2nd highest upvoted comment, damn guys lol"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"That flop too.
Love all the details they put in this game."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It‚Äôs the walk of an animal who is not yet certain they can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶duck underneath the obstruction if they crouch low enough.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The mocap on the flop and the weird crouch walk are so well done.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I laughed really hard at that point, very realistic."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Ok... Now I believe it's made by cat lovers.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My kitties did this when they were getting harness-trained! Very realistic. Well done devs!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Tried to put one of our cats in a harness, he just went stiff and dramatically fell over, refusing to move unless we rook it off. Once we did he sprang right up, demanding pets. As you do."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat only walks backwards when she's in a harness
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"What game is this, sorry am new in the gaming world"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I keep the cat's harness on him. He got used to it. but this reminds me of the first time he got one :)
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"If you blink really fast, you'll notice you still get the exact same FPS"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"That bit cracked me up.

Absolutely love everything about the game itself. My choice to play it on PC with my gamepad/mouse combo was stupid, and I suck at the ""combat"" (I think I just heard King Arthur yell ""Run away!""), but that's every non-mmo I play."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"You can tell the Devs all owned cats at some point.  The details are great.  However my biggest disappointment came when I started the game and realized there was no mechanism to choose my cats appearance, I thought I was gonna get to pick what cat I was :("
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat uses one and this is so accurate lmao
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I love when the cat wears a paper bag on its head and the controls are completely reversed.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This part was perfection It was so accurate. So many little details.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,That's probably the first thing they captured when they put the motion capture suit on the cat.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is Stray that  good or are they just massively successful at manipulating the front page with post floods between ‚Äúmy cat watches stray on the tv‚Äù to ‚Äúcheck out these cool features‚Äù. The marketing push on this game has been ubiquitous across Reddit in the last 48hrs.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The flop is perfect.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I love that if you meow at a cam (before getting to the bot), it nod at you. Really cute game"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This game is the new Journey in terms of emotional affect and excellent execution.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I legit assumed the game glitched
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,They've got the cat like behaviors down perfectly
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,[removed]
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Motion blur is wild..
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I have an orange cat and when I tried putting him in one this happened. When this happened in the game I lost it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I ran straight into the bedroom to tell my GF that the cat in the game did the clothes thing!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cats have never evolved passed the flop over stage of harness training
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Thanks for making me lol so hard at work, this game looks awesome and the harness sequence is so faithfully depicted. Brought back lots of bittersweet memories of trying to take my princess for a walk, only to have her alternate between a pet rock and a cripple."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What is this game?? Srry I‚Äôm uncultured
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,So accurate but usually the just wouldn‚Äôt move at all
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I loved this part!! There's so many times your just reminded that you're a cat!!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I showed this to my wife, and she fucking tells me ‚Äúoh, so basically it‚Äôs a game based on you?‚Äù

I have never felt so personally offended, and yet simultaneously so deeply in love with her all over again after that comment."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat just tries to shimmy backward out of it and bumps into furniture or the wall.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My daughter and I had a good laugh at that. She‚Äôs 5. Loves it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,These developers have been annoyed by a cat before and it shows
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,The lying down like you put a thousand pound weight vest on him
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I swear that one of the application requirements to work on this game was: Developers needed! Must own cat(s).
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Also if you lay a piece of tape over their back. Not even firm enough to stick to any fur, just lay it lengthwise on top."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Lol thats so accurate! My cat lost 50% agility when I put him some clothes
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Cats always pretend like the harnest is killing them
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"If you put my cat into a harness and pull her forward a bit, she starts walking backwards all the time"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,As a non cat owner I wondered wtf was going on
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This looks hilarious. I need it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Ngl, I'm not much a cat fan, but this game is gonna be a hit for sure.

It's so damn perfect in every details that make me get even more scary about cats!"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I played this part of the game last night and it made me laugh so hard. They nailed how cats behave
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Can confirm. I went to a minor league baseball game this past weekend and it was ‚Äútake your pet to the ballpark day.‚Äù  People brought all sorts of critters, including various reptiles, a duck in a baby stroller, and at least 1/2 dozen cats walking just like that."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Question is the final game as choppy as this looks or is this a recording problem?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,They act like we attached a 10Ib weight to their backs when we try to put a harness on. Lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I am loving this game so far.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Move away dishonored 2 I have a new favorite game
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,That initial flop tho <3
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat never got up just said fuck you and laid there till I took it off
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Mine just flat out refuses to walk in a harness. Like he forgets how to.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I‚Äôve never heard of Stray until like a week ago and now I‚Äôm seeing content for it everywhere. What happened?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,One cat we trained from a kitten with a harness. The other cat will just continuously back up trying to get out. He doesn‚Äôt stop backing up. We break the cat. It‚Äôs funny then sad.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I love this game so much. All the details they put into this on how the cat behaves makes me appreciate my cats that much more.  Fuck the Zurks though‚Ä¶
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,So fucking accurate üòÇüòÇ
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What game is this omg?!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Damn i didn‚Äôt know this game was out already. Might have to scoop it. How is it?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Why does it look so stutterly
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is there a part where the cat gets booties and it does the shakey-walky?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The cats ears would be back!! UNPLAYABLE!   /s
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Why does every post of this game make it look like shit? First ps2 looking graphics, now laggy as hell gameplay?? I get wanting to show the game off but your systems make it look awful"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat just falls down and dies. End of clip.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Yes cats do this in real life they aren't used to having harnesses on their body so they crouch walk lol my cats do this lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I don't have a cat and I thought that the vest was really heavy lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Amusing. Depends on the cat. My Siamese cats, a harness never seemed to bother them. My big brown tabby reacts just like this, though."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Amazing.  Yes - that walk.  Then I gave it a heart attack when I removed the harness and the velcro made That Sound.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I‚Äôm downloading this right meow! I can not wait to play!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I don't think I've ever enjoyed playing a game more than this one.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,god damn put it on xbox
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I wanna play this so bad, can't wait to start working again"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,OMG I LOVE IT. My cat does the same when I put his thunder shirt on
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Lol you left out the best part where your little robo-companion gets flustered and says that the harness was designed for ""small quadrupeds"" and how could the cat possibly not like it."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This just sold the game so hard to me lmao
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"one of my cats is cool with it, we used to take him for walks.  not sure about the other 2, they are scared of the outside."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Looks like a fun game lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Well thanks a lot. I was trying to hold off buying it. Now I got no choice.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Sure this game isnt going to be in contention for GotY or anything but its by far the best indie game I‚Äôve played in a long time.
Very fun and touching."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,OH GOD the fraaamereateee MY EYES
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Bro it's so accurate though
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,That was it. The moment I decide to buy this game.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Loving stray
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,I can't handle the cuteness. Only thing missing is a customizable kitty.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"I think I need this game, especially as a cat person"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Ah the newest heavily advertised stylish platformer!

Doesn't appeal to me but I wish these ads were less ""WoOk aT tHe KiTty"""
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I haven't even play this game and I love it already.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I see they're marketing this game pretty hard.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I was watching day9 play this last night and he made a good point.

That up until this point you were playing as a cat and having to interact with stuff as a cat.

Then you get this robot companion that can talk to people and operate door pinpads etc and now you are basically interacting with the world as a person in cat form."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"for 30$ on steam,, it is a good buy?,, was thinking to buy it for my kids"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I want to play this so bad, but my laptop can't run it, I don't have a PS5, and my friend won't let me borrow his even though he's not playing it

Edit: thanks to everyone encouraging me to buy this on my laptop anyway. It actually runs great!"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I was cackling so hard at this scene
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I found a glitch the other day where you can jump on the planks that was destroyed and hover
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I really wish this was on xbox, actually want to play it pretty bad."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,So is there some cool plot to this or are you just a cat?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Why do I see this cat simulator everywhere ?!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"A shame this game isn‚Äôt on the Xbox, PlayStation fanboys win this round"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"For every moron that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù this game or why it‚Äôs blasted all over the place, let me simplify it for you:  Cats go meow and are cute as fuck.

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I can't get over the framerate? What are you playing this on?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What is this?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Should I buy it? I'm considering.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Non related question, why is everybody is posting this game? Isn't it just goat similator with extra steps? People think like it is another elden ring or something."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Does the framrate really look this bad
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,dogs are better than cats. change my mind.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The new Cat Simulator looks pretty good! When will it be out of beta?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Let‚Äôs just spoil the game immediately
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"very smart to make a mediocre game that will pander to the cat fanatic market who will share all 5 of the things the cat does incessantly.

so much wasted potential and a mediocre plot. but hey, the cat scratches things and they even force it into the gameplay 4 times."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Still waiting for PS5 to release this for their Premium Monthly game....


Edit: it wasn't in the MONTHLY GAMES like I would expect. It's in the full catalog for Premium....."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"WAIT WAIT WAIT ITS ALREADY OUT? NOOOOOO I PASSED THE RELEASE... WHERE IS IT PLEASE I NEED IT. Ig on steam? Wait how is it called again?

Edit: okay sometimes it's helpful to first read the comments and than write one lol. I found out that it came out yesterday and the name ist stray. ""sometimes emotions lead to stupid actions"" zitat from idk who cuz i forgot. Is that even from someone? Idk it just popped up in my head lol"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Can you add an spoiler tag next time?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,We have had two boy cats and both do this. Never could get them to walk no matter how long we leave them in it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Hahaha, as someone that recently got a cute little harness for my own kitty, I know exactly how this is! Such a great little detail!!"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat tries to back out of it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My cat displayed the same behavior when I put on his ""thunder shirt.""  Trying to help the little guy get over his intense fear of storms and loud noises.  Anyone need a used thunder shirt?"""
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Well. At least one person who made the game is friends with a cat.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The cat should have fallen over at least a few more times.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"The action time was great, with that and the quite horror city it make me pump up the adrenaline"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,these type of details made me laugh so hard. truly awesome
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"This game is what sold me on upgrading to ps+extra. The game costs $40 CAD and my upgrade for 2 months was only $8.

Still might change it back before my renewal date but we'll see if I get enough use out of it.

I'm kind of an Ark addict so don't play many other games."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The ACCURACY of this part had me laughing. My cats lost their minds hearing the meows and seeing the butterfly in the opening bit.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Tangential: I have a friend who will rant about how outdoor cats are mass murder machines and therefore it's a cardinal sin to allow a cat to roam outdoor without a harness.

Do other people share this view or is it a niche crackpot thing? He made it sound legit but I'm just wondering how popular this notion is."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I wish there was an animation where the cat walks backwards trying to get the harness off without success.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I laughed out loud. This game is so unbelievably charming, visually stunning, and stuffed full of lovingly crafted little details... front runner for GOTY in my book."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I have never owned a PS system nor have I ever had the desire, but this cat game has me tempted to try and find a PS5, no lie"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My cats were so smart they always played dead if we'd see them wear their harness.
It's a big city so we didn't want them to go outside on their own, and the instructions said that we should put on the harness and let the cat get adjusted to it one or two days. And they always walked with the harness, but only if no one was looking. If you snuck up on them, you could see them sit or stand, but as soon as you made a sound they would fall over and not stand up until we left the room again."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Never got past the collapsing part.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The best part of this game is that everyone you meet treats the cat like it is just a very small person.

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What is this game? Please tell me I must have it I love cats and have two of my own.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What game is this? I keep seeing it on Reddit
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Will this ever be on Xbox?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is this game on stadia?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My cat does this with a collar. Pretty sure she would disembowel me if I tried a harness
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I hope it‚Äôs as fun to move around as the car as it was to move as that dolphin in Echo.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This part made me laugh really hard cuz this is something my cat does lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"That game is fresh, I kind of love it"

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"my sister's cat took to it instantly honestly. he loves going outside on the harness, it's kinda funny if he hears it jingle he starts meowing incessantly"

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Game? I love this lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I said fuck it and just bought it on the ps app. Gonna get home in about 20 minutes and play all night. So excited!

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Got this game and absolutely loving it so far
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Would have appreciated a spoiler warning
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Son got me this as an early birthday gift. It's so dang cute! I have laughed, giggled and snorted. It's a tad confusing at times what I'm supposed to do and not a whole lot of help online, but I power on. Only issue is the mouse part is so sensitive I got very motion sick after a few hours, so will have to limit exposure. Other half said he definitely wants to get this game lol."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-22,"it will be a memorable experience for me (I dont usually play games like this: more of an nfs and pvp player)

but I really like cats (adopted 2 recently) that I will get  a platinum trophy on it no matter the time it takes"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Same here, I saw a trailer a couple months ago and was pretty curious and excited to try it out. So far it's actually even better than I expected! 

I was kinda thinking I'd just be a stray cat exploring, but there's a whole story to uncover and it's actually a lot of fun going through the areas. The graphics and art style are absolutely beautiful as well"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My nine year old loves cats. I mean *loves* them. When I booted this game up he was sitting right next to me and cried when >! the cat fell down the drain in the beginning. !<

We love all the purrs, noises, small cat details the devs put into Stray. 10/10."

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Same here. I saw an ad for the game on Reddit and immediately pre-ordered it. Love the game so much. The cat details are so adorable.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Did you get the 100 meow trophy yet?

This game is just awesome."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I ordered the physical from iam8bit so I wont get to play until December, but I'm stoked!"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What game is this?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This seems awesome! They were definitely cat coexisters
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,One of my favorite parts so far is when you stick your head in a paper bag and suddenly you can‚Äôt control where he walks because the poor little kitty can‚Äôt see anything
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Same, I'm loving it so much"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,What‚Äôs the game play like? All I‚Äôve seen is a cat walking around.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Hows the performance? This clip looks choppy af, but I really want to buy the game."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,I'm contemplating buying it. But I've heard it's extremely short and for the price tag idk if it's worth it

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,If you're playing this game: Have the cat take a nap when you can. It's so damn cute!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I‚Äôm thinking of getting this game for my nine year old daughter because she loves cats. However, I‚Äôve been hesitant because of a review I read that said there are several traumatic moments in the game that they hated. So far they are the only person I‚Äôve heard with this complaint. Do you feel that this may be a valid concern for a young child?"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My partner is just getting into PC gaming. They really dig cozy games that aren't too stressful (Animal Crossing, Cozy Grove). We're playing It Takes Two right now, and they surprisingly got into No Man's Sky for a hot minute.

Do you think Strays is good for someone who doesn't want to be stressed out by games?"

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Has it not been out for a while now? I thought I saw it on steam a few weeks back
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Out today
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Reminds me of my mom's dog. She had a little coat for him in the winter, since he had trouble staying warm in the snow and frost. But if he decided it was too warm for the coat, he'd just flop over and refuse to walk. Mom would put it on him inside and he'd immediately flop over, since it wasn't cold inside.

Then once we dragged him out he'd be like oh!! It's cold now! Ok! And he'd get up and walk his merry way around the yard, ever time."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,">AH cat

What's that?"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"The drama. Why is it that Instagram cats are so carefree with their leashes?

Mine did backflips as if the harness was burning his flesh."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Thanks for being one of the very few responsible cat owners who walk their pet on a leash instead of just letting it out pissing, shitting and destroying the wildlife all over the neighbourhood."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Ppl walk cats. That just seems strange.  Never seen ANYONE walk a cat
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My dog does the same. Runs away and hides when I take the harness out. We've had her since she was a puppy and she's had harnesses on forever. Still does the ""my waist hurts"" walk and walks in circles at home. The second she's outside with harness she doesn't care. She loves collars though."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I've been putting harnesses on my two long-haired indoor cats and taken them outside a couple of times this summer. They have been quite scared of going outside, so you definitely need the keep them on a leash so they don't get spooked and run away, and also to keep them from eating things that might be poisonous for them."

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Housecats are problematic enough as invasive predators themselves to warrant being kept indoors.

Good on you for trying to harness train yours, but ultimately domestic cats do not belong outside at all, except in the near east/north Africa where they're indigenous.

I love cats, but they're an ecological disaster."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Haha are we the same person?? I‚Äôm having the same trouble with mine. But I tell him if he wants to go play outside with the neighborhood puppies (he‚Äôs good with them all indoors 1-on-1) then he has to wear the harness because them‚Äôs the rules‚Ä¶
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It is always safest for the cat and for all other critters outside for them to stay as indoor only. You made the right choice.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"No, no. Not hard at all. You made perfect sense."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"In other ""animals are weird"" facts, dogs use the pads on their feet to tell if they're on a surface or not, which is why boots results in them doing exaggerated lifting feet movement; they think they're still standing in the ground."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Is that why my needy as fuck cat turns to liquid to avoid being pet?
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's similar to humans who use VR who know that they are in a safe space mentally and with their other senses but since our primary sense is sight we still feel weird with it, since cats primary senses are more physical they act this way."

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"My cat pays absolutely zero attention to his harness.  The first time I put it on him I was expecting the ""tip over"" or ""goofy walk"", but he just kept on trucking like nothing changed."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Seems like they could have improved the rotation animation.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Fun fact but it‚Äôs actually not mocap ! Animations were made from the scratch (based off a real life cat obviously) but BlueTwelve did not use mocap for it
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I've done just enough animation work to appreciate how hard animating animals in a realistic way is. Pretty much all of the animation work is amazing. The first five minutes where you're interacting with your cat posse just blew me away, so much work put in there."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,All of the devs' cats are in the credits
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Cat didn't try to back out of harness.  Emersion broken. 3/10^/s

So is Stray, the game."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I get a lot of these comments whenever I upload GIFs. It is a fine-line between encoding, frame-rate and file size. I know it sounds silly, but in my country fiber is not an option for a lot of people--it makes me more conscious of bandwidth. I want everyone to be able to enjoy my posts, without having to wait for a GIF to load."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,Give it a month and youll have mods for that.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's a cute little game with puzzles that need to be solved and a few action sequences where you need to outmaneuver enemies (sometimes while solving puzzles).

None of it was overly challenging, but it has a nice little story to it and a well-designed atmosphere. The NPCs were pretty charming and felt like real characters, rather than just two-dimensional set pieces intended to move the plot along. Maybe I'm a sap, but there were a few scenes that tugged at my heartstrings (particularly the ending).

I got it free through PS Plus Extra and I throughly enjoyed it. That being said, I probably wouldn't have payed $30 for such a short game with (in my opinion) little replay value."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's a walking simulator. There's no dedicated jump button so you literally just press X to magnetize from one platform to another.

I expected platforming or anything really, but the game is really all about pressing the stick forward while being a cat."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Cats are carried by their mothers in their mouths. So cats when pitched at the neck go limp. And this basically is a thing for them even once they grow up. So if you grab a cat's skin at the back of its neck it will stop moving.

Cat harness usually put some pressure on that area so cats react the same way as being grabbed there and you have those results:

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I‚Äôm in the same boat as you

After done scrolling I have come to the conclusion that it is called Stray"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,This is pretty much a normal cat reaction if you try to make it wear anything.  They eventually get used to it but usually not anywhere as quick as in the game
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's called Stray. Is only came out yesterday but I'd for sure recommend!
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's a charming little game. Im really enjoying it. It's a fun, interesting story too!"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Not everyone has a super computer, bruh"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,People posting a thing they like doesn‚Äôt make it an ad.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's not a platformer lol
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"They dont even need marketing for this game, the players do it all for them for free. Even still, without the players free marketing, they still wouldnt need to market, because cats."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It is considered an OK game if you are into cats. It isn‚Äôt going to be the best game you‚Äôve ever played but definitely an enjoyable, albeit short, adventure."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's not long, 6ish hours for most people, but I'm entirely happy with my purchase having just finished it."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,My gf and I played the entire game yesterday and it was incredible
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's very reasonably priced. It's about 5 hours long. I hear there is a second playthrough mode that changes it a bit?

It's very cute and adorable. If you have a lot of stress in your life this is a mostly great game to relax to and soak in the atmosphere of being a cat in the future.  There are some actiony bits, but so far it's been mostly relaxing and some puzzles for me"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Your laptop might be able run it better than you expect, what are your specs?

I'm currently playing it on my onexplayer with an integrated Intel xe GPU and I can pretty easily hit 60fps most of the time.
The issue is that the game's handling of resolution is kinda wonky, much like the god of war pc port. Essentially to run the game full screen you have to run it at native resolution and use the resolution scale but in practice the performance ends up being kinda bad this way. 
To get around this problem, set your desktop resolution to the resolution you want the game to run at, 1280x800 for example. That way, this value becomes the game's full screen resolution and you can scale down from there.

Don't be afraid of scaling down too, the game seems to have something like amd FSR built in that makes these low resolutions actually quite attractive, I don't think it's just the TAA doing this.

Hopefully this helps, one thing to note is that there's currently a shader compilation issue with the game that means it will stutter heavily at certain points, but this will clear up."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It's on PS4 as well if you have one if those
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Same. The husband and I lost when the kitty flopped, then got up and did the belly slink walk."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,The game is nothing but story. There's actually not that much exploration other than talking to NPCs and looking for some items that are pretty easy to find.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,it's the most realistic cat simulator since talking tom

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Game called Stray.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"In my opinion it's not really worth the full price. It's super short (only 5 hours) and it has zero replayability. It's a fun game and an ok story, but super linear and there's really not anything to do other than the story, so you would get the same amount of entertainment from just watching someone else play it on YouTube or Twitch that you would get from playing it yourself."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Don't know if you have a PS4/5 but it's included in the plus subscription.

I have one cat that absolutely does not mind being on a leash at all.  I have another 2 cats that just want to be outside near the back door and just hang out, eating grass and shit.  They'd rather not do the leash thing.  Luckily, they don't really go very far so it's been fine.

But every cat I've ever heard in my life have all loved going outside.  They might be scared at first of all the noises and stuff but they all get used to it and wind up being their happiest just rolling around in the grass."

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,oh yeh save time by getting a cat of all creatures to do what you want. I can't remember the show but a famous tv show spent ages trying to get a cat to jump onto a table for a scene and it took so long they settled for just letting the cat do whatever it wanted to in the back of the shot.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"As far as I know, motion capture (with humans as well, not just animals) is not really a time-saving feature. It's a way to introduce human actors into the game, and have some interesting or complex, genuine movements as a base ‚Äî but I've seen animators bitterly say that people have no idea how much work goes into the animation once the mocap is done. 

Basically, mocap data is a super rough draft that doesn't have the ""real"" animation itself in it (simply speaking). The animators have to rig the model properly so that the model looks natural when it does these moves, and THEN edit and refine every single movement by hand to get a quality result."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Mocap isn't always that helpful, it gives you loads of data that often need so much tweaking you might as well make it from scratch."

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Nah, this isn't indicative of the game really, just a very poor quality video. I played through the game and only had FPS drop a couple of times and it was just for a second while playing on an HDD."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Yeah the gameplay is basically the same the whole time so I mostly just pointed at shit after a while and stopped taking the controller from her

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Actually, it's not by the same people at all. Bluetwelve Studio (France) developed Stray while Mobius Digital (US, California) developed Outer Wilds. They are using different engines (Stray is Unreal 4, Outer Wilds is Unity).


Both are published by Annapurna Interactive. I don't think there is any overlap in actual developers, though."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,man reddit went soft. this place used to openly cheer for piracy. now its downvotes

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,Yep. One cat I know is well into her elder years and can still be scruffed if necessary. Another cat has zero scruffability and will just get pissed if you try it.
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"Yeah, no. Adult cats don't freeze when you hold them behind the neck. You'd know that if you ever had a cat ;)"

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"I believe I started around mid to late evening and ended up going until 6am. Entirely depends on what you do in game.

w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"French is way easier to learn than English. We have butchered, bastardized, and stolen words from so many other languages over the centuries, that we have precious few simple rules left and our grammar and syntax are confusing to learn at best.

French, on the other hand, has way fewer exceptions to the rules. The gendered nouns thing is a bit odd, but what language doesn't have a couple oddities like that?"
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,It doesn't even seem fun to learn at least not in school already 1 year in only thing I say is je ne parler pas  Fran√ßais

HLTB will probably start having good typical playthrough timings soon."
w3ct0k,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"And so by the arbitrary definition that you have chosen, progress is spreading off of the planet?  And with an arbitrary ""we"" as though the humans are a hive species in your eyes as opposed to individual accomplishments or personal meaning?

There is no great purpose or quest log for reality.  If that's what you see as the meaning of life, that's fine for you.  It definitely wouldn't match up with my own views, but everybody having their own views is fine in so far as it doesn't harm others.

Just don't mistake thinking that there is a preset meaning. Or that interpretation of meaning is more real than anyone else's. Including various animals that existed for millions of years quite happily before our little blip of existence.

...

Also, leading something with ""you sound confused"" because you can't understand other people will have different values than you is something you should think about.

I place no personal value on whether or not mankind leaves earth. No personal value on whether or not our species survives our own failings. None.  

My own views on the meaning of life have nothing to do with the future of humanity.  I'm an individual, not an ant."
yoo4ru,2022-11-07,2022-11-07,I honestly would love Gameboy Demakes of so many games. It was my first system and I still love it to this day.

The world building was excellent, and I love how it seemlessly moved between gameplay styles and tones as you move from area to area. One moment you're playing an adventure game, then it's a survival horror, then it's a stealth game. It also does a GREAT job at being a cat game."

1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I just finished the game with my kids. We love it. A little too short maybe but a very cool game.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I‚Äôm not the only one who just sat there and meowed for like five minutes at first right?? Right???
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And one of the rare single player games that isn't packed with crafting mechanics and upgrade trees.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I would like a game where I just explore. I loved exploring the city and meeting the inhabitants. Hated the parts where I had to outrun the xerg
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Stray is fantastic.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I didn't finish it, but I liked to pan the camera close to my character cat and make it meow to mess with my real cats."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Ngl it's one of the prettiest games I've ever seen
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,Is the gameplay fun? The game looks great but I'm not sure about the gameplay from the trailers I've seen.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Unfortunately it's just an innovative form of visual novel in my opinion. The game really needed deeper game mechanics where you should git gud to progress or at least could git gud to progress faster.

1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this game, and would have really liked it if it was a little longer!

It was all thanks to the PS subscription though, because I don't think I would have bought it."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I love how the cat participates in a world-changing event, but it just sits there grooming itself and looks back like ""meh..."" and then just saunters away."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Loved it, but too short... It had potential for many more sidequests"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It's an exceptionally well made game. I loved the world building, music and tone this game had. And besides the general cuteness which comes with playing as a cat, it was also such a wonderful examination of all the great things which come from having an animal companion."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,His fur though was disappointing.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Truly enjoyed this game myself.  Played through it twice.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Oh I absolutely loved it! The world building and setting were so good. That ending was also so incredibly sad...
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"My partner wants to love this game but it gives them mild motion sickness, any suggestions to help?"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,I think they spent alot on the cat stuff so that's why it's ab 2-4 hours.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,I think they spent alot on the cat stuff so that's why it's ab 2-4 hours.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,For real. I wanted him to see his old crew again.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I don't think it's overrated at all, but rather overpriced.

The game is great for what it offers but for a game that's relatively lacking in replay value, the price tag is a bit steep."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I had so much fun In the sewers or whatever that was fighting the monsters it was so ugly
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It could be a cat or a dog or whatever, still fun to play"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It's a great game for a weekend. Or even just a Friday night and Saturday afternoon. It wasn't terribly long and I pushed the play well beyond what it needed appreciating the environment and finding all the collectibles. Controls are smooth but the platforming holds your hand like a mofo. it was still a fun play and the story had me tear up a few times. I got really invested in the characters really fast.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,But do not pay full price for it. This is a 8-15 dollar game.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Fuck no, 40 dollars is crazy for what it is. It was beautiful and lovely and fun. But not 40 dollars worth. Ps plus was pivotal in my enjoyment of it too lol"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I got my 'sleep for 1 hour' achievement by not wanting to leave my buddy at the end. I just sat there and cried a little bit. Crazy this game was able to play my heart strings so completely.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Oh, i had this problem, and after searching, found that a bunch of other people also felt motion sick playing Stray. 

I forgot what exactly I did to go from throwing up to being able to complete the game, but I remember turning off the Motion Blur setting, reducing controller sensitivity and wearing my anti-motion sickness wristbands.

There are other threads and steam community discussions with better solutions, try googling for them, should be better than my vague recollections."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Fuel for potential sequel. I also would like to see more of‚Ä¶.. the eyes. You know the ones I‚Äôm talkin about.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Who is ""him""?

The Cat or the Professor?"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"How did they fuck that up? The game isn't that long, I hadn't forgotten that my goal was to find them. Everytime we lost a friend I tried to remember it was getting me closer to my pack. The ending really fucked me up."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I played it for free and loved it, but honestly it's 14 hours long and outside of the max Payne time trial achievement you can get everything else on the first pass. I'd say wait for it to go on sale for 8 bucks. But 40 is without question an insane price for what it is."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I thought it was overpriced at first. Then I started making my own game, now nothing is overpriced. That shits hard and takes so much time."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I bought it full price. I am a poor Eastern European gamer. Played it out once. Don't mind a cent I spent on it. Loved it all from beginning to end. Cannot name another game that was similarly enjoyable. Worth every cent
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,$20?
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It would still be fun to play, but I think it's important that the way you traverse that world *only* makes sense if you're a cat. Dogs don't jump up on railings and rooftops or through small gaps in windows the way the cat in Stray does"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Yeah I even thought that after getting the platinum, it was too short and I'm glad I didn't purchase it üòÖ"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I also lay down for a while with my buddy and sat thinking about its passing. It got me. Wonderful game.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,OMG! I did the same thing! I just couldn't go on...
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Oh those are some great tips, thanks! I'll try checking out steam community discussions as well, glad we weren't the only ones with the issue"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Not sure if it's just hype or not but Annapurna showed a teaser today for their Showcase coming later this month and it showed Stray a few times.

I'm hoping for a sequel or some other additional content to be announced."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I did love their world. Maybe for a little annoyed with the fetch quests but they were so overtly fetchy it felt charming in its own way
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The cat you play as who was separated from his crew in the beginning.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,They didn't fuck anything up
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I played this game with my two year old daughter, when the cat fell off the sewer grate she cried I‚Äôm a dumbass Bc the cat fell and I go ‚Äúoh nooooo!‚Äù"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"While as a consumer I'd always want the price to be less, I appreciate Stray for what it was.

The game had a great story with characters I cared about in a world that was unique and cool.

I would have loved for it to be longer and play more of course but I'm also glad that it wasn't riddled with microtransactions or other fluff to pad out the game."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It was 30 on release if i recall correctly
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,True. I‚Äôm not a cat person. But I am a dog person. And if a dog is on a rail-something has went wrong.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I still haven't got the platinum. I hate those max Payne complete the game in one hour challenges. Well done you!
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It was funny cause although the story and that scene at that moment made me sad, the image of the cat sadly curled up next to him is what had me bawling."
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I just saw that too and thought ‚Äòwhat a coincidence‚Äô. I hope that does mean there‚Äôs a sequel in the works.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEOEczZQHbo

I hope that make you happy :)"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Yeah, they are be together after the end.

There is a good video about this. ""Where the heck is kitty cat after the ending"" (not the real title).

Nice analytic about how far the cutie traveled and how far she still have to go 

Spoiler: a few 100 meters"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,You're wrong.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Little steep. I‚Äôd love to play a sequel tho.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It wasn't too bad tbh, I just used my trusty notebook to write out a progress route and did it first try. The hardest trophy was doing the no hit run on the chase sequence, that took a fair few attempts!"
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I got that one first try. Wasn't aware it was a trophy til it popped. Lucked out I suppose. Maybe one day I'll go back and tackle it. Maybe look up a strat cause I can't be arsed to play it a second time just to chart the course.
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I literally played it just for the platinum üòÖ went on a crazy splurge when I got my PS5 and did like 29 platinums in a year üòÖü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1447chq,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,The timing on that achievement is very generous. As long as you remember how to do all the necessary puzzles you're unlikely to have any problems hitting it.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Meow meow meow! Nothing feels better than the inside of a cat!
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Hey man don't diss 3D World. It's great.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Lol! Good one!ü§£
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"You're not really missing out on much, Stray isn't that great."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I mean it‚Äôs free so why not
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"I'm waiting for the physical edition, won't be here until September... whew."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Mom can we have stray?
No we have stray at home.
Stray at home:"
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,The stray you have at home is pricier.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,Except the cat doesn‚Äôt meow it goes HA WA YA WAHOO
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,Stray at home is more expensive than the actual Stray
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,[deleted]
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre referring to the cartoonish look of cat Mario vs the more realistic look of the cat protagonist in Stray.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,"L   it would easily be game of the year if Elden Ring didn't exist

&#x200B;

i'm convinced people that don't like Stray dont like it because its a fairly laid back game and yall cant go 30 seconds without getting bored lmao"
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Yeah, it's pretty boring."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,A free Mario game? Where?
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Only if you have ps+ extra
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,It‚Äôs not free. I pay every month for access to those games. It‚Äôs included with a PSPlus - extra subscription is what you meant to say.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I'd like to put this out there: it wasn't an actual Nintendo tweet
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Uh... What
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,"What Stray does can be accomplished by perhaps any form of media from books to film. I don't see why it had to be a video game. It's simply not what I want out of a game, you're correct. The game really does make me bored. That is why it is fundamentally not a good game. Impeccable story, bad game."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,It‚Äôs free. I had to pay $12 to go to extra and stray is 30 I think? Or just go with a month and the game is still free for the price
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,[deleted]
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,"some of the most popular games to ever exist are popular because of their stories and in my opinion could've probably been a movie instead of a game. 

&#x200B;

the walking dead? that's basically just a movie

the last of us? again, literally just an interactive movie

red dead redemption 2? just a cowboy movie.

every visual novel to ever exist? they could've just made that a movie.

&#x200B;

yes the game may not have much interactivity but if you made it a movie or a tv show it will lose all the puzzles, all the exploration, and all the little bits of world building you get when exploring while playing. For me, Stray would be a 5/10 movie but because it's a video game it's easily a 9/10.

I liked how I could meow whenever I want, I liked how I could scratch things whenever I want, I liked how I could talk to whoever I want, I like how I could find collectables to get more worldbuilding and story information. None of these things would be there if it was just a movie or tv show."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I‚Äôm quite certain you don‚Äôt know the definition of the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Ah yes, ‚Äùfree for the price‚Äù"
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,It‚Äôs included with a subscription. I don‚Äôt say I watch movies for free because I pay for a Netflix subscription.
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"No, it was a Shane Dawson tweet."
w7p14q,2022-07-25,2022-07-26,"Because you pay Netflix to watch movies. No one buys ps plus because they want to play game xy that hasn‚Äôt released yet in the future for discount. You pay for online. If you go for extra then it‚Äôs 40 more a year. You pay 40 more for the current catalogue of games and not for future ones. This means everyone who could play stray for free already had extra, meaning they didn‚Äôt intentionally pay for playing this game"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"The environments were gorgeous, but unless you get a lot of joy from ""cat does cat things"" you basically play the entire game after like 30 minutes."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,[deleted]
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Art is gorgeous, atmosphere is perfect, background/lore are interesting.

That's it. That's all this game has."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Eh it's a fun sorta game for a while then it's really the same thing over and over. I'm glad it wasn't too long because it got dull less than half way through.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Stray is gorgeous!
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"The art might be good, but the gameplay and the story aren't that good. It just had a huge publicity budget"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Adore this game and have played it through several times (it is short).
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,These screenshots basically give you the entire game experience. It's a pretty game but it's incredibly shallow and quick with basically zero replay ability.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-08,"This game reminded me of Journey or Abzu in that I really didn‚Äôt feel like I had a purpose. There is a little information about the game world and that‚Äôs it and you just progress through the environment. No real challenges etc. 

I guess I don‚Äôt like these games for the same reasons I don‚Äôt like art museums either."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Stray was a piece of art.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"The game is indeed very pretty, it's a shame that my PC fies if I try to run it at 100% resolution... Had to resort to 70% for it to run smoothly.

Still a very pleasant game to play, graphics and gameplay wise"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,If it goes on sale for like 15 bucks I would be down to play it
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Loved it but unfortunately the game was too short!
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Honestly, as much as I loved the cat- the gameplay loop was just kinda okay and a bit short for what I paid."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Waiting for it to come to switch
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I wish I could play it but unfortunately this is yet another game Sony paid to keep from Xbox. The ABK deal needs to go through and all Sony's shitty practices need to be made public to teach Jim Ryan and anyone else who thinks that's the best way to do business a huge lesson.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Meh game with meh graphics carried by the fact it had a cat.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"There's no challenge in this game, just watch a youtube playthru"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,You're a cat who can't jump. I won't play it.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Best game of 2022 by a mile, imo!

Edit: Wah oh!  A different opinion!  Downvote it!"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,[deleted]
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Some people don't like it because of the simple controls and short story but...I really enjoyed it a lot. It's more a chill-vibe game and boy did they nail the atmosphere. I could stroll the cities all day without doing much of anything. Perhaps the simple controls is what reached out to a wider audience. I platinumed it a long time ago but I still think about it alot. May revisit soon.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I dislike cats and I'm horrifyingly allergic to them but this game is a pleasure! I love the lore and environments and wish there was more, maybe a sequel or something, perhaps a prequel?"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I expected more when they introduced the weapon, but it really just turned out to be a platformer"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I don't know how you missed all the memes and posts when this first came out.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Is there like missions to this game? Or are you really just a stray cat walking around? No disrespect if you like it. Just curious.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I cracked it and was halfway trough.. then i had to formate my pc and my files got lost. Buying it is too expensive now and cracking it again and playing to the same point kinda a drag. But its a very unique and beautiful game
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,It was very fun game and I liked story. I was entertained whole time.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I recommend playing it with cats around, it's truly wonderful-ler! üòÅ"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I played it with my 6 yr old, was a wonderful experience."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,If someone has played somerville and limbo it's for them as it's just the same except it is being made for mainstream as well as the budget was bigger
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,The lighting and The details it is a game i never seen before
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-08,Love the environment modelling and the ambient soundtrack is fantastic
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-08,"Out of all the ""hold up on the left stick to watch the game play itself for you"" games I've played, this was certainly one of them."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Glad to hear that. I avoided it because I hate cats but everyone says it‚Äôs like some great revolutionary thing. But, since I don‚Äôt like cars, it looked very boring. Pretty, but boring."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Its basically a press A over and over again, if it wasnt for the cat I don't think the game would be praised."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Yes but! You can‚Äôt charge 30 dollars for a 4 hour game. That‚Äôs just ridiculous
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Developing the proper length of a game is important and I think the devs did a pretty good job at that
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Tell me you didn't play it without telling me you didn't play it.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"It took me 8 hours to complete because I wanted 100% completion, but yeah, it was short. At least, it had a wonderful ending, even though it was simple."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,This game really feels like it was MADE for switch!  But Sony is gonna Sony
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Somebody can't handle the truth. It's a fact that Sony have been using the same shitty methods since day 1. It's why SEGA failed. Sony don't like competition. They want to destroy everyone and they don't care how they do it all so they can say they are #1. Their objection to the ABK deal has nothing to do with CoD and everything to do with not letting MS have anything. 1st party deal are one thing but paying a 3rd party to not release a game on a rival system is another.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Stray looked good but yea it was boring
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Its okay we all have terrible takes every now and then
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Agreed.  I'll happily take a unique game like this over Dark Souls 12 any day.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-08,"For real. If your entire concept falls apart because of a playable characters appearance, then you didn't make a good game."

10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Why not? You'd get less time buying a movie on blueray for your money. I think it sold well so clearly enough people felt the value was good.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I 100% it. It took like 8-10 hours. It was a pretty game but it was easy and straight forward and only had enough content to knock it out in a couple evenings.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I also got about 8 hours but I didn't come close to 100%

I was just soaking in the atmosphere. The vibes in this game are impeccable."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Actually if you didn't play as a cat, the game would be the exact same minus playing as a cat."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"No it wouldn't lol, you could be in a miniaturizing suit and nothing would change. The only ""cat thing"" was the meow button."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"I don‚Äôt hate the game or the idea. Just the price/gameplay ratio. I feel like games are way too expensive for what you get sometimes, now more than ever."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"What a stupid thing to say when the majority of you idiots are paying $70+ for incomplete, broken ""fix it later"" in-game stores anymore."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I don‚Äôt pay for or watch movies
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Ah so you didn't actually ""play"" it. You just treated it like an achievement hunt. That's not real playing. That's just checking boxes."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I think if you swapped out the cat for Super Mario it'd actually be more fun.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"If you consider the amount of development needed to accurately model a cats movement, which really hasn't been done to this degree before, it's worth the price. It's also important to recognize when people take a risk on a new concept. Yes it was short and the replayability is fairly low. What they produced was really refreshing from a gameplay perspective and it was executed very well."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Yea 4 hours should be 20 bucks and 10 on sale. If its on sale i would buy it
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,OK but that doesn't really make a difference to my point.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Wut? No i played it and there was so little actual content that it was trivial to 100% it naturally in a very short period of time.

If you enjoyed it I'm not taking that away from you. That's all that really matters. I'm just sharing my opinion based on my experience. You're welcome to add your own separate reply sharing your opinion and experience... you won't see me replying to it arguing with you."
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"Hey, If people like it, buy it. I personally don‚Äôt think its worth supporting for 30 dollars"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"That‚Äôs how I feel. I don‚Äôt think every game should have boring garbage filler like Ubisoft games nowadays do, but having a handful of interesting side quests and secrets that adds maybe another 10 hours of content is key if you want 30 dollars for your game. At least in my eyes"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,"It does. My point I made was I MYSELF don‚Äôt see the value in this game being so short and 30 dollars. I also don‚Äôt watch movies so your point doesn‚Äôt work for me either

I understand what you‚Äôre saying though"
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,That's fair. I rarely buy games on release I'll wait for a sale and depending on my backlog I may end up waiting a year or two.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,Thats why i like games like the order 1886.. the only game i finished without touching any other game. Nowdays games are 100 hours and you dont remember even 10% of what happened in the game.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,That's not how you phrased it.
10vnpmh,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,I never actually played that game. I missed a lot of games. Been stuck on siege mostly for the last 7 years

Some people don't like how you catch wild Pokemon, but attacking them down to low HP was a terrible mechanic. Many reloads in the past were made to attempt to recatch Pokemon that were killed.

The map is the same, but in beautiful 3D. Not 3DS 3D, but really polished console 3D. I'm having a really great time with it. I heard there's a mode after you beat the game with 150 different trainers, each with one of the original 150 Pokemon at lvl 70 to beat.

Imo, Pokemon has gotten way more complicated in the latest installments, and this game sort of bridges a gap between Pokemon Go and Pokemon Yellow. I've only beaten the first gym, but I hope this isn't the end of this series."

If you're expecting it to play like any other Pokemon game it should also be noted that the game was made to emulate Pokemon Go's mechanics. That is to say that the mechanics of encountering wild pokemon are heavily watered down from standard Pokemon games, which is a nice way of saying that there aren't any wild pokemon battles at all in it. You simply encounter them, and throw a ball or run away. No danger, little challenge. There are still trainer and gym battles."

When vacation time came around, my little kid brain had to take a break from trying to figure out invisible walls and poison. Meanwhile, my parents got their old friend Kevin to watch the house and take care of the dogs while we were out of state.

A week later we got home to what looked to me like a tidy house. I remember my sister saying something about finding a cigarette butt on the counter, as well as alcohol and strangers clothes. That was the first time I heard the term booty call, but little kid me had no idea what any of that meant. Little kid me was just excited to get back to Pokemon after what had felt like ages. 

I remember climbing up into the bar stool and finally getting my hands on my game boy, which was on the counter.  It felt good to click the power on and spam my way through to the menus. After I clicked load save, all I could see was KEVIN.

9xqjs1,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"I used too but the older I get the more ridiculous it all is, from Superman blowing Reagan (ignoring that most of the big name DC comics of the time took the piss on him more often than not including Superman) one of the earliest incidents of Batman actually 'winning' a fight against Superman (and Miller had Superman act brain dead half the time, to make it even remotely plausible), and the shades of Crazy Steve and Edgy Batman that are seen throughout it all. Part of it is definitely me projecting future works and trends onto it, but even beyond the art the story very much breaks my SoD on several occasions. And as much as I dislike Bruce Timm I really enjoy Batman Beyond and I both enjoyed the concept and most of the execution of it. 

That said while Edgy Batman seems to be (slowly) phasing out finally it did give us some great stories and interesting characters. 

His Daredevil work still holds up really well. "

w3geax,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"It's good if you like cats and great if you love cats. Most of the charm comes from the fact that you are a cat. 

But it's the definition of a casual game and that's not a bad thing. It's just a fun little journey and a cool little world to get immersed in for a bit.

If you're hoping for something even slightly challenging, you will be disappointed.

8.5/10 for me as someone who **loves** cats but I'm about two thirds through."

w3geax,2022-07-20,2022-07-21,"Story game, some decent but not too complex puzzling, a small amount of action. 

If that seems to be your jam, then the package is excellent. Wonderfully animated cat just ... being a cat."

w3geax,2022-07-20,2022-07-20,"But it doesn't have to be.

As an example to explain my fatigue I'll use Fall Guys.


Fall Guys was a huge hit when it came out and r/gaming was flooded with posts on it. But here's the thing. The posts made were showcasing gameplay highlights of people goofing off, finally winning, losing  embarrassingly, etc. 

In other words, things that are actually content and can be the basis of discussion.


All of these posts are basically ""I bought game"" with the addition of an animal being on screen. There is no discussion to be had. No real content. This is a deluge that amounts to nothing g and is not what r/gaming should be.


r/gaming deserves better than to be a free advertisement space."

Her birthday was in a couple weeks and he was texting everyone to throw her a surprise party.

w43zvg,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"I keep telling people that pets want to join people in the gaming world.  They see that we are very interested and involved in something - and they know we are interacting somehow, but they can't figure out how to get into the action.

Game systems need a paw-pad for dogs/cats to touch that will do something on the screen - allow them to kill birds or rats in horror games, or maybe make stuff appear and run/fly across the screen for the human players to shoot.

I'm certain pets could understand some simple interactions.  These should just be bonus animations and not essential in any way to the main game.  So when you pet bores of pawing the paw-pad and walks away, your game is not affected at all - but they can still join in at any time.

After 50 years of video games it's ludicrous that pets are not part of it."

Then when you got into the city you started doing human stuff, understanding English/whatever the language they use. Youre plugging power into sockets, entering keycodes, etc.

The cat behavior is mostly gone past some novelty interactions like scratching sofas and walls."

w43zvg,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,I wouldn‚Äôt say so. It‚Äôs dark but not scary.
w43zvg,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"Personally it missed the mark for me.

The starting 30 minutes was really strong. A lot of environmental storytelling and cues and good use of objects to tell the story.

Then after that the game just became a repetitive walking sim where dialog and story was shoved down your throat through NPC speech bubbles and there was just so much fetch quests.

Here, you need this item, but I want you to get this item first. So talk to that NPC and she will tell you to get another item so she will give you this item.

The art direction looks great, but the grandeur of exploration falls flat when you are forced to backtrack so much and the environments just become a chore.

Also, the ending was rather... unsatisfying?"
w43zvg,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,I‚Äôm enjoying it thoroughly.

- People love cats

- People in /r/gaming love video games.

Ergo, people are talking about a very good video game about cats.  It doesn't require a conspiracy theory for a few people to post content about it.  Maybe it's just a new good video game that people want to talk about...?

yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Stray would be the obvious choice, as this title and award would only bring up sales a bit and all other titles have already gotten so much free advertisement from the fan base that the only game that actually needs the advertisement of GOTY of 2022 would be stray.

That and it's the actual GOTY of 2022, only game that was new thinking and did something new, all others are just sequels or further build on an already big franchise."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Xenoblade 3
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"C'mon, Stray?"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"I chose A Plague Tale Requiem. It was a masterpiece. The storytelling was incredible, the graphics were so beautiful, the gameplay is such a step up from the first one. It‚Äôs everything a sequel should be and more."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"As much as i love God of War , Elden Ring just feels like more of a video game ...ya know?"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,I honestly can¬¥t understand why people are so obsessed over a title and an award. Honestly it means nothing yeah the company get more PR maybe some more sale.   But honestly I think allot of games I played been fracking awesome and the year is not really over yet.  And I hope Warhammer 40k Darktide will be epic as well.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"the cancer I got reading the comments, makes me wonder if ""gamers"" were always nonsensical or this is just a byproduct of ""anti-social media"""
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"stray, it is the cute cat game after all"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,If elden ring wasn't on there it would be a hard choice. But Elden ring is just a masterpiece.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,I would vote for stray
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,its God of War for sure. It had a better story than any other game on the list.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Requiem
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"I feel like Elden Ring, regardless of your love or hate for other Souls games, had a huge amount of content, was accessible to people new to the genre, had good a good look, good delivery of lore, and was a pretty excellent experience.

I like Stray, too, but it wasn't nearly the same feat as Elden Ring was."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Horizon Forbidden West for me. Haven't played Elden Ring because I've never played any of Souls games (did play Jedi fallen order tho). I'm waiting for a decent discount on GOW Ragnarok because I'm not a huge fan of Nordic mythology and I didn't like resource management , Valkyrie bosses and way too many currencies in the 2018 game"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Bloodborne is better than Elden Ring in every way. Why people are getting crazy about it?
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Elden ring, it has to be. Other games are great but elden ring is a masterpiece."

yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"My vote is for Elden Ring.

Also I see that Club Penguin bookmark up there, respect!"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,It has to be Elden Ring i think. I have never played such a masterpiece before
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,GOTY belongs to GOW or ER in my humble opinion.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Elden ring is the best gaming experience I've had in over 10 years easily. I haven't even started Ragnarok yet though should be good! The fact that anyone here says Stray is better then these is just a full blown troll in work lol
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"I think GOW would win on brand name alone, but ER did get a lot more media recognition and better reviews. Really tough choice.

Horizon, Xenoblade and Plague tale have 0 chance of winning, and I could see them giving it to Stray as some bizarre move to shake twitter up or something."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,How a plague tale made it on there I have no idea‚Ä¶ so uninspiring. Horrible character development. Garbage thrown together story. And glitchy as all hell.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"The impact and staying power that Elden Ring had was something you see come around very rarely. This game was non-stop in the media for months. If anything, that shows you how great of a game it is"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Anyone who picks Stray as GoTY should be forced, by law, to never complain about an empty and boring game again for the rest of their lives"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Then don't vote.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,God of war
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-12-08,"I just finish God of War and honestly struggle with how one can really choose between Elden Ring and GOWR. Both are excellent. God of War R. is the among the best of what I have seen in term of story telling and Punch Out style combat. Elden Ring is the best open world I have played. ER‚Äôs story is also skillfully told ‚Äî from the perspective of the tarnished warrior that is your avatar. It‚Äôs so cool. In any other year, these games being separated would likely be the GOTY. 

If I had to choose, however, it would be Elden Ring. Both have excellent writing, music, and gameplay.  But Elden Ring has more of it."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,i liked it and i hope it will a few awards. but not GOTY obviosly. belongs to GOW or ER 100%.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Honestly.. at this point i feel like they should just give the award to Stray. This whole God of War vs Elden Ring ""war"" has been silly for too long. Let's shut both camps up, low-key troll them and reunite gamers through cute kitteh game."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"To me it has to be elden ring, none are bad choices but there is so many things that can be done with elden ring . The world is actually pretty empty comparatively speaking. I thought skyrim was the best I'd ever played and it still is, but if elden ring ever had a story I gave a damn about or was organized in any way, it would be the best game I've ever played"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Yeah, a video game from years ago maybe... GoW is what modern gaming can be, ER is everything bad about gaming that should have been forgotten a long time ago."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Cancer? Ah of course the drama queen diagnosis I get it now. üëç should get that looked at bud
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Is it? Seems like a lot of people see it with rose colored glasses on. What exactly makes it a masterpiece? I can name at least 6 other open world games with better stories and pacing. The combat is insanely great unless we're talking about PvP meta. Other than that, I can't really think of what makes it so much better than some of these other games, a few of which also have pretty fantastic combat and gameplay in general, not to mention more coherent stories and lore."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,[deleted]
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"elden ring fans are downvoting you, although they know that you a right lol

ER barely has a story at all."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,This
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Disagree on the lore delivery part. As a player with over 250 hours on it and have played through Souls 1-3, ER out of those four games is the least logical and least coherent when it comes to it's lore/story. 

As far as content goes, Forbidden West objectively has more. More to do, more to see. Much of Elden Ring's map itself is very empty compared to a lot of other open world games despite how good it all looks.

If Elden Ring or GoW win, it will be by popularity. Most of the people in r/gaming never even bothered to play Stray or Forbidden West, and even fewer gave a singular thought about XC3."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Elden Ring is worth your time, but don't go into it expecting a decent story. However, the combat is fun and satisfying."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,As much as i agree with you elden ring was the first fromsoft game that got massive hype in the mainstream in my opinion
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"In my opinion, Elden Ring is better than bloodborne in every way. Wanna know the difference in those who share your opinions and those who share mine?

Those who like Elden Ring dont go around acting confused why everyone loves bloodborne. Elden ring fans love bloodborne, bloodborne fans hate Elden Ring."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Meh to me Bloodborn is like the dark sheep that people like becuse it¬¥s cool. After finishing Bloodborn I was just mostly bored and sad on how damn easy all the bosses where.   


But that¬¥s my personal opinion."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,[deleted]
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"People keep calling it a masterpiece, but I'm failing to see why. The story/lore is barely coherent, and the combat is what drew my attention the most, because it's excellent. I can't really think of what makes it GotY over all these other games, most of which have really good writing and a couple even look just as good if not better than Elden Ring graphics-wise."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Tell us you never even played it without telling us.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"You must not play very many games, then. Elden Ring hardly does anything new. It's a good game, but what makes it a masterpiece?"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,0 chance of winning??? The gameplay and writing in Forbidden West was top notch. I'm guessing you never even played it.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Media hype does not automatically = good, though. With over 250 hours in ER, I fail to see what exactly makes it GotY worthy over certain others, especially when those others feature more engaging writing and lore."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,I'd pick any game on this list over stray
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Careful or all the GoW and Elden Ring fans will get mad at you.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Not to mention ER is going to be getting dlc at some point
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Elden Ring fanboys will tell you the game has the best lore and story of any game for the last decade and that you're just dumb for not liking or understanding it. It's honestly kind of insane the hoops people will jump through for the god-awful writing it had, George R.R Martin's involvement be damned."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,You're a primo cornball
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"made my case, bud"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Elden Ring is going to win by a landslide and folks who just don't understand why are going to have a very hard time next month. There's no rose tinted shades here. Elden Ring set the bar in video games and folks are just gonna have to get used to it. No one will be comparing God of War or Horizon to future games in terms of how much content is in the actual game. ER did that and there's no competition for the foreseeable future.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Ds2 would like to talk
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,Pretty sure the OG Demon Souls is still the worst Souls game.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-18,"Thank you. I think Elden ring is a good game, but it isn't God of War Ragnorak. It doesn't have the character depth, the story, or the emotional beats of God of War. The two games are pretty equivalent as far as the quality of their action and  gameplay. We you list all the things that make each game special God of War is checking off more boxes."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Most ER fans on Reddit can't tell you what makes ER so much better than any of these other games, a majority of which have very engaging and coherent writing. ER is a great game. GotY though? I don't see it.

It's just good because it is and anyone who disagrees gets down voted to oblivion and insulted. It's actually a little sad."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Hype does not automatically = good, though."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-16,"This popped up in the community as soon as Elden Ring hit the mainstream hype wave.

A lot of Souls Veterans, and such seem to be nitpicking Elden Ring really hard to maintain their 'favourite' as the best.

This is in no way a criticism of people who just prefer Bloodborne, but there was a lot of Soulsborne fans who *wanted* to hate ER, right from the word Go."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"''Easy bosses'' ?!? 

Have you played The Old Hunters? Bloodborne literally has the hardest and creative bosses among all of the souls-like games."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,I‚Äôve heard the same from others souls-addicts.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Tell us you're 14 without telling us
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Indeed I never played it (Never liked the first one) but my opinion is not based on the quality of the game but on its popularity and that of its competitors. It could be a good game, but it's been barely discussed whereas ER and GOW have been in everyone's mouths for months. (Yes I am aware GOW came out last week, I mean people were talking about it)"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"I was talking more about the hype within the gaming community itself, rather than the media hype and media outlets talking about it. I also just think it evolves the genre and type of games FromSoft have been making. I can't really say the same thing about Horizon & Ragnarok"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"That's what I mean. There is so much potential there that's it's like this game is just the template, there are a few issues with it that have to do with controls that could be streamlined a bit. Or just give us console players the same freedom the PC players have with button  assignments and I'd be happy. But for muliplayer, imagine staged tournaments where the winner is an elden lord , he gets to be crazy powerful until a group kills him. And single player, imagine building a shelter or it's just so many possibilities"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"Yeah, I read in an interview he did after he had done the talk shows to promote ellden ring where he said they didn't use very much of what he wrote. I get the whole make it what you want sorta thing, and it's a great game either way , I just like a little more straightforward story as opposed to learning it through the game, it's all good though , still love the game"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-16,"I won't defend it blindly as I'm fully aware how obtuse the narrative in the game can be, but it is not badly written.

It's just a different story delivery method, and past that point the enjoyment of this method is subjective."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"You're just further proving that Elden Ring bias, btw. Hey watch out guys don't say anything bad about Elden Ring or else the Souls fanboys will rip you a new one. Yeah and never explain why it's such a great game or have any real discussion, it's always, ""It's a masterpiece"" or ""It set the bar in open world video game history"" or ""You're a primo cornball"". üôÑ"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-19,"Yeah, no"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"But you didn't actually explain what makes it good. You just praised it to high heavens without adding a single reason why it's just that good if not THE best game ever. HOW did Elden Ring set the bar? WHAT is the bar? It didn't exactly do anything new in gaming from what I could tell, and I have over 250 hours on it. The combat, while fun, was pretty much what we had in Dark Souls 3 with the addition of being able to jump. Even a large portion of spells, weapons, weapon arts, and animations made it over from DS3. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay and nearly endless potential for different builds is phenomenal. I don't disagree that it's a good game. It's just that you say no rose tinted glasses but can't explain why the game is so much better than any other game. You just defined the definition of the phrase. I feel like a lot of people here praising Elden Ring have never even played any of the other games and have no basis to how good any of them actually are. For example, while playing Forbidden West, I found that there was always something to do and you get rewarded for exploring. There is never a dull moment and there are plenty of activities and challenges to come across. The story is engaging and keeps you invested. Elden Ring of course has dungeons to solve, major and minor bosses to fight, but those aren't new concepts in any way, and other than those things, there isn't actually a lot to DO activity or ""content""-wise. If ER set the bar, and that bar being 'open world puzzle dungeon boss gauntlet with discoverable lore where you ride a horse', then Breath of the Wild already had that bar set years ago. There are a lot of open, empty areas in Elden Ring that seem to serve no purpose other than to give the player the illusion of content or to pad out the map size. Are the map and graphics amazing? Sure. So are that of GoW and Forbidden West. I might even say the graphics in DS3 were better, but I know that's a less popular opinion. While Elden Ring is open world, it still also requires that you follow a certain path in order to progress through the game, and again, this is nothing new, but as many have described, it's just Dark Souls but open world, which, in my opinion, doesn't lend itself well to how the story/lore is told, unlike in previous Souls games where you could pretty easily figure things out as you go along the linear areas and fight bosses that you HAVE to kill in order to progress. You can skip or miss quite a few in Elden Ring, a lot of whom are supposedly important to the lore/story.

So essentially, what you said is that it's just good just because it is, and anyone who doesn't understand is just foolish. So much for ""no rose tinted shades"" huh?"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-19,"Elden rings pros are that its deeper in combat, enemy variaty and its longer. Thatd literally it haha"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-16,"I think why it deserves the praise is due to the design philosophy of letting the player tackle the world however they want.

This starts at the bottom with the sheer amount ofbuild , weapon and skill variety, allowing you to play exactly how you want, whether it be a holy paladin, or a sneaky mage. This isn't Unique to ER, but the way it's presented and the tools you have as a player to achieve exactly the character you want are pretty unmatched in the industry.

The second part being exploration, every corner, corridor, dungeon has something useful to it, upgrade materials, weapons, armour - and whilst God of War or Zelda have similar rewards, the scale of Elden Rings rewards are insane, entire areas, main bosses and huge story reveals are hidden - and left entirely to player discretion to find and clear these, a normal playthrough can miss half the game - but it doesn't take away from the experience and further adds replay value.

The story, I will admit is a controversial point - the story is absolutely fantastic, really solid base and a great example of worldbuilding. However, the delivery method is not to everyone's taste, as it requires investigation and active seeking of answers, which is a poor motivation for the narrative, but an extremely rich source of player engagement.

Tl;Dr: Elden Ring leaves much of the game up to the player to tackle in whatever way they see fit. Story, combat and exploration are all player-led, leading to a really good video game, with immense replay value."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,It‚Äôs been years and I still have not beaten the orphan of kos.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Yes I have and they where a bit harder but not that hard  the only one I liked was Lady Maria she was fun to fight.

Also not my fault it was hard for you dont deag every one to your level.  But some people cant accept that others dont like the same games. Pathetic."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"What does playing Stray have to do with age? I'm 30 and I play LEGO Star Wars. Does that make me immature???? It's even more for kids than Stray is. Sorry for not only liking ""big boy"" games, I guess. Come back with a real argument and stop projecting your insecurities. Nobody is going to make fun of you for what you play, unless they're 14 like you apparently are."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Trust me, plenty of people have been talking about it."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-14,"It's a hella fun game, especially if you love challenging and varied combat. I personally just don't think it stands up to a couple of these other games, namely Horizon and GoW since they both feature great combat AND more coherent storylines and writing."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,You're a primo cornball
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-16,"Dudes that's way too many words to read. No one said it's the best game ever. I said it was the best game of the year. I never praised it to ""high heavens"", I said it set the bar in terms of how much content is in the game

Maybe you should do some actual reading, and stop replying to comments just for the sake of hearing yourself talk"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-28,"God of War has tons of enemy variety, solid combat and is a beefy game in its own right. It also has more meaningful and impactful moments than Elden Ring (Which is a good game in its own right). God of War Ragnarok and Elden Ring both are fantastic games. I'm just saying God of War is a better overall experience."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,Grown ass man... Its okay bro you soft I get it
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Not even remotely close to the extent of GOW and ER, which can be easily confirmed by just spending time in this sub."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"Again, point proven."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-16,"Bold to tell me to do some reading when you didn't even bother to read the majority of my comment. Set the bar for content? Plenty of other games have set that bar years ago. Breath of the Wild is one other open world game where you can do pretty much anything that you can do in Elden Ring, and more. It also encourages and rewards you for exploring. What content does ER have that certain other games don't, exactly? I clearly must've missed something since it seems to have SO much content beyond killing bosses/enemies and doing dungeons.

Keep saying how great the game is with no real reason. ""It has content"" is not one. Not like GotY means much, anyway."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"As opposed to being hard and only liking CoD or GoW? Yeah okay. Go back to school, kid. Maybe you can learn how to make better comebacks. üëã"
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"A single sub on Reddit doesn't mean much. And if you never bothered to play it because you didn't like the first game, then you haven't bothered to pay attention to any attention it's been getting. So that ""0 chance"" is based off nothing because you have no basis for how the game actually is."

yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-17,"Dude I'm not gonna sit here and explain it to you. You don't like the game? Good. Go play something else. You like having your hand held and feeling like a big boy solving puzzles? Go for it. But I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince some reddit contrarian to why the best game of the year, is the best game if the year.

It's going to win. It's not even a competition. And no I don't have to sit here and type a fucking book for some rando in the internet. Sorry I just dont have that kind of time"

yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-15,"It is a good indicator as there are 35 million people here. But not just here, it's barely discussed anywhere, I don't know why you have such a hard time accepting that. The first game won ZERO awards (It was jokingly called like that for a while in most gaming boards).

My opinion on the quality of the game is irrelevant, I know critics liked it, but its a whole different league beneath ER and GOW."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-21,"I already said I liked the game, though? You'd know that if you bothered to read any of what I said. You're a hypocrite. You have the time to praise the game and the time to say you don't have the time, but don't have the time to say why it deserves GotY. ""It just does"" is a pretty shit reason. You're the epitome of Souls fanboys who can't be bothered to explain what makes the game just THAT good, drooling over it and spitting on anyone who dares have any negative opinion."
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-21,Your still on this subject 4 days later
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-22,And you replied. Does that mean you have time to explain why Elden Ring is Game of the Year? It's okay to admit that you just like it and think it should win. Nothing wrong with that. But you refused to back up your claims and then get all defensive when somebody calls you out. Don't cry when you're the one who started this. It will stop if you explain why it's GotY or don't reply.
yve182,2022-11-14,2022-11-22,No

Cats - adults, can be assholes, can lash out, can be kind and nice, needs cuddles when they want it, dont need much attention unless they are looking for it.

Dogs - children, need constant attention, if their parents are assholes and undisciplined, so will they be, need food ALWAYS. Can cuddle whenever.

v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwE1MHVURIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwE1MHVURIE) Probably took reference from this type of cat or one similar to it.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"I mean, my cats are closer to the Ubisoft cat."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,It's because it's an ad likely put together by whoever is publishing this new cat game. It's easy bait.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,"Yes you are lucky but not because that's rare, I see different cats behave like both situations multiple times a week. I'm guessing OP doesn't have much contact with cats."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Makes me wonder if we should be feeling sorry for their cats.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,I swear ppl cant just be happy with some things.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"I have never pre-ordered a game before because, well, what's the point but my workmates got me a steam voucher for my birthday and I'm shit with money so just in case I run out when it releases I pre-ordered Stray. I'd like to say something smart about what's got me interested in the game but basically I like cats and I want to play a game where I get to be one :)"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,It's a upcoming game called stray
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,"1st game Stray, 2nd game AC Valhalla"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"yes, stray, on steam I think? it releases in July according to other comments"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"headbonks mean, ""I love you,"" in cat"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Well Splinter Cell sure doesn't have cats though
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,You the type to mass buy on sale. My man. I do the same. Never bought a Ubi game full price. I always buy them at 50-60% discount some time later.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,if i'm not completly stupid it should be ac vallhalla.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"It varies greatly. Some don‚Äôt like it, some love it. The problem tends to be from people who don‚Äôt understand their body language and try to belly rub when the cat is wound up and either wants to play or wants to be left alone entirely."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Actually a lot of cats love belly rubs *when they actually ask for it!* The problem is that cats often show their belly as a sign of trust and affection, they are more or less saying ""I trust you enough to make myself vulnerable, because you won't take advantage of it"" and when you rub their belly in response, in Cat, you just said ""Oh hell yeah I'm going to grab your vulnerable parts!"" Of course they bite or scratch in response.

If you are petting a cat on it's side or chest, and it moves to give you access to it's belly as you pet, then it wants a belly rub.  If it flops on it's back in front of you, especially if it's  a little bit away from you, and moves to expose it's belly, it probably does NOT want a belly rub, but is expressing affection."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,I'm a male and that's exactly how my cats act.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Sounds like you need to re-evaluate how you treat cats if you think people are delusional when they say their cat is like the AC one.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"It's called ""STRAY"". Coming next month, pre-order available on Steam."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I think."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"About the only time my sweetheart (and I think ‚Äòspecial‚Äô) cat has scratched me.  Spooked by the doorbell.

Any other time she‚Äôs all snuggles or at least content to sleep within arm‚Äôs reach.

Now my other cat‚Ä¶.well she plots my murder I‚Äôm very sure"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Some of it is a miss understanding of how they show affection also. Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as being in the same room as you or the way they hold their tail.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,">Honestly getting tired of the cats dont want affection and dont show affection ""meme"" or rather myth at this point.

I am too. We have three cats. One likes to drape himself around my husband's neck like a scarf, for at least an hour after my husband gets home from work. One gets so excited when being pet, that she drools. And one just likes to be on someone whenever possible. And anybody who falls asleep in my house will likely wake up with a cat on or near them. Yeah, I have had cats in the past that were less affectionate, and had some that were even more cuddly than these three. Even a few that  never seems to get enough attention no matter what. Just like I have had (or known)  dogs that loved everybody they met, and dogs that just weren't interested in most people and only really liked a few people, or even only one or two."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,"He'll grab if  you try to walk past without petting him, or only giving passing scritches/pets."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"I argue with my brother about Ubisoft all the time. I think most people just shit on it because other people shit on it. It's a fad.

Splinter Cell
Far Cry
South Park
Assassins Creed
Watch Dogs
Ghost Recon
Rainbow Six

As for console gamers. You may not like every game these IPs come out with. But most people definitely like some of them. Hell they all defined there generation and innovated gaming at one point throughout the years.

Splinter Cells never had a bad game. Conviction set a standard for 3rd person stealth games. 

FarCry 3 was a mash up of all the FarCrys before it that just missed the mark. And also set a standard for open world fps games.

Assassin Creed 2 was beloved by all. Origins again changed the standard for what a Assassins Creed game could be.

Ghost Recon was the Mil Sim game of my youth. WildLands revamped what Ghost Recon was.

Rainbow Six was the Swat for console gamers. Seige  changed what a 5v5 multiplayer match could be.

Watch Dogs was the Cyber Punk of it's time. But Watch Dogs 2 was a great. Legion well......its complete fucking trash. So the odds weren't with that IP.

South Park is fucking South Park. You like the show? You'll like the game.

Everyone loves to hate on Ubisoft for all the bad. But nobody ever seems to remember the good. I have genuinely never played a Ubisoft game (exception is Legion) that was just complete trash. I've had countless hours of fun with all the games."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,Remove the captions and you've just got a side by side of cats being cats.

v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Yeh, that cat game has no steam reviews yet and is on sale"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,That‚Äôs from AC: Valhalla
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Wrong. I‚Äôm struggling not to downvote you out spite. My last cat wanted attention to the point I‚Äôd get annoyed. He loved belly rubs and would knock on my bedroom door just to be next to me while  I played on my PC. ‚Ä¶miss my guy.

v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,And i want a cat with a big a-
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,The first game or the second game
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,Gracias
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,I think he was referring to Stray...
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"If your cat is taking a swipe at you before giving affection, you are not starting early enough."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,I got Watch Dogs 1 and 2 for free and it didn't click for me. Hated the gameplay and the storyline. I took a chance with Legion and I love this game.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Most Ubi games are good for a little while but there is a point where it just feels like you‚Äôre completing the same mission over and over the same way every time. Watchdogs devolved into using the CTOS scan and just running in with a silenced rifle and wildlands devolved into me using the mass scan from a drone and running in with a silenced rifle‚Ä¶ 

Seriously though I did like both games (20 hours in watchdogs and 40 in wildlands) but it does feel like I‚Äôm doing the same thing over and over. at least In wildlands loud gunfights were possible because you have Heath but in watchdogs you‚Äôre made of wet noodles and will often die in a second or two if you‚Äôre not behind cover and get spotted so it feels like scanning and stealth kills are your only option"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Your examples are all mostly old Ubisoft games. You put Origins forth as an example of a good Ubi game and while I agree that it was decent, it's what essentially started the looting RPG crap mechanics. I played Origins, I played Odyssey. May as well be Witcher 3 spinoffs at this point."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"The way I think of Ubisoft is ""a little buggy but fun overall‚Äù I enjoy the hell out of most Ubisoft games and don‚Äôt understand the hate"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"It's kind of silly to look back at games like original Splinter Cell, Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 2 when most of what Ubisoft has made RECENTLY has been absolute cash grab garbage with awful micro transactions, huge bugs and other issues.

It's like saying ""bro, why u bashing Blizzard? They made Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2!""."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,I played almost all Ubi games and there wasn't a single one i didn't rage because of the shitty controls and dumb ai. Optimization i wont even comment...
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,I have both of these cats
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Buddy. I guess you don't either, because my cat shows affection in a very similar way to the second clip. Cats aren't, or at least shouldn't, always be assholes. If your cat likes you, it will let you know."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,My cat will cry and cry till I pick him up to love on him. Cats can definitely be loving and cuddly
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"It doesn't release until July 19th, so why would it have reviews?? The sale is a pre-purchase promotion."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,probably why it needs advertising
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,oop
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Yeah your cat

Did you get to the part about trust?"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,The big ass cat is actually in AC Valhalla the other game shown is stray
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,Stray
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,[removed]
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,Definitely 1st unless I've missed it
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Yes
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"could be i didn't even knew that game exists or is in development, could be because there is that ""no actual ingame footage"" line in that clip."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"I completely get what you're saying. But I just somewhat disagree. Every company has games that don't hit and are a bit scummy. But Valhalla wasn't garbage to me? Ghost Recon Breakpoint had a No Mans Sky trajectory. It launched as trash but had  developers that stuck with and believed in there game and it was slowly turned into something good. I'm ok with that. At the end of the day creating games is a business. If you've invested millions of dollars into creating something and it's not what you wanted it to be. But deadlines are deadlines. The CEO is on your back. Because the Board is on his. Those people see bottom lines and dollars and cents. It's a job not a passion for gaming. I just think making a game is a much harder thing to do now then it was 15-20 years ago. When it was smaller companies that had the freedom to spend time creating exactly what they wanted. 

""Microtransactions"" has been this word that gets tossed around casually. But when you really look into it. I'd say 99% of all microtransactions are completely optional (mostly skins) that don't have any effect on the actual game at all. Personally. I think remakes. Even good ones are 100x more frustrating to me as a gamer then any microtransaction. There's only been a handful of games that gave me the feeling of experiencing something new, different and innovative in gaming as a console player. 

Morrowind/Oblivion
Farcry 3
Deus Ex
Prey 2017

The hype for remakes just baffles me. I want something new. Were in this stagnant era of gaming. Ubisoft makes great open world games. But at the end of the day. What could they do to make the open world games feel different? I genuinely don't know. You have to fill the game with activities and side missions. What else can you do? For instance...I like the newer spiderman games. So do most gamers.  But they are the worst case of what most people hate on ubisoft's open worlds for. Big. Empty and side activities that all feel the same.

Sorry I know my grammar is shit. And I'm honestly always open for a discussion/debate. Don't mean any offense or to say you're wrong because of your opinion."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,With awful micro transactions? The only micro transactions that I‚Äôve seen in AC is skins with no advantages. I think the only AC game that had pay to win was Black Flag bc you could upgrade your ship that way. That game is still considered the best AC game though
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,You sound like you have anger issues
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,From what I remember Splinter Cell was pretty flawless. Now I understand they would feel like shit now going back and playing the original 2. But that's most games. I would say Conviction and BlackList were pretty damn perfect. And idk. Quirks I guess I maybe remember in ubisoft along with all games. but nothing game breaking from what I recall. Nothing that made me stop playing the games.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Same ,cats will want attention and not want attention"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-06,"Oh really? Didn't realise, just popped up on steam the other day. Could have sworn it was on sale xD

Must have confused it with another game.

It looks cool, my kids will love it"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-06,It looks cool tbh
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"My friends cats always eventually loved me. My gf told me her dogs normally hate strangers. Guess who changed that opinion, no animal has a preset personality."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,[deleted]
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Yes very smart responding to a question with ‚Äúnobody asked‚Äù and saying ‚Äúcringe as fuck‚Äù is cringe as fuck
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Nobody has to ask, there's no rule on reddit saying it requires permission to comment

Nobody asked is such a stupid statement"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Are you a kid? This feels like a child comment
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Not really i finished sekiro, when i said rage i meant alt+f4 quitting type of rage."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"Cats are highly defensive of their belly, they don't tend to like strangers touching it, how do more people not know this?"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,The big cat that gets picked up is actually AC Valhalla.
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,Of course. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone over the age of 15 to say ‚Äûnobody asked‚Äú
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-07-17,average reddit mod
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,How are you replying to a person with first hand experience and asking ‚Äúhow don‚Äôt people know this?‚Äù
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-05,"A cat I met outside my house about two months ago, first time I saw it, it let me rub its belly and hold it. It depends on the cat."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-07-17,then there is you who is 13 and is obsessed with minecraft roblox porn
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-07-17,"Get therapy, log off and touch grass jesus i saw your comments lol you need serious help"
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-06-06,"I apologize, I think got caught up in my opinion/emotions and didn‚Äôt realize what you were trying to say. I reread it, and now I‚Äôm looking at it different. Have a good week. Try a cat tho."
v4pwzn,2022-06-04,2022-07-17,Spot on
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,Purr fun *
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,Looks ok but I've got bored after an hour or two.
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"It's too simplified for me. i didn't enjoy playing it.

and i can't enjoy a game based purely on graphical settings and the looks of the main character."
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,I've been meaning to check this out in VR. I saw someone playing it using the FlatscreenToVR mod and I can hardly imagine how gorgeous it would be
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"I played this with my 4 year old. I gave him a powered off controller and told him he was the cat and I was the robot. I played through the whole game while pretending to direct him and get his input and help. We finished the game months ago and he loved every minute, and still talks about it. üòè"
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"I just started playing it, too! It's so pretty!!! üò∏"
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"Yep, I loved this game, beautiful, and interesting ideas. It was over way too quickly. I think I heard a sequel is being worked on, hopefully it is.

I keep looking at Steam hoping it gets down to $15, I played it on ps4 and would like to play it again with better visual fidelity."
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"My daughter every now and then said to okay the ""cat game"". Loved the story and gameplay. Also it allowed me to find something else to play then the ""goose game"" lol"
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"I enjoyed it a lot.

For sure, we can see that the developer isn't a big studio, and they have a lot of work to do and stuff to learn. I didn't get into it with much expectations, and it saved me from disappointments from certain things (like game-breaking bugs, which made me re-start game from the beginning)

I think the visuals and optimization combo is great for such a game. The story might seem somewhat shallow in places, but I would definitely call this game a success"
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-05-09,"I've had the opposite experience from a majority of reddit users in here. I absolutely love the game! Granted, I had a couple edibles in me and it elevated the experience.

Still, I love how simple the gameplay is and that it's not too challenging and overwhelming. I've been playing games since PS1 and this is one of my all time favorites. It's a great game to come to after a long day of work or to just vibe to. I give it a solid 8/10."
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"I don't get why so many people hate on it, one of the few games i bought and played on release day and I've never regretted doing so"
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,It's a pretty great game.  I hope it gets a sequel or something along those lines.
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,Had more fun doing dishes than playing this game.
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-06,This is one of those games where once it comes to game pass it will be the only thing I play.  But I wouldn't spend money on it.
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,Amazing game!
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-06,This looks so cute ü•πü•πü•π
18ys8vh,2024-01-05,2024-01-05,"I actually just started playing it. It's cute but it's kind of dull being on rails non stop. I don't really feel like there's any challenge and its just following the story line.  


Maybe things will get better but it's getting close to sending me to sleep right now. Also WTF is the Field of View in this game? It's like playing a game through binoculars! Thankfully found a fix for it but meh, it's getting boring fast."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,It‚Äôs free on PS+extra. I beat it in an afternoon and thought it was good. No game of the year but it‚Äôs good/different.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"For once I agree with the media reviews on this.

It is a walking simulator. It's very pretty, it's very cute, but it's a walking simulator with very little in the way of actual mechanics or interesting gameplay."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,84% on Metacritic for the PS5 version is fairly high. Certainly above average.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Bots and marketing my dude, game is great, gameplay is progressive, visuals are great, if you're looking for a warm hearted short game this should be in your collection, but it's not goty, but it's Dope to see the amount of hype because they did something pretty unique here, I'm tired of formulaic games and I would say this breaks the mold"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Yeah... even if it wasn't a walking sim... 30 bucks for a 3 hour game is a little much in my opinion.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,The people saying it's goty are out of their minds. It's fun but not close to goty
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Idk about GOTY but if I see another ""LoOk At mY CaT WaTcHiNg mE PlAy tHiS CaT gAmE"" post, I'm gonna lose it."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Reddit is a massive circlejerk. I can guarantee half the people upvoting stray posts haven't even played or seen gameplay of it.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Reddit has a stupid/strange obsession with cats. That's all it is.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"It's because it's got cats in it as the main playable thing, so everyones losing their kidneys over it. It's fake social media excitement is all, to sound engaging and fun.

&#x200B;

It's a fine game, it's not a great game, people are just vapid fucks."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,84% hardly middling but wouldn‚Äôt say GOTY.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,I was looking forward to playing Stray but too bad it's just a walking sim. Might buy it when it goes for sale but current price is way too much for a game like this.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,In other news Redditor discovers mammal preference for other mammals. Reptile minds blown.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"I think because most (?) of them never experienced how unique walking simulators are.    These have been around awhile but if it‚Äôs your first one, might leave a mark."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,There are so many games people love that they would have ignored entirely if the IP was different. That's just not a valid complaint.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Yeah... It's just a huge circlejerk atm. I mean, what's the state of gaming when just a walking simulator of a cat makes ""everyone"" go insane."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Replacing it with a lizard just turns it into Spyro and everyone also loves that game üòÇüòÇ
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"maybe your own perception bias is at play.    


i've seen several non-reddit reviews praising the game highly.    i've also seen shitty reddit hot takes shitting on the game.  


it's something to talk about so people who make content will milk it  ... reddit,  being an echo chamber for attention hungry and just people with no one to talk to.   talk about shit too.    


i don't think there's some larger issue at play of people on reddit being a monolith that is somehow separate from supposed ""legit"" game reviews"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"It's effectively a viral trend, much like the goose game was. It's no technical marvel or narrative masterpiece, but it's a unique and genuine title that's found a wide and appreciative audience that can enjoy it for what it is and the unity it brings to the gaming community. 

And in all honesty all the game awards bs are so pointless it might as well be on the list, there's no objectivity to the GOTY anyway it's effectively a popularity contest of the most recent releases so fuck it cat game for best of the year, might as well be."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"It‚Äôs cause cats.


Tons of people spent 10 bucks on cat ears in halo infinite.


I messaged my friends the other day calling it goty, I still haven‚Äôt even played it.

But yeah I love cats, it might actually be my goty, plus I don‚Äôt care for elden ring."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"All I know is that I loved the game. Didn't expect to get it day 1, but I did. Very much a short but sweet experience. I just want more of it, but what we got was very impactful to me. I am playing Elden Ring right now. Long anticipated game of mine that I am finally getting the chance to play. Andd that game is great, but there's just something about Stray that grabbed me more. If there was more to do I would be playing more stray right now."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Its a good walking SIM but just a walking SIM.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"""Change the premise of the game and the premise of the game would be different!1!!!!!""

Hot take. 

As for the reviews vs reddit...that's pretty bog standard for most things isn't it? Go through Rotten Tomatoes and you'll see the same trend of critics being at odds with users. Professional critics aren't worth listening to on basically any topic."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"I have seen exactly 0 people calling it a GOTY contender. I'm sure they exist but I guarantee you 99% of the time it's just a meme you might not be getting.

Also how is 84 even close to middling, Lol. Reviews for it are overall great."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"It's clearly a meme.  


The whole meme started because people on reddit noticed that user reviews for the game were very high. The reviews are high because people like the game, high user review score are subjective and often just result of expectations management."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,I played it a bit yesterday and i hardly see myself finishing it
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Yes, The game is boring, lazy gameplay etc."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Internet likes cats.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"I don't understand the people that call Stray a walking simulator. It has puzzles and rogue-like portions, and it's quite possible to die in multiple areas from enemies. 

Is it just a derogatory term for any narrative based game or are people just talking about the game without having played it?"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Reviewers base themselves off of how the game sits within the current meta of what makes a good game. Focus on graphics, gameplay, and how much the publisher spends on ads for their website.

Redditors are looking at originality."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"It's ok, but no GOTy for sure.

It has nice visuals and some cute semcebes where you can be a cat.

It's short, there's mininal cinematics or story, and there's nothing innovative behind bryond being a cat.

It'll get mostly forgotten about in a few weeks."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Its the exact same with every story driven, walking sim type game.

Is it going to reinvent gameplay? Nah. Is it an artistic masterpiece? If you ask me, definetely. 

GOTY, fuck no."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Honestly... ""Reptile"" sounds like a neat game as well.

Imagine you're just a chill iguana who gets kidnapped (For use as a pet or food) and has to find their way back home.

I'd play it if it had the quality of Stray."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Game is being memed hard, it‚Äôs ridiculous."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Because Cat people are a breed of their own, so you're getting real reviews ans cat ppl reviews"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,it's a cute gimmick and that's about it. It's at least priced pretty fairly for what it is.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-08-11,"Innovation should be rewarded. Stray isn't just putting a cat in your average platformer/walking simulator. All the things a cat does are blended into gameplay as useful mechanics, usually pretty seamlessly. This game was built around being a cat.

The game also has a fair bit of variety that I appreciated. It may be short but it never overstays its welcome and doesn't feel the need to endlessly repeat a stale gameplay loop. Sometimes it's exploration, sometimes its light puzzles, sometimes it's chase sequences with environmental puzzles, sometimes it's stealth and sneaking.

Of course, the world itself is also very well developed and presented and kind of unique."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-08-15,"It's fun to play something chill sometimes. Stray is the right amount of fun -  I cannot spend hours gaming anymore and I'm past the point of playing hyped/popular games just because everyone likes them. I now prefer games that are engaging , but not so detailed that I spend too much time/energy strategizing. Stray is just that . I've never played ""walking simulators"" before , if that's what this is, then damn - it's good. This will appeal to the casual gamer and I guess that's why it's rated high on several forums."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-08-21,"Played it for maybe an hour at the most and felt like I'd seen all there was to see. A game where you play as a cat should not be entirely context based. 

I was hoping for some hilarious failed jumps, knocking stuff over and AI that reacts to you being basically a stupid animal fumbling its way around a cyberpunk city. 

Give me a cat platformer with combat, turf wars with other cats and the ability to act out every hilarious cat video on the internet and I'll play the shit out of it.

Very pretty game though."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-12-05,"What's annoying is people negatively comparing it to Death Stranding as far as it being a ""walking simulator"". Death stranding has an S-tier story, tons of combat and stealth, as well as a layer of planning and problem solving. There are vehicles and ziplines for travel, too.
The walking is meaningful and the story pushes you to ""want"" to. The multiplayer element is HUGE in making it fun, and the desire to help others pushes you to keep going, to lay down ropes and ladders, among other structures, to help others..
These walks are also magnified ten-fold by some top notch music choices..

Stray though?... I can't concretely judge until I play something but... is it really anything other than just a literal walking simulator with toddler-level puzzles? Lol
I've yet to see any interesting gameplay.

If what I've seen is what it is... then it absolutely does not even deserve to be a nominee of GotY.

GotY and most of the categories easily go to Elden Ring imo.

GoW Ragnarok was just another woke, preachy, cycle of violence narrative with an anticlimactic ending and puzzles that the awful AI instantly and constantly solves for you, with no option to shut them up..."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"This is why I've been ignoring the people gushing about the game. The only things I've seen from it are cat posters and the cat trips random npcs. And runs from something in the sewer but I don't remember enough about that. 

So far I've seen no content posted, no fun game missions or weird but fun things. 

Now, walking simulators are fine in their own right, they have a good calming aspect to them that not a lot of games can boast. 

But the reddit love for this game isn't anything more than crazy cat people coming out in bulk it seems. 

This is like if The Witness made front page daily."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,but theres a run button... :O
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Just because you found the mechanics boring doesn't make it a walking sim. And freeform movement would be a nightmare. You'd be falling off of pipes and thin ledges all the time. It'd be super frustrating.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Yeah, and the user score is 8.9, it's really not that much of discrepancy, I've seen way bigger ones."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"I think you massively overestimate the amount of ""bots"" that exist in the marketing space. Actual humans employed to say nice things, sure. But computer programs, not so much"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Replace cat with literally anything else and nobody cares about the game.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"GotY can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

For me, I got more overall enjoyment and value Stray far more than I did for even Elden Ring."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"I sure hope ""it"" isn't important because you are gonna loose it if you haven't lost it already."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Yeah, the upvote system really creates an illusion of consensus."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Do you remember the early days of youtube? The internet as a whole has a stupid/strange obsession with cats.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Yes, if you replaced the cat with anything else people wouldn't even look at it."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Free on ps+extra tier
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"> It's effectively a viral trend, much like the goose game was

exactly this, a popular game doesn't have to be groundbreaking mechanics or state of the art graphics or even an amazing story. it just needs to be something new and get lucky"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"The game is nothing remotely close to rogue-like it's just dying and respawning at a checkpoint, puzzles are very light the end game area puzzles with the drones you do not even need stealth as just running causes them to miss and they won't fire into a box even if you get into it while they watch."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,"Are they though?  The game is original in presentation, but the actual gameplay is very bog standard walking simulator stuff."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-08-13,"Except it's literally a walking sim and nothing else.
Just because you can't make a good, fun gameplay, doesn't mean that replacing every action in your game  with ""press x to watch a cute cat cartoon"" is a good game design with actual gameplay mechanics."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Fine, a crawling simulator."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"I see this is the first time encountering an opinion.

w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"While believe you are correct because cats are generally superior and all forms, I think it depends on the theme and world built around the animal you want to make the game around."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Death Stranding basically swaps the cat for Norman Reedus.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-08-24,True but that's why the game is made with a cat. I'd like a sequel with a doggo as well
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,You have a right to like Stray more but you‚Äôd be absolutely off your rocker to suggest it as goty.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Waiting for that GOTY Stray release date.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,">For me, I got more overall enjoyment and value Stray far more than I did for even Elden Ring.

I understand games are subjective and opinions and shit, but... that's just wrong lol."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"And the fact that saying the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù thing earns you downvotes, and hides your post so that if enough people disagree with it it won‚Äôt even get seen."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"I mean the cat is the USP of the game. That's like saying if you replaced the blocks in minecraft with smooth, well textured objects people wouldn't look at it"
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,That's really the best way to judge how good the game really is
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-23,Yeah they give good reviews to pretty much all big games cause of money.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"You presented it as fact. Don't worry, you'll do better next time."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-25,Never did play that one. I was a Kojima fan and was watching it. Reviews were not that good so I skipped it.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,"Well let me ask you, what makes a game ‚ÄúGotY‚Äù for you?

Edit: It was a genuine question. If you can‚Äôt answer what a GotY game means to you, as an individual, you have no right to even discuss the topic. But downvote away."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Yes how dare that person enjoy one game more than another. Next you'll be telling me some people prefer different music than me.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-28,"Elden Ring is as overhyped as stray I put 200 hours into the game and while yes it is better than most games out in the market, it does not compare to older FromSoft titles in world design and gameplay balance this could be remedied easily with mods or proper balance patches but sadly FromSoft decided to put EAC on a mainly single-player game, and they don't seem to give a shit to put some effort to fix this broken and buggy game."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,Me and my wife have Reddit accounts. Sometimes my post shows 1-200 upvotes but on her account it shows my post on  10-20. Also the same with comments some of my comments have negatives but when she shows it doesn't show a number at all
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-25,"No, it's not, like at all. The blocks are not sentient protagonists, they are inanimate solid objects in an open spaced sandbox. I do often wonder why I bother engaging with this kind of comment, but this one was particularly dumb.  


Comparing Apples and Apples is fine, comparing Apples and The Titanic is not."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-24,That's not how opinions work. Go back to school.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-26,Yeah and they conveniently hide the controversial sort order when searching posts so you can't find the human posts.
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-25,Yeah but they're both an integral part of the game that makes it stand out from other games. If stray was a game about a human trying to escape then it wouldn't even get a second look. If Minecraft was just a garrys mod clone it wouldn'tve gotten further than being a free download on a forum
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-26,"Controlling a narrative is social media speciality. Just look at the media with things like Rona, religion, politics etc. Majority is BS."
w6d2jr,2022-07-23,2022-07-26,I made a comment saying consoles are expensive I immediately get -5 karma I hop to my other account and would you look at that it's hidden from plain view now because I said the wrong thing.
1en9zn9,2024-08-08,2024-08-09,"Oh, the devs are busy porting the game. Also I didn't know about the animated movie in development. Hopefully all these means they want to expand the IP and there will be sequel someday."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I've tried to get into Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodbourne.

I fucking love the atmosphere of all of the games. The artstyle is amazing.

I just hate. Cheap. Deaths. And lack of checkpoints. I must've dumped at least 50 hours collectively into all these games. I got the furthest in Dark Souls, about halfway through the game. Stopped once I got frustrated trying to navigate myself through Blightown.

Demon's Souls I restarted with new characters countless times. I would get to like, the first boss in every world, beat some of them, die to some of them. Even grinded a ton on 4-1 (the one with the rolling skele's). I just hated the fact that I'd make it so fucking far in an area, and then die to something fucking stupid - like an enemy jumps out from behind a wall, stuns me, and I die. FUCK. Now I have to restart the entire fucking thing and carefully retread my steps for 20 minutes.

Then you FINALLY make it to the boss and he kills you in one hit. You have no idea what the move was, or what the pattern was, because you spent a total of 7 seconds in the bosses lair before you die. Now it's another 25 minutes of getting to the boss again. And don't make a stupid, hasty mistake trying to get to him or you have to start over again.

Literally the only reason I put time in these games was people saying, ""Oh, you just have to learn the enemy attack patterns and be prepared to die a lot.""

Yup. I've realized that these are games where you have to memorize everything. Honestly, that's not fun to me. I think these would be good games if I was a kid and I had time to dump into one game for months on end, but unfortunately I don't.

I just love the way these games look and the atmosphere they present. I wish they were easier, though."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Lmao this thread

Dark Souls is mostly learning patterns so you can time your I-frames right and not get punished.  Yea you'll die a lot before the end of the game but it can be beaten at lv1 with nothing but your fists.  It's about timing your dodges and blocks properly which is totally doable by anyone who invests time into the game.  So many of you guys give up way too easily."

I just run to the end of the arena and punch his hand like 5 times..."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Agreed, the Fume Knight was a complete arsehole of a boss. The only other boss that made me turn a game off for a while was Capra Demon, putting those dogs in there with him was a cheap cheap move!"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"You should watch the speed runs of Bed of Chaos, and then rage"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Don't forget the 4 kings. The only bosses that I refuse to fight by myself.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Most of them I can understand (i.e. Ceaseless and BoC are just badly designed) but in what makes Stray Demon hard? You got to watch out for his magical AOE attacks, but those are very telegraphed.

Btw. I think I had the hardest time with Artorias, but at the same time, it's probably my favorite video game boss ever."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Ceaseless Discharge was easy as fuck, just wait for him to swipe after picking up that armor set, then run past all the way back to the fog.  Then wait for him and he'll put his arm down so you can wack away and then he dies after only a few hits.  It was a gimmick of a boss, like the Bed of Chaos.  Man, fuck the Bed of Chaos, such a pointless battle."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Fume Knight is fucking awesome. He wrecked me hard, but he's an awesome boss for the sheer variety of moves and combos. I like to take him on with either a partizan (piercing damage is good against him) or caestus (manliness and it makes dodging easier if you're up his armpit). By far, my favorite boss of the whole Souls series."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Exact opposite for me. To this day even though I have every achievement in the game on 360 and PC, O+S is the only boss I can't fight by myself. 

And Bed Of Chaos?. That's barely a boss. Four arrows and a jump is all you need. The area around Bed Of Chaos is harder. 

To me the only boss that I feel is stupid hard besides O+S is the Four Kings on NG+.  First time I played them on NG+ made me quit the game for weeks. If I didn't care so much about achievements I probably would have stopped playing the game."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"The stray demon gave you trouble? I thought he was one of the hardest too at first, but on my second playthrough I realized he's actually one of the easiest bosses if you take it slow (1-2 hits at a time) and study his moveset to learn when he's doing an AoE attack. Just keep your distance most of the time, and use estus whenever your health is below like 70%."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I had to fight Artorias for the first time on new game +. That was the toughest Souls boss in Dark Souls for me. Darklurker for Dark Souls 2, and Flame Lurker for Demon souls. Flame Lurker largely because I refuse to use magic. Ever."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,It seems like O&S has a bit more wiggle room in the way of strategies.  Where as with the Stray Demon and some of the others there's only one way to beat them without getting destroyed.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,I don't know why but I had more trouble and fits of rage because of O&S than other of the the others. Maybe because I had to play better to finally beat them (with like 5% health left) 
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,[deleted]
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Really? O&S are the hardest boss in the game to me. I just cannot solo them for whatever reason. Manus, Four Kings, Artorias, and all the others are easy by comparison."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"for me, O&S are still the most dreaded bosses. i could never solo them, and i still cant on an NG.

every other boss i managed solo most of the time, but not those two. even with solaire."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Fume Knight and Sir Allone. That fucker with his bugged to hell stab hitbox.

In DS1, however, no boss gave me even close to as much a hard time as O&S. I did kill Smough first, thou (melee only). Killing Ornstein first is 100 times easier."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"stray demon is super easy if you know what you're doing. Ceaseless discharge is a joke if you know what you're doing, Artorias is tough, but is manageable once you learn his moveset. Sanctuary guardian is hard, but if you have fast rolling and react quickly to his moves, you can dodge all of his attacks. Manus is pretty tough, I'll give you that. O&S however, no matter how much practice you have on this boss, they can still screw you over with bullshit. It is much harder to pay attention to two enemies than just one. The only way to make O&S a consistent win is to summon help, other than that, there is no strategy that works with absolute consistency against them."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"O&amp;S solo was ridiculously difficult for me to complete, but for some reason I had such an easy and fun time with Artorius I would get him down to his last sliver of health and let him kill me so I could keep fighting him "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"O&S, the Kings, artorias, black dragon, and Manus were the only ones I couldn't solo. Stray demon took me a solid 10-20 tries though. That damn magic blast"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I would say that O&S are much harder than Artorias and the Stray Demon. Just poke the stray demon in the butt with no armor on. Bam, problem solved."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Artorias actually isnt too bad on a NG if you're using a tank build with a lot of poise (aka Havel's + greatshield). 

On NG+ however, prepare your anus."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Noone you listed is nearly as hard as O&S, except Manus.  And dual sanctuary guardians.

And many of the bosses in #2 are near O&S, and above the other ones you mentioned.

Seams like we have a classic case of warping perception.  You started the game as a bad player, having problems with pushovers like Stray Demon.  And by the time you got to DS2, the tougher bosses were now below your refined skills, so they appeared easier than they actually are."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"O&S solo took more tries on my first playthrough than any other boss. I'd put Artorias and Manus right up there in terms of difficulty level (also you forgot that asshole Kalameet) but they still didn't give me nearly as much trouble as Biggie Smalls. I think it's the unpredictable nature of the fight that comes from having two seperate entities to fight.

I haven't played the Dark Souls 2 DLC yet but as far as the base game, I thought Velstadt was a real dick."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"It's funny how Dark Souls bosses can be. It seems most people dreaded Fume Knight, but I one-shot him. And yet, I struggled like hell against some other bosses that most found to be a push-over.

Same with Bloodborne."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"The fact that everyone knows this and still finds it difficult is proof that it is in fact hard and not just unfair. It is difficulty in its purest form because even when you know each and every aspect of it, it still comes down to player skill."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Patterns or not, it's still extremely easy to fuck up if you haven't mastered it. The Four Spooky Lords still fuck me up from time to time. And even if it loses it's difficulty after experience, it's still a joy to replay."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I like it. The thing about Dark Souls is that dying is part of the game. You're an undead dude who keeps on dying and dying while trying to stay sane. Everybody is undead. Though if they lose their sanity at some point during their continuous cycle of deaths then they turn into demons or something.

So dying being part of the game you go in, die, learn the mechanics, and then win.

It's pretty fun, though I'm nowhere near as hardcore as a lot of the community. "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"As someone who quit this game after twenty minutes, got that itch of incompletion, and returned, I have one piece of advice for you:

You are not supposed to go in to the graveyard with the skeletons after defeating the first (""tutorial"") boss. Look around for an alternate path. You'll thank me later when you're really enjoying yourself."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"It takes awhile to get into and little bit of pre-knowledge (what stats to upgrade, how to upgrade weapons, what humanity is), but it is all worth it. The first playthrough will make you want to fucking kill yourself, but when you look back on it and really think about the design and the mechanics, you realize how good it really was. Some of the bosses are basically my favorite bosses from any game ever, and the DLC is in my top 3. Not every boss and area is perfect, but no game is. Dark Souls 2 is kind of a asshole (I'm not fond of it compared to the first game), but I like to think the first game just makes you work for it. When you die you have to get back up. The moment you rage quit, you lose. Practice practice practice. Practice rolling (I frames), practice timing, practice parrying, etc. "

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Give it a go, I've never finished any of them, but I enjoy them. Once you get the hang of it it becomes quite methodical, almost relaxing."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-18,The challenge and reward is very very addictive. Small steps. I only finally beat it last week after putting it down for over a year.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,I play on PC too. You NEED a controller.

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Never stop moving. Make sure you can see both of them at all times. My favorite way to play is straight strength so I'm always two handing a great club, but for your first go I'd recommend always keeping your shield up unless you are attacking or rolling through attacks (although that obviously depends on your skill with I frames), especially since Ornstein likes to be a little unpredictable and can hide attacks behind Smough. You 100% NEED to upgrade the fire to 10 estus flasks if you haven't. Make sure if you need to chug you are behind a pillar where you won't get hit. Pillars are the easiest way to stop Smough's charge attack. If you're fighting SPOILERS!!! ~~Big Ornstein~~ staying at his feet generally seems to be easier for me than mid range."

It's notoriously difficult. Not in an unfair way, but it absolutely punishes carelessness or arrogance.

OPs gif is making fun of a famously difficult boss fight. Google Ornstein and Smough if you want more material. /u/The_Nipple_Tickler 's gif is a tiny part of a hilarious video called [""manly miner men.""](https://youtu.be/2K1NZPWau_I)

In that video, one of the players with a pickaxe is the ""host."" The other pickaxe guy is a friendly summons. They're using real in-game weapons and clothes and other items to simulate two hard-working miners. The blue and red players are hostile invaders. Some of them get the gag and play along, others just try to kill the host and his friend. It's a brilliant use of the game to make something entertaining for the fans."

I'm really disappointed in myself for that. :("

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"The first time I fought him I was running super heavy.  So heavy I could tank the blast of fire from his slam.  So I just stood a little further back than his arm reached with my shield up, then bashed his arm a bit."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-18,I fought and killed him once. Before i learned the easy way online. It was probably the single most brutal and unforgiving fight in the entire game. Those tentacles are next to impossible to dodge.

You should see a little window ledge off to the right from the top of the stairs. If you time your jump right you can land on it and deal with the dogs from the high ground, then jump down and smack around capra."

Except the Fume Knight. Did I mention he can get fucked forever?"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"4 kings is just a DPS race.  
Go in there with the best armor you got, highest damage output you got and 20 estus+humanity  and just hammer away at them.  "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Git gud.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I usually go for the full Havel set and just tank them. The trick is to only focus on one at a time and keep on attacking when they die, so they continue to lose HP for a moment.

As long as you don't get ganked, the fight is pretty easy."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Fighting it by yourself is the way to go. When you summon someone (npc or human) bosses get an hp boost. Four kings already have the most health of any boss, so it's even worse with them. Just get close and side roll into the swings. "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"How do people have so much problems with this?

I mean SL1 runs ... sure, could be hard. But other than that? 2h weapon and you can easily DPS each of them down before the next spawns. Hell even if they fucking grab you on every occasion there's usually enough time, it's not like you have to play perfectly."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Huh I just did the 4 kings for the first time a few weeks ago. I had this super defensive agility build where I use real heavy armor and a agility scaling sword. I thought the fight was so boring since all the kings did was tickle me. 
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Let me clarify: I may rage and curse most of these bosses, but in reality, there is nothing better than the feeling of beating a hard boss fair and square. I don't think Fumey is particularly cheap, he just has sick range and a fuckton of HP. Very challenging is what I'd call him. The only really shitty boss in the whole Souls series is the combo of Throne Defender and Watcher. Again, not incredibly difficult, just badly designed.

The best boss in the entire Souls series is a hard one. Here are my favourites:

- Old King Allant (Demon's Souls)
- Penetrator (Demon's Souls)
- Sif (Dark Souls)
- Gwyn (Dark Souls)
- Looking Glass Knight (Dark Souls 2)
- Velstadt (Dark Souls 2)

and my absolute favourite of them all, Darklurker. Also Dark Souls 2."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"How can you not beat O&S after so much time spent on the game? Kite Ornstein away from Smough and you basically have a 1on1 battle about the difficulty of Dragonslayer in DS2.

Smough is fat and slow. Just run from him. Ornstein will follow you without problems and then you can duel him."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Never stop moving. Make sure you can see both of them at all times. My favorite way to play is straight strength so I'm always two handing a great club, but for your first go I'd recommend always keeping your shield up unless you are attacking or rolling through attacks (although that obviously depends on your skill with I frames), especially since Ornstein likes to be a little unpredictable and can hide attacks behind Smough. You 100% NEED to upgrade the fire to 10 estus flasks if you haven't. Make sure if you need to chug you are behind a pillar where you won't get hit. Pillars are the easiest way to stop Smough's charge attack. If you're fighting SPOILERS!!! ~~Big Ornstein~~ staying at his feet generally seems to be easier for me than mid range.

If he had a smelter demon fire core, he would be pretty bad."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,You can make the fight pretty intense by activating the red tearstone ring and relying on dodges only. Go one step further and do it at soul level one. For full insane mode do all of the previous steps but wait for 4+ of them to spawn and attempt it that way. 
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Yeah in NG as long as they don't do the AoE attack you're golden.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,I like that Bed of Chaos is so shitty it doesn't even make the bad list. Solid list though. I feel like humanoid enemies with combos and movesets are usually the most fun. I actually still need to go through Darklurker though.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Gwyn took me so long to figure out.

I was so used to blocked and countering enemies his size, that when he just kept slashing and doing damage through my shield, I really started panicking. His moves were quick, and difficult for me to tell which one he was going to do. Eventually a buddy told me to trying parrying him, which never even occurred to me, and that's how I eventually beat him. I'm not sure how you're supposed to know that parrying is even an option. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you can parry any other boss.

"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,I beat Velstadt on the first go last night on NG+5. I use the red eye ring to get his attention and let the companion do a lot of the work. Mirror Knight has never been a problem though. For some reason I lost to Vendrick 5 times in a row even though I brought all five of my giant souls into the fight. He kept one shotting my ass.

I just can't do it solo. It took about six months of stopping the game and trying to pick it back up. But since the game doesn't teach you shit I learned after that six month that there were summons in the game and multiplayer. I didn't even know the difference between human and non human was. I thought the Effigy just gave you more health. 

Then i watched a speed run, and started reading the wiki on how to actually play the game. 

There is no question that this is the best game of the last generation"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,That strategy works if you want Smough's armor. I think it's way tougher to kill Smough first for Ornstein's set. Never pulled it off alone.

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Yeah, that seems to typically be the case for any multi enemy boss fights."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,If you know what he does he's not hard. But fighting him the first few times I had no idea how to avoid his onehit-kill AoE shit. 
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Manus is pretty easy as long as you have good shield stability. You can take Manus without taking damage with a shield and the pendant.

I made it through the tutorial and thought, ""What's everyone bitching about? Sure this game is punishing, but not to an unfair degree!""

Then I took the turn the game assumes you will take--In addition to teaching you to follow enemy patterns and to never underestimate even the ""easiest"" creatures, the game also teaches you to explore if you want to succeed--and ran in to those fucking skeletons. I've never ragequit so hard in my life.

But it was a lesson, like all things in *Dark Souls*. If something isn't working for you, even after several tries, you probably need to try something else."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"the thing is though, as long as you have a weapon that does enough damage to keep 2 from spawning at once, rolling 4K attacks is a piece of cake."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"A lot of people seem to. I don't understand it.
Especially since it isn't a fight with multiple entities ... unless you're too slow.

I mean either you're underleveld and haven't upgraded your weapons properly (aka you're not dealing enough damage) or you're losing to much time getting hit by them instead of dodging their attacks.

Run to the first, smash his face in asap and he'll be dead easily 5 seconds or more before the second one spawns. It only becomes a multiple bosses fight if you're too slow.

And I think players with a tank build have ways of dealing with this boss without rushing him down - seeing as there are a lot of comments here about people facetanking all four all of them with havels or some shit.

I just kinda feel like you shouldn't stop trying. Stip naked, get a Claymore, upgrade it to +10 or some shit, twohand it and go wreck those bastards. Just dodge their attacks and attack in between attacks.

Again I totally understand the problems with fights against multiple bosses but if you have more than one of the 4kings active you already fucked up imo. Properly played this is a single entity boss fight."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"So you are telling me. I can make the game more challenging by making it harder for myself. Never would have guessed. 

It's one of the things that annoy me about Dark Souls. You are not supposed to use magic because that makes the game too easy, or use a bow because the AI is too dumb to figure out where you shot from. You have to intentionally set limits on yourself for the game to actually be challenging. "

This is why O&S took me like 40 tries for the first kill - I only bet them when I found out about kindling bonfires. With 20 Estus Flasks you can compensate taking a hit every time you go for a hit on Smough.

Their only mechanic is that they'll try to raise the other one when they die, so you need to kill them close together (or have some insane burst damage ready).

Get the homeward spell and go down into like the sewer area before the giant rat. There's a run that you kill about 10 rats and can get 3-5 effigies per run that takes about 2 minutes to do as long as you can kill them with one hit and no clothes on to run faster. I used to get about 50+ per hour I think.

Of these at least armor weight is really important to understand in order to properly play the game. My first char had extremely heavy armor but hardly any protection. I could not beat the gargoyles for the life of myself because my roll was too slow to dodge and my defense too low to tank.
Also cursed status. If you do not stumble over the female undead merchant - which is utterly possible seeing as the entire area is completely option - you cannot uncurse yourself until you find the dude on the house in the new londo ruins."

I played an INT build on DS 1 and 2, my only saving grace was finding a magic weapon that scaled off INT instead of DEX, I would get wrecked standing still casting spells "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Yep. Each spell has a use linit before you rest at a bonfire (checkpoint)
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,It's not as bad as in D&D. Your spells reset after every checkpoint and you get a lot of casts. The biggest reason people don't usually go full mage is that it's hard starting out. You're kinda weak and don't have a lot of casts until you get more spellslots. You can easily get a melee weapon the benefits from magic for the first thirty or so levels though.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Being a glass cannon is not easy in Dark Souls and You only have a limited amount of casts per spell you pick.  It is very helpful to have some skill in melee.
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"You can only cast spells a limited number of times before testing at a bonfire again, but you can pick a bunch of different spells. As it is DS of course you don't get unlimited anything except punishment. Also they have done spells differently the last 3 editions of D&D. It was pretty rough in 3.5, 4th was way different but I can't say if it was better or worse and 5e is awesome. Limited but awesome.
"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Spells can only be cast a certain number of times before needing to be 'refreshed.'  Refreshing your spells also respawns basic level enemies that you've already killed. Many spells also root your character for a good time, making you vulnerable to opponents charging or doing a sudden attack.  It's easier to use weapons and supplement your playstyle with magic attacks for certain enemies with magic weaknesses or that are ranged."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Limited spell uses is a big reason. Also, the game encourages hybrid builds by including weapons that scale with intelligence/faith (the two spell stats), so even your grand wizard build will still chunk dudes with sword attacks."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,The trick is to start out melee build up to about level 60-70 and then merge into what magic you want. I use miracles so I start bandit and get my stats good enough for the sun sword and then some vigor then I build faith and attunement so I can use lightning spear and the such
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Me too actually, but going full wizard is for people already used to the game as it is very hard not having a armor with almost everything killing you in one hit or combo without it edit: Also lots of importante speels are only found late in the game edit2: on PvP a experienced player will Dodge all your spells edit 3: yes, spells are limited"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Man I'm getting off-topic but I love the D&D magic system. The spells can get really broken so it's good they've got a limit on them, plus it makes you have to be more conservative/ inventive with your spell usage. "
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Yes. I was just pointing out that he may be confused...
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"All three for each. Like I said, they are broad categories :) Lots of potential for experimentation and fun. Give it a shot. You won't be sorry.

EDIT:

I think I spoke too soon. Not sure of any healing spells in sorcery or pyromancy, but they do have attacks and buffs. Miracles have all three."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"That one is cool, but it's not my kind of weapon.


I want to know what the secondary is for the hammer.  It looks like it has a large trigger on the head.  Maybe it's another kind of flamethrower?"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,Don't you have to kill 4 kings to get a dark hand?

80% for all types of damage afaik"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"True that. Though, I still feel great whenever I land a Sunlight Spear on someone and do about 700 damage."
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"> That being said, magic is actually incredibly powerful (and awesome) in PvE, but when you get invaded or invade (PvP, have to fight another person in your game) your opponent can easily navigate around and punish your use of ranged projectile spells.

Yeh, this is why. Typically when you see gifs/video of Dark Souls it's from seasoned players, and seasoned players typically don't play full wizard (you never go full wizard) because they like to play PvP and magic is basically useless in PvP. 

A lot of players don't realize how powerful magic is against monsters, though."

3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"Fair enough, guess it fits to have a limited use of spells in DS, but I guess in that case I'd just use melee... Do people who play pure mage just have to do the tedious ""Use spells to clear area, go back to bonfire, go back to where you were"" rinse and repeat?"
3l9qcj,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,"I haven't played many D&D games, I just like games where you throw an entire library's worth of spells at people - 'cause zapping people it fun."

110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"That‚Äôs the story of most video games.  Launch, do a majority of the volume of sales in the first week to month, and be forgotten.  Absolute rarity to have a game like NMS that remains active after so many years."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,"Now days everybody talk  
Like they got something to say but nothing meows it   
And when they mash square  
Just a bunch of jibberish and mtherf**kers act like   
Like they forgot about Stray"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,"I still recommend it to people, but it's a very encapsulated story with only a small amount of replay value (and that's only if you missed things on your first run). I'm not surprised at all but I don't think it's necessarily a reflection of whether or not it was a good game. I loved it."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-15,They finishes the game and that was it I don‚Äôt see the issue
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"It was very, *very* cute, but a pretty mediocre game. It was fun to play, but you'll never need to play it more than once. 

And you might literally only recommend it to cat people."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"it‚Äôs a short linear game where you walk around as a cat

haven‚Äôt understood the hype when it came out but i certainly understand why people forgot about it already. not because it‚Äôs short and linear but because it looks boring except for the fact.. well that you walk around as a cat."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,Certainly one of the most unique games I've played
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"I thought the same the other day. Have bought but not started.
Isn't it the same with Valheim though? Completely different game but no hype anymore."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,My friends and I collectively agreed it was boring.
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,It‚Äôs so niche.
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Stray.

Joking aside, it was a very short and focused linear adventure game. I view it as a tech demo for an upcoming cat MMORPG with realistic cat physics."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,Because it was a boring game
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,"So you're telling me the 5 hour walking sim in which you couldn't manually jump has not left an impression?

Color me surprised."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-08-05,"It's a boring game. The hype was just that you play a cat, that's all."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Eh, I haven‚Äôt played it, but it is definitely something I‚Äôll pick up during a Steam sale for $9.99 or something. The game is just too short for $30."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,I keep talking about Skyrim.
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,You need to divide that KD ratio by 9 due to the nature of cats lives
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"""bu-but you play as a cat!!!! It's a goty material!!"""
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,10/10
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,I came here for this
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Half Life 2 is a single player game. Still gets a video essay every 2 or 3 months. Stray wasnt just a single player game, it was a really boring single player game"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,Gow hype live maybe 2 week.
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"There are puzzles and stuff, so it's more fun than you might think. Depends on what kind of games you are into tho."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"I played it and loved it but i agree, even one of my favs games that least 2:30h o wouldnt pay more than 10 for it, and its one of my favs"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,Same I would try it when it‚Äôs 0.99$
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,Nice try Todd.
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,You're why we don't have ES6...
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,There were GMod addons for that in 2016
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Yeah it gets a video essay NOW, cause it's like 20 years since release and reviewing old classics is pretty popular. Stray is a brand new game.

Besides, comparing Stray to one of the most influential and universally acclaimed video games of all time seems a bit unfair. You put the bar waaay too high man."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-13,In contrast to Stray it still is widely more relevant
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"It not comparing the two literally. What I meant was that Stray boring and forgotten Half Life 2 interesting and remembered. Or hell, any singeplayer game where you can do something. It didnt flop because its a single player game, it flopped because it was boring"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Just because Stray won't be remembered as much as HL2 doesn't mean it's bad or boring. It just means it isn't as good as one of the best games ever made. Again, put the bar lower mate."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"It didn't flop though. The game sold around 2.5million copies.

To add: it also won several awards such as best indie game and PS Game of the year"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"I meant they are remembered. Interesting games are remembered, one way or the other. Of course they dont get video essays but they still have a community or a modding scene"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Replace HL2 with almost any singleplayer game and my example would work. Stray wont be remembered because its boring as a game. It will be remembered as ""the one game with da funny cat"". Of course a game doesnt need to reinvent the wheel to be interesting, but Stray is a walking simulator where you press buttons to jump only when the game wants you to"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Awards mean nothing these days. And dont necro this argument, it was a giant dick measuring contest"
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"Stray is still remembered, just not as much. And that's normal."
110bv8f,2023-02-12,2023-02-12,"> dont necro this argument

It was a couple hours old..."
