Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-15,nice to see they used real actors who can relate instead of dressing someone up as a cat to fake it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-15,glad to see she hasnt let it all go to her head
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-15,biggest va of the year snub. would have had a shorter acceptance speech too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,after i beat stray i watched a few different people play it and it blew my mind how rarely any of them meowed lol. i don't think i saw anyone get the achievement for meowing x number of times. meanwhile i got it within the first thirty minutes of the game lol. my entire playthrough was step meow step meow step repeat seven hours.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,this game depressed me for some reason. maybe cause i have 4 cats and cant imagine losing any of them or they being separated. only game that has had that affect on me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"i got that same achievement in like 40 minutes lol, because i thought it was cool at the part where the cables shake when you meow. after that not much though."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,my husband watched me play he's the better gamer by far but he said it was more fun to watch me enjoy it and he was not surprised at all when i got that achievement within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. the meow button was one of my favorite parts of that game lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,the second i figured out i could press button to meow i was mashing that mf
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,same. meowed almost constantly. and then i got to the stealth section and forgot that meowing is in fact not very stealthy meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"i did it just like you. i was meowing, all. the. time. meow meow meow as i did everything. loved that game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,i got the achievement in my first play through. i dont remember how long it took me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"i got sleep for an hour achievement almost first thing. i had left the game open on accident before i went to bed, and i decided to sleep ingame before i saved. i think it was the 4th achievement i got, the one before was meowing 100 times. i got all of the beingacat related achievements before getting to the big tree city thing which was scratching things and jumping 500 times."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"same, haven't finished it but i've been meowing at everything. once i saw it light up a string of lights i was like... what other secrets does meowing hold?!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,seriously... i spent a lot of time just doing stuff... finding all the spots to chill at and let the cat nap.. it was a chill experience. also the paint.. and making paw prints.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,my brother was way too happy with the fact that you could meow during cutscenes. i don't think there was a cutscene that he wasn't meowing through.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,i got that achievement in the first 20 minutes of playing. i was playing with my two catmates and they loved it.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,stray 2 is going to be one of those games that takes what the first does and transcends an entire genre and defines what games are allowed to be going forward. the amount of care and love i saw in that first game convinced me that the sequel is going to be amazing. it reminds me of portal in that way. get a better story with better puzzles and more interesting use of mechanics and you've got a recipe for goty

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"i know nothing about this cat in particular, but she was probably trained for filmtv like the character goose in captain marvel, a cat in a cat food commercial, or the monkey in pirates of the caribbean. to take another guess, the cat may be naturally chatty, and so the trainer worked to develop her into performing different types of vocalizations on cue a cute meow, hissing, yowling, etc. after the casting director got over their initial i have to cast what now?! they probably started asking around in the niche animal actor community and someone was like oh, i have the perfect cat!. other considerations that the casting director probably had to account for besides a cat who sounded appropriately catlike would be the range of vocalizations the cat can perform, their willingness to perform in an unfamiliar sound studio i heard they were worried goose wouldn't like the actors in their alien costumes since they were totally unfamiliar, their willingness to perform directly in front of a microphone, and their willingness to perform over and over again i think jack the monkey could be difficult to work with at times because he got bored of doing the same thing."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,youre absolutely right. i love my little orange but she is in outer space all the time. also idk if its all oranges or just mine but she doesnt make normal cat noises  her meow is like a little tea kettle.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"my least talkative cat so far has been an orange tabby. even when he does meow, which is infrequent, it's very quiet. my most talkative cat was a russian blue and i dearly miss him. interestingly enough, when he died recently, my next oldest male cat, a tuxedo, started meowing a lot more. i think he's taken the place of leader and representative of my cat pack. he's the one who tells me when a bowl needs filling and meows at me when i come home like his big bro used to do even though he didn't really do it before. it's been interesting to watch the shift in the hierarchy."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"you can like a game more than other games and still acknowledge the game you liked less was better. people have different tastes, which is why for some people a niche 910 game is way more enjoyable than a broad 1010 game. stray is exactly that, a niche 910 game. did i enjoy it more than a 1010 game? maybe. doesn't mean the game is better, means i enjoyed it more. to give you an analogy, lets say we have american football and then basketball. you don't like basketball and enjoy football more, but you can acknowledge that basketball is still a better sport to most people, therefore making it better."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-17,"meh gaming year? lol elden ring and ragnarok are two 1010 games released in the same year. not meh at all. and if a 910 game is nominated, it does not make it a meh year lol. and ragnarok lost, so then it's regarded in the same range as stray, when it clearly isn't."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-17,"you have no clue what you're talking about. now more developers will make something other than dark souls games? there are only 3 dark souls games lol and if you think fromsoft is going to stop making soulslike games then you're just wrong. as a whole the gaming industry might take some inspiration from stray, but nobody is looking at stray and saying god, we need to make something unique to capitalize on the market!, because simply speaking, those who had that philosophy before will keep it and those who didn't won't gain that view from stray. elden ring is much better than stray, whether stray is more original or not. you're completely right saying that stray is unique, i think more games like stray need to be made that are unique and stand out. that being said, it does absolutely not compare to elden ring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,"there are many prompts for places to jump in stray. there are some areas that are blocked with those pigeon spike type things, and obviously you can't jump from a height that will be fatal or leave the cat injured. some areas have fewer jump spots, for challenge... it's no where near as bad as this person makes it out to be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,you can jump on pretty much anything that would make sense to jump on or that you would need to. it's a really good game don't listen to the other guy definitely pick it up on sale

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,i own cats and they don't usually just randomly jump unless they've been frightened. in stray the cat can jump onto anything that makes sense for a cat to jump onto.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,there's so much vertical environment in stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 910 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-16,so they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"spanish, portuguese, italian, french, and romanian are all romance as in roman languages  they evolved from vulgar latin the latin of common people, as opposed to classical. you will get a lot of similarities, not just in words but in grammar too, like how every word has gender, the existence of the la, el, le, las, los, etc, the generaltospecific word order big yellow cat becomes big cat yellow  gros chat jaune  gran gato amarillo  grande gato amarelo  grande gatto giallo  you will realise that the germanic languages english, dutch, german, icelandic, scandinavian norwegian, swedish, danish, uralic finish, estonian, hungarian, slavic russian, ukrainian, romance languages, greek and the indopersian languages are similar like the word father, pater, pitar, vater, fair, padre, batko, pateras i mean, even the word cat, gato, katze, gat, qut, chat i make this point because in india, the northern languages, based on sanskrit, is more similar to all the languages i said above, than it is to the southern languages based on oldtamil. the southern languages don't have a the, there isn't a 'is' es, ist, hai, words do not have genders like in germanic and romance languages, a lot of concepts of gerunds and grammar are different, like you know how you would say i have a cat, tengo un gato, ho un gatto, habe einen katze, ya maru kota, paas ek billee hai in tamil it's ennakku oru poonai irukku. literally, to me, one cat exist so er yeah when so much is different, never ask an indian if they speak indian it's not even close to do you speak european, it's like do you eat stuff? sorry i got carried away"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"it's a few years old, its pretty good though. its survival horror but it reminds me a lot of stray. where you play someone who is suddenly cast into a completely alien environment, everyone else is gone, and you spend your time exploring and trying to make sense of what happened and who you are. they both rely on a strong narrative and exploration, some light puzzles, no combat, no inventory management."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,downloaded it at 2pm.. played uninterrupted until 9pm.. when i finished the game. pretty fun!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"lol. i'm nearly finished already. absolutely love this game. wish it was longer this is probably already known by most people here but for anyone who doesn't know, you can let the cat sleep for an hour to get the productive day trophy. at first i was like, aw cute it sleeps but why lol. also wanted to know if i had to let him recharge. you don't. it's mostly for the trophy and for ambiance. you can fall asleep next to the music robot forget the name after giving it a piece of sheet music you want played as well. could make for a good nap time for you as well lol. just thought i'd mention for anyone who didn't know!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i wanna give it a try sometime.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i agree with a lot of the issues on gameplay too linear, easy puzzles but there are so few games with this aesthetic that i try to support every one i find. last game with an art style i loved this much was quadrilateral cowboy and i still play it sometimes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this game is great but made me tear up so many times. i lost my cat this year and hearing the cat meow in my headphones makes me miss her.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i dont see why everybody gets so defensive when someone mentions the short length or the easiness or the linearity. its not personal theyre valid critiques.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,twenty five quid seems a lot for under 5hrs of gameplay. ill wait for a sale
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,i wish we'd have this on psp
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i just want the cat to occasionally just ignore all your controls like a real cat would do.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"even if its 30 for 5 hours, thats 6 an hour. thats less than lunch for two. its totally worth it. its a cute game with an adorable aesthetic and totally worth it. meowsassins creed"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i'm still playing the game but does anyone know if you can miss memories? i was way too scared of trying to get doc that i've missed some memories and it's irritating me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm about 3 hours in. i personally feel like this is really fresh and so creative. i'm a big fan of games like inside, limbo, journey, abzu, edith finch, etc... so i'm biased! however, i feel that people are focusing so much on the cat that they're missing how rich and thoughtfully constructed the game is. the gameplay is as simple as it could bebut it works. that simplicity allows the player to enjoy all of the intricacy of the world the culture of the robots, the curious nostalgia of this postapocalyptic landscape, the sweet and optimistic relationships between characters, the spectacular soundtrack. it's not for everyone. but i certainly don't find it boring, the pacing seems quite effective. i think it is a game that demands a lot of the player, however. it is kind of only interesting if the player allows simple aspects of the game's world and environment to become the meaning of the experience. i think that if it's taken to be almost meditativeif its pace is acceptedit has a lot to offer. and it's so clearly a labor of love!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"okay, there's a few problems here and there, sure. like occasional clipping, the animations can be a little jerky, and most importantly the game sometimes really struggles with implementing vertical gameplay in a compelling and atmospheric environment. what i'm saying is that there's a lot of times when you clearly see that you should 100 be able to climb a building or something using the very prominent ledges and whatnot but the game just won't allow you to. but that's honestly about it. other than that this game is literally everything we've been waiting for, it really doesn't disappoint."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,great game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i hate the game. it's overpriced if you don't get it for free with the playstation plus. you can't argue it's not. it's 5 hours long if you just play through your first time without looking for the collectables and it's 30. most of the game is scripted such as the jump ability. not being able to jump freely removes all difficulty from the game and pretty much makes this game nothing but a walking simulator with a story and a few puzzles. i know i'm going to get hate for this but it's the truth. this game is over hyped only because you get to play as a cat. if you played as a human nobody would praise the game.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"okay i saw this game on my steam queue but ignored it thinking it was some lame game in my search for games that fit my desires, seeing as its popular i find what i believed to be unlikely so can someone give me a gameplay not plot summary?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,i wouldn't mind keeping this cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,just started occasionally meowing at the wife and kids  quite amusing their reactions.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-08,the way he acted when you first put on the harness brought back so many memories.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-11,"hey guys i have a question for those that finished the game stray. what are the life lessons you can learn from the game? moral lessons, painful truths, any lessons"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-17,man loved this game so much! might be game of the year and i don't even like cats got platinum on it! hoping for a second stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i love that this isn't even really a joke, it kinda is lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,those sewers wigged me out so bad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so that's nyanners?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i was kind of interested in the game up until i read what it actually was. not my cup of tea. lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so its the cat from captain marvel?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"well, my cat got into ma's depends and got its head stuck in a plastic bowl...stumbling around... so more like elden ringtone cat!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love meowing at cameras
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"how does it compare to cyberpunk 2077, though? better, or worse, in your book? just curious, really"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love just being a little  i scratched up the rugs and walls theres a robot that you can sleep on top of also
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"amazing game. definitely took an unexpected tone in some parts, !i am specifically talking about the room make of eyes and eldritch horrors.! not that that's bad, just... i was not ready for that in what i thought was a silly cat game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,can't wait to get my paws on this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"hour into it and it's fun and my cats seem to enjoy it...alittle too much, get your fluffy butts away from the screen"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,i'm ootl can someone explain why i'm seeing this everywhere
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"yes. thank you. i added this to my steam wishlist the minute i saw the gameplay video. such an amazing concept. very creative. oddly enough, stray seemed to be an experience where i knew anything i imagined, no matter how cool, wouldn't come close to the actually finished product. i have high hopes for this one!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's really good so far.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,little nightmares
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i got a similar feeling from firewatch. exploratory and ambiance.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"cloudpunk sorta. its a softer, sometimes lighthearted voxelstyled cyberpunk game. selling point is being a relaxing hovercar drive around game. similar chill vibe."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,tokyo jungle
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lost ember
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've gotta second flower as far as the chill vibe, though it doesn't have the intellectual depth that stray has dealing with hard subjects like poverty, human greed, etc... flower is literally just drifting in a field as a gust of wind and hitting all the flowers until the field lights up and brings you to the next little maze. as far as the theme goes, detroit become human has that futuristic wasteland aitakingover type of vibe and it's got a really good message to it too. plus you can make choices throughout the game, giving you different outcomes based on what you choose. if you haven't already played this one of course lol, i know it was pretty popular when it came out"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"its an older game, but prior to playing stray it reminded me of tokyo jungle, the gameplay is not at all similar but wandering around a city as a small animal has its similarities."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"spirit of the north is similar not in world design, but in general concept you play an animal and just get dropped into the world with no real idea what's actually going on, at the beginning. and as you progress you learn more and more about the environment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the closest thing is machinarium honestly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,caroline
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"cave story. i instantly felt a connection between stray and cave story between the pretty environments, the small towns, and the goal to seek out memories. cave story is an action platformer and not necessarily relaxing but it felt similar in tone, style, and atmosphere."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"inside and limbo. darker and more linear games but similarly beautful in their own way. also, my absolute favourite machinarium."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,inside.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,spirit of the north is kiiiiinda like it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it isnt an open world, but i got one shot vibes from the game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-08,you should play soma to the end.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,!thats the only thing that kinda disappointed me but i also wouldve cried!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,im hoping we get a sequel or dlc where that happens
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-17,"for real, i went through the whole game like yeah, gonna reunite you with your buddies and then b12 dies and i cant pick him up and take him with me in hopes of finding someone to repair him. and then the door opens and i think this is it, even closer to finding my pals. nope. fuck me. overall loved the game though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"possibly my favorite game of all time is called inside. it's a simple lefttoright puzzle platformer of sorts with an intense moody atmosphere and mysteriouseerie setting. not too long, but definitely worth multiple playthroughs. and the sound design is absolutely on point. i'd highly recommend it, especially since it's not too long."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i enjoy my big aaa 60 hour open worlds, but a nice short little game like this with great polish and atmosphere makes for a superb pallet cleanser"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i prefer short games now. i don't have the time to play long games. it's reached the point where if a game is supposed to be a huge, sprawling experience it kinda pushes me away from trying it. i work constantly all week and maybe have 34 hours to play a game every couple weeks. i can't play all these 100 hour games like i could in high school and college."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,majority of reddit is a bunch of entitled kids who want to only see things they like and anything else is garbage. im insanely excited to play this game and everything about it is up my alley
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my ideal length for games is 20 to 30 hours. ill happily play shorter games but not longer games. games i have enjoyed  the pathless  the last of us  spiderman 2018 games i will play  tlou2  spiderman mm  stray started yesterday  firewatch games that are too big for me  ac valhalla  rdr2  cyberpunk id happily take suggestions on unique, beautiful, fun up to 30 hour games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,honestly i was happy paying 120 for ratchet and clank cuz the experience was worth it even though technically it's only 14hrs sometimes games don't need to be super long to be super enjoyable especially if gameplay would start to lag around 20hours ac val was probably the worst for this felt like i spent a week actually in game on it and got nowhere but stray is shaping up to be a memorable fun experience that i can always treasure d
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if it costs 25, i better be getting my money's worth. at approx 46 hours, i don't think this is worth the money."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"stray will be reminded for two things the novelty of concept and atmospheric design. i say that because every other part of the game is mediocre or worse but you know what, it's novel as hell and the art styleanimations are great. sound is pretty good too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's on spotify
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,saw it on steam today
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it would have been nice if it were a little longer as long as the gameplay was more varried i would have hated if they extended the popabug section.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,there's an achievement for doing the whole game in under two hours. i'll give it a go now i've played through it once. it'll be an interesting challenge.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,how many hours did it take you?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"can't wait to play it. i think of games like this journey, abzu kind of like a movie experience. i usually spend around 30 at amc for a ticket and popcorn, and if i really like the movie i'll watch it multiple times at home or sometimes even again in the theater and catch new things the second watch through."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,what button do you press to drag your butt across the freshly cleaned carpet? what about leaving a pile of slimy unchewed food?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,also can you just paw things off a dresser or counter just to be an asshole? wouldnt be a cat game without that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,hopefully you can chew on a plant and then throw it up a couple minutes later as well. ill refund if i cant.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cats do that in real life.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you cant even jump in it. its a huge letdown for me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,motion blur is often a culprit that causes that. see if you can disable it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,sitting in a cardboard box will help keep you oriented. make sure it's the smallest one you can fit in so your body is making 4 points of constant contact.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"aside from motion blur as others have mentioned, excessive monitor brightness can cause it in some cases. as well as too wide fov if you're playing on pc on an ultrawide."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"me too. turned motion blur off like i do for every game, but started feeling sick after about 30 minutes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,turn off motion blur. it's literally used to disguise framerate drops. i turn it off in every game. just the stupidest feature ever.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"i'm having the same issue, which is pretty usual for me sadly. if they'd add a fov slider or something similar, that would help a lot."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,welcome to my life. can i ask you about some others? the last of us? the witcher 3? v rising? also if you can turn the fov up on anything that helps tremendously
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,check the fov and see if it can be changed. that always gives me motion sickness.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its not motion blur. you have no frame of reference where you're looking. turn the pointer thingy on. makes it purrfect
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,turn on the crosshair and focus on it during gameplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,oh no! i get motion sickness really easy so this worries me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"saaaame, had motion blur turned off too. was able to watch my bf play though, the ending made us both cry."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"didn't happen to me, but decreasing motion blur and camera sensitivity should help."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"as people are saying the off motion blur setting may help but also if you're playing on a tv, also check out your tvs motion settings tvs these days have a built in motion smoothing. turn that off"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,have a fan blowing on you. it works for vr also.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,fov or field of view. increasing it should help. also some games do stupid stuff with the camera like shaking the screen. those effects always give me motion sickness.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"aside from motion blur already mentioned, expand 'field of view' to max to help with motion sickness if option is available."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"just to make sure you are on safe side. make sure your computer can run this game. i bought this game since i was visiting family, and my older pc which is like 6 years old couldn't run this game. a lot of people are having trouble with the game off steam. apparently something with ps5 exclusive allowed people to get the game for free."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its not supposed to be an open world nor a challenging game if thats what your expectations were
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i thought a short hike and obra dinn were incredible artwise but i dont think they appeal to everyone.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i had to pause and take a minute to regain emotional stability after the dreaded fall at the beginning of the game.. still upsets me just thinking about it. losing your cat is one of the most painful experiences in the world. i am sorry to hear that you had to say goodbye, and i hope that you find peace, comfort, and joy in remembering the love you shared with her. 3"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-29,i love the linearity. whenever i play a nonlinear game i feel like i have to discover everything and do every side mission or i will miss out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you can play it for free. new playstation account plus the ps extra 7 day trial.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is the game only five hours long?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i mean if you just run through the story, sure. it took me like 3.5 hours to go through the first little town. if you just enjoy the world and being there it adds so much but either way 25 seems like a fine price for what i got"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"6 hrs of story gameplay. you can do whatever the heck you want along that way, so i don't see the problem, the point of this game is to simulate the cat life. but if you only play game to finish them then i don't think any of these type of game would worth it for you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i dont get how people have the correlation that length of game  price of game. should shorter movies cost less and longer cost more? dont they both have the same level of effort and craft to a degreedepending?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,thats the price of a meal you eat in 15 minutes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,only 5 hours? wtf?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah im no hater, id like to play this because it seems like a pretty good game. but no way is it 30 usd good, not for 5 hours of gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"reminding me of deliver us the moon very cool concept but over so fast that said, i got about 2.5 hours in and im in love with it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,something something 5 great hours vs 500 shit hours or something like that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah... i usually try to justify these things by comparing them to other stuff. like a cinema ticket is what, like 14 now? and that's a 2 hour or so film. when compared to that it kinda doesn't seem so bad to me. but... i still probably will wait until i can get a preowned copy for less."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i think for the quality of the story, music, design, it's worth it. my partner and i have been playing it together at a languid pace so i think we are definitely going to get more than 5 hours. if we went out for the night for a meal and then the cinema that would easily cost more than 25. i think the game is easily worth the 25. i'm a huge cat fan as well mind you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,id rather pay 25 for quality 5 hours than 60 for crap like fifa or cod
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,pspspspspspspsp
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,have you put the paper bag over your head yet? controls become reversed!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yeah i see alota people complaining about it being overpriced for a 5 hour walking sim. but the allure of the game is the ambiance and being emersed in the beautiful world. if you wanted some complex long gaming experience. prob should just play a different game as thats not the intended experience.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what they call walking sim i call adventure game. find the thing that makes other things do things. but instead of pointing and clicking you're a cat with very satisfying movement in an amazingly rendered world. people are losers
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's maybe not much for you but for people that are working min wage 10.79 euro ish here it is
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yeah i find it absurd the amount of people who focus on price to length ratio. sure thats fine if it was less than an hour long or something but buying lunch or a movie ticket can be around the price of the game and yet no one complains about spending 20 concessions to see thor in imax but oh no this price is stupid. if the game doesnt interest for the price its at now then just wait cause theres plenty of people who think the price is exactly what it should be. theres just something so entitled about complaining about something like this. if you only have a certain amount to spend and you want something thatll last you longer thats understandable but dont get mad at the game.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"there is a chapter select after you finish the game so technically nothing is missable. it will tell you how many memories in each chapter you have out of how many there are so you know how many youre missing. just make sure that when you do this, that you collect a memory and then continue playing until there is a cutscene or save icon, otherwise it might not register if you quit the chapter right away."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the hype is literally that you are a cat. people love cats. what's not to like? but what it actually comes down to is a beautiful game with well thought out gameplay and a clever story. plus you're a cat and can push things off shelves.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,but tech demo sell very well on ps5

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,i was expecting some kinda skyrim levels of free exploration expecting an indie walking simulator to equal a aaa production heavily focused on exploration is not as reasonable as you may believe.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,honestly i expected the game to be much more like a ww2 simulator. there arent any tanks. there arent any air planes. not even so much as a m1 garand. you cant shoot enemies. you cant even storm the beaches of normandy. it's just so simple and empty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i thought this was a copypasta and the skyrim comparison was gonna keep going
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,wow. all these incredibly enthusiastic posts with nothing but rave reviews are suddenly seeming so disingenuous. can't jump in a cat game? what a joke.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i kind of wanted customization too, but to be fair i guess it's based off of an actual cat so they wanted it to look like him lol. still would have been cool to make him look like my cat though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you should have been expecting nothing so whatever you got is good then
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,this is great bait haha i feel bad for anyone that actually believes this. ngl tho you almost had me until you expected a skyrim style rpg.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"its a cat, how many times have you seen a cat randomly jumping arround."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,literally... wtf does pspspspspspspsp mean?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the hype was i get to be cat and nothing else so idk, i got exactly what i wanted"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"rubbish. it looks to me like we're getting exactly what was promised in the trailers. afaik there was no indication about the game's length ahead of launch. now that it's available and reviews are out, folks can decide whether or not they want a longer game and if this is worth the price of entry. but let's not start slinging mud at developers and suggest they're spamming us. we can do better than that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm drunk and thought it was a cute game with a cat, but i love that you think i'm clever enough to get paid for this shit."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sweet can't wait to play then.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,wait what
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"for real though is there any challenge to the game at all? i dont mind if there isnt, it looks like its supposed to be a chill exploration game with some moments of running away"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-31,yeah after about 2 hours in and hitting the sewers i was like... caelid? is this caelid? lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"damn it, i really wanted it to be a more cutesy game or at least nonhorror game. i hate horror. but i absolutely love cats, and this idea of making a videogame entirely based on the actual life of an actual cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"sewers freaked me out a bit, feels like theres more deeper lore with bacteria looking like flesh and having eyes along with some conciousness"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the giant eyes!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, it's not a worm."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love meowing at cameras
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,meowing at the guys tossing paint cans long enough to distract them into dropping them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's not the same thing at all... stray is more directed and of a smaller scope. love it so far.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"they are completely different types of games and it's unfair to compare them. stray has a much, much smaller scope, there is no combat, and it has a bigger focus on puzzles. also, stray isn't an rpg, its a linear adventure game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,can't compare the two to be honest. i'd compare stray to like.... shadow of the colossus. linear on rails sort of experience. literally nothing to compare when against cyberpunk. that or like the quarry or until dawn and such. it's more an interactive movie than it is a game if that makes sense. my gf is absolutely loving it and i love to watch her enjoy that. me myself? i'd rather play elden ring or returnal.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"well, only one game let's you shred the carpet, knock shit out the shelves, mlem and has a dedicated meow button."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. is this the case? like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump. i was expecting a freeroaming platformer where you have a little more freedom."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my dog keeps standing on the ottoman right in the middle of the screen to watch me play the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"lol you too? been watching my girlfriend play it, and so has one of our cats. sits right under the tv staring straight up at it. it's hilarious"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i doubt they read reddit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"ha, i had to stop playing because the cat noises were upsetting my cat and putting him into alert mode, theyre that realistic! plus the reaction of the cat when it gets the thing shows this game was made 100 by cat owners"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat almost knocked my tv over swatting at it with her paw

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,reddit loves cats and indie games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"fun linear adventure game, where you play as a regular ol cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we've been waiting for this game for something like 6 years now from the first sneak peek. and it just came out today.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's called marketing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,effective viral marketing and it had a successful teaser post get popular on this subreddit a month or two ago.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"was watching a friend play it on twitch, i think they spent 4 hours just pushing objects off of ledges and giggling about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,30 for a 4 hour game really detracts from my desire to purchase it. guess i'll wait until it goes on sale.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"haven't played it but watched a review and 2 things cooled my enthusiasm for it 1. there is no actual jump button. if you position the cat in a direction it can jump, it will say press x or whatever and the game completes the jump for you. this would take away from the fluidity of the immersion for me. 2. the reviewer said he beat the game in 5 hours. that's like indie game short. for something that's been this hyped up i would have expected at least 8 hours of gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"overhyped for a 30 game? that seems harsh. had i paid 69.99 for it, it'd be upset. for what it is on initial play through, and going back for trophies.. 7 hours on my first play through, got about 45 of the trophies blind. talked to damn near every character in the game. 30 sits just fine for me. it's a pretty, indie, cat game, with some weird scifi elements... no complaints."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"not that this game isn't good, but you might want to temper your expectations. really just an idea for life in general..."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,holy shit i haven't played flower in like a decade. i loved that game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,journey is one of my favourite games ever. the ending feels like what i imagine dying and going to heaven is like. i've played it multiple times just to experience that ending again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,abzu as well. flow is a neat one too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,journey is soooooooooooo good. played that for the very first time ever while on some mushrooms and it was so beautiful
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,abzu is very good
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"like the other person said, sable is freaking gorgeous. it's got decently fun yet simple gameplay to it as well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sable is amazing. a bit buggy but so beautiful
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,im playing sable on the side right now. such a chill game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sable is beautiful. i just wish the call bike function actually worked. the japanese breakfast soundtrack makes up for it though.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,possibly the most underrated game of all time. i spent so much time unlocking all those damn animals.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,i think we will with the little tease at the end
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-31,"it was a mass success for bluetwelve studios. i'm really hoping for a sequel, seems likely with the semiopen ending and the positive feedback. i'd love a sequel!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,got it on sale last year and it was great. i'm assuming you've played limbo as well?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,thanks. inside has a trial and is currently 75 off.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"inside was great. made by the same people who made limbo i believe, which is also really good."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that game was cool. little easy and short but really cool atmosphere. gameplay reminds me quite a bit of some older but more challenging games like prince or persia, another world, and flashback. blackthorn is another rad old game thats similar, but with a shotgun!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i have a feeling you don't know limbo. if you don't, you'll love it. i've played inside once. i've played limbo about 6 times already and i don't replay games. like at all. it's from the same studio, their previous game, absolute masterpiece."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yep. i mean, folks can enjoy whatever they like and i don't mind if people prefer longer games. that's totally cool. but the crowd who totally dismiss shorter games and accuse devs of being lazy or whatever... they're missing the point by a country mile. games like inside are examples of shorter, beautifullycrafted experiences. i'm not suggesting that folks have to like them  to each their own  but it's the dismissal and naysaying that annoys me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,inside is awesome
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so you ever heard of this game called little nightmares
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yep, thats me with red dead. the grind of a massive map, doing tiny little tasks. i enjoy the idea of it, but then i actually get into it and aaaa"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you don't lock yourself up in a bunch of side quests you can beat cyberpunk in around 20 hours
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,zelda botw
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,uh 120?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah, i mean, that's literally the point right? folks will have different tastes and will have different requirements for games. it's fair enough if you aren't prepared to spend 25 for 46 hours of gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"tbh though 25 really is not that much money. a book is around 10 and can be read in the same amount of time. a video game is that  graphics  music  sound design and strays graphics are good enough to rival bigger, more expensive nonindie games. 25 is pretty average for it in that case, big studios can just afford to underprice their stuff and still make money"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah, it's pretty easy you can do it in around one and a half hours so there is a lot of time to spare"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"around 5 first time and 1,5 while doing it for the second time for trophy"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i actually like motion blur. i know that sacrilegious to say but i don't care. i understand that it can be implemented to hide frame drops but i still like it. i don't think that it's bad just because it has a purpose other than it's surface value. i'll keep it on, even when my 3080 is pushing solid 120 frames."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i get major, major motion sickness even riding in the passenger side of a car in the front when someone else is driving makes me feel sick anymore, a common issue for people with migraines, and i felt fine after turning off motion blur and capping the fps"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,unfortunately the game doesn't have the field of view option. hopefully if they get enough feedback it might be possible for them to implement stuff like this in future.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i haven't finished the game yet as i can only play for a few minutes before the sickness kicks in and needed a break for a few days of not feeling sick, haha. hopefully i'll manage though. thanks for the information!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love that spot too. so cozy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yeah the fall had me go oh no nononono no. the murrs of panic and pain had me teary eyed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i explored a fair amount, and i got about 6 hours of game play. which isn't a bad thing. i think if the game were longer it might have felt a tiny bit dragged out. i think it's really worth the price. the movement, music, and world building were all great. it's been a long time since i've played a game that's just it's own thing. nothing complicated, no in depth mechanics. the game is what it says it is and honestly it was an incredibly refreshing experience. perfect game for a nongamer too, if you're trying to get one of your loved ones into the hobby. that said, i absolutely love cats so my bias may be speaking a bit here."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"depends on how much you explore and how much of the backstorycollectables you are hunting. there is an achievement for finishing it in under two hours, but i'm looking at an easy 810."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i finished the game in a single playthrough, being curious and talking to everyone, rubbing against legs and everything. 7 hours of gameplay beginning to end. netting about 45 of the trophies blind."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my son just finished it today, it's not that long"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've played 8 and i'm at 40 something percent, so not necessarily. i've also missed some of the collectibles. if you are only doing the story and not looking around at all, then maybe, but even the first level is large and complex enough imo that it'd probably be difficult unless you've played it and are going for the achievement. i bought it before it came out and i really don't regret the price."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm currently at 6 hours, trying to get all of the achievements, and i've only reached the midtoend portion of the game. however, i did spend around an hour of my time just exploring, appreciating, and casually messing around as an adorable kitty.. it's definitely something i never realized i wanted to so badly in a video game! xd"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"movies typically have a much shorter range of runtimes. and much shorter run times overall. 75 minutes minimum to what, 150, 180 max. the significant value metric isnt quantity here. but games can go from 2 hours to 100 in some cases. this spread is enough that most people would pay significantly more for a long game with the same quality as a short one. time spent becomes a significant metric, because quality being equal, i'm getting much more value out of a longer game. with such a long spread in playtimes, significantly more development effort is also spent on longer games than shorter ones. that's not to say time is the only metric, of course."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yup. even still if you get enjoyment out of it you're paying 5.00hr to have fun.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"as someone who games 40 hours a week, i can't afford to be dropping 30 on something i can knock out in a few hours. bigger and longer doesn't necessarily mean better, but i have played plenty of excellent games including some masterpieces that i was able to sink 100 hours into at a cheaper price than this game. if it ever drops to 10 i'll give it a whirl."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,25 can feed you for a week in some places
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a game about being a cat, not sure what you expected lol. this isn't going to be some mass effect level of story."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what exactly did you expect?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,wtf to what? its a small indie game. did you expect skyrim with a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you can blast through the game skipping story and all the meat of it rather quickly. hell there is an achievement for beating the game in under 2 hours. but, if you're just playing to play, and curious like i did... expect about 7 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you want to buy the game just grab the playstation version of gamepass. half the price 40 vs 21 here in canada and you can play it and all kinds of other shit. literally why it was a day one service game was to motivate people towards this. just cancel before your month is up. don't allow auto renew.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,at least with fifa or cod there is a large element of replayability. as it is i cleared stray in 4hrs and 27mins and will never go back to it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,totally. cats are way better
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"thats not the problem of the game developer. thats the problem of the customer. the game is half a game according to the playtime argument, and its half the price of a standard ps5 game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-31,thank you so much!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,no you're a towel.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"lol, yeah, i couldn't even finish death stranding. i kept waiting for it to be fun, couple hours in i gave up."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"death stranding broke me too lmao. i stopped playing a little over halfway through. great graphics and music. cool backstory. but just got tried of making sam walk, esp when i was carrying heavy things for transport. ugh"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"as a prior cat owner, no you wouldn't. oh you meant in game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that and i wish i could control the jump instead of jumping where it tells me

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,thank you. but why do people make that noise to cats? i tried making that noise out loud and cringed at myself.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,they always respond to german.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,imagine paying 30 for a 4 hour walking simulator.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lmao people are allowed to dislike something you like jesus. just because it's indie doesn't mean people can't dislike it because it wasn't what they were looking for.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i heard there's a grumman f6f hellcat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,honestly i expected the game to be much more like a star wars simulator. there arent any atats. there arent any tie fighters. not even so much as an eweb. you cant set blasters to stun. you cant even have the high ground. it's just so simple and empty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's about a cat not a gat, i can see the confusion though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"the jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. it's not a 3d mario platformer, or a survival cat rpg, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,that's exactly what stopped me from buying it. i was ready to buy it on launch but i watched a review last night where the guy was trying to be enthusiastic but still mentioned the prompt based jumping and i was immediately turned off.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,right? the viral marketing tactics for this game are insane. it doesn't even look interesting.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"the jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. it's not a 3d mario platformer, or a survival cat rpg, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you are jumping all the time, but you can only jump if you have somewhere to jump to. cats don't just randomly bounce up and down unless maybe playing with a ball. they walk or jog along, and the lithely jump to a specific ledge, or down, or whatever. you can jump loads, and really are jumping all the time, it is just a jump with deliberation."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it sounds like people got their expectations way too high thinking this was supposed to be some big cat rpg when it's literally never been advertised as such so i'm not sure where all this confusion is coming from. it reminds me of people getting angry about lightyear because tim allen wasn't in it and they couldn't understand or fathom the possibility that a product could be different than how fans would imagine things to be due to hype or expectations that grow to a fever pitch so we end up disappointing ourselves all on our own generally speaking
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"well, with how reddit and other platforms have hyped it up, i'm not surprised he thought that. the hype for this game is unreal, this studio produces indie, linear gems like what remains of edith finch, and this detail is lost when people describe and hype this game as the next huge thing, the game isn't trying to advertise itself as something so grand, it's own fanbase is doing that sadly."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,have you played it? how is what he said wrong? cause im playing it right now and its pretty boring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,who says we're expecting a skyrim style rpg? the point is it lacks basic features. you'd think you can free roam and jump around whereever in a game like this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,httpsknowyourmeme.commemespspspsps pspspsps is an onomatopoeia used to recreate the sound some make to get the attention of a cat. it has been used in a series of jokes about futile attempts to attract a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's an onomatopoeia that you say to attract a cat. perchance.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's the noise people make to get a cat's attention. httpsknowyourmeme.commemespspspsps
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,same. i was so freaking excited the moment it started and i could start playing with the other cats. this game could have had no real story to it and i'd still return to play in from time to time just for the pure joy of getting to be a cat and explore lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the developers confirmed over a month ago the game would be eight hours in length. i'm going at a moderate pace, and it looks like the game will take me six hours to complete, so the game is about the length they said it would be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,gamers are seriously some of the most miserable fucks on the planet lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"sure, you're drunk"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,truth hurts i know and cod sucks nowadays but i mean if sony fans were more honest about these games the truth wouldnt hurt so bad lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hardly an edge lord reaction, the game does nothing unique and is a walking simulator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what!!!!!!! thank you!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"greatness is subjective, if they enjoyed the game a lot then they enjoyed it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,google subjective opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yea that was my thought process going interesting it. would love to support the studio in whatever way possible. appreciate the input!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-17,"i beat it, but ty for inquiring"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it feels a bit like half life at times
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,theres some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. you mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i wouldnt say its a horror game, but the game does take place in a post apocalyptic world where humans are extinct, and the enemies are cute little bug things but the idea behind them is kinda scary lol. basically its a sweet exploration game set in a depressing world i guess if you want a pure cute cat sim maybe look at little kitty big city, its more stylized but still looks pretty nice!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,me is this resident evil?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-29,it's amazing how off guard it catches you. i remember getting low key jump scared when i noticed them.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. is this the case? like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump. i was expecting a freeroaming platformer where you have a little more freedom."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love meowing at cameras
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"theyre not the same but in terms of the overall worldbuilding, lore, design etc. stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes, this is a real thing didn't realise wholesome cat game was also !a psychological horror!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. i hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i had to take a break because i kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,shit chasing me in games always gets me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,otherwise its only 30 bucks. i have the premium ps plus and i'm still going to buy it. i like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i think its the higher 2 tiers
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's on the extra tier. but, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and stray is only 30."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,none is you pay 30 euros
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. if i want a game i'll pay for it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes, it is. the animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. you can meow as much as you want if that helps."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"pro tip after you have played for 3045 min or so and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around, you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. this makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump  knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. it works really well like this imo because the jump points are with a few exceptions very intuitive. so much so that i wish the devs had put in a popup early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah. it's kind of annoying. there are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is true. you also can't jump any time either. idk why but for games that bothers me. i just want to assassins creed every possible surface! lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the story is very linear. the puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. the majority of the gameplay feels like a pointandclick adventure in 3d. small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of a plague tale. i was hoping for a game where i could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"doing saying yes is wrong and not understanding your question. cutscenes are scripted jumping is not. there are obvious edgesair conditionerfencewhatever that have the ability to jump to. you're not scripted with where you have to jump from or land, if you're close enough and it's within reach the game lets you jump wherever just like assassin's creed. not a fixed point, just certain claimable things vs unclimbable. game went beyond my expectations i'm only 2 hours in though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it locks to a platform based off where you are pointing, you can choose where to jump onoffacross."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"its not as strictly. you obviously have parts where you can jump, but you can jump to any part of that ledge. so its not worse than an assassins creed"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. in terms of difficultychallenge, it isn't a difficult game. and the puzzles aren't 'hard'. if you're looking for a challenge in this game, i do not think it's your type of game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it feels like i'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,skillup has a good review on it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a video game, with a cat and ray tracing! edit i thought i saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe i'm misremembering."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is a pretty smart fucking cat. nothing regular about him.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"not really. it's literally good looking game about cat. that was it. thats the extent of the marketing. that was enough for everyone else to market it for them. for what it is it's great, would i pay 40 for it? nah. but it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do i care. good game. could it be more? sure. so can everything."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,dude it was in the original ps5 games announcement
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"this game was originally shown on reddit like, 5 years ago. one of those i'm making my first game and here's the first clip deals. it was pretty organic afaik. this game has been looked forward to by a lot of people for a long time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"this is why i haven't finished the game yet. i've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. i will have to go back to one chapter cuse i went to the next area, not realizing i was"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's like indie game short. ...its an indie game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,point 1 makes it a no buy for me. i haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. my little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. you think he is too young?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"think you need to scratch all points in all levels for an achievement. i didn't get one, but i also didn't really hunt them down."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i wish i could just enjoy flower but i'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. i know it's 100 my fault. the setting is beautiful.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. youre going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. people come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. unbelievable game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs. legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. absolutely incredible game. 1010. 2010 on acid.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy stray would also like little nightmares. both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange  unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesnt require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's coming to game pass as well.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yooo, blackthorn was one of the first games i played on my garage sale homemade pc back in the late 90s. a blizzard classic."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"so i had the misfortune of playing limbo after i played inside. it's hard for me to want to go back to limbo knowing i could replay inside instead. something about inside resonated more with me than limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. i also have to admit i think inside is the better game. visually, gameplay, and sound design just hits more. seems like the studio took what they learned from limbo and applied it to inside."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,agreed. why dismiss these shorter games? what have you got to lose? i'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shootlootshootloop on repeat. but you're right everyone has the right to their own preferences.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm in australia also was the deluxe version brought brand new atm at full price it's sitting at 124.95c
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,nah...stray is too short to rival games from the big studios
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"wow, wasnt expecting it to be that short. stray has been my most anticipated goty so its a bit disappointing to hear that its not longer but im sure its jam packed with great content! would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like its dragging on."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is a bot

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so are there a lot of vertical climbing surfaces? or is it just curtains? never played it but my cats insist curtains are made for just that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,bapbapping intensifies
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,nope. game is having huge marketing and false reviews. everyone needs to really check the negative reviews before buying. there are many valid points. cant believe i spent 30 dollars on this. its 4 hours of walking down one path and pressing x when prompted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,the motto for dramamine
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,did people downvote this comment for some reason or does reddit just like hiding comments for having just a small amount of upvotes?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,make sure to knock things off of shelves and tables too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,removing all my posts and comments due to reddit's fuckery with third party apps. june 2023
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,not sure why this is so downvoted. i can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. and tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,totalbiscuit's spirit lives on. there is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i agree with you. fov slider should be in every game by default. i was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. i will upvote you if it helps.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"i have never understood fov bros like you. sure its nice to have in some games, but its literally never been a deal breaker for me. but i'm obviously missing something because ya'll cant possibly be that petty."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,imagine... not wanting to be sick is an unpopular statement. i'm with you
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"that's too bad. it gets overlooked a lot, but motion sickness needs much more attention. i got resident evil village on ps5  had to quit because of motion sickness  i called konami  they said 'no fov slider coming  no refund'. played my friend's pc copy of re8 for free so f konami."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. it wouldnt even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. just more of what its already doing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"ah, so it's the length of 1 run through a dwemer ruins."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"its actually funny, theres quite a bit of interesting story being presented and i was just running after a ball, pawing at it while they were talking about it. its very much a cat simulator lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,why is everyone being so pissy? 5 hours is very short for a game of this quality and it wouldnt be unreasonable to aim for 810 hours. 56 is pretty short.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah for sure. no chance a studio could make it more than 5 hours and still be fun. literally a gaming impossibility. just straight up not possible to make a game about a cat more than 5 hours. edit just wanted to reiterate it would be absolutely impossible for a studio to make a game about a cat any longer than 5 hours. maybe in a few years but unfortunately we just don't have the technology or the creativity to get there currently. edit 2 guys, guys, i get it. it's impossible to make a fun game about a cat longer than 5 hours. what did you all expect, it's a game about a cat...?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah, but what's the end game crafting system like?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you people pretending like it's crazy to expect a game to be longer than 5 hours in 2022 are absolutely nuts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes. every game that is longer than 5 hours must be equivalent to skyrim. obviously.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,if i would open cod i wouldnt last 10 mins in that for 60 bucks. sorry im not into these games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"feel your pain. i did the same, but for rdr2."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,because they respond?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"because cats are generally aloof and respond well to the sound, so people use it to get their attention."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,requires a cat to be involved. if you make the noise with no cat in the vicinity then of course you would cringe at yourself
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,for real like what the fuck
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you're right people paid 60 for death stranding to deliver amazon packages.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've paid close to that for one meal, and more than half of that to see a movie. i'm not interested in this specific walking simulator, but i'm also not opposed to the idea in principle."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is what happens when you are raised on mobile and free to play games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,four hours in and no regrets. i've spent more on visual novels. different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. it's also not purely a walking sim. there's puzzles etc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. get a better job
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. so 30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since i haven't played the game i don't like or dislike it myself. what i tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. it's like buying bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival ubisoft openworlds."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ok i will keep looking for sure
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,honestly i expected the game to be much more like a tenchu 3 wrath of heaven remake. there arent any katanas. there arent any grappling hooks. not even so much as some rice. you cant kill for lord gohda. you cant even be a ninja. it's just so simple and empty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes. when my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, i noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up. 100 realism confirmed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"so wait, you can jump? cause the person i replied said there's no jumping at all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"this is sounding like a morbius situation, but i think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. is this game actually considered good or not?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lol true. im super happy with the game tbh. i played for hours yesterday and didnt feel bored ever once.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the op of the thread you're talking in said that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you cant just say perchance.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ahhh thank you!!! i've recently gotten into modding my ps vita and so i've become aware of the emulator named ppsspp. i was very much confused.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"1 so many bitter entitled fucks. same ones sending death threats to developers for not making the fortnite skin they wanted. not your cup of tea? move on, nobody cares."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,for real. unable to enjoy or appreciate anything.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"i played it for 4 hours. yes its not perfect game and not much to do but this is only first step into new era i hope you play as a cat in a nice back alley world and explore streets and help some robots but you cant forget your main goal to get home. yes it lacks more movement control, cutscenes, better side quests, longer and more emotional story, harder puzzles and little more action. but we must not forget that this is an indie game where funds were limited. i would love game like this with aaa budget. and high price is because its small studio. its like local farmers are more expensive than store."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,isn't the premise that you are a cat lost from the family so essentially you see the world as a lost house cat would? cats get scared and frightened easily.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,my gf really wants to get it but really doesnt want to see a cat die graphically. is it like that or a bit more gentle?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,and you're also supporting the studio behind a game you've enjoyed. bless you. i'll be doing the same.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,can i bark?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if they made it so you had to do the jumps yourself quite a few parts would turn into a jump king cat dlc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hmmm, yeah. i think i'll pass. i was hoping it would be more like feline witcher3, but its more like feline tomb raider i guess."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i don't know man, i'm almost done with it and there were a few times where i got really frustrated that i couldn't jump on thing that i should've been able to. particularly behind the night club. plenty of stuff i should be able to jump on get up there but only one path the game let's you take."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,when i noticed i clicked on publisher and noticed i own about 50 of anything they ever published. all of those games are very focused. not sure if i would call that style simple. stray is incredibly focused. you play as a cat and they went to 100 cat movement for that. and that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"neon white is also annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so i disagree with the premise here."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. considering their resources, i think its beyond my own expectations. the puzzles are pretty simple, but i kind of like it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah same, i was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. would love to see that kind of thing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sounds more like the player needs work.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,are the puzzles easier than untitled goose game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"eh, exploration isn't really rewarded much in this game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i had a similar thought, mine being i like this even more because there are some more open areas to explore around in and do some optional quest challenge things i love it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm like 4 hours in and i haven't found a puzzle that was actually interesting yet. they all have been incredibly simple and took no effort to solve, which isn't really rewarding."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and i gave them the answer.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's neat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the first i heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. that explains things a bit!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you can turn the jump prompts off. it's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if you play with them aka on the couch with them, on your phone while they play it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child. other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests. letting them play there would be fine."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. i think it's pretty family friendly, though. if you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. the cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. it's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,cant you adjust the sensitivity on that? or have you and it still frustrates you?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hey i was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 mhz cpu.  i have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. still fun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"interesting, i would argue the opposite d. inside is a larger project, but i've loved the journey in limbo. it's a journey through life and while i wouldn't form that idea on my own, i've surely felt it while playing the boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo the world between life and death. the soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. the boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. in the ending scene, she is covering his grave. also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth. anyways, the point is, i love limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. i was surprised that i didn't have that feeling with inside."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's insane
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"lmao what does length have to do with graphics? its also closer to 810 hours than 46 2530 is a pretty good price. people are just used to video games being underpriced as hell bc they were never raised to match inflation. like do gamers not know how much effort goes into making these things? its weird that you can get a super gorgeous art form with top tier music, sound design, custom 3d modeling, professional voice acting, etc for 60"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,low fov gives me motion sickness. i almost puked when i first played half life 2 back then
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the fact that it doesn't annoy you is not enough for you to generalize and say it's something not important and people shouldn't care about it. many people like me hate low fov because 1 it feel wrong in a way that my brain doesn't like at all which provoke 2 motion sickness, nausea and so on, which of course 3 damage any sense of immersion and part of the pleasure playing the game. it cost nothing for a dev to add a fov slider, yes it may have impact on some realtime cinematics but it's a price most people who ask for the feature are completely fine with. so basically the only reason why dev doesn't add fov slider is mostly because of pure lazyness and lack of respect for theirs customers. that and many others settings should be standard in any game, even indie games, and gamers should complain until it happen."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"it's about being able to play the game at all. if the fov is off i'm hugging a bucket 20 minutes in. it's not pettiness, it's accessibility. it sucks but that's why."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's not about being petty some people start to get sick if the fov isn't right. it's not all that different from colorblind options, motion blur, or other accessibility options."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,assuming people are petty because they have preferences and standards? sounds quite petty to me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i dont understand something so it affecting someone else differently than me makes them petty. thats what you sound like.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's an accessibility feature. some people get nausiated i just get bad headaches. we're not asking because we like fish eye vision. low fov is really uncomfortable.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,its infinitely more fun though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,then don't buy it...?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"creativity i can get but why do you mention technology? you can definitely, easily, make a game about a cat more than 5 hours. hollow knight is about a beetle basically. why does species matter? edit i see you, you cheeky bastard that downvoted this. lmao. actually made me laugh. hmu downvotes. would love to hear your oponions."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm not sure that it's crazy, but it does feel unwarranted at times. not all games are going to be long experiences. some will be shorter. and that's cool. you don't have to buy it. buy  and play  what you enjoy and what you feel will give you the value you're looking for."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,your comment doesnt make sense even as a joke its poorly thought out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"me neither, but at it stands i have paid over a fiver for each hour of gameplay which is frankly too much"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,look at mister money bags over here
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i can't get a better job. can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-05,i just upgraded the rest of my ps subscription for 15. so i can play stray and whatever else on the list that i want to for the next 5 months
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my understanding is that jumping is a context button. in other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. i didn't buy the game but i agree with them it looks very limiting. sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but i personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a canned animation. you push the button and it just does it for you. you don't aim it, you can't miss time it. that's probably what he means. it has jumping in the same way that one cod game had respect paying. you push the button and the game plays itself. not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"technically yes, it's a big part of the game. it's odd but i think it fits very well with what the game is. i don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm throughly enjoying it and some of the you can't jump comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour. it's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain. you find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. there's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. you can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot, break items etc. you have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city i'm four hours in and i'm throughly enjoying it so far cause i'm also looking for everything without a walkthrough. so, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. if not then no. but it's definitely a good game imho"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. but from what i've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,they are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's awesome that you modded your vita. i have a modded psp 3000. it still has great games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,so if its short and missing a whole lot to make it a full game paying a higher price is just dumb but the gaming for you people see cat and nothing else matters like i said overhyped
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i enjoyed this game a lot, i thought it was great!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"so now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that's not what's going on in the game. it's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"it's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. there's no blood or anything. i'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. it's entertaining. i'm a couple hours in.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i can see that for sure. i added a caveat to the last paragraph. my main point wasnt about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves dont really make the game any bettereasier and can probably be turned off."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i haven't played untitled goose game, but the puzzles in stray are quite straight forward. if in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. in a bigger space, there are quite some obvious hints."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes. i played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes they are
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes. by a fair margin, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . i really like it but i honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i know. i just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,why are you being a tool for no reason? genuinely curious...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"thanks for the info, i appreciate it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i loved blackthorn too!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,our dollar is worth a fair bit less atm. but most games are around 80110
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"what does graphics have to do with price? i would pay 60 for terraria, because it has so much good content and you can play that game for hundreds of hours. you know how much terraria costs? 10 bucks. i would not pay 25 for stray."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,jumping being prompt only was never talked about anywhere.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i saw it okay among all the comments in the thread baconreader on mobile
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"ugh, the first time i saw hl2 was at my friend's. i was just watching over his shoulder and i had to tap out because of nausea and headache. looked cool though but i never touched it because of this experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,"i'm exactly the same. can't play any first person games, most third person can be a challenge too if the camera isn't right. over the shoulder view? forget it. camera too close? forget it. unnecessary zooming in when using abilities? i get sick too. the list goes on and on. thankfully a lot of the time there will be some mod, or a cheatengine table to 'fix' the issue, but those are rarely optimal and tend to break."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-19,assuming people are petty because they have preferences and standards? sounds quite petty to me i think the entitlement is the problem its ridiculous not to have an fov slider in 2022.  i don't think that's accurate.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm not?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i was being sarcastic because the guy who made that comment is a moron.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"all these arguments for longer games also dont take into account the level of graphical fidelity, sound design, polish, etc. on a technical level its very impressive what stray has accomplished. especially for an indie. i dont hear anyone complaining about the length of the portal games. if you guys want bang for your buck, play jrpgs and nothing else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i just can't think of any other popular gaming release that failed to provide more than 5 hours of content. especially at a 30 price tag.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"nah bro, it's either a 5 hour game or a skyrim type game. no room for in between right?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,yeah i get it that its not really a cheap game and i wish it was longer but well heck with it. im not going to die over 10 euro
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it feels like the zipline and ledge grabbing in the arkham games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"whenever you find yourself asking hey, it looks like i should be able to jump there, can i jump there?, the vast majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. jumping is a fundamental part of the game. i often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. so it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,what there is not to like? i would love a game where you are exploring cities like this and having a story. its cute. i love singleplayer story games and i play only these games and im happy for each one like this to release. is damn factorio worth 30 bucks? it looks like damn 2000 game and there are still fans defending it its a perfect game. yes it is maybe in its genre.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"shes also a huge cat lover, thats why she was concerned haha. good to know she can get into it now!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i did find a receipt for a joke toilet
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah i got you, i just feel like i needed those jump markers at a couple spots. either way, getting confused about where i could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. most of the time it was intuitive. i had the day off and got it for free with ps and it's been really fun. i would've been totally fine paying for the game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yea its really boring, i returned it. matter of opinion. i found myself just looking for where you get jump key prompts and not at atmosphere. blinders on. individual limitation. the animations are rigid also. opinion then stopped for dinner, there was no save function, signed off, signed back in, inventory wipe, progress wiped, had no clue where in the first city i had gone and not. said fuck it. lack of commitment game needs work. does it?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,marketing 101 include a cat profit.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"do you think time put into labor doesnt affect price or something? better graphics  more time, money, and labor put into the art and design of the game. a 2d pixel game thus should obviously be cheaper than a game with 3d modeling and realistic textures."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,right on
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so you came into a thread about a game you haven't played and don't intend to play just to complain that it's too short? wild.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"irony at its finest. whether you agree with my original comment or not, you're the one that escalated with an extremely sarcastic and passive aggressive reply. your attitude stinks and you need to take a chill pill lol. go touch some grass, you might feel better."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,fair point. missed the sarcasm first run. too caught up in people's shitty takes. you're right there's a lot of criticism to be leveled. i myself am in the i don't fucking care category. games just fun for a lot of people. i love watching the gf geek out about it. in the end that's all that matters.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i can think of a few over the years, mostly indie games. i mean, as i said, i think folks are getting their knickers in a twist over nothing. some gamers will be happy with a shorter experience, others will want more. that's totally fine."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,you can like a game dude thats cool and fine but ive played all consoles and pc for a while and without a doubt sony fans hype everything too much at least factorio has more hours on content and a system in place to learn and grow in this game you walk like a cat for a few hours its a funny idea but everyone is already overhyping a game that shouldnt be a hand full of hours for the price same with aaa stop trying to charge me 70 for the same games its dumb and we arent getting a whole lot for the money

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,youre being intentionally obtuse. thats neat was a lame comment
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"your comment about viral marketing isn't the comment i responded to, so i'm having a hard time figuring out why you think it's relevant..."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"again, nobody knew that you cant jump without a prompt. i feel you dont understand this point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i came into a gaming subreddit to read and talk about gaming? is this not the place for that? wild. edit to respond to the coward briarthorn who responded and then blocked me lmfao your analogy is close but unfair. liking baseball and then going into the hockey subreddit just to shit on hockey is different than liking baseball but with the desire to learn about other sports and going to the sports subreddit and commenting on a post about hockey. this is the gaming subreddit and stray has been getting a lot of buzz the last few weeks and i'm always looking for new fun games to play so i pop into the threads to see what people are saying about the game. when i saw someone say it was only 5 hours long, i found that very surprising and disappointing. so you're saying i can't comment in any thread about a specific game in the gaming subreddit if i don't buy that game? weird take man."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"pivoting at its finest. you tried to respond to my response saying i didn't understand your sarcasm, not realizing that if you were actually being sarcastic it would mean you're agreeing with me lmfao. and then saying i escalated with more sarcasm when you were the first one to add any sarcasm to the convo and my sarcasm was just a response to your supposed sarcasm. amazing lol you're not very good at this my friend"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"agreed. i was just surprised to hear it's only 5 hours long after seeing it advertised everywhere the last few weeks and all the hype and anticipation behind it, 5 hours is such a short burn. the mere notion of simply being surprised by that drove a bunch of dorks here into a frenzy"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,haven't heard of any of those. not nearly as popular or anticipated as stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you weren't being sarcastic though lmfao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"like you are getting your moneys worth when you buy that icecream for 23 euro? its not all about how good it is or how long does it last. its the new experience. and about sony fanboys. sony is almost only idk platform or what to release great singleplayer games. i got myself ps4 just to play exclusive games and as i have stated i only play singleplayers. we have kingdom hearts, last guardian, bloodborne, uncharted series, horizon zero dawn and west, god of war, persona games and probably some others im forgetting. thats why i like them. i dont care about sport games or simulator ones. i want to experience stuff not grind the money for new car or player. im not interested into multi player."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,call me right now please!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,intentionally obtuse is a bit of a reach there big guy. what else am i supposed to say when somebody throws me a curveball comment? that's interesting i didn't know that.? isn't that's neat saying the same thing in fewer words? perhaps nothing would have been a better choice? is nothing better than a two word reply? what's the deal?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"then i don't get why you're trying to call me out for saying something's neat. are you still genuinely curious about anything? i'm cooking dinner right now, curious what it is?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"im pretty sure this is the other way around  regardless this is an utterly pointless debate as i dont judge games price based solely on the amount of time i can play it for, you do, and we will never agree so  agree to disagree, carry on living your best life my guy. godspeed"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"httpsgamerant.comstrayannapurnainteractiveplatformingelementsbuttoninputsmissedpotential written july 1 this means that instead of players having a button that lets them leap around whenever and however they would like, the cat can only leap to predetermined points at the behest of a prompt. yes people were aware."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"gaming is a pretty wide hobby my dude. i like baseball but it would be weird to walk into a hockey game, which is technically still a sport but one i have no personal knowledge of and can't contribute anything meaningful in a discussion about, and start arguing with actual hockey fans about why their sport is bad. seems to me like you're just looking to argue with people on the internet and found a comment chain you could latch on to and coop some of that secondhand indignation about the length of a game you don't even care about. which is fine, you can be a little contrarian gremlin and get it out of your system. but yeah, it's wild someone chooses that life."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yikes. if you perceived my original statement as sarcasm, it goes to show how unhinged you are lol. discussing this any further with you would be the equivalent of trying to argue back with a karen. have a lovely day."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lmao yes i very much was
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,you know you are proving my point listing off single player games like they only exist on that console lol! and you know you are losing the point when you compare this overhyped game to ice cream at least people dont call the ice cream the best of all time and the best ice cream of the year lol!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,actually those two comments come off completely differently. youre example wouldve sounded fine.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"glad you did all that analysis on your own. no, saying that's neat is not the same thing in fewer words. it's gives a far different, ruder tone. and yes, saying nothing is always an option too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a good looking game about a cat that was shown off during the ps5 showcase. viral marketing is not the driver here, simply just the internets proclivity to lose their minds regarding anything involving cats andshowcasing next gen systems. there was no viral campaign it was just people on the internet loving cats like they always do. simple."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"because it was clearly snarky. it was a sarcastic, dismissive neat, and you know it. at least have the backbone to be consistent instead of backpedaling when you get called out. not a good look, just fyi."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if only i read that before. thanks for making me feel worse.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"nah bro i know you were serious. you genuinely believe that just because the game is about a cat, it's impossible to make it any longer than 5 hours, since only games with mass effect type stories can have more than 5 hours of content. heard ya loud and clear mate!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,oh so you agree with me then that 5 hours is short af? dope!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,you clearly dont understand what i mean with ice cream reference. people are paying for it because they want it and dont care for its price. same here we wanted a good cat game and we got one finnaly. and about these exclusive games yes they started to port them to pc but who wants to wait 5 years to get to play a game and get mostly crappy port.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"when i first learned about this game, i thought it was a joke. when i realized it wasn't, i thought it would be stupid. now that i'm seeing gameplay of it, i totally want to play it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is this like on lowest settings? these graphics are a far cry from the gameplay trailer.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,can someone who's played this game please reassure me that the cat winds up happy at the end?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is this game like 12fps?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i played 30 minutes before work today and its a chill experience from my usual violent games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,dude must be playing on a gtx 650 with those graphics
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"also in stray you have a flashlight because cats appearently can't see in the dark  great game, and a sure 1010 for me, but that little detail is out of place. they should've just adjusted the brightness when you enter a dark area. the cat's eyes even reflect light at certain angles. that's literally the reason why cats can see in the dark. but ah well. a tiny nitpick in an otherwise pretty much purrfect experience."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is everyone playing the game in 30fps or is the game that demanding?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this looks so dumb. how is it breaking the internet?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the game's world is curious to me, like what happened to the humans and why is it just robots? do the robots fear cats or did some virus happen that wiped humans out and not cats.. so much to uncover in this game about the robot world."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"after reading the thread i was this close to refunding. but i played the game for about 1 hour last night and while i find it fun some of the comments in here were spot on. its beautiful, however if it really is only another 23 hours of gameplay, thats not very cool. the game just kinda tells you where to go without shoving it in your face, and while its kinda handholding its a nice game to get stoned to and just chill playing this cat. the idea is really cool but i thought it was more of an exploratory game where you had the freedom, its much more linear than i realized which is ok in some respects. i was like man, that sucks if theres only 2 more hours of gameplay and was going to refund due to this, but then i realized i have a little girl that would love this game in due time. she is only 2.5 years old but i know she will love this game in the future, so i guess im gonna decide to keep it for what it's worth i guess. if i was single and stuff i would refund. 30 for 4 hours or so is meh. only going to keep it so my little girl can try one day."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,end life pc trying to run this game. i played on ps4 and it was much better than this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"looks like a combo of gif compression, reddit compression, and maybe low settings, cause even on a ps4 this game looks absolutely amazing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've been playing this on my ps4 slim, looked fine to me. op must be playing the game on a potato pc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i think its just bad lighting tbh everything is washed out and flat, theres no shadow depth or directional lighting going on i run into this problem in lots of open world games with weather patterns. cloudy day ingame, between buildings, sun is low, all leading to a flat image that looks like a ps3 screenshot"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i'm honestly kind of disappointed with the graphics, and i have them cranked all the way except for motion blur on pc. it truly feels last gen. it's not horrible, and certainly doesn't distract from the game, but there are some visuals hat have been done much better in other games. textures are kinda low res in some instances, even when the level is deisgned to have the camera very close to the environment and things are clipping constantly. edit is anyone seriously trying to argue that the shape of this lamp's light should look like this and that no games have ever done it better? httpsi.imgur.comd2grzhp.jpeg further edit what i'm referencing with the textures is that generally i can sometimes tell pixels apart with random things, which is not that bad in my opinion, but there is at least one texture that is just hilariously pixelated. i can't currently go back to the spot where i saw this, but there is one outsider's house that is basically a library, and there is a spot in the shelf where you can lay down. the pillow right next to that spot has honestly unacceptable textures for an object being brought so close to the camera the camera gets really close when you lay down somewhere. if you want a clipping object, go to momo's house and find the ball that is basically buried in the floor, or just walk in front of some robots and clip their legs. also there is a bucket somewhere in the alleys that got stuck in the floor and started making loud noises. it happened to my friend as well, with the same bucket, so i think clipping is an issue. but to be fair, in comparison to some ea games the clipping is virtually nonexistent. none of that are issues in the sense that i will stop playing the game. but the graphics could be better."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,im playing in a 2011 pc with low settings and its not nearly as bad as this gif
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is how the game looks now that it's released. the previous trailers weren't actual gameplay
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that game is a basic platform style game with linear levels and the occasional openroam areas inbetween so not that unique but you play as a cat and can do cat things. so the whole game is moreorless dedicated to paying the internet cat tax. i'm enjoying it. playing as a nonhumanoid for once is refreshing and enjoyable even if the game genre itself isn't that special.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a really effective grassroots marketing campaign, we've seen it with other games before. this one has a cute cat so of course the internet is going to run with it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,these are paid advertisements.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's astroturfing people are being paid to post about it on reddit and write positive reviews on steam that's all
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i mean, it looked great. cyberpunk setting where you play a cat. good looking graphics, too. on paper it had a lot going for it. i wishlisted it as soon as i saw the steam page, but didn't preorder it, because images don't equal gameplay. there's definitely marketing going on but i can see why people would talk about the game because of its appealing elements. it's off my wishllist now that i've seen the reviews. i wouldn't part with money for it, even on steep discount, because a simplistic onrails, semiwalking simulator is not what i'm looking for."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you like cats and relaxing games then definitely worth it it's a pretty short around 6 hours i believe
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's just that type of game that is mostly about the journey and enjoying the vibes. if you're looking for some advanced gameplay, there is none. still, it's hella fun and relaxing doing cat things."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's good at what it is. some people can't wrap their head around the fact that there's an audience for it, though, and can't get over the fact that it's short and the gameplay is simple  surely that makes a game bad?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i actually really like it. i found it really charming and different from the start. you can tell a lot of passion was put into this game and it really shows with all of the environments and what not. besides there being a cat the visuals are really freaking cool and the cyberpunk aesthetic is not disappointing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i liked the prospect of seeing the world in a different way i.e. as a cat or some animal, but that is all this game has. same dystopian landscape. robots. tiny, narrow streets. every jump in the game is scripted and there is absolutely no reason to be careful. you can't even walk off an edge if you wanted to. shoot, this is a cat simulator game and you cant free jump. that's right, no jumping unless explicitly told by a prompt. i truly wanted to like this game and i was waiting for its release, but this is clearly just a halfassed game trying to ride the internet's obsession with cats. i mean look at all the reviews. within an hour of the game being playable it had thousands of reviews most of which said stuff like i see cat, i play cat or some other nonsense. i highly doubt those reviews are based on the quality of the game itself so much as the novelty of the protagonist if you want to call them that since the story isnt about you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"given the number of posts from people with their cats in front of their tv. i think it's just the crazy cat owners of the world. sure there's some overlap with reddit, but the main correlation is with owning a cat."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i really enjoyed it, don't own a cat or anything, just thought it looked fun and the fiancee wanted to play it. not everything has to be this grand 80 hour narrative experience. it does a really good job of sticking to what it is, an atmospheric game that is just chill and allows you to experience a cool little story. most of the fun comes from just doing fun little cat things, some lite atmospheric puzzle solving, and finding out the sorry of your robotic buddy. if you think of it more like a point and click game or a cinematic platformer aka out of this world than some sort of grand adventure game it feels a lot more in it's element. tldr if you want a shot adventure with lots of character and atmosphere, this is it. don't expect the next elden ring but it's not nothing as some people here want to say."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"it's a relaxing few hours that doesn't require much thought and i only picked it up because it's currently free on playstation plus. i don't think i would have been happy to pay for it after finishing it in just over 5 hours to be honest but for what it is, yeah i enjoyed it. it's got some moments."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,y to be anything it isn't. not every game needs to be 100 hours long open world. why do people care about reddit karma anyway
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"not much to do or show off, so yea they are at the bottom of the barrel now"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i beat this game today and can safely say it's the most boring shit i have ever played.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"its getting ridiculous for a game that has like 5hrs of gameplay. but alas, we wont hear about this game in about 2 weeks time. just gotta wait it out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"not saying it isn't. but why would they choose the most lowquality gif possible, showing off one of the main features people are already talking about?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,how much did it take? i want to buy it but i'm afraid it's gonna take me only 34 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its a little lacking in gameplay but i immensely enjoyed it. the only thing exceptional about it is the music. i would recommend it if you like atmospheric games and cats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,no and no
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's the most boring game i've ever played and i love cats. i tried to play up until the 2 hour mark, but just couldn't. so i got a refund."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you want to pay for a 4hr tech demo then sure. it's way too short and the allure gets old fast.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's free with the new psplus right neow! but yes, from the little bit my son and i played earlier this evening, it is definitely worth dipping your paws into."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes and yes it's a fun relaxing game that's not too long, definitely worth the money"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,untitled goose game was actually fun though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that's a terrible comparison as untitled goose game is great, and so is this game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,guess i don't like cats enough to play this game.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,where is this game available? steam and ps. and how much does it cost too much for what it offers. 30
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,steam and playstation for sure. 30 us. or a ps plus extra subscription.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"costs me 17 for ps extra, which also includes the ondemand catalogue. money absolutely well spent."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"took me a solid 7 hrs, because cat game and doing cat shenanigans. and it's a full game lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,game is fine. just because you speed through a game doesn't mean its 5 hours for everyone.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,no the game is actually stunning for an aa that is on pc with the lowest settings possible probably
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,finds question i was going to ask question is downvoted to hell leaves thread
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,play and find out! its a great game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,... but why not?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's crazy that a nextgen console would look better than the 510 year old computers that most people use?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it is very good at what it is. some people are like that's not long enough to be a real game, that's too simple to be a real game it has some real light puzzle solving but is mostly a walking simulator with the gimmick that you traverse the space in catlike ways. as someone on board with it for what it is i think it's great. 30 for something that size is a bit much but i'll accept it for the quality of polish and animation."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i read on the game's wikipedia page that the environment is inspired by kowloon walled city
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"within the game, no, its not the walled city. the citys nature is important and gradually discovered in the story. but artistically, yes, its inspired by the walled city."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's a fictional futuristic city.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's like 30fps probably, this hurts me physically, emotionally, and spiritually."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no shame in that, not everyone has the best equipment to play with."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"this is most likely what rhe other guy said, lowest shittiy settings at like 15 fps, running on a toaster. i've got a decent pc and my game looks beautiful, it doesn't even look that bad on older consoles like on the ps4 is still looks beautiful, it's just missing the detail and clarity that better hardware can produce, but still looks nice."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"welcome to spoiler culture. even if you avoid the entire internet, you will have things spoiled for you. everybody openly discusses the latest shows, movies, and games constantly and spoils all of it. there hasn't been a single big movie or show or game that hasn't been spoiled for me in the last 5ish years or so. i blame streaming and marvel movies lol. either way, it takes me a long time to get to finally experience things so always having everything spoiled just ruins my interest in bothering with that thing in the first place"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's so close to not being a game at all that i'm hardpressed to describe what it is. it's a cat experience with video game elements i guess? certainly more than a walking simulator but only just. it's for sure something novel so it deserves some attention. i think the decision to make jumping failureproof was a real missstep in design  a real missed opportunity to create a meaningful mechanic and elevate the whole thing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"sony's astroturfing is easily the best in the industry. every game they've partnered to market has been a huge success in social media. kena, bugsnax, sifu, and now stray. all games that would have been quickly forgotten otherwise."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the game is about 3 hours long. at this point i've seen more ads then gameplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is playing a game thats 4 hours long really considered grinding? lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"so, give us a brief summary please."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,two ads for the same game in one morning. their marketing team is out in force today.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,oh no. this game is doomed because this particular person said so
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,herp to the derp
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you know you are here too right? fucking idiots.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the entire game is just walking as a cat that's exactly why almost any post is a spoiler, because the nuance is all of the cutsey cat things that you discover and find along the way."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah, this is what i ended up doing for now. but like... why is it like that?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,framerate looks atrocious too. could be the gif though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it is set to the lowest settings on pc maybe even lower by editing ini files. i play on pc and its absolutely beautiful
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if you like playing as a nonhuman, check out ghost of a tale. it's very pretty, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"can it even be called a platformer? the jumping is a context sensitive prompt, you are not in control."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,there are plenty of games you play as animals. this is just an advertisement.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it's certainly the most compelling play as an animal game in a long time and the cat tax is helping by leaps and bounds for sure. it's just a giant shame that they decided to take the great strength of a cat  jumping and agility and completely throw that aspect of gameplay down the drain.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,did you put grassroots in quotations because these have been mostly paid advertisements? i get this sub isnt that great. but it's not hard to figure out these posts with 50k upvotes of a video of a cat walking around with ps2 graphics wouldn't generate 50k upvotes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"one half of the internet is for porn, and half the remaining capacity for cat videos. youtube got big with people sharing videos of their cats being cats. all you need to do to farm karma is to have anything implying a cat connection... anyone paying anyone for cat advertisement is dumb as rocks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,hardly an answer. if i knew one thing about this game it was that it featured a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love cats. i have two of them. this game is hot garbage.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,5 hours is from the devs own interview.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"lol, yeah i was just asking why the cctv is reacting like that in game. guess people is so sensitive that they thought i am talking trash about the game. just played the game abit, minor spoiler but the answer is, the cctv is controlled by a ai asking for help"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,thanks. your answer is the truest. i have seen the kowloon walled city and it looks eerily very similar.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i literally thought the game was from like 2000. i had to look it up and see it was a new game. the fps threw me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"for reference, 24fps is standard for movies, and pretty much always has been. also most modern tv shows are delivered at 24fps. any higher and the movieshow looks horrible, like a vhs home video or soap opera. this is like 10. on that note, i actually prefer some games lile rdr2 to run at a lower, more cinematic framerate. feels like i'm playing a movie. but this is just sad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"for sure, i remember when all i had was a shitty laptop too, so i've been in that position"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i'm not sure why you say that about bugsnax. it's a legitimately good game that they've added good content to. it was also a launch title.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the term doesn't describe a length of action but more a dedication to either it's repetition or completion.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,nobody's gonna really care about spoilers since it's a trendy game. every single yt outlet  gaming sub is going to be mentioning every small bit of this game because they want viewsupvotes. it's ez.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"wouldn't be surprised if sony pushed the controller features on devs, making them include something that uses the speaker, regardless of how well implemented. can't think of one instance where a controller speaker actually improved, let alone didn't actively worsen the experience of a game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"what other games do you play as animals? besides the untitled goose game, which was also very popular because you play as a goose."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes exactly, the quotations are meant to show that the ad campaign is trying to disguise itself as users simply discovering and enjoying the game but it's clearly too coordinated to be organic. astroturfing is the right term, i.e. fake grass"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's just a hyped game that seems to be meeting the hype about cats. a popular subject and a rarely done one in gaming. it is also free for folks with ps extra the game pass on playstation so a lot of people are playing it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that is the answer though. if you don't like cats, that's fine, but other people do and they're interested in the game for it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i haven't played it that much, i'm only a few hours in, but it's not giving me any maneater vibes personally. the only way i can compare them is that they are both damn good animal simulators."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i thought the game looks really good on a nice oled. the hdr seems to pop.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,no this is the best graphics this game has
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i don't think they say that in vanilla skyrim
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"let's get to bashing butts, as well as deez nuts!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"but every skyrim player ever has thought i wonder what happens if i fus this annoying guard, so it's safe to assume you're getting attacked!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no but people are super cavalier about it now. no one marks spoilers for anything on reddit anymore, and in real life people just start openly discussing things without considering others around them may not have seen what's being discussed by them. the fact it even has a namespoiler culture tells you how rampant it is. it is significantly more of an issue now than it was even 5 years ago."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"bugsnax is easily the worst title of the bunch. like i said, a completely forgettable experience, but thanks to sony's crack marketing team it acquired meme status and received way more attention than it deserved."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"fair enough, but how much longer is the game going to take you to grind to completion rather than just playing it normally?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"so fucking hilarous xdddd this game is already doomed to become the next meme, i'm giving it a pass because you redittards ruin everything. the account is ucleahn, which was inactive for nearly nine years and suddenly woke up from a long nap about two weeks ago, it seems."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,talked a bunch of smack about people who use reddit and that everyone is stupid or something like that. was just being a little edge lord.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you'd think if a person wasn't part of a culture they'd stop participating in it, but here we are. just watching you engage in self harm."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you are here. i dont think you know how this works. just keep being a dumbass. eventually youll learn.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,why was your account inactive for 9 whole entire years?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"youtube you'd have to chose to watch a video about it, reddit feeds it in your face if its on a sub and you're scrolling."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"at the start of gotg you're on the ground wreckage? space gunk? with rocket and groot while drax and gamora are on the ship. when rocket and groot talk it comes out of the usual tv speakers, but since drax and gamora are on comms their voices come out of the controller. thought that was a neat little detail, and for anyone who finds it annoying it stops being a thing as soon as you're out of the tutorial area"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"first thing i did when i turned on my ps5 was shut off the annoying controller speaker, lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the only time i liked the speaker was for the unlocking sounds in the resident evil remakes. so satisfying.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my mans never seen a gif before...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"judging by the lack of shadows, ambient occlusion, etc, i'm guessing the pc is very underpowered and that the capture itself was 1520 fps."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"ill add on to this, what other games do you play as animals and it is also relevant and engaging storywise? even in untitled goose game, youre just a goose causing mischief, theres no deep meaning to the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"tokyo jungle, spider the videogame on ps1, maneater, ecco the dolphin"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's clearly too coordinated everyone is posting about it at the same time because it iswas the day the game was released. that's not a conspiracy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"but its not even that great at being a cat game? the cat is almost on rails and you cant jump, you just walk and press x to interact with things. there are other cat games like little kitty big city that are much more in depth. i get that its a walking sim but is there any other reason that people are hyping this up outside of omg cat and the fact that its being advertised a lot?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it just seemed more like an interactive story than a game to me. very small, linear areas, no ability to freely jump around, explore and actually be a cat. your actions are limited and only available at onscreen button prompts. the fact that the story itself only takes 34 hours to beat. lacks depth and replayability. not worth a 30 price tag, imo. maybe if the game was like 10 bucks i probably would've reconsidered keeping it and beating it, but as far as it stands now, i've got better things to spend 30 on, like toys and food for my actual cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"he doesn't like a game, so he must be a troll!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, i just don't understand the hype it's getting. the game is super short and the gameplay is mediocre at best. it's more of an interactive story than it is a game. definitely not worth 30. if it's your cup of tea, then great! but the ad campaigning and the fact it's all over reddit is stupid. you would think it's a aaa title by the attention it's getting, but it's not even close. it's a great concept, but bad execution."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"imagine writing like 30 negative comments about a cat game that came out yesterday. hot garbage lol, he is just trying to upset people."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes you're right ubasiccomplexities ! this short game clip on the lowest settings clearly is a heinous plot to get their advertisement out there. or maybe people are just playing a new game and are organically posting about it. i finished it in about 6 hours. enjoyed the heck out of it. it's a short atmospheric game with not a lot of replayability. is that everyone's cup of tea? of course not. doesn't mean people can't post about it or enjoy it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm pretty sure their comment in its entirety was meant to be sarcastic.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,...so i should buy a playstation to play the cat game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you can barely do that though. the game isn't open world and is super linear. the areas aren't even that big. there's only so much poking around you can do before it gets boring.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,sure i hear you but you are very constrained within the game. most of it is a linear path. not much to do once youve explored and looked at some of the nice details. feels more like a super polished tech demo than a video game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,zurks
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"and some of the robots in the slums do immediately like you. if you rub against grandma's leg, her face gets a heart display. one of the other robots says they feel compelled to pet you, but that they don't know why they feel that way, so they're not going to do it i really love the world building the devs put into it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"but its not even that great at being a cat game? can you name a better one? you can scratch up drapes, knock stuff off shelves, fit through tiny spaces and meow on command. very cat like, very fun i can sort of see why people miss a dedicated jump button, but it's an adventurepuzzle game not a platformer, and having a jump button you could spam would go against the realistic cat movement and animations the devs are clearly going for"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"fair enough, i am really enjoying exploring and having fun. maybe if the game was like 10 bucks interestingly enough it is 11 in my country, so maybe that is why i don't mind that it seems a bit short."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,not liking a game and calling it hot garbage is different.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"just because people disagree with and get upset with my opinions on things doesn't mean i'm actively trying to upset people. when you grow up, hopefully you'll learn how to gracefully accept the opinions of others instead of getting angry and going off on a tangent. also, i have made 10 total posts in reply to people discussing the game, on three to four different threads. not sure where you got 30 from."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,no. no game is that good.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"you mean meme reviews like these ones  this game made my mental illnesses worse thumbs up   this game is so much better than elden ring! thumbs up   i wonder if the devs intended for it to be a horror game or if it happened on accident thumbs up that's kinda the whole point. the reality is that the game is average at best, hence the low review scores from critics."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,thats stunningly good. you captured so much charm. the weathering is also really well done.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,thats so dope
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"stray is such a cool game and this is such a great cosplay, i thought it was an ingame screenshot"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,wow!top cosplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"wow, this is so cool!!!! i thought it was a still from the game before i read the caption"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"that's amazing! i love it. you did an awesome job, man. nbsp i started it a couple weeks ago but i can't find the last journal.  i think it's glitched out or something."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,this is amazing!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,great cosplay op but i will once again ask why some cosplays are appreciated while the lady dimitrescu cosplay from a few weeks ago was absolutely shafted? what is the stance of this sub on cosplay?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,this sub is only about cosplays now
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,wow. superbly done. truly great work. edit why the downvotes? do people not know what the word superbly means? superb means exceptionally good. the ly makes it an adverb so i can stick it in front of a verb.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i expected much more from that game. it was way too short and basic for what it had to offer.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,am i the only one who thinks momo is a bmo ripoff?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"ive tried playing this game. when does it actually become interesting? edit fyi, i stopped when i kept dying during running from the bugs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,is this where bmo came from?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,of course a guy. no skin detected
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,yes!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"that is some a work right there. i know a lot of the focus is on the head, but everything else seems very commendable as well. lots of detail for the ragged look."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"great job!!!! like, this is the best!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i just finished the game yesterday so seeing this in real life is giving me fuzzy feelings. amazing job.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-02,omg this is so good
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-16,hello!! im thinking of making a similar cosplay in terms of the mask. i would like to know how you made the screen  ty!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"haha sadly no, its just a static screen i made of the default expression, mostly because i wanted it simple and easy to see through"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"thank you for sharing the files! when i first played this game, i knew someone was going to cosplay momo perfectly, and that someone is you!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-23,alright now... uhh i don't know how to begin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"i was absolutely in love with the first city area where you meet momo, such a cool ambiance !"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,fantastic concept... played it all the way through. never need to pick it up again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,it was okay
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i love this game so much. i'm a big fan of soulslike and it was so refreshing for me to just play a chill relaxing game with a great story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"i see right under the eyes since the face is made of pc fan mesh which is perforated plastic, the leds do affect my vision a bit but im able to navigate myself in a well lit area."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"i mean, it has to! i have so many questions that need answers!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"good, that game had a really chill vibe that was really cool."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,wait really??
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i personally prefer games that don't overstay their welcome. stray felt fresh the whole way to the end.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"hollow knight is a fantastic indie game. its pretty cute, very hard, and hours and hours of play"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"i've never experienced motion sickness from a game in my life before but stray put me in bed, head spinning, for hours after jumping around the first robot area for a while. i was looking forward to it so much. tweaking some settings fixed it and i was able to finish it but it ruined the experience so much."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,it is. but i was slightly let down by the lack of roof climbing in the upper town.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,agreed. i just finished season and it was wonderful as well.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"really? it was alright, nice idea, got tedious and the bots took away from the fun with the cat for me the level of promotion this game got was impressive, thats for sure"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,daddy likey momo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,sit down.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"im not going to lie, i saw this on my popular feed and immediately jumped to the comments hoping and praying this was here."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,so glad someone posted this 3
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"oh yeah, im thinking daddy likey momo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,probably due to how limited my visibility is at times hahshah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"same, i thought there must have been some sort of crossover i wasn't aware of for a second"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i made it from scratch using foam! i scored the lines with an old soldering iron and made thin foam strips for extra detail. it velcro to the back of the head. the main reason i made it from scratch was to have it proportionally accurate to the head since the game models have tiny heads compared to their body.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,right? instant regret for not finishing it yet.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"for the fabric bits the neck, mask and gloves i used neoprene fabric since it's thick and durable tho not recommended if you live in a hot country. the finger pieces are made from eva foam and hot glued on."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"at the moment no, i do have progress pics scattered throughout my twitter but i will consider making a video soon once i finish another photoshoot!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"ngl, was a bit sad it wasn't that haha"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,and i thought they meant the kpop idol lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,which one?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,well was it any good? did it look complicated to do? was their anything unique about it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"is it gaming related? ok then, bring it on"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"so, where do i find all these cosplays that you speak of? because no matter how i sort the posts, i see like 1 cosplay post for like at least 10 none cosplay posts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,really
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"the account im replying to is a bot copying other peoples comments. if you want to help clean up reddit you can report this by going to report  spam  harmful bots. message me if you want more info, im human!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,a talking tv is not new....and it wasn't new when at did it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i stopped when i kept dying during running from the bugs. you mean the first 5 minutes of the game......? if your patience is like this all the time don't even bother playing it lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,what?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,how do you see through?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"i thought it'd be like old fashion slide projectors, where you could slide different expressions in and out. it'd be cool though. again, awesome work! you just made my day"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"it can't be that hard to program 2 or 3 faces with a switch or timer between them, the problem would be seeing through the pixels though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,and you're a bot farming rgaming posts
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"the account im replying to is a bot copying other peoples comments. if you want to help clean up reddit you can report this by going to report  spam  harmful bots. message me if you want more info, im human!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,thankfully they priced it very reasonably at launch 30 usd.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-03-01,"there really needs to be more of these types of games, stray, tomb raider etc. closed world, chill games. the best thing about stray is how well it runs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,nice work!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"exactly how i did ours but i only lit the eyes, was surprised at how easy it was to see out"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i neeeeed to see the kitties get back together. we need to see that face rubbing tail curling action!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,he guaranteed it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"it was nice not to have to spend weeks or months to get all of the trophies. some were a little difficult like the run and avoid part, and the first time i tried a sub 2 hr run i was 15956 and it didnt count.  next try was like 146 tho. totally achievable, a decent challenge that wont break your spirit like rdr2s observe  kill photograph every damn species. i felt totally satisfied with the little package that stray was and not overwhelmed. its just a nice casual fun game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"hollow night is right at the sweet spot where difficulty feels great. its sooooo satisfying to feel yourself learn with every try. then you beat a boss and if you were to attempt it again youd probably beat it immediately, where it took you 20 tries to get there. fantastic game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,i got all achievements in hollow knight including the pantheon of hollownest one. still waiting for silksong if its ever came out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,same here. not as bad but even worth tweaked settings i could only play in little bursts or by watching standup on another screen at the same time so my focus was elsewhere. still loved the game though!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"yeah, i'm thinking daddy likey momo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"people keep asking, if daddy like momo..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,i like twice likey likey
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"wow, never thought it was foam from the pics  it looks amazing!!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"i giggled it, and apparently, it's near momo's apartment? the second notebook i believe."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"it was one of the better lady dimitrescu cosplays besides the criticism was never of that cosplay it was cosplay in general in this sub here, read commentshttpswww.reddit.comrgamingcomments111p3g0demitrescubydahliacosplay?utmsourceshareutmmediumandroidapputmnameandroidcssutmterm1utmcontentsharebutton"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,yeah true but novadays they are all over the place and most of them are low effort not talking about this one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"first 5 minutes of gameplay maybe but i died a lot. also the only reason i quit was i saw the ads and there was actual dialogue. yet, by the time i stopped, not a single word has been spoken."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,with their eyes. i think.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"it looks like it is a printed mesh, so there would be holes in it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,lcd screens are actually transparent. they're just usually in a monitor chassis. you can remove the panel itself and do all sorts of neat stuff. my personal favorite is using it as the side panel for a pc case.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,it could be something like a onesided mirror
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"jokes aside, it looks like they painted a mesh screen"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,absolutely. don't regret playing it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"i used 5v led strips for the backlight so i just had them for the top and bottom infront of my mesh so they're not seen when i turn my head. the eyes and mouth have their own leds using 3.7v cob strips and made a stencil inside to prevent led bleed. the little knobs under the jaw are actually the dimmers i installed to control the brightness since when i first made this mask in october, the leds were always too bright and would constantly overexpose on camera as seen in my old posts"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"i literally cried at the end because i was so upset the kitty family didnt get back together. i was also pmsing, but still."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i feel like they really dropped the ball on that ending. it could have been so sweet but instead i was left sitting there thinking wtf where are all my kitty friends?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,i was hoping the main cat would find the cat friends and take them all back to the town to be friends with the robots. i figured that was why the robots always got the heart face when you rubbed on their legs.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,hes gonna like the way he looks.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,same game publisher as stray right? annapurna
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,i honestly want them to do a crowdfunding if its money they need to make silksong
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,uuhhhhhh yeah i'm thinking daddy likes momo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,uhyeah. im thinking daddy likey momo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,"ah, i see."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i'm with you. too many people playing dress up on this subreddit. just another post to hide.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,"yeah my guy, because you didn't meet the robots yet.... wtf lmao"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,my brand!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-27,i might be having a stroke but i swear to god i remembered meeting up with my kitty friends in the end of the game. like we all walk off together. i'm crazy??
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-28,my predictionhope for the ending would be that the cats live happily together with all the seemingly lonely robots that you encounter.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i love this game! but... it would have been so easy to show the cat reuniting with his friends. yes, i saw the video that proves he was just a hop, skip and jump away from his home when he finishes, but what if they were out looking for him? cats in this world seem to have a slightly higher brain function and they seemed loyal. maybe it's a set up for more? all i know is that i was thinking about and striving for that reunion the entire game. it doesn't lower my opinion of the game, but the fact remains, i wanted it so bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i played it on the ps4 and i'll do it again this year when it comes to switch.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,did your sleeve fit the games case without tearing? many didn't since the ps5 case and ps4 case are tiny bit different. they either sent the wrong size or only had one that fit the smaller case. i was able to request a new sleeve for the ps5 version.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i can understand why the devs did it this way. sure it might be a bit casual for some, but with free jumping it would have turned into an annoying where the hell do i jump falling down and dying simulator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,its a chill cat game what would you add to it other than purrrcore and being able to knock stuff over??
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,this dumb cat game won the most innovative award on steam. i'm a fan of bannerlord and while bannerlord has its flaws it was actually innovative but lost to stray. dumb popularity contests.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i adore cats, but i found this game very dissapointing for that reason. what kind of cat game don't allow me to jump?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,it's ok to just watch a cat go on a journey. sit back and enjoy watching the story unfold. sometimes i like things that are different to other things that i also like. and that's ok.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,who asked?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,goty 2022 imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"no, i don't care, it's a mf cat! but come to think of it, i didn't care about the gameplay, just wandering around and recollecting the things for the silver harness! and the soundtracks too! but it must be because of cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i thought the whole thing was a tutorial, or mellow start. i was all set to really start the game when i realized i had completed it. overhyped by the internet cat lovers. 410."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,the enjoyment of the game is just being a cat and doing cat things.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-19,the fact they they copped out so hard on an actual fucking ending is what ruined it for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,story was pretty engaging and its a good game to give to my gf who cant play anything thats too challenging.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i've wanted to play it again on my steam deck, but haven't hit the buy button just yet. i'm afraid it's gonna make me emotional again. haha"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"the problem isn't even that it's a game about a cat. papers, please is a game about a border control clerk in a socialist country and it's heaps of fun. my problem with stray is that it's just a walking sim where not much happens. hell, even the jumping is scripted. you'd think they'd at least let you freely jump when playing as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,have you never paid for a movie ticket or what
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"the xbox one is on sale for 15. i mean, you do you, but it's some of the most fun i've had playing as a cat."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,some people dont want to get teabagged by a professional twelve year old and just want to relax after work and just let a story unfold around them. and like cats.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,oh yes! i have the japanese ce on preorder cause it has some cool stuff with it.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,in the japanese collector's edition. i got it from play asia.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"why do redditors always go to extremes? it's not like there's only stray and elden ring, what happened to all the games in between that are not super difficult and yet are still fun? nope, it's either cat walking sim or hardcore soulslike, no in between."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"dude. i cried for at least a half hour when i finished it. specifically, when you press triangle next to that. it was so bittersweet and beautiful. reminded me that cats really are such sweet little babies when they want to be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"to be fair, i did finish that one without crying, lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"its a game that costs like 20 bux. op isnt buying skyrim 9 times over at full price, theyre supporting a small indie company that deserves it. pathetic how you must shame and tag some cringey meme consume sub. what a sad use of your internet time."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"ugh, seeing cats this cute always makes me so sad i'm allergic"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,cute cat. i wish this game had let players choose which breed they could play with. i would love to play it as one of my siamese gatos.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,fair. my cat doesnt like harnesses she is so smol that she has been known to slip out of them but does like the backpack. they are both very pricey however.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-11-28,they're not multiple options. they're the same game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,yup. i do be like that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"yea a good story and atmosphere can absolutely carry a game with simple gameplay, easily. the product is better than the sum of its parts in that regard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"three of my favorite games from the last decade or so were days gone, mafia 3, and cp 2077. all of those are what i call mediocre games with excellent ambience, style, story, and characterization. i would hate it if all games were like them but i'm very glad they exist."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"moral of the story, gimmicky shit works on pop culture types."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"counterpoint you play a cat who never reunites with his family. the story literally starts by dumping the titular stray into a nightmare failed robot utopia and that is the last of the stray's family you see. you never reunite with the other kittens you wake up with in the opening of the game. there is no resolution to the loss of your siblings or even knowing what happened to them. additionally, you play as a catlike creature but the game doesn't even pretend that the cat is an actual cat. as soon as you encounter the ai it treats you like a human intelligence that happens to be in a cat body instead of being a cat. suddenly you're an active member of the revolution against the current system instead of being, you know, a fucking cat. yes, it has interesting lore and i would probably care about it a lot more if the main protagonist didn't involve a cat acting like a goddamned shitty manga isekai protagonist in a cat body instead of being some random ass cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,you say emotional payoff but you don't even get to see the kitty reunite with its friends at the end. i liked gone home and firewatch but the story in stray was passable but not enough to carry it imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"did you play it or is this just conjecture? the game has a great story with solid world building, lore, mystery and emotion. people made entire breakdown videos on the story to try and work out what some clues in the game meant in terms of what led to the state of the world and how much time had passed. yep just a unreal engine tech demo. steam recent reviews overwhelmingly positive 1,956 all reviewsoverwhelmingly positive 126,810"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,actual platforming would have been nice. the devs went to the extent of making the perfect animations for a cat jumping around and then tied them all to a hold button to do x thing rather than give me an iota of control or chance of failure.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"the problem isn't that it's a chill cat game, the problem is that people acted like this game is a 1010 goty game when it's just a simple, pretty looking indie game with the complexity of a shape sorting toy. the game was hyped completely out of proportion. like, you can't seriously sit here and tell me that stray is on the same level as elden ring, god of war, horizon or xenoblade."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,something like ravaging endemic bird populations?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"scratching the shit out of people, attaching to peoples faces while theyre driving and making them crash, making people trip on you and fall out the window. that sort of thing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"and literally nothing it did was innovative outside of the main character is a cat, lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"i'm not disagreeing, but being different doesn't make it immune to criticism. like, why not make the platforming a little more engaging than hold button to purrkour? why not have more sequences where i have access to the ability to fight back against the creepy crawlies after i've spent so much time just running? why was the culmination of the game just push block puzzles and narration? why did i get zero emotional payoff for fighting my way through a robot religious andor political revolution but didn't find my other kitties? like, literally the entire first moments of the game is about how you're a member of a pack of adolescent kittens and you get separated from them. it's your setup, your call to adventure, and the whole reason you're going through all this shit is for the payoff of the reuniting moment, and you don't get it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"you did. and since i wasn't blunt enough, apparently, let me be more blunt stray is a fucking walking simulator with an extravagent animation budget for what it is. i guarantee that if it wasn't a wellanimated cat doing cute things to distract from that it would have gotten 67 out of 10 at most because there is literally no real meat to the gameplay beyond some very basic puzzle elements. i can give you more criticism if you ask, or you can bigger off. i really don't care which."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,you think that stray was a better game than elden ring?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"and i'm not saying that's necessarily bad, but that's basically all there is to it. the plot just kinda happens around you. i think yahtzee put it best in his review of stray at the end where he basically summed it up from the cat's perspective as well, that happened before it fucks off."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,agreed! the game could've played more with the idea of a story about a cat doing cat but instead they just made a generic story about an ai scientist. missed opportunity!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"counterpoint you play a cat who never reunites with his family. i actually love that aspect of the game, in a cliche disney movie the cat would have its happy ever after, but in the real world....it is just a cat, it will muck around chasing bugs until hopefully one day it ends up back at its pack, people have actually broken down the area on youtube and tried to work out where the cat would end up, but i personally think we don't need to know this, the cat was just a vessel to help deliver the story of the underground city, i guess that was lost on you. but ultimately this is just all sounding highly subjective and we are back to where we started with different people liking different things. op just came to show off a collection they were proud of and didn't ask for opinions on the game, but you can't help yourself of course, i know you added the good on you for enjoying it though. to seem wholesome but it was just fluff on top of what you really wanted to say."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"as i said to another user i loved that we didn't see that, in a cliche disney  pixar movie you absolutely would get that fluffy happy ending, but this game was trying to be real about what a cat is, a cat is....just a cat. it will chase some bugs and get home eventually, but i personally felt we didn't need to see it, i absolutely love the ending, but it is also fine if you don't. my point all along is we all like different things and these people who started dumping on the game just can't appreciate that because they only see through their own lens."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"this is one of those games like animal crossing where you either love it to pieces or you find it unbearably dull. i'm definitely in the latter camp. the game had a cool atmosphere but the fetch quests were so boring and unimaginative it really tarnished the experience. also a huge missed opportunity to have actual cat parkour and platforming in a game, instead they opted for press a to play animation which was severely disappointing. as far as story goes, i mean it's okay. i don't see how it's anything super special to write home about. look at a game like undertale, made by one dude, and has multiple endings and a huge cast of wellfleshed out characters not to mention actual gameplay. stray is just kinda standard videogame story fare in comparison. if the protagonist was anything other than a cat, we wouldn't even be talking about the game right now."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"the comment above is also acting as if all games aren't some variation of hold x to do xyz. in a singleplayer game like this, the story is the point. stray nails the story, nails the art, and nails the world building."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,you keep posting the review scores. a lot of people liking something doesnt prove its quality one way or another. bandwagon fallacy. anyways the reason the game got so popular was 100 just the funny cat. i can guarantee that if you didnt play as a funny small animal it would be half as big.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"the game can have all that but if it fails at including actual gameplay then i really dont consider it a game. why not just make it a movie or a book or something else at that point? i dont want to play a game with barely any gameplay because that just makes it not fun also i dont care what steam reviews say, i dont base my opinions off the beliefs of other people"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,ya there could be more challenge to it but as a stoner its an amazing time getting kinda high and watching the lil cat do the cat things
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i feel like the reddit demographic tends to look favorably on these kinds of games. i still remember buying journey back in like 2015 because of all the this game melted my brain its the greatest experience of all time posts, thinking that there would be some crazy twist or huge shift in the gameplay. nope, you glide through a desert the whole time, except the one part where youre gliding through a tundra."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,clearly that must be wrong because the game got the steam award for most innovative game. its really ground breaking. its changed the mind of industry veterans worldwide. a truth became clear. just. add. cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,its been awhile since iv stepped into the world of stray but if i remember correctly all life is gone except for cats??? dont quote me 100 so chasing birds would be dope but their dead  you can vibe with stoner robots and annoy other robots as they clean tho
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,you okay?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,blinx had an orange cat main character 22 years ago lol. i'm sure other games did too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"like, why not make the platforming a little more engaging than hold button to purrkour? i think this is a deliberate choice, as someone whos favorite genre is the 3d platformer ive seen many people play them, or non platformer games with platforming elements and especially in the latter people were often frustrated that the platforming parts were stopping them from progressing. if they're mainly in it to be absorbed by the story and atmosphere and the fails of platforming could take them out of it then thats probably worse. ideally of course you would have both and the easy platforming option would be a toggle although ive seen too many people suffer due to pride, always chosing the hardest difficulty, no accessibility settings etc despite having less fun in the end that way. which i believe is also why a lot of hard difficulties nowadays are pretty tame. personally of course i would enjoy the game much more with better platforming that goes without saying, but i genuinely believe a lot of people could have gotten very frustrated by it in a game like this."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,".....but those are just some cats. life doesn't work like that, usually. would a cat behave like that in real life? would he be out searching for his friends or would he just get on with his day and move on with his life? nothing is immune to criticism, but your criticism is you didn't get the story ending you wanted. well, that just wasnt the story that was being told. how was the story going to loop back to that cat group without it being awfully forced? as for the gameplay, moving through the environments was satisfying enough for me. it was a welcome break from more involved or demanding titles. i was able to hand the controls over to my kids and we all had a great time with it, either playing or spectating."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"i tried to get into them, but they were a tad too kiddy for me. i had read its spiritual grandfather tailchaser's song by tad williams when i was about 13. needless to say, it's a book i liked a lot."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"omg yes! this looks like my jam! i guess i'm signing up for audible again, lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,omg. yes! i need this for when i go on extended trips! i always miss my babies so much when we go on vacation! good luck with college! hope you don't miss your baby too much!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"yeah, it absolutely is lol. they got people paying a monthly fee for a 20 year old game. it's nuts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"the thing about open discussion forums is, well, open discussion. that discussion might not be to your liking, but just like the game, it doesnt matter does it?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i guess that was lost on you. okay buddy, so i'm just going to throw this out pretending i just didn't get it because i have a different opinion is pretentious as fuck. get that shit out of your system. the very minute you discard a different opinion because you think the other person is shallow is the same minute you lose your critical thinking skills. and i'm going to explain why. every good story needs an emotional climax to resolve it. every good story establishes a conflict or stakes for the protagonist which offers a solid conclusion to the story by the time they've reached the end point of the story. it doesn't have to be a happy ending or even the end of their character arc, but it needs to be an ending. stray simply does not end, narrativelyspeaking. the protagonist, the stray, is left with a clear narrative goal get back to the other kitties. and then nothing happens there. it's an emotional clickbait to draw you in and then does nothing with it. the rest of the narrative is you performing tasks that can be done by a fucking cat while an ai tells you how awesome you are because you're a cat. i know you added the good on you for enjoying it though. to seem wholesome but it was just fluff on top of what you really wanted to say. i am not wholesome but if people like you want to call me out for being critical,you're damned right i'll go into detail. you basically said tell me how you really feel for saying i don't like the game, so it's beyblade let it rip time baby."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"it is a happy ending for the cat though, they just don't show the reunion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i haven't played stray, but i feel you. happy endings are such a boring trope."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,i'm not. there is very little gameplay to it. it's practically a walking simulator.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,this is so intellectually dishonest it hurts
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,whatever you need to tell yourself to cope
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"why not just make it a movie or a book or something else at that point? this may blow your mind but not everyone feels the same about it as you, some people value story wayyyy higher than game play, and they love the interactive experience stray delivered....fine if you don't but you talk in a way that really seems like you believe your opinions are the way and everyone else is misguided. also i dont care what steam reviews say, i dont base my opinions off the beliefs of other people and i am sure op wasn't much interested in your opinions either, otherwise maybe they would have asked."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,movies and books don't allow people the viewers to explore and interact with the world they build like how stray does
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"i'm not saying it's not a great game to play while stoned, just saying it doesn't make it immune to criticism."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i feel you. i tend to learn towards hard games but sometimes i just wanna vibe. just getting high and cruising around in gta is fire.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i'm just going to point to the fact you're pretending random cat with human intelligence solves robot apocalypse is somehow less forced than cat just tries to find hisher siblings and dies of starvation in a corner. i'm glad that you were able to hand over controls to your children, since that's about the level of your critical thinking."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,you're lying! no!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,why? there's millions of great games. why settle for ones that give you minimal hours of enjoyment for more money?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"i'm actually quite well off mostly because of my frugal spending habit and time management lmao i don't care if you think it's ridiculous, it works. it helps me not support shitty aaa games with no content as well as find some hidden gems."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-18,if you are a human you should be fighting late game capitalism 247
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"ooh, i love tailchaser. one of my friends told me that when i was 16 or 17 i kept telling everyone to read it. i don't remember that. but now i have a signed hardcover copy that i will never lend out tad is a friend of mine now."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,my cat hates it and starts going into hunting mode whenever she sees it. ive stuffed it in the attic so that shell actually feel comfortable in my room. she does not like the big version of herself! ill see if the brand or website is on the tags after work tomorrow! !remindme 18 hours
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i openly discussed that i thought what they were adding to the discussion was toxic and possibly misinformed do you not approve of my open discussion?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"you are saying all this as if it is fact, an x needs this and a y needs this, as if just because you say it makes it true haha you really are lost in your own little world of what i believe is the best one you're damned right i'll go into detail. i imagine you cracked your fingers before writing all this as if you were hitting me with the ace cards but it is just another big steaming pile of your opinions"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"this is all just your opinion stated as fact, and i'll bet you thought that beyblade line was hard af. to me, stray had an incredibly satisfying, if melancholy, conclusion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"what do you think you are, like, strays strongest soldier?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,this may also blow your mind but i also value story in my video games too! but i also value gameplay at the same time because thats what makes a game actually a game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,if they dont want to make it a book or movie then they should call things like stray something else like an interactive experience or something like that because calling stray a game really doesnt make any sense to me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"who hurt you? it's a game about a cat, dude. it's not that serious"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i'm glad that you were able to hand over controls to your children, since that's about the level of your critical thinking aaaand there goes any meaningful discussion we might have had."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,nah this is completely clowny sorry
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"what an adorable bean, thank you!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"tad is my favorite author of all time, so i am jealous, lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"you said that the op didnt ask for opinions in an open discussion forum. that was the point of my post, to say it doesnt matter a damn if thats the case or not. fwiw, the game is mid. enjoyable, but mid. the discussion around the game isnt though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i'm seeing a big steaming pile of i don't have an actual response and you're a totes loser there, bud."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"yeah, but i explained why i felt that way instead of making a counterpoint with no argument behind it, so that at least puts me one up one you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"what do you think you are, like, strays saltiest enemy?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"so i guess we are back to square one with all of us liking what we like and no need to dump on each other for it? no need for me to say something negative about a game you like, and no need for you to called ops passion just a tech demo when they just wanted to show off their collection and didn't ask"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"video games, whether you like it or not, can be and are frequently used interactive art mediums that allow people to tell stories in ways unique to that medium. stray is in the same vein as a lot of other games that strive in telling stories through mostly world building. just because it's gameplay isn't something you dislike doesn't make it not a videogame"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,nobody hurt me. i'm just saying there are legitimate reasons to criticize the game. who hurt you that criticism of something you like feels like a personal attack? show me on the doll where sushix gave your childhood favorite game a 510.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"you're pretending you were being constructive in the first place. you literally said well what about real life? and pretended that actual narrative constructs don't exist while talking about cats,while also pretending that what happens in real life should be satisfying in a fictional, narrative perspective."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,theyre trolling look at their profile.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i met him because i used to work for his publisher and worked on his books. i'm thanked in more than a few. he's a great guy. funny, kind, smart as hell."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"yes i was openly discussing that op didnt ask for opinions, are you saying you don't agree with my open discussion? fwiw, the game is mid. enjoyable, but mid. this certainly does seem to be your opinion"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"but i am not trying to change your mind about any of your subjective feelings so why would i offer a counter, i was just pointing out that some people like the game and feel it does have a lot to offer, and that you were just being toxic by pointlessly dumping on the game when no one asked  whether you admit it or not appends final wholesome comment to pretend to be overall wholesome"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,just because your opinion was longer than mine doesn't mean it was an argument.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i mean i posted what like 2 sentences actually about the game im not doing a very good job at being salty i guess
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i never said people cant like it im just kinda annoyed people call it a video game when it really shouldnt be considered that and did they ask for people to be positive about stray in the comments either though? op decided to post it so they should accept that there will be both positive and negative comments. thats just how the internet works. also i wasnt even criticizing op i was criticizing the game so why would it even affect him?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,if someone doesnt value gameplay then honestly theyre just not a fan of video games at that point. im telling you now if all games became like stray with barely any gameplay than most people would be upset and stop playing games altogether
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i've seen so many of your comments all around this thread and you just seem overly angry at the kitty game. take a breath my guy. it's okay, promise."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-16,"i always feel weird when people critize others minimum requirements for a purchase. imo it's a matter of taste how one will value a product before purchase it may change whenafter playing the game. if people want to apply some form of dollarhour metric, it also won't hurt the industry. especially compared to supporting mtx riddled games. unless it becomes an excuse for companies to apply the same metric to jack up their prices there's no reason to criticize them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"yes, and i pointed out that they dont get to have that abided by, nor get to stifle any opinions that are shared when they opened themselves up for it but starting a thread on a open forum."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,so you were basically commenting you're a big poo head and i don't like you. neat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"brevity might be the soul of wit in some cases, but in your case, not so much. in any discussion with dissenting opinions, having a longer opinion allows you to explain more ideas about why you disagree with someone. my opinion was long not just because i am a wordy boy, but because i used words to explain why i felt the way i feel about stray's narrative core. you basically responded with lol no i disagree without explaining why you felt stray's conclusion was, and i quote, an incredibly satisfying, if melancholy, conclusion. how was it satisfying? literally nothing happens to the core protagonist, the titular stray, and they are just an observer to the events that unfold. because they are a cat, they have no emotional investment in the ongoing narrative and their own jump off point, being separated from their fellow kitties, is never resolved or addressed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,coulda fooled me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i never said people cant like it im just kinda annoyed people call it a video game when it really shouldnt be considered that it is still so clear that you just can't grasp that this is not a universal objective truth, it is just how you feel about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,im just kinda annoyed people call it a video game when it really shouldnt be considered that why do you care so much about what other people call things? why does this even matter at all? why is the definition of video game something that needs to be protected so badly that the discourse on things like this is littered with shit fits about it? it makes no sense. stop wasting energy on things you don't like. just ignore it and move on.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"its a video game, whether you feel it should be or not."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"so until dawn and all the dark pictures anthology games are not games according to you. beyond two souls? detroit become human? wow, if everyone had your perspective on video games then nobody would play video games. you need to learn the definition of video game. might wanna check wikipedia."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,that's why there are different genres of games? you just don't like this type lol. i hate racing games i think they're incredibly boring but you don't see me out here saying racing games shouldn't be made because theres no enjoyment to be had out of them. it's like you don't understand the concept of people liking different things than you
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i'm sorry you think responses are aggression, but that's a job for your therapist."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i commend you on your openness to discuss openly these discussions that got opened
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"poo no need for such language i don't not like not, but i don't not not like you..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"it's always interesting to try to communicate with someone who feels like a conversation about opinions can be won or lost. stray makes several friends, one of whom goes through an existential crisis and eventually sacrifices himself for you at the climax of the story. you see everyone you met and helped along the way as they react to the lockdown being lifted. in the end, the zerks are no longer a threat, the robots can now leave the city, and stray wanders out into the world to find his family. it may not have been tied up in a neat little bow like you like, but it was a reasonable choice to end the game there. personally, i enjoy stories that don't feel like they start and end with my attention. the story wasn't about stray or his family. it was about the robots, their lives, how they came to exist in the way they did, and resolving their conflicts with the zerks and the lockdown protocols. stray is only your vehicle through the city and pov for discovering their world. just because you didn't like it doesn't mean it wasn't good. it means it wasn't for you. just because you say a lot doesn't mean you say anything insightful or even useful. and just because you're quick to insult people doesn't mean your condescension is earned or justified. it means you're kind of a dick about your videogame opinions."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i like arguing with people online and i was bored
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,yeah i wouldnt consider those video games either. theyre interactive movies. minecraft story mode is like that and its on netflix!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,yeah but racing games have gameplay. i mean look at every genre of videos game and they all have gameplay. even the most simple of games have gameplay
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"when they're needlessly hostile and snide? yeah, it's a bit aggressive. let them enjoy the kitty game and find another one to play."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,i hate this game too but this is just being pedantic at this point
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"i appreciate your honesty, but i'm appalled that arguing is seen as entertainment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,"then you don't know the definition of video game and are just making up your own definitions. just google or wiki any of those games and it clearly states that they are video games. webster dictionary's definition also confirms. goofy thing to deny facts, but ignorance is bliss i suppose and you are free to do you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,and stray has gameplay. you just dislike that gameplay because you see it as not enough but i'll take the gameplay of stray over the gameplay of a racing game any day
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,arguings a strong word more like bickering with people online
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,yeah the small amount of gameplay it has is terrible. like the platforming in the game being basically automated. is that really fun to you?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-17,playing stray iswas very fun for me yes lol. but i don't consider platforming to be the main gameplay of stray either
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,get some of that dimmsum

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,yes i thought it was pretty good. the controls felt weird for me at first but i got used to it. for example the game doesn't let you jump unless there's a prompt. that sounds really weird but after a while you get used to it

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"what stray gets right is how well they lean into the environmental storytelling. its a walking simulator with some simple puzzles, but it absolutely nails the ambience. not just the environments, but damn these guys researched themselves some cats. the player controlled cat does a very good job of feeling authentically cat, even while youre running around doing very not cat things. the robots do a better job of being human than i think actual human models would, and the world teases that exploration nerve constantly with little secrets and peaks of places youre going to next. it knows how to get you to say ooh, whats over there? i want to go over there! about the place its just about to send you to. to be fair, i own cats, and that seems to be a big part of where this game plugs into your brain. so if you dont like cats or are indifferent, it might now work as well for you."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"are you saying the steam reviews are fake? the publisher for this game is annapurna interative, they've published many games before stray as well which have also been highly recieved. neon white, outer wilds, what remains of edith finch, artful escape, journey. they've had an almost flawless record we don't talk about 12 minutes, so why do you think stray of all games would ve astroturfed? the main reason as to why it's popular is because it comes from a well known publisher, it was advertised heavily in many of sony digital conferences, it came for free with people who had ps plus, it released a few days ago, and the protagonist is a cat. of course people are going to be talking about it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i'm a dog person, still wishlist this game and prebuy it and enjoyed all the way"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"what i really enjoy about this game is the sort of lack of direct direction... if that makes sense. idk if it's intentional, but i seem to pick up on it from more experience gaming compared to my gf, but i'm noticing some yellow neon signs and whatnot that vaguely point you in the right direction. or an ac unit on the wall has little strings blowing out of it to grab your attention as a hey, you can jump here. it's so refreshing compared to constant quest markers and arrows, or having every jumpable surface have that yellow edge like mirrors edge i think?. even better when you turn jump prompts off."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"yeah, but theres a cat"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i was more going for portal was a short and sweet game that tried something outside the standard mold. there's certainly nothing mechanically groundbreaking about stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,free on the high seas
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,the 810 hours in the dense and heartwrenching world are worth it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i am normally pretty bored by game storys but this one is really grabbing me. its got way more character and story than i actually expected. i went in expecting a walking simulator but as a cat. and theres a lot more to it!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"no, we dont eat the long pig"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,the marlins and the trout?!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,except robot are not human
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"oh, the game is called stray. hope you enjoy it as much as i did."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,and?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i didn't realize you were the center of the game world. someone should have informed you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,when a political groupcompany pays to have a movement look like it's organic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"was joking in the same spirit, chill out"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,its so fucking easy to gather info about what a game is about and simply not let it be part of your life if you're not into it. there's only thousands of other games to play. this must get tiring if you do this every time a game comes out that isn't for you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,one's which heighten the experience with charm and good visuals?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"tons of people liked it, and i think that alone speaks volumes about what they did right. what would you have added, though? saying it's hollow and boring doesn't tell me what it's lacking. it tells me that it doesn't interest you. i have not played anything shenmue, so i don't get this analogy. in terms of cinematic features, i enjoyed this as much as the quarry. in terms of peacefulness, stardew valley. everyone has different tastes in games, but if you think adding something would improve it, i'd love to hear about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"the only reason i think it was expensive is cause it wasnt a long game. without knowing what wages they paid and their expenses and only looking at it from a buyers point of view i see it more as a 20 us dollar game. but i dont mind paying a little more to support the game as i liked the story and atmosphere and i admit i have no idea what price would make the game feasible. plus its a smaller developer and we need to se more of those succeed, especially if we dont want to see all big games dominated by sony, nintendo, and microsoft seems a lot of the big third parties are getting bought out. i doubt at 30 dollars they were just trying to rip people off though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,he can be both.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"okay... what are the specs of you pc or laptop, if you happen to have them on hand?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"you can get a 1tb hard drive for like 50 for your ps4. the system requirements for pc are low, like you can play it on almost 10 year old hardware low. not sure where you got your dollar amounts from but if you really want to play you should do a bit more research."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"do you think trailers are spoilers? if so, get mad at the devs for showing them in the trailers and not random people on reddit."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,no... it rhymes with ham. as does the first syllable of ramen.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"ram and rom are 2 related but very different things. if you're pronouncing ram as rahm then you're pronouncing those 2 terms the same way, and you think that's right for some reason. i can't even understand what you're trying to say here. i do pronounce ram like rahm, but rom like rawm, so they're not the same at all? and rahm is basically indistinguishable from ram in my accent so ram and ramen sound exactly the same. anyway good lord, who cares. the things people argue about on reddit..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i'm not trying to be abelist or make a joke about neurodivergent people or make you feel bad about yourself, but are you on the spectrum at all? i feel like you are getting hung up on something that neurotypical individuals would not and it is hard for us to even understand what you are trying to argue"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i read somewhere on here that they did actual mocap on a cat or cats for the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i literally just finished that part in the game. super sweet. kinda drive home that the up cycled ramen is basically brain soup, though  edit 22 mins later."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,or it's a game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"like someone said above, you can think of it like you're playing as the b12 robot guiding the cat everywhere...then again, why would the robot need the cat in the first place? to carry that backpack thing around i guess..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,wizards of the coast said no cats in dnd don't have dark vision
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you can do all of those things in the game. its fantastic!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you can do most of what you mentioned. i even got an achievement for sleeping for more than an hour.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,i would also buy this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,this is true. i parked the boat in port a long time ago though. not sure i would be able to chart myself a course at this point.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"yeah i know its not all about playtime, and to be fair it does look incredibly detailed but for me i'll wait for a sale and strech my pennies further."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,same. the first hour or two of game play i just ignored the story and pushed shit off shelves and ledges. it felt nice after having it done to everything in my night stand by my own finger boy for the past 15 and counting years
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,no. it's right where it should be.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"well you answered yourself, b12 was stuck in his computer, he needs something to take him around and the backback that happens to be for quadrupeds can recharge the drone if it's battery is low so. oh but what if that companion drone and the backpack was actually made for cats, like you control the drone at distance and you never lose your cat!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,well they do in real life
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"gonna tell my girlfriend about that one lol. she took a break last night to do some laundry, but she only decided to take a break when she found a spot to sleep on a shelf. it only ended up being 30mins or so though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,the superior form
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"please note i'm not agreeing with the other guy. i know absolutely nothing about the game, nor do i care to learn about it. i just wanted to explain the term 'astroturf' since people use it and never explain it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"understandable points, but not every game lends itself to the same standards as other games. it's a question of genre, game feel, game essence, vision and intended playing experience. the devs have made decisions about the game's content and functionality that  in their mind and experience  best conveys and delivers on their vision and type of game they're going for. your expectations are by no means unreasonable and i'm almost 100 sure that the devs have brainstormed along those lines as well especially the traversal mechanics i can feel have gone through a lot of iteration. however, at the end of the day, they decided to create a game that is less about mastery or freeform traversal and more about the feel of the world and the experience of being an actual cat in it. a cat that can easily jump to  get to any point in its reach marked nav points but has to find those paths first investigating your surroundings as a step in the game loop in order to make the player stop and really look at the world and atmosphere they've crafted. i think this just isn't the right game for your tastes and that's fine. what i personally don't quite understand is your tone and choice of words making the development of a game not suited to your taste seem like an attack on the industry by the devs and their publisher. to me that seems to be just a rather nonsensical leap in logic. as to your question what games i've dev'd, i am not at liberty to tell you about most of them, but i've been in the business as a programmer for 4 years, a project manager for one year and now again as a programmer i am working on an unannounced dune survival game with funcom."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i'm curious what games you have in mind when you say this. i haven't played stray, but i've loved some of the stuff that annapurna has published outer wilds, sayonara wild hearts, what remains of edith finch. some of their stuff isn't especially long gorogoa, florence, but the experiences felt unique enough to be considered more than just a tech demo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"ok, a samsung 1tb ssd is under 100. i understand it might be expensive for you, but as a whole hddssd prices are not very expensive at all. sounds like you just need something to complain about."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,seriously blue twelve nailed it with this game. i thought it would be a fun little novelty game but instead they succeeded in making me emotionally invested in not only the cat but the companions as well. they created a beautiful game that i never knew i needed

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,my favorite is that and destroying the majong game the robots play. theyve already played the game thousands of times if you tell them so why not spice it up with a cat.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,loving this game so far and probably one of my favorite releases of the year. very different from the other games ive been playing lately and its a great change of pace. a couple things i would add to the game is to be able to name the cat and choose the fur color and pattern. also jump into boxes and go nuts.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,the colliders are so seamless
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,game of the year 1010
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i wonder how much money theyre spending on social media marketing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,when my cat does this to me she just gets yeeted across the room.... i'm like 30 times her size.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i love how doing cat things is intuitive to the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,100100 for the game!! such a beautifully done game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,this game sucks.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it doesn't really. the cat stuff is gimmicky and doesn't add anything to the game. you could've replaced the cat by a robot, a kangaroo or a tibetan mastiff and it would more or less have played the same. stray is not a cat game, it's a robot game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,they need to make a 'taking a shit' simulator and spruce it up with good graphics.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"best game of all time, that's it. elden what? sorry couldn't hear it. elden what?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,wish i had a pc hopefully getting one for christmas and will be playing that game immediately!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,if at one part you climb on my desk and piss in the box holding all my lego set sticker sheets like an asshole yeah it's pretty accurate. fuck you target.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i wish there were actually people in this game not just robots. would be better if it was modern day world
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"fucking asshole, how dare he kick a cat wtf?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,this game looks like trash lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,people will play anything nowadays. gaming world is sad right now.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,everybody wants to be a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i was buying a game for my bf yesterday and wishlist this game cause the style alone, but just because if this video i'm buying it because i know it will entertain me way to much"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,this game is almost convincing me to buy a console so i can play it. i only have a switch
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,is stray an openworld game or does it have levels in order you need to complete?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,oh shit was that an achievement i missed??
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,jumping up on that one guys chest while he was sleeping and then he immediately fell in love with me was one of the best optional ones for me. i also liked that you could rub legs on half the npcs
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,finally.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i didn't love this game, but it's sure is pretty..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,sees review that's trying to relate to me turns back and ignores it

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,those are some long arms my guy no wonder why he feel cause a big legs jesus
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,only of the guy then got up and apologized profusely to the cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,im still looking for the idiot in the bomber jacket and gold chain
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,can you throw down a vase from a table while someone is telling you not to do it or shreds garbage bags just to make your owner cryhave a meltdown out of spite for humansrobots?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,the amounts of time my cat has done this to me. i'm the one who won the clash

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,what game is this?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,where can i play this? doesn't look like it's on xbox.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i've never tripped on a cat before. stepped on plenty of them though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"is this an achievement, i feel like it should be an achievement."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"did a cat fact check this, or are we just assuming we can comprehend cats now?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,is it open world?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,what game is this?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,is this game on xbox?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,bad beem bada boom
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,standing here i realized you were just like me trying to make history but who's to judge the right from wrong when our guard is down i think we'll both agree violence breeds violence but in the end it has to be this way
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,the knocking things if the shelf is the best part also
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,the bosses of this game are dogs?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-11,"hey guys i have a question for those that finished the game stray. what are the life lessons you can learn from the game? moral lessons, painful truths, any lessons"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,are you sure she's not a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i spent way too long tripping the walker in the first area because i assumed there was some sort of puzzle where tripping him at the right spot caused something to happen. as far as i could tell, it does not."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you should have her play this game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,glad its not just me. i tripped that guy every time i ran past him.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i've been trying to do this to the one in the first level where these guys exist. fucker keeps recovering like he's only got a buzz
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,it's called searching for hidden achievements
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i hope you immediately asked to come back in.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,and scratching every rug and sofa!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,woke up this morning to my 100 headphones cord completely changed through....won't make that mistake again
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"the ending was incredibly bittersweet for me. i hope they do content updates or even dlc, because the ending left so much open."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,what they need to add next is dlc or mod pack to let you change your kitty. i want my black n white oreo miss her so much
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,speaking of emotion the fall at the beginning and the cat walking like it was heavily injured made my wife cry and get nightmares
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,tbh i thought this game would be kind of a potato the world looked very interesting from the trailers but playing as a cat looked kinda dull i never thought id be so attached to a cat and her robot friends
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,frigging companions can make such deep comments. i like one that talks about the thesseus' ship problem explained with his own body.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i'm hoping for a short dlc of some kind
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,didnt this just come out like 23 days ago?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i just downloaded it today but haven't had a chance to play it much. how long does the entire playthrough take?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i have soooo many unanswered questions. loved the game but would have preferred to see our cat being reunited with its cat family on the outside. also when did zurgs evolve into those weird big alien eyes looking at us throughout the sewers chapter?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"even a simple lore book or website would be great, explaining wtf is up with !the giant eyes in the hive!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"because a cat's the only cat, who knoooows where it's at"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,until it's time to do cat shit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i want to be the cat but no playstations in the house. it'd be something if a game about cats brought me back to sony though. probably would sccop one if i see it in a store a ps5 not a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,but ain't nobody want to lift no heavy ass rats!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,ksssssst ahhhhh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"yep, and there are a few points in the game this is even relevant. i literally knocked over a box onto some guy's head and found out a few minutes later i had to for story progression."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"you can knock stuff off everything, its amazing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"yep. you also scratch the shit out of carpets, walls, couches, etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,haha it just falls over at first and that is exactly accurate to when you try and put a harness on a cat. love it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,that purring is so satisfying and comforting.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i was hoping for something to happen with this bot, like it dropping a can of energy drink or something. but i did it 3 times and nothing special happened, except the robot seemed tired so i stopped messing with it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"warning the game has 56 hours of content total and most of it is an onrails linear experience for the main quest with small pockets of exploration to gather items that are only helpful for completion, but don't affect gameplay. i just found myself disappointed, thinking that you would use feline agility to maneuver quickly, but the movement feels clunky and all jumps are on rails, you get to a ledge and press a button and the game does the rest for you fantastic cat simulator, but a very meh game in my opinion"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,looks like the ad posts are working than.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,the game is still a walking simulator but as a cat. very very little gameplay
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i really wish there was an achievement for tripping someone!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,is this possible in game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,its a strand type game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,oh boy i hope dunkey is playing this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"the entire game is pretty much photo mode, and the sleeping spots all have a nice scenic zoomout on them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,my cat would rather be dragged around the house than willingly walk in a harness. i laughed very hard at that scene.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i started learning spanish and this is the first sentence ive been able to read in the wild.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,there is an achievement for napping in one of the sleeping spots for over an hour so...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,its on pc as well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"there is a puzzle that specifically requires you to knock something off a shelf to wake someone up. so yes, it absolutely is a thing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"because it's trendy. we had weeks of elden ring too. tbh i'm enjoying it but the goty hype seems way way off, it's just a fun dumb little game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"being the owner of a cat who loves to follow me around and post up in spots knowing i'll trip over him, i can confirm it's accurate."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,on the internet nobody knows you are a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"just because a game fills a void in the market doesnt mean its bad it set out to do something specific, and is receiving praise for it. your comment is essentially the same as saying spiderman would be a total failure if not for the big majority of people who adore spiderman why take out the aspect people cherish the most to prove a point?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,probably zero. everyone is doing it for them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"when a game is this interesting and different, you on't have to pay for any social media marketing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i don't think that word means what you think it means.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,do you walk like a nazi?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,admitting to animal abuse on reddit. you're not very smart are you?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i dunno that i'd suggest getting a console just for this game. while it's fun and gorgeous to look at, all the people saying that it only has 56 hours of playtime are correct. if you had a console it's on or a pc i'd say go for it, but unless you've got a list of other games you've been wanting to play on that console you're gonna drop a lot of money for a relatively brief experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's a linear storydriven puzzle game with explorable areas in each chapterzone. you solve puzzles by doing cat things, like scratching things up, knocking things overoff of other things, meowing, jumping on things, hiding in boxes, making barrels roll by walking in them, and carrying small objects in your mouth. in my honest opinion the game isn't perfect, there's some issues with pacing and i think everyone, critics and fans alike, would agree that it's too short. it is absolutely gorgeous though to the point where it's almost harder to get a screenshot of it that doesn't look like a digital painting. it also has a charming story to it that's discovered partially through collection, encouraging exploration of the larger city areas."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"nah don't worry, there's no reason this is in game other than 100 true to life cat behavior."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,ps or pc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,nope
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i mean i hope not. but all the signs are pointing to meow.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,same same
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,the secret is to keep doing it until they die of blunt trauma
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i don't think a cat knows how to play games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i actually had one let me in, and i instantly realized i needed to do something else first, so i instantly turned around to make him let me back out. i hadn't even realized how catlike that was until this comment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,lol i actually did just to make sure i didnt miss anything
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,let me in so i can go out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,did you take the ending to mean that !b12 is still alive and inside the supercomputer?!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,dlc or a sequel showing the cat reunite with the other three cats!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"the game doesn't even need like a dlc or anything, i'd be happy with bluetwelve adding an animated short to the game that !shows the cat reuniting with it's family and the companions finally exploring a zurkfree world as well as b12 letting the cat know that they're still around.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,how much time did you need to get to the ending?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i hope they give us stray2
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i have no idea why they didn't just let you choose one of the 4 cats at the beginning, not like it would have made a difference storywise. not hating, absolutely loved the game just seemed like a strange omission, also they should have let you play that starting chapter once more at the very end in reverse to reunite the cats!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,totally agree! would've loved to do the same with my current or past kitties
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"like in okami, at clear game you could be a lot of breeds of dogs and a couple of colored ones. even a chonky one. would've been great if at the end of the game you'd unlock a few colors at least instead of just changing b12 gear with 100 memories"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,show her the eyeballs
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,omg please let us play on the !post apocalyptic world outside of the city!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"after paying 30 for hours, you want to pay more?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,its a really short game. not a bad thing but if you are broke you might think its a ripoff. 30 for 56 hours. a few parts are that felt meh but overall a solid 810. also the sound design and music was great.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's a short game. 57 hours. very fun, obviously made with love, but also quite short."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,it took me about 6 hours
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,completing the story took me 3 hours at max including talking to all npcs and doing the occasional not all sidequests. 100 completion with side quests and achievements might take 56 hours seeing as one achievement is that you need to sleep for one hour xd
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-15,"i knoow. the ending felt empty, would have liked some closure!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,when playin' jazz you always have a welcome mat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,finally
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,everybody fantasizes about being able to lick their own ass.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,same with scratching things up. i love that the cat things that look fun to do also usually help story progression
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,sold
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,are you talking about the passed out guy inside the bar? the one who's restocking the hats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,if only he was wearing a hardhat...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,are you talking about the passed out guy inside the bar? the one who's restocking the hats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i would always see cats throwing shit just because they can and never understood them. now playing stray i can understand, it's just amazing to drop things for no reason at all, it's glorious."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"this game briefly turns you into a little agent of chaos ok, who can i duck with now?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i didnt give up easily. i tried to trip him at the top of the stairs thinking the bigger fall might release some loot. but he never fell down there. i think they didnt program the extra action of a fall on the stairs, so he cant do it there."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"thought the bot was just going to slowly become more aware of the cat, looking behind him seeing if its still there. eventualy giving it some pets or other acnowledgement before heading on. simple social acnowledgement like that is usaly pretty wholesome in real life so in a game it can really help make things come alive. edit i havent played this game yet, idk how much of what i said applies to it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"this is fair. i'm enjoying the game a lot, but it's not exactly a fully immersive and replayable masterpiece."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i think the most disappointing thing about the game for me was the pacing. the slums are incredibly well crafted, but as you move up through the other levels they start to feel a little more rushed with less stuff to do. it's a beautiful game and amusing to play, and i really wish there was more story to explore, but i'm happy with my purchase for what it is a nice little puzzle story game with a cat as the protagonist"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,how does it compare to untitled goose game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,wish the places you could nap would have done the life is strange thing and let you really take in the mood and scenery to some nice musical backing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"reddit has been jerking off to this game for months simply because cat truth is that beyond that novelty, there isnt that much to offer"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"you very well replied to an ad comment lol. wow! this looks incredible i'm going to buy it right now! by any chance, could any human provide a url to this fantastic looking product?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,than what?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i'd give it a few weeks. they'll fizzle out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i too love interactions!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,really? that's awesome!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,there is
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i'm being completely literal. if there are paint cans or the like near the edge of a surface, pressing triangle will push them off with your little paw."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,you just made my week i think.  thank you!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i'm in!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,there is a clear difference between a cat game and elden ring. and even during ers launch i saw other posts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i think its that the game is 30 and is a handful of hours long with little to no replayability since there isnt much else to do past the main story line. also the story is about dystopian robots enslaved by people. old as fuck nothing original and the story isnt about the cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you mean the people they paid to do it for them?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"well, thats just naive."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,prolly going for integral.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"no, but it seems like you have never walked in your life. here is en explanation, when you walk, you perform an automatic task, your brain just assumes that it can safely move the foot, and since your weight is always on your back foot in case of an unexpected obstacle adrenaline kicks in, your brain tries to lift the foot up and also use your back leg for more force, so basically a punt. you will stumble but won't fall, this is why leg under the table don't magically make people fall unless you put extra force to make them fall, and cat weights basically nothing... it is alot easier to trip someone running."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i dont have a pc

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i know sometimes you get achievements in this game, was wondering if you would get one for scratching on a door to be opened and then just sit there when they do open it. i know a saw one called something like !a little chatty! for !spamming the meow button at a robot?!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,cats are literally gamers.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i def did
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,especially after the buzz in the screens after the cat walks away. smart way to end it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i feel like it could get the same treatment little nightmares had. short but very fresh and charming game with lots of mysteries. what about a dlc with the other cats trying to find their lost brother? or something incredible like the humans did survive, only those in the walled city 99 didn't because of the bacteria?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"the first time i played through it took like 8 hours but that's because i'm the type of person who has to mentally map an entire area to make sure i don't miss any collectable or easter egg. the second time i went through trying to clear achievements and just barely missed the i am speed achievement for completing the game in under two hours. i will say trying to do the speed run has its own charm, kinda gives you that nippedup feeling."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,a lot of people are quoting 56 hours. a streamer i watched took five hours and 6 minutes according to the youtube video he posted but he might have cut out a part or two that i watched live because i thought he was closer to 5306
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,took me 3 hours and 58 minutes and i thought i explored a decent amount
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"well amaterasu is a god, and it was just an endgame achievement. the cat in stray is inspired from one of the devs cat named murtaugh, an ginger tabby that used to be a stray."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i really dont get comments like this. people pay upwards 20 for a movie, more if you count concessions. plenty of small event or short lived experiences for much more yet people like you gotta make yourself look dumb arguing over price to length ratio like anyone actually cares. i see comments like this and think youre either very young or you hit your head too many times."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i got it on playstation extra at no cost. so for that yes i would pay more
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"me daughter and i got through it in 6.57 hours. we didn't get all of the memories or side activities, and definitely spent more time than was necessary in some spots. if you knew where you were going and just kinda ran through the whole game until you reached the end it doesn't seem that difficult to get through it in under 3 hours. i'm probably gonna go back through and try to 100 things, but even if you didn't it fares pretty well on the dollars per hour of entertainment compared to seeing a movie."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,you dont have to be broke to think expensive games are ripoffs.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you can also get your head stuck in a bag and spend a few minutes trying to shake it off. and at the beginning when you first get the backpack you lay down and walk weird and stuff for a while just like real cats do. it just captures c a t so well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"theres also a moment where one bot tells you not to distract another one hes working with, and you can go sit and meow next to the distractable bot and he drops a can of paint a about two stories, making a shop owner bot come out of his shop to clean it, giving you access to the shops interior. im very early in the game but am really liking it. only downside is there's no navigation hud as far as i know and it can be daunting to find your next quest item"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,thats all you need in a game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"!ironically, that was exactly what it was for, to get a hardhat.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i noticed when i was trying to get this clip that he wouldn't do the full fall in tight spaces or anywhere there was an object in front of him, only the partial stumble. seems like they coded it that way to prevent clipping since they don't have animations for falling on an incline or into objects."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i was tripping the guy that walks around the slums and eventually he fell over and didn't get back up. cat murdered a guy. in actuality i think the character glitched into the wall and got stuck
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"they have a lot of other acknowledgement like that on other aspects, but unfortunately not in that one."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,im about to leave the slums and although reading this is a bit of a bummer i still agree that im still happy w my purchase
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i liked the tasks more in untitled goose game. it can be played with 2 players as well. stray has better graphics and some haptic feedback on ps5. but the fact you can play untitled goose game with a friend makes it better imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"ugg is more gameplay, stray is more narratively focused."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"both are kind of easy puzzle games. goose game is more creative, but obviously stray took a lot more work. neither are what i would consider good value for money if you want something to sink substantial time into, but if you're looking for a relaxing zeroconsequences game, i would recommend both"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i think its a very good comparison. both have the incredibly satisfying press button to make animal sound feature, both are short but super fun and memorable. both involve using an animals natural behaviors in clever ways to complete puzzles and achieve goals. partway through stray i commented to my partner this is gonna be just like untitled goose game, where everyone is obsessed with this game for like a week and then forgets it ever happened. the big differences id say 1. styleambiencesetting ugg is cute, bright, cartoony, and looks like normal everyday settings. stray is that cyberpunk dystopian hong tokyo vibe thats so common right now. i get lost a lot in stray, never in ugg. 2. game overs the cat can diegame over idk why this isnt being mentioned more. its not gorey or anything but it still was distressing to me. 3. ugg had more in terms of gameplay aspects and achievements to complete whereas stray is much more narrative driven. stray has some completionist stuff and a handful of gameplay oriented achievements but it almost reminded me of something like life is strange or gone home in terms of how the emphasis is really more on plot slowly unfolding. stray will likely make you a bit misty eyed at points but i dont think goose ever had anything that serious."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"a couple of them do. it zooms in on your lil cat and then slowly zooms out, and a handful of them have accompanying music to go with. if i didn't use wallpaper engine a few of the shots would be my wallpaper right now.httpsimgur.comatsdm3g4"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i made sure to curl up for a nap next to the musician every time i turned in a new piece of sheet music for that same vibe.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's not a lot of game, but it's one hell of a vibe. and sometimes that's what i'm looking for, so it was a hit for me. it's a bit rude to claim that folk that are into that are 'jerking off to it' though. let people like things."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"honestly? yes. cat is all that is needed to make me like this game. they could have had absolutely 0 story and nothing but you running around climbing on things to knock stuff over and scratch everything up and i would have still been sold on it, because i enjoy it on those merits alone. add in the visuals, puzzles and story and it's a cute little game that's fun to play. will i play it forever and ever or get 6000 hours out of my purchase? nope. do i regret playing it? hell no. not every game needs to be an openworld aaa hit with years of replay value and complex gameplay, sometimes a silly little game about cats is enough."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,it's a fantastic linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain. and then you discover connections with those robots while exploring a world that sadly echoes aspects of our own. all while doing fun cat things. i legit cried twice by the end i don't know why some people don't get how some gamers really legit love this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's a cat simulator with a decent story that tugs at the heart a little bit. that's all that ever needed to be. and for a lot of people, that is more than enough. just like there is a lot of people who do not care for a game selling point to be the story, there are a lot of people out there who don't care for the game selling point to be the mechanics of a game. it's perfectly fine that this game is a short one with a focus on a tight story while also being a cat simulator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"but also, this game was going to succeed just based on the trailer alone since the internet loves cats. much of the excitement is genuine. even i love the idea without planning to buy the game anytime soon because i have other things to play and can wait for a sale."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,ad comment the phrase youre looking for is word of mouth.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i agree with the concerns you've laid out here, but i must say that product appeals to me despite the sleazy advertising, if not because."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,than should have went before the rest. thanks professor. now kindly sulk back into your um akshuly discord server.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,this game has officially piqued my interest
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"its a cat game. just like that duck game and sheep game it usually blows up. reddit loves cats, developers probably thought what could make a lot of money with little effort. so this game. then a dog game will come and a thousand more cutesy bullshit that ppl will gobble up because it hits them in their insecure feels."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,ive seen you before you just shit on other games all the time
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"how many games are actually nonderivative narratives at this point in time? how many 60 aaa games can be beaten in 68 hours or less with little replay value? i dont see the point youre trying to make here. this game did something quite new, and gave a new perspective to a type of storygame weve seen before. people just like to hate for the sake of it, and cant be happy. i get it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"yeah lemme tell you buddy, i'm clearly a shill for the cat game. they're paying me in catnip."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"dude, do you know what viral means in the context of the internet? i paid for this game and im spreading all the cat goodness all over every social platform i use. all my friends are spreading it all over the internet. hell, ive been anticipating this game since the first time the gameplay went viral."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,please name another adventure game where you play as a housecat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"no, i meant intuitive, though realizing that gameplay might not be for everyone. most expected cat behavior advances the game. there have been times i just scratched something up or dropped something from a rooftop for fun and it became a storyline. the game runs on visual hints on where to go and what to do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,this is the part in the comment section when it make you remember that you are at reddit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i have nipples, can you milk me greg?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i have nipples greg, would you milk me?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"aye, laddy. then that's alright."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"trigger warning this game has 0 gore, there isn't even real violence. no emote dances, loot boxes, or online multiplayer. shit it cost money! it's not even free!!! and it has a ending?!?!?!  wtf is that shit?  absolutely 0 anime titties females for me to make my waifu. honestly guys avoid this soyboy shit. fml lib fit gamers trying to push walking as a agenda in everything now."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,? what was the point of this comment lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,k
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,that's a big ole who asked?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"ngl this was the very first achievement i got, before !you even fall into the city.! ... did you know you can spam the meow button through most cutscenes?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,color me surprised
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"lol i dont like paying 20 for a movie either. not sure why you assumed i was okay with that either. now that i see youre a reddit psychoanalyst, im done here"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yup. i feel like if it was 20 it would be a better deal but still good.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yeah you can run through it really fast but i spent a lot of time talking to everyone and poking around every nook and cranny.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,you also get an achievement for getting the bag stuck on your head lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"dude that part had me craaaacking up. then just, flop."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"why people have been complaining about this i have seen. however, i believe that is actually a good thing for the role play as a cat. because, as a cat, you are never lost. you're exactly what you need to be at the right time. even if you have no idea where you need to be at what time. you'll figure it out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i'm glad it doesn't, they give you context through narrative and environment"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"holy shit is that how i progress? i fucking catted around the city for so long trying to figure out how to get to that big sign. on second thought, dont tell me. im having too much fun being a car. mroow!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,b12 can give you hints if you ask and meowing usually highlights a direction you should go.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you need to get rid of the spaces the the spoiler formatting to work.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"speaking of glitches, i just had a glitch where i walked out of an apartment and there was a leg stocking and a cloak hanging in space, not animated or being worn, just hanging there. it was still there after a game reload, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"will i play it forever and ever or get 6000 hours out of my purchase? nope. do i regret playing it? hell no. not every game needs to be an openworld aaa hit with years of replay value and complex gameplay, sometimes a silly little game about cats is enough. it was a great gaming experience for my daughter and i that happened to line up perfectly with a few afternoons that were just too hot and uncomfortable to do anything outside. if i put a total of 1012 hours into the game by the time i finish a second playthrough getting all the memoriesbackstory, i'll consider it a great use of 30."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"you are absolutely entitled to love this game, but that doesnt mean that reddit hasnt jerked off to this game since it was announced"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i get that ads are posted a lot on reddit but i think people are genuinely underestimating how much people like cats and want to play a game like this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"since the internet loves cats. eeeyup. i dont play many single player games bc i like to play games w friends, but i immediately bought this game on steam cause i wanna get high and play as a cat. that sounds like a great time"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"absolutely, my wife and i are playing through the game and it's very fun. people are going to be excited and there is a lot of natural excitement. doesn't change the fact though that a lot of comments are artificial and warning people to consider what they are reading sometimes with a little bit of caution doesn't hurt. if you read something and think it might come across like an ad, it very well might be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,everybody is baffled by the fact that the devs know some cat behaviour that every cat owner knows.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i think the full phrase would be artificial word of mouth.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,you can then run through the paint and leave temporary trails of colored pawprints
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i dont just shit on games. but i get what you mean. i shit on games that i believe are predatory or if i disagree with a point. people do that on here. its reddit. in either case and to your point though, it really isnt adding anything sometimes, so i will try to cool it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"those aaa 60 for 10hr games suck too. i didnt say aaa is better. i am saying the reason some people including myself dont like this game at this price point and it is too derivative of a topic thats been beat to shit and the one thing seperating it is pretty lackluster. on top of that, you have games coming out at 30 that offer hundreds of hours of replayability."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-29,"i have not played stray and have no opinion, but your reasoning is dubious at best. essentially, you are saying that most games are overpriced and mediocre, so you should not point out when a game is mediocre and overpriced."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,what do this game added that is new and different?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i don't understand how internet veterans like gamers are surprised by the popularity of cat content on the internet.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,hah that's great
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yeah its probably a bit too much to fit your weekly allowance.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"a cat is never late, nor are they early."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,ultimately i am too. it does make exploration more enticing but i do get antsy and want at some point to have my way shown if i cant figure it out lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"weird, it showed it working on my side text is all censored."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,sure. i'm just saying there is more to the game and it's not just a shallow novelty
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i messaged my partner on slack today with you can get a trophy for napping for an hour and they replied starting the download now.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i remember seeing this game on imgur a loooong time ago, like 5 years ago in user sub, i don't even think it had a name, i think this game had much more humble beginnings than what you're trying to convey"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,ok and im not arguing everyone should like it. i just think its sad people have to go out of their way and complain over something theyve already made their mind up about. let cat people enjoy the cat game. it doesnt affect either of you in our thread here to do so.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,sir this is a wendy's
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"you know if you suspect people are bots or secret advertising you can click on their profiles to see what kind of things they post, right? they're usually super obvious. everything i've posted has been my own oc, including this clip. hell my most upvoted post prior to this one was a crocheted hamburger pincushion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"i have seen exactly zero content for this game in the last few days, that wasnt created by people that are playing it and enjoying it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,this is a bot that copies a different comment and replyscomments it again to karma farm
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"really out of place warninglist about the games mechanics, length, and such. criticism is fine, but this dude was being more of a party pooper who was clearly upset this game is popular or that people could even enjoy it period."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,theres actually already a mod that replaces the meow with jason!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,you got what you meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,ohhh cleverrrrr go outside. 121k comment karma. imagine working that hard for nothing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"huh, it must just be rif then, it looks fine on the reddit app."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i just got that one yesterday! was actually kind of peaceful with the calm music and quiet purring just going on in the background
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yeah my advice for people who don't want to see posts about commercial products would be to avoid a subreddit that is entirely dedicated to a type of consumer product.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,no.. there's other fitting subs sure but that's not accurate.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"oh shit my bad, can i get a frosty?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"im not saying you specifically, but theres a ton of people posting about how great the game is without anything specific. i havent heard about any gameplay at all. just that you okay as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,it was satire. edit oh that was you. the previous comments been deleted so i didn't notice that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i bothered you that much for you to go through my history? lmao yeah that tracks. also didnt you say you were done here?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"the gameplay is being a cat though. you solve puzzles by climbing on top of things, scratching things, crawling inside barrels and boxes, knocking things over and meowing. for some people, myself included, that's enough to be enjoyable and found memeworthy. i understand the appeal isn't for everyone, but i just wish people would let others enjoy things."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"the world is what i loved the most in this game, the cozy cyberpunk atmosphere is unmatched."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i want a expanded version that has more town to explore and no monsters
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,fuck now im crying again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i know im late but meow!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i remember getting it when it first came out. i bought it for myself, but then my son got really into it. he played through it several times. even learning the glitches. and instead of calling those things zurks, he called them jerks!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"stray is a 1010 video game. it is magical how they pulled off the amazing post cyberpunk grunge graphics, gameplay, and story perfectly. the npc's and ambiance make me want to just chill with them for a few hundred years."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,awesome game! i'm still trying to beat it in under 2 hours
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"the thing i hate most about this game is its length. i was like i want to be a cat for longer. game was like nope, thats all you get."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,absolutely loved this game. gf wanted to get a cat after playing it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"as much as i love cats, this game was really underwhelming. the gameplay is pretty minimal, and so is your ability to affect the world. sure you can knock over some individual pots, but you could do that in hl2, twenty years ago. climbing looks impressive until you realize you're just holding a in the direction you want to go and autopilot the rest. really the only thing this game has going for it is a nonverbal cat pov character, but you have so few options to actually do car things that it makes me wonder what's the point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i loved this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i just started playing it today!! i am loving it so much.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,would've loved the game if it didn't felt like it was in assist mode all the time
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"you can't never be late for a game, at least with single player games. i know it's normalised to preorder games and play them on launch even if they are ridiculously broken. but playing old games is perfectly fine, and you will save money on the process as well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"got this on switch weeks ago. so, i'm with you on this op."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,the gameplay is too simple for me to enjoy it but i like the setting and art style
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"the cat doesnt even do cat things, theres only one walk animation so if theres a can in the way it doesnt high leg step over the can avoiding contact, it just walks through it and repels the can away like with a forcefield. this game is ass."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i don't quite get why anyone likes this game it felt like a rip off for it's small price. i played through 100 in about 3 hours and due to how short the game was i felt zero connection to anything whatsoever . i feel there is a limit to how short a game can be before it has no emotional feelings to it and i easily get emotional from games in general if i've really invested time in them but each to their own of course.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,im waiting for it to hit 15. it looks great but im not paying over that to play as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,"i think this christmas i'll skip it for another game i think i'll like more, but it will be the next on the list for sure"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,amazing game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,"it's on my wishlist. i have a minor obsession with kowloon walled city, which inspired the layout. fascinating in its gritty will to survive, y'know? just the thing for the cyberpunk future."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,i really enjoyed this game. obviously because i love cats and own an orange myself. the puzzles were fun and doing little cat things were cute. people hate on it because it was so short but that made it a nice treat. i hope there's a second one in the future. i can't believe it took them this long to do a game like this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,the vibes of this game are immaculate. the music and the slums area especially have soul.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-20,never late to experience this amazingly unappreciated game. i hope you love it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-21,really nice game with a perfect run time. the guitar robot can play some catchy tunes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-24,i came late to this game as well but i enjoyed it so much more than i thought i would. i just impulse bought it and was glad i did.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"great game, perfect length for a fun quick adventure, but quite a bit of side stuff and hidden things to find. i really enjoyed it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,i have so many photos and videos of my two cats sitting and watching the tv as i played.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,still remember the chills i had when encountering zurks for the first time. disgusting! and i cried like a baby in the end.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,oh my gosh! this was one of my all time favorite games. does anyone know if there is any talk of there being a stray 2?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,nobody's ever late for good gaming.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"this game has been on my backlogs since it came out, i only started playing it yesterday, must say, even though i went in the game with no expectations, it's nothing like what i was expecting."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,such an amazing game. pretty sure the only one i've ever played that made me cry
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"lost my cat some time ago, she got hit by a car. decided to play this game because i missed my fluffball, loved the game, story progressed to the part, cried again like never before."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i waited and waited for this game, as i'm on xbox and got it the day it came out. i'm so surprised i didn't hear more about this. this game is super fucking chill and cozy and the music in ambience is like none other. i wish as a cat i could explore the entire city just remove those damn parasites. my fingers are crossed we get a sequel or something."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,really a masterpiece isnt it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i was always wondering why this game is quite often labeled as a horror game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i have anxiety attacks playing this game cos i dont wanna my kitty to get hurt
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i loved this game but there was not enough breadth to it in my opinion. once you do the story and all the memories there is almost nothing else to explore.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"this has been on my list for a long time, how good is it? i haven't bought it and can't find it at my local library to play but honestly i just want to see how my 3 cats react to it lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i really wish stray had character customisation because i'd love to play the game as my real life cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,never too late for cyberpunk cat game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i loved this game, everything about this game was so good. i really hope they make a sequel."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"the game is really cool cute idea, addictive gameplay where you alternate between activity and simple exploration waiting for part 2"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"started playing it in august, stopped midgame for some reason and now i am continuing it. great game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,rpatientgamers
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,nice to hear huge cats are cyberpunk fans too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,the graphics are surprisingly good. took a few screenshots to post here in a small gallery eventually
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,amazing game and the coziest city design i have ever seen in a video game! i read somewhere that the developers based the design off the kowloon walled city in china which was apparently very densely populated.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"becareful of zurks, they are as cute as lethal"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"made me cry like a baby at the end. you really feel the sense of pride and hope after !conquering that downtrodden city, going behind the scenes, bringing back the light again,! and on to your next journey back to your family."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,love this game! ive played it twice now and both times were awesome. first time through i never figured out how to run
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,i wish there was more. i love that game so much
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"love the game. but i just cannot bring myself to see our feline friend get devoured by those little fuckers, so i make it invincible with some cheats..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"man, the fomo mentality is crazy for you to think you're late to a game that came out a little less than two years ago. but yes, great game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"ive played through it twice, heard about it but had to wait till it made it to xbox. first time to go through the story, second time to complete all of the accomplishments and just explore. great game, good for young teens but may be a bit intense for preteens."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i couldn't play, the opening scene with the cat falling down and losing his friends made me too sad"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i havent quite finished it yet and i love the visuals and music. i do think the gameplay is sort of clunky and leaves something to be desired. great vibes though, certainly worth checking out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,ugh so good but too short.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i got my copy but i need to wait for xmas! better late than never!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i was so excited for this when it first came out but i was never able to play through it. we had to put our car down the week before and when i first turned the game on i cried and had a hard time keeping it together. i'll get back to it one day.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,this game is a masterpiece and gives a different vipe
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,super fun game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,wow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,ah yes the game that i keep forgetting that i have in my pc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,i want so bad for them to do an anthology series. all in the same world but different locations and animals.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,i really like it when the cat looks back at the camera and its eyes catch light like you would see with real cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"yeah, i cant stand cats a menace to nature so this game is not for me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"maybe a dlc where the cat wakes up a abandoned robot, and u need to find out who switched u off. and at the end u can go up and actually see the outside world this time"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"it's mever late for cat, cat, cat!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,while i would like to be able to support the developers because ive heard so many good things about it i hope it is free on epic some day. thats probably the only way i will play it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"same, and the npc's are so chill"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,the world they created is just sublime
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,i love that i can just relive chapters. have the sleeping cat as a wall paper while im afk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,part 2! we can do fetch quests for all the now freed robots and help them solve other issues in the city. with our group of cats that will have a cozy home in the city.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,you mean like an open world type. well i want too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,the ending of the game absolutely wrecked me. i just sort of sat there for a good few minutes. we went all that way...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i found the ending really hopeful.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"the speedrun achievement wasn't that hard actually, for me at least but i also used a youtube guide video. however the achievement for not being bitten by the small grabbers in the chase sequence.. boy i that was hard"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"i found the game frustrating at points because it's quite linear and there's always a very specific next task that you have to achieve, but there were a few times where it's not at all obvious where to go or what to do and i found myself kind of looping around the map a lot just trying to brute force some progress. the environments are really visually busy and complex which exacerbates the problem. great art and vibes, and i get the appeal, but i personally found it somewhat boring and frustrating in the end."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,the world they made is great and personally i liked the gameplay outside of the infection sections.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i agree, the game looks like just a glorified walking sim imo and tbh,most people probably just enjoy it just because there is a cute cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"agreed, it's kinda a let down of a game leaning heavily on the love of cats, which i definitely have. i would never begrudge someone for enjoying it, but i'm glad to see we're past the point where reddit was clamoring for it to be named game of the yeardecade."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,i got it in the recent steam sale
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"ugh, i've been wanting to play this game for a while now. i have an old orange that means the world to me. i guess i'll take the game off my wishlist at this point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-19,"ok, downvote me all you want, cat never dies in my book."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"yeah, same."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,mmmmidontpractice catteria
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"i'd buy that and play it in a heartbeat. the devs nailed cat behavior and the physical ability of cats agility, crawling through small spaces, etc. i loved playing as our little orange cutie and doing cat things along the way like knocking stuff over, scratching the ps5 haptic feedback made that so satisfying, napping in cozy spots, and of course, jumping onto the chess board to ruin the game lol we need more!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,this is the way...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"i want to dig through places, find stuff for the bots, and maybe a bonus for knocking over everything i can"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,played through this with my 8 year old... she was not okay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"and they don't even just force you to the next part, they leave you there with b12 until you're ready. cheesy as hell but it took me awhile"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,at least there is hope he found his family httpsyoutu.beteoeczzqhbo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"shit, i lost it on the first level when you got separated from the rest of the litter."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"i made the big mistake of hitting the 'meow' button during this scene, and it somehow made it even sadder."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"yeah, maybe don't post end game spoilers on a thread about someone playing the game for the first time ffs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,it did end on a hopeful note. still a sad story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,that chase was hard. took me a few tries. i'm on that last bit in the prison yard
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,i played this game with my 3yo sitting in my lap. he freaking loved it. by the time i tried for the 2 hour achievement i had put about 60 hours into the game and had every corner memorized. i did it in 1 hour 37 minutes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"it is fun for a while, but nowhere near goty or most innovative gameplay that people kept touting. it doesn't do anything particularly new or exciting, but it does have a cat, which i guess is enough for people who haven't played a lot of creative videogames."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"just for the sake of clarity, the cat is fine. it's a sad ending, but no kitties were harmed in the making of that sadness."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,imagine a cozy apartment that the cat can customize lol. stuff like that would be crazy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,yeah not really fit for that age. there's another game called little cat big city thats different in that there's no adult themes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"was thinking of getting this for my 9 year old, purely based on the fact you can play a cat. without any major spoilers, can you give any indication of why the game ending might be traumatic? i'd rather avoid if it's going to cause more pain than fun"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"played it with mine, he loved it. got a little freaked out at that tunnel with the eyeballs, and he was sad at the end, but on the levels of any good movie. i hear you though. playing brothers with my older son was a mistake though. 0"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,yeah that would be a lot to deal with as an 8 year old and you'd not see it coming.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"what next, make her read the warriors series?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,you had over 2 years to play it. not my fkn problem you didnt play it. get over it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,you had over 2 years to play it. not my fkn problem you didnt play it. get over it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,its kind of a modern take on an old school lucasartssierra adventure game. i think it stands out because modern games are all open world sandboxes and stray refreshingly isnt. but thats also why some people dont like it it seems.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,little kitty big city!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"i'll preface this with the fact i have an extremely empathetic child. she loved the game and would play it again... it's more sad than anything, but my daughter reacts strongly to seeing others in grief. the game is appropriate for the age."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"its just a really nice, but somber, game. the whole thing is set sometime after humanity destroyed itself, so theres just an underlying melancholy to it. its not relentless or anything, but depending on how much your kid has thought about the big stuff it may inspire some questions you might not have been ready to answer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"if your 9yo loves cats, i would steer toward little kitty big city. more comedic and lighthearted."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"there are some spooky little critters that will stick to the cat like suction cups and hurt the cat, as well as some drones that might zap the cat too, for what its worth. none of this is graphic at all but might cause some amount of stress, maybe ? the ending is about as bad as any sad moment in a pg movie so you dont need to worry too much about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,yeah it was litterally just the ending with b12 that did it. she thought the eyes were funny. lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,brothers was an amazing game. one of my favourites.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-18,"2 years is a very short time if youre also fully employed, have other comittments, and maybe some other games already in your queue. so, no, posting endgame spoilers is just a general nogo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,that's the one!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"great thanks! my daughter is also quite empathetic, so i'll have a think about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,she loves little kitty big city!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"oh absolutely, it was brilliant. just a little much for my son for several reasons. i didnt realize how heavy the ending was."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,"has she dealt with the concept of loss and what that means? or does she at least understand it? that's about the kind of heaviness you can expect through the game's story and world. it's a prevailing theme, so i don't think it's too much to say."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,the ending made my wife and i cry and i'm in my 30s so ? it's hard to explain without spoilers. it's age appropriate. the ending is just sad but also happy in a way. it's bittersweet.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-12-17,meow too. high paw!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its fine. its probably around 10 hours tops. its quite simple but exploring as a cat has a charm to it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its a fun game. interesting story, cool environments, good amount of exploration, and even some light puzzles and combat. the game itself is fairly short. probably less than or around 8 hours for a playthrough. if youve always wanted to play a game as a cat though its a must buy for sure."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"at 20 it is a good buy imo. it's not hard, it's definitely not complex or deep in terms of gameplay, it's just a game where you play a cat in a strange world seeking friends and answers. it has mild puzzle, stealth, and combat, sections, but mostly about exploration. x200b if you go in looking for some profound and challenging experience you will be disappointed. x200b if you go in looking for a heartfelt game where you get to be a cat you will get you 810 hours of enjoyment and feel happy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it has a very cool cyberpunkish vibe and if you like cats, its extra cozy imo. not a long game, but still a good time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its more like a visual novel to me. you talk to robots, you bring them things they need. it even got some tears out of me. there are also puzzles and stealth parts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"imo a good quality game is not meassured by how many hours do you get out of it. one of my personal favorite games is fire watch it's about 6 hours long but such a great game. visuals, sound design, story, everything is really cool. also the game does feel longer than it is actually"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"stay imo is exactly what its advertised as a fun little cat game. the mixed reviews imo mostly came from people thinking it was going to be some mind blowing game of the year epic or something, versus the reality that it was a cute little cat simulator. hell, when it released it was only 30 because they knew it was a short and simple game. it took me around 10 hours or so and is well worth it. its not mind blowing but its a fun and pretty unique little game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's not super long but it's cute. my cat was super interested in the cat on screen, and kept trying to sneak up on it, but would bolt when i turned it to face him. if you like cats you will probably like the game, but if you are strictly a dog person you might not be as charmed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i thought it was great, didnt understand the hate. it was a cute, simple, straightforward game that had a satisfying finish and gorgeous graphics. definitely no replayability, but its good to experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,novelty of playing a cat thats about it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"no, its pretty boring just moving forward and hitting x the entire game. people just liked it because kitty. the environmental storytelling is good though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's just a walking simulator...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's one of those games that absolutely wouldn't have gotten any attention, but it initially launched as an exclusive for the ps5 so it got a lot of praise and more of a spotlight for that simple fact see death loops 1010 reviews for another example. it's honestly nothing to write home about"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i really did not care for it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i had a lot of fun with it. i believe i spent about 6 hours on it. i'm not sure of the replayability, but i had a good time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"if it wasn't about a cat it would be dismissed by most people, so just ask yourself if that piece of it would bring you enjoyment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,overhyped its cute but boring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i bought it as a cat lover and the idea that i could play as a cat in the game. had no idea at the time about the robot stuff. i was perfectly content being a cat seperated from my family trying to make it back home. there was a certain level of endorphins released while playing. brought my blood pressure down the little of it i played
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's overrated, and boring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,fantastic. made me realise how i much i wanted to play as a cat in a video game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's decent, but it was waaay overhyped just because lol u can be a cat, so random"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's boring. the main thing that pushed it was twats going omg kitties
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its the same thing over and over.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,the game is 5 hours long on average. people who say that it's 10 hours are probably expecting you to play it twice or something lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i thought it was great fun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,610 but i loved every nyano second of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"good fun, not super long it's not really an action game a few action sequences, so just make sure you want an atmospheric exploration game with light puzzling."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"extremely overrated. first hour or so you should really enjoy, but then you realise there's not much about it unless you want to finish the story or just enjoy lazily exploring a city as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i had to stop playing because my cat was getting too confused by the cat noises.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,great game. i played it for 10 minutes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its surprisingly meh.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i loved it. its short. i think 812 hours. being a cat is dope.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i think most of the hate stemmed from it having meme energy on the internet, and that fueled the attention more than the quality of the game. i remember it making top five lists for the year for a lot of categories. while i think it's novel, and a good experience, it is not so great that i would consider it a mustplay for that year it came out. i could see that backfiring and attracting a more varied audience for a niche game  and as such  attracting more negative reviews. however, it has a unique feel  and so if you're looking for a pallet cleanser, it might scratch that itch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its charming but like if it wasnt omg cat  people would be able to see its kind a meh game that takes 8 hours tops and its just ok. if you can get it cheap, its great. but i think the people that spent 30 overpaid"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's pretty good, nothing incredible but good. i'm just kinda unreasonably salty it won indie awards over say tunic. feel like it got weirdly high mileage out of you playing as a cat"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"if stray didnt have a cat as the protagonist, nobody wouldve played it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,it's kind of like myst in a lot of ways. i think you'll like it more than you'd think.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i found it boring, couldnt play it beyond a few hours. the cat mechanics are clever and really well done, its just a shame they didnt put the same effort into the world they built."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,my wife and i both enjoyed it greatly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's very okay. free was a fine price.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"no, it's 5 hours. it's a walking simulator from a cats perspective with a press a to progress and nothing happens. it's atmospheric at least, but that's about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"very mid tbh i got bored about 2 hours in but i can kinda see why people like it, esp if you're a cat person which i'm not lmao"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i kinda hated it. i found it a mostly boring puzzle game that makes you waste your time. there are some fun alan wake style action sequences but not enough for my taste. it may be one of my least favorite games actually.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"stray is a short game but tells a cute little story without narration, it is a game to experience as a short experience and is touching in a heartwarming way."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i was so excited for the game when it was frost announced. a puzzledetective game where you play as a cat? awesome. what we got instead was a mediocre platformer with poor excuses for puzzles. it was about 4 hours of boredom for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i loved my time with it, and felt sad at the end that i was leaving. its like a point and click adventure really, full of charm though. the music is fantastic too, was plenty of times when id just vibe out with some bleep funk on the radio. id recommend if you like indie games, cyberpunk, robots or cats in any ratio."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i liked it. not the most robust or challenging game you'll ever play, but it's got an interesting story and some good production value. the puzzles are clever, but shortlived. pacing is a little random. overall it's a great game to get on sale, but don't be surprised if you're left feeling like your meal could have been a little larger."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"neat concept, but i got bored after about an hour"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i didnt love it as much as others seem to. i really enjoyed the first hour or so where its mostly about just being a cat  exploring, leaping about and so on. no game has let me do that before and i was really liking it. but then as it goes on it introduces combat and stealth sections, and i lost huge amounts of interest at those points  ive played a thousand combat and stealth games before and those elements felt completely unnecessary in stray. it just felt to me like the developers had a great angle for a unique experience, but then couldnt help but make it as videogamey as they could. id rate it 610, because i did like it enough to finish it, but it just didnt hit the spot for me that it seems to have for others."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i love cats. i have owned many cats. my gf and i have 2 cats. this game was boring af  still love cats. they're better irl
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it was a pleasant experience that wasn't expected. played it on psplus but never fished it kid preferred to use it as a cat petting simulator but it looked and played great.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,maybe 9 to beat it. was amazing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,there is nothing good about this game beyond the novelty of playing as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i was glad i played it after i was done. it was adorable and my cat really enjoyed it also
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"one of my all time favorites to be honest. visually the most gorgeous game i've ever seen im personally a sucker for the naturecyberpunk aesthetic and though simple, the story kept me really engaged"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"youre asking the wrong question. its not about quantity of hours. its about the quality of those hours. as with any game ymmv in that regard. for some it was a monumental experience. for me it was a good time with a nice story that didnt overstay its welcome, which was about ten hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"very chill interactive experience tier puzzles. like 10 hours as others stated. i played it in like 5 sessions and found it worth my time, though a bit unmemorable."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its a fun game with cool aesthetics, but i couldn't help feeling like they could have done a lot more with the concept."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it has a good atmosphere, but the story and the gameplay will disappoint if you have big expectations... it's a fine game, but that's it. you ask how many hours i got out of it, well, personally kind of wish the game would have been a bit shorter"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-06,"i loved it, but i didn't play it to make it to the end as fast as possible. fundamentally it is a puzzlewalkingadventure game with not very difficult challenges, combined with moderately tricky actionescape sequences a number of which i had to play multiple times before figuring out how to make it through. the real joy of the game is not in the figuring things out, it is allowing yourself to relish the world it presents which is beautifully rendered and slowly learn the story of what is going on. the cat is rendered and behaves in a delightfully catlike way. if you enjoy the atmosphere, the catness of it, and the emotional story, and give yourself time to take it in, then you'll enjoy the game. i took it in a leisurely fashion, tried to complete as many of the side quests as possible, and reached the end in about 12 hours. i found the end to be beautiful and moving."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i loved it. didn't have any pre conceptions but it was one of the best games i played this year. as others have said it is pretty short but well worth getting.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"as a video game doing video gamey things, it's not that special. but as a 'cat walking around for 10 hours' experience, it's amusing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,very fun little game. i recommend it to every cat lover lmao. i've got a plat in less than 8h.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i really liked the game. i had about 10 hours playing it but was really in no rust to finish. i tried to see where i could nap and explore all of the corners. its a fun and enjoyable experience to hang out in, but if you are out to beat it the game would probably get thin quickly. as a side note, theres not much replayability to it, but i really want to go back there. i would love them to release an update or dlc thats just catn around the map with lots of stuff to knock over or looking for the best sunny spots to nap. sometimes, an hour of chilling out as an orange cat is the sim i really want."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,10 to 12 hours and i thought it was amazing. i want a stray 2 open world game now. moar kittah!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i loved it. it's 1015 hours or so. i enjoyed the story. it's simple gameplay. you're a cat after all.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,loved it. ended up getting all the achievements in it too cause it was so fun.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"for a cat person, stray got such cute little detail that they can relate, and that amplify the experience they have playing it. its more like a one time experience game, with little to none replaybility. yet, the few hours spent in this game is worth it. would highly recommend if you are a cat person op. would also recommend if you like chill short games. wouldnt recommend if you have grudge against cats in general."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i found it touching
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i really enjoyed it! as an adventure game it's nice and simple with an interesting investigation plot with a cool art style. if you can get it cheap it's a worthwhile play.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i liked the game.played it for around 10 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's pretty boring and i dropped it after an hour.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,no. it's cute and charming but really shallow and over in about five hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"the idea seemed cool at first but the novelty wore off after about 4 hours. i finished it once, won't be revisiting it. it's an ok adventure game with puzzle solving."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its a massive disappointment relative to the high reviews it got but a good time if you go in with realistic expectations. id say its a 7.5 with  0.5 margin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's a good game, i think it's worth the full price imo so if you get it discounted then definitely. i played through it once and got 12 hours out of it according to steam."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it looks nice but gameplay it a bit so so. it's basically a modern take on a point and click adventure game with ok game design. if that is something you'd be interested in and if you like cats you'll probably love the game. it has great atmosphere and good esthetic design.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's a neat little 1015 game depending on how good you are at puzzles and how often to stop to look at stuff. 1010 one of my all time favorite games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's barely a game. more of a walking simulator. if you're into that and cats then you might get something out of it, personally i would say go spend your money elsewhere."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,no it's not it has no gameplay realy to speak off and it took me less than three hours to get the platinum blind it was a joke this was a game of the year contender lol don't waste admittedly a very small amount of time on this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,ive played it a couple of times probably more than 30 hours for fun and speedrun practice. its a fun game with a neat story. i love playing it over and over. do recommend giving it a try.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i think its a good game. i was invested in the world and was keen to uncover the story. probably 812 hrs?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its a great wind down at night game. its pretty short though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,yeah its good and short.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's a very good game, probably 10hrs top to finish it. i played it over a weekend, and got all of the achievements except one. there's an achievement for completing the gangs in 2hrs, which after playing it i almost tried because if you know where to go and what to do it seemed like a very manageable achievement to get. just never tried to get it. if you can get it on sale for less than 20 totally worth it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its not very good. its uncharted with a cat and the whole gameplay is just pressing x
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i have 7h of playtime and finished it while a exploring a good bit but i very much enjoyed it and dont feel like it was a waste of money.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i loved it. its a short game, but a fun and entertaining ride."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i wasn't a fan personally. the gameplay is kinda cool and they absolutely nailed the expressiveness of the cats my cats literally would not leave the tv alone the whole time i played, they thought real cats were in the tv. there's some cool environmental puzzles, some cool collection stuff, a lot of meaningless missables. but the story... absolutely killed the experience for me. without spoiling anything, the game was very much teased as a sort of cozy cat adventure in a futuristic cyberpunk world but the story focuses way less on the cozy cat adventure and almost entirely on hamfistedly jamming political views down your throat with a cyberpunk backdrop. i wanted to have fun in a futuristic adventure world as a sharpy animated cat. instead i got about 10 hours of dae think late stage capitalism will inevitably lead to fascism and the apocalyptic downfall of humanity??? isn't capitalism horrible???? guys??? guys??? hey did you know capitalism is bad???? guys???? i fucking get it, i don't care and i dont need to be reminded every single dialogue, i just want to get this cat back to his friends  the ending is also !painfully sad. fair warning.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i liked the aesthetic and the people quite a bit. i'm not a cat person whatsoever and i enjoyed the one playthrough.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i lost interest after an hour and never went back. i think the game is less than 5 hours long.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"if i remember correctly it's like 8 hours. it was pleasant, a vibe, and i liked the story and world. definitely worth i'd say like 30. certainly a novel gaming experience. basically ac with a cat. i don't really understand the outsized vitriol the game got. it's a solid made game with a fun twist. wish there were more like it. the only gripe i had was the rat popping light minigame in the first major level. felt unnecessary. just being a cat running around was way more fun than that kind of action filler bullshit used to make idiots feel like something is exciting when the setting itself is evocative enough."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i finished it in 22.4 hours, which is much less than i expect to get out of most games, but it was worth it. for this type of game, i would compare it to the cost of going to a movie theatre."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i put 29.2 hours into it. but i think a good chunk of thst might have been sittingsleeping in various spots. or my kid just panning the camera around the cat and making it meow. did i mention theres a dedicated meow button?!?!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its a very fun unique game. if its cheap on sale i say get it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it was cute and fun. the puzzles weren't terribly difficult but still enough to make you scratch your head. it felt good to finish, wasn't a long game by any means, but there's lots of unwritten side stuff you can do and explore. doesn't need a sequel but did really show off the cat controls"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"holds a special place in my heart as the first game i played after an unexpected hospital stay and emergency surgery where i was away from my wife and home for 3 weeks. sure we completed it in like 10 hours, but i loved every second"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"fun game. took about 10 hours. good exploring, graphics and environments. meow button is cool."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a fantastic 1010 game in my opinion. great atmosphere, great story, fun gameplay. only problem is, it's short. i have, i think 20 hours in it, over two playthroughs. once as a blind playthrough, and once as a guided playthrough to find all the secrets and get all the achievements. if you like cats, it's absolutely 100 worth it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its more of an experience than a game. only took me 5 hours to beat it playing casually and focusing on story
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it was fun to play with my wife, who doesn't normally like to play games with me. i would let her play until things got a little dicey, then she'd pass me the controller to get through it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"if you go into it with the expectation of playing a cat as it wanders through a cyberpunk city, what i recall it being advertised as, youll get that for the first third of the game. it shifts to become something different for the rest of the playtime however. if you approach it as a weird dystopian story from an outsiders perspective, its not bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i think it was a short game, i wanna say 46 hours? that's if you do everything like collectibles and trophies. it's even more fun if you have a cat. i spent a good 15 minutes making the cat in the game meow and confusing the hell out of my real cat lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,there's a meow button.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i finished it twice
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's objectivley bad gameplay. the biggest pro is cat and it really doesn't offer much more then the feeling. but if you really love cats it's probably a good game. i say that as a person who likes cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,one of the best indie games ive ever played
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i couldn't finish it. i found it very boring.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,not bad. i got a good 20 minutes out of it before i returned it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its a cute game. the environments are interesting and fun to explore there isnt much exploration to be had but still cool to look around and the gameplay, while very barebones feels great. i dont know what fairly cheap is but for 20 or less its definitely worth playing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i loved it. everybody knows it as the cat game but it's actually one of the best entries in the cyberpunk genre in recent years.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i was pretty bored but it was cute at times.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i got it on playstation plus, its a good game but i wouldnt spend more than 2530 on it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i was disappointed by how short it was. didn't find the ending satisfying either
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,what did googleyoutube say?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i found it to be boring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,"gameworld made me ponder what had happened in the past. if you are into environmental storytelling, i personally think the gameworld was wonderfully crafted."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,length  doesnt  dictate  quality
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"the game has amazing world building, fun mechanics that don't overstay their welcome, a solid show don't tell storyline. i'd rate it a 1010. it's short, but you get a lot out of it. one of my favourite gaming experiences of all time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,very short. its an enjoyable game and one of the few to get the waterworks going but my platinum was about 6 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's short, but was a decent exploration experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i found it enjoyable, but there's very little replay value"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's fine. it was maybe 68 hours. i certainly wouldn't want it to be any longer.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i beat in 9 hours total. it's a good game, can't say i didn't enjoy it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i have 5.5 hours on steam in 1 playthrough with 50 of the achievements but i think i actually saw everything in those hours, i just didnt scratch the carpets or walls enough to get more achievements. i would only buy on sale though for like 20 bucks"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,where are you getting it cheap second hand?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it was fun for a bit. i got really bored halfway through and by the time i wanted to play again it was removed from the free games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,played about 4 hours of it. was fun for a bit just chillin catting around being a cat but haven't gone back. glad it was free though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"yeah, it's a pretty basic twist on a traditional point and click adventure game. fun, you won't get more than a day or two out of it, and there isn't much replayability."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i really enjoyed it, but it is fairly short. about 79 hours. if you have a playstation, you can just get a month of ps plus and play it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,mixed reviews? you gotta stop paying attention to whoever you're paying attention to then.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"around 7. i enjoyed it, cool atmosphere, nice story, beautiful environment. made me cry like a baby."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,got like 16 hours for the plat. it's a delight.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"to know the shortness, i would say that you can speedrun it in under 2 hours by just playing the game again. i'm honestly surprised more people don't have the speedrun achievement. i really enjoyed it. i thought it was a laid back game, but it is visually beautiful"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's good, around 6.5 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its honestly a good time. they really nailed the cyberpunk dystopia atmosphere. story is pretty decent also. not very long, you can finish in under 10 hours"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it was enjoyable. i platinumed it mainly because it was easy to do so. i had fun. got it for free on a monthly games deal but something i would pay over 20 for.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,play it and then watch creator.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,took my 9yo son 8.5 hours to beat it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i personally liked it but i can see that it wouldn't be for everybody.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"loved it  felt different, had an engaging world design. the only thing i didnt do was the speed run trophy. it was a bit annoying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i think my first play through was about 810 hours. to get all the trophies was about 2024 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its fun but trying to get the trophies pissed me off. overall a cute game, nothing amazing though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,played the story in 5 hours. didn't get all side things collected so could probably push 24 hours more trying to get them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's a very short game. cute, but short. i actually don't like short games though. i liked it, but it was over way too early."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,pretty sure its on game pass and psplus
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"if you get the platinum, probably 1012 hours. if you do one playthrough its only about 46 hours, depending on how much you explore the details. its a great deal if you find it on discount"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i liked it, its very cozy and bittersweet"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i enjoyed it. a good looking puzzle style game that is non stressful and has a story. i enjoyed it but i'm the 100 percent when i play discovery games guy so i got around 20 hours out of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"if you enjoy a nice postapocalyptic world to explore, you'll like it. i think it's a really specific niche. like in horizon zero dawn my favorite part was just trying to explore and find little clues about what happened to cause the apocalypse. i'm just a sucker for postapocalyptic worlds."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i got like 8hours out of it. it's pretty fun but very short. i'd wait for a discount.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i turned it off after half an hour.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's amazing and i love it but it's way too short. maybe 10 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i got 7 hours out of it. i had an absolute blast with it. puzzles were fun, being a cat is amazing, and the gameplay is fun. i played it for free on ps plus."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i got bored about 3 hours in, and i was really excited for it to come out"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"once the charm of playing as a cat wears off, its pretty standard platformer fare. i got bored a few hours in and stopped."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its not super long, but its enjoyable. at a discounted 20 on steam that is fair"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its an excellent game. im not even a cat person and i still think that its the best ps5 game that ive played so far.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's fun. a bit above average in my opinion, so it's good but not amazing. gameplay was solid and i had no noticeable bugs ps5. the novelty of playing as a cat was definitely fun. i think i played through it in about 10 hours. i only went back for the easier trophies, but didn't 100 the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i've played 5.4 hours. i really enjoy the world and exploring it. i didn't much care for the action sequences. i still have it installed, but idk if i'll get around to finishing it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it's essentially a walking simulator with a cat. the gameplay itself is very basic platforming with some simple combat. about 10 hours of gameplay depending on how much you explore. for 20 i think it is a fine game. i enjoyed the art style and the cyberpunkandroid environment. one of the few walking games i enjoyed. if you watch trailers and it looks interesting you will probably like it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i had loads of fun with it mostly because i like cats it's fairly short
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"great little game that knows exactly what it is and doesnt overstay its welcome. i actually would agree with it winning indie goty, the atmosphere, world building, and aesthetic are all amazing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,found it boring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's fun, cute, and pretty. it's very short for the money, and pretty simple with some super minor puzzles. i think if you can get it for 10 or less it's worth it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it's good but perhaps not for everyone, some people may think it's boring if the don't feel the atmosphere."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i liked it a lot! i think i finished it in a few hours. maybe around 6hrs i wanna say?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its for cozy gamers. my girlfriend loved it, as did her best friend. they spent a lot of time just knocking shit over as a cat. in my opinion, its a perfect game, in that it delivered exactly what it advertised and did so very well. if you didnt like it, thats perfectly fine. it means you werent the target audience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"its just okay in my opinion. nothing special, yet i really enjoyed playing it. its not too long and i found it a really chillrelaxing game to play. other than that nothing special like i said."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,my cats love watching me play but i get bored easily.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"great exploration game, i think about 12 hours. if you like cats or dystopian future, its amazing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"if starfield can be considered a horrible game, then i'd say that stray is below that in it's barely even a game. it barely has any sort of player input and you could change the whole cat aspect of it that isn't required by the setting and then what are you left with? a linear exploration game. it was somewhat fun uncovering the world and the perspective was cool, but i've played similar in a different where you transform into a smaller creature that's needed to get through puzzleexploration areas but it had the added bonus of having combat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its an ok game, carried by graphics and the fact that you play as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's relatively short, but it's fantastic... i'd rank the experience higher than a handful of longer more mainstream aaa games easily..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's cute, it's interesting, and meowing at security cameras who nod back never got old. but it's short. i usually take a really long time finishing games, and i completed this one pretty fast. if you can get it for cheap, i'd say go for it  it's more fun than a drink at starbucks or even 3."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's s lovely game, but goty candidate was a stretch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,is it a good game? no does it have a cat in it? yes so its 1010
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it was a great game for me and my wife to relax and play over a few hours together. it was fun, quirky and different to other stuff. definitely worth playing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"stray is most definitely a game. i can assure you, with a 100 guarantee, that it is one of the games i've played."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its a great game. its creative, fun and endearing. i spent 13 hours on it as a completionist. i did everything ingame and all but 2 hidden ps achievements. there is a varying degree of difficulty in the puzzles. i liked the storyline and if you love cats, its even better."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i loved it. if you don't want something too heavy and with simply game play, stray is the go to. it's kinda therapeutic."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,think this would be a great candidate for a switch port
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a walking simulator with some very light puzzle elements and a few opportunities for very basic combat. the atmosphere is cool. the npc's you don't really develop a connection with. it's just....ok. if you like cats or have someone just getting into gaming, it's probably going to be worth it. if you are expecting a deep narrative experience with a rich story or riveting gameplay, that's not this game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's a walking simulator but you're a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's fine, it should not have won best indie last year lmao"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i got maybe 5 hours, and then stopped playing. wasnt bad, wasnt great. it was available on ps plus extra, and i felt like there were other games id rather play more than it. im sure its worth playing for cat people."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a good game that is overrated. while i love cats, i played almost 10h and i was bored most of the time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,stray is a great game. 78 hours long or so. deserving of a goty nomination to recognize its originality. jealous youre playing it for the first time!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its not spectacular or anything, but its still enjoyable."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i suggest watching rantons review about that game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a charming indie game with lovable characters and an atmospheric world. however, not a terribly lot going on in terms of gameplay or challenge. it's pretty on the rails as a game, with just a few explorable hubs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it was a cute, moderately fun game to explore. pretty short, maybe 10 hours max, i beat it in maybe 6 or 7 hours doing some of the extra stuff but not a ton. it was fine, not super memorable, but if the idea of hopping around as a cat and talking to robots sounds like fun, it's worth a shot. i mostly got a lot out of it because my dog was obsessed with it. every meow had him staring at the tv, fully engrossed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"if you like cats youll like this game. i loved it. short and sweet, interesting concept, and the ending made me teary eyed. id give it a go! edit also has a banger soundtrack"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its okay for an idie game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i really enjoyed it, characters all had a nice charm too. if you like adventure games that aren't challenging, it's great."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i got bored about halfway through it and never finished it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a good story wrapped around an okay game. it's also made being a cat feel very catlike. like you just want to get up high and knock shit off shelves and damn that's satisfying. imo it was worth the 30 price tag it originally had, so if you can get it on sale, even better. i'm gonna say 6 hours start to finish, but i'm not certain. i played with my kid so we spent a lot of time goofing around."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i love it, but be aware that there isn't much in the way of skilldriven gameplay, and not much replicability either. it's more about experiencing a charming and interesting world. i absolutely recommend it, but it's not the kind of game you should count the hours on."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i hit that meow button so many times
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,you have to go in knowing that most of the game is exploring as a cat. that's it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,meow...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"6 hour little point and click adventure game. gameplay design is fairly simple but there's good variety, so it feels fresh the whole runtime. if you do not find the idea of embodying a literal house cat to explore and play interesting, you probably will not like it. it is very much about the central gimmick of being a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,stray is even better knowing that that one crazy pirate empress girl went batshit over it in her message
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i loved the game for the introductory missions and just being a cat. once the actual game started it got real old real quick.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's about 10 hours. it's a simple but very atmospheric and unique game. i enjoyed it thoroughly and preordered the physical copy for ps5 for 30 dollars and didn't regret it. but i was very excited for it and enjoy those types of games to their fullest extent. i can't say i've played much that's quite like it. but i also like to take my time with some games. the story is, like the game, short, but also like the game, interesting. there's a small collectible component in one of the initial areas and some fun little achievements. given the length, i'd say it's worth 15 for quality. otherwise wait for a sale for it to be 1510."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,playing it at the moment and loving it. isn't super long and you basically just jump around a cyberpunk city small areas as a cat. but the visuals are lit soundtrack is bangin and it's relaxing as fuck.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,httpshowlongtobeat.comgame79790
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"stray was my 2022 goty and made my personal top 50 games of all time list. it doesn't hit for everyone, but when it hits, it really hits. it's well worth the price tag, and it's eight to ten hours long."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i loved it, but i'm a major cat guy. i have 4 of them. so walking around as a cat exploring and solving basic puzzles was awesome."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i'm really glad i played it. it isn't the longest game i have 10 hours on it, but it was an enjoyable one."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"about 7 hours or more. i spent most of my time admiring the attention to details. the graphics are good and u don't need a tutorial to play it. just know your key bindings and explore. solve mysteries and exploration, that's the game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"enjoyable. its a 68hour game. it is a fairly simple game but looks great, has some decent enough puzzle aspects and is something a little different."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its not just a good game its a 1015 hour work of art, in my opinion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i was bored with it within the first couple hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"good experience, and it was around 5 hours for me and i was playing extremely slow."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"just play it, don't be a pussy"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i got probably 15 hours out of it because i went for all of the trophies. it isn't a huge game but it is an interesting story and it is remarkably fun jumping around as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's just long enough to be ineligible for a refund.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"don't pay more than like 20 for it, but it's absolutely worth playing. for what it's worth, i got it when it was free on ps5, loved it enough that i ended up buying it on steam"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"being a cute cat is fun, but the combat is rough. after several hours against the first enemies, i had to put it down"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its a fun game. not crazy difficult and relatively short. but its cool and has a dope style. cyberpunk? retrofuturism? idk something inbetween those. if you can get it cheap go for it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i love cats , so yes for me"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's very short but it's a beautiful experience imo. slightly biased as i'ma big lover of cats but it's full of charm and really captures the 'cat' experience.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,stray was really fun.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i loved it, but i also lost my 19yr old cat at the time so it really helped me at the time. i'd still recommend it, it's unique if nothing else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i adored it. i spent maybe 8 hours on it but im not hugely experienced with this style of game so it took a minute for me to catch on to the objectives. if you like the cutesy idea of being a cat and listening to robot music for 8 hrs, then its def a good game. not everyones cup of tea!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its a good game, and one thats relaxing and chill. its not intense or frustrating. just a nice kickback game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,are there any sad moments?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's fun. there are some moments that are a bit annoying, but it's fun. one of the main issues is how short it is"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a great game. got about 8hrs out of it. mostly quiet platforming and world exploring and finding out the story through lore, punctuated by frenetic running away at moments. if you love cats you will love the game. really moody and atmospheric, responsive controls. loved it and definitely worth it if on sale. the cat has a lot of character."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,6
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i loved the art and the story. i think i completed it in about 6.5 hours but i think it was definitely worth it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's a pretty chill, charming and easy game. if you want more, you may be disappointed. it is a good game for what it is trying to do. playtime is probably around 610 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its nice fun little game that lasts probably around 10 hours. bonus if you have a cat irl you can watch it circle around the tv confused about the cat talking on screen p
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"personally, i think its ok. its a standard platformer with the main selling point being you are playing a cat and its atmospheric storytelling. the graphics are quite beautiful and the story is ok. its not a bad game, especially for indie standards but i didnt understand the hype of why it got nominated for goty. there is no dlc so getting it second hand wont result in you missing out and it is a pretty easy plat if you are a trophy hunter. its a pretty glitch free and ok experience but got a lot of underserved hype because cat game imo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it is an inexpensive games with a mix of both positive reviews and negative reviews among the community. i believe you are on the right path to finding out the answer. good luck
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,worth a 10 note no more
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,platinumed it on ps5. got it for free when it released. i played through a few times with my kids probably got about 12hrs out of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i think it's cos it might have gotten more hype than it really needed or deserved tbh. it's just the 'cat game'. but that year the hype and novelty of ''the cat game'' meant it was talked about in the same vein as gow ragnarok and elden ring so many people were probably disappointed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"the best about the game music, lighting, environmentslevels, story the worst about the game often clunky contextual controls for jumping overall great package, sweet story and definitely a game to remember"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i loved it, one of my favorite games on ps5 and the graphics and art are fantastic"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i thought it was phenomenal. then again i dont have much time to spend on video games but i personally liked it. dont know how much time ive put into it but pretty long
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"yes. it's simple and enjoyable. i'd describe it as a quirky eye candy game. i played it with my wife, we loved it. it's more of an experience and less of a hardcore gaming thing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"story and mechanics are straight forward. can finish it during daylight. that said, game is good. you can feel the atmosphere it sets."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i loved it. wasnt particularly fan of the first hour because i didnt get the mood the game was going for. then all of a sudden i felt very cosy playing this game and was actually sad when i got it over with. definitely in my top 3 games played this year it lasted 8h for me. you could probably get around 12h tops if you go for the platinum
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,bought it and never played it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's amazing. if you like cats that is. it's very good in letting you do cat things. 810 hours one playthrough. max 20h platinum trophy. totally worth it considering it's free or cheap. had more actual 'fun'entertainment than with elden ring, which i had played right before."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"not my style, so i did not enjoy. at first it seem unique, but when i entered the large maze  i gave up. walked around for prob an hour until i gave up and had no idea where to go. total playtime prob 23 hours of mine."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"well, beside playing a cute cat, it's a real basic exploration game with nothing more to do than wandering."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"8.4 hours according to steam. was a fun little game, def worth a try"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,not much of a spoiler so just gonna say that you can idle in the game and i wish i could use the game as a screensaver sometimes to just hang out with a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"6 or 7. its charming and has memorable visuals, but not much in a way of engaging gameplay or replayability."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its not complicated. its not hard. but it sticks to you. and like some other postapocalyptic pieces, theres a real emotional sticking point to the retrospectives on contemporary times. i found it very worth the price of my subscription but i wouldnt buy it. and certainly not at full price."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"its solid, but not particularly challenging or even really very engaging. it has everything a game needs, so to speak, and its real cute and wellcrafted, but once you finish it you just feel a bit empty and disappointed. a lot of is this it? but if its cheap, by all means buy it. its not a bad game at all, its just not a lot of game. its a nice starter, not a main course."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its short but really fun and relaxing. would never play it again but im glad i went through it once
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i played through it once, i had a lot of fun. there is an achievement for completing it in under 2 hours, which id imagine is a targeted speed run, but it should give you an idea. fun game, worth 20 or so."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i had fun with it, but it is very short"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"boring af. interesting world, boring gameplay. in only got praise cause people like to play as a cat.. a solid 4 or 510"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it is a walking simulator but as a cat. got some light puzzles and combat. kinda liked it more than i guessed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i found it fun but i got stuck at the end and haven't finished it yet
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"ita a good game with a good story but it's short. you can rush through it without exploring in 23 hours but if you look for memories, explore and do little side quests you would probably be looking at around 10 hours. it's certainly worth playing at least once."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's fun! it has an interesting story. you get to play as a cat too which it doesn't happen often. definitely worth playing it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i think i played it for 5 hours? one regular playthrough and then another speedrun to clean up the leftover achievements. i enjoyed it both times, but i dont think ill go back to it. kinda done everything there is to do. although i have a friend whos done probably about 30 playthroughs, mainly trying to improve his pb, but he also downloads mods inbetween playthroughs to shake things up a bit."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"from what i understand, it's more of an artwork than a game. not much replay value or unique gameplay, but it has a pretty art style."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,just played for a few hours. thought it was kind of boring and hoped for more interactions.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it was decent  can probably get 2 playthroughs out of it with the 2nd one on the highest difficulty or the trophy speedrun. was refreshing in how it was an original idea at the time.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i quite liked it, its realy coosy but its only around 56hours playtime."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i didnt get too far before becoming bored and giving up but i wouldnt say that makes it a bad game. the gameplay and graphics are great if you like that kind of game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i got the platinum trophy which is rare for me to try and do. it took around ten hours. the game is pretty simple but really charming. the short length also works in the games favor. it always moves things along before a section gets boring. i get why some people who paid 40 were disappointed with the length. if it's on sale for like 20 that seems more than reasonable to me though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"stray is a game targeting people who love cats. if you aren't into cats, it's probably going to be an okay game, done in about 20 hours. if you love cats, you'll spend those 20 hours just scratching up the couch, all while meowing, simply because you can. i'm a cat lover, so for me, stray hit all the right paws, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a fan of cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it was ok, what was there was well done but not enough to it for me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it's fun, it's creative. but it's also very short. httpshowlongtobeat.comgame79790httpshowlongtobeat.comgame79790 i wouldn't pay over 20 for it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it is enjoyable. not too long. it runs well on the steam deck.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"just a simple arcade runner, nothing more."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"though its not for me, my wife loved it. she is a cat lady who mostly enjoys retro adventure games. wasnt me, so i'm not sure on the hours of gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i enjoyed the heck out of it. got more then 10 hr, prob 1520 but i play slow and flip a lot of stones. it wont be for everyone, its more about the story and setting then the action. its kind of an interactive miyazaki movie."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it didn't do much for me. the novelty wore off after about an hour for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's about 34.99 worth of game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,it's successful at what it sets out to do. if you can get it cheap and want to play cute cat game then get it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it was a nice experience, but i cant see myself replaying it. the story was okay, but i wasnt really into it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,yes you play as a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,"i played it for a bit but lost interest for other games.just like baldur's gate 3.but that one is another bag of catsdon't like the combat system,no hot chicks characters to play,etc.i was planning in resuming playing it but like i said.there was so many other games that were more interesting for me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,will check this one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,"i really like this game, took probably 1015 hours to finish. however its a zero 0 replayability factor for me. definitely a one and done."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-30,"no, got bored after reaching second area and quit playing. controls are clunky and the game is super easy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-31,"depends on how you play. it's an experience, an adventure with amazing atmosphere and storytelling. take your time and you'll enjoy it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-31,it's peaceful if you want that type of game. i enjoyed but didn't complete.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-01,"it's nothing special, but it's not bad. it's just a very generic game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,okay yes the time span of the game sucks!!! i wish it was longer however the game is extremely detailed in my opinion and has so many features that bring the game together all together it's an awesome experience to play also emotional for some
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"this is exactly it. i see some folks deride it as a shit game. its definitely not shit, but i wouldn't call it great. i'm a cat person and i fucking love cats, but the people who called for it to be a goty were huffing the litterbox dust. it definitely has charm to it, and it's worth checking out on sale, but it's nothing that's gonna be remembered by gamers as a whole in a few years."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,what kinda car?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,even though i have to say i didn't feel like a cat. click x to jump here. and then click x to jump there. those prompts really killed the immersion of swift and sneaky cat movement for me. but world building and press key to meow were good!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,isnt it also on game pass?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,ten hours? it's barely two for a full blind playthrough and about three maybe four to get 100 if you are slow.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"10 hours is a huge stretch, unless you're going to go for all achievements including a 2hour speedrun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i took my time and played it calmly, still only took me 6 hours from start to finish."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i have played and my opinion  story and atmosphere are really good 8.510  gameplay is okay 610 the novelty of you being a cat is fun, but not for very long. the parkour is pretty railroaded, making it very easy and the opposite of frustrating i personally see this as a plus. some puzzles are a bit tough to figure out, not because they're very hard, but because it's not always obvious what you need to do and the solution might require you to do something seemingly unrelated. very little subtle hints as well. also a relatively short game, but honestly the perfect length. any longer and it would have dragged on and have become boring. definitely experience the game as an exploration game. just walk around, get a feel for the levels and atmosphere, talk to everyone and gather as much information as possible. don't attempt to just rush the storyline."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"do you think a 7 year old would be able to play? we just got a ps5 for the family, and my 7yo daughter is feeling left out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"yep, i played it this time last year in the week between christmas and new years eve. horrible weather outside and ate good holiday food. 1010 comfy as fook."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"tbh i feel like a 120hr game will inevitably have a lot of repeated actions, there's more change you'll drop it. short games are much better in this regards"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"they were separate, somewhat unrelated questions, but agree with your sentiment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i feel the same about journey
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,exactly how i feel about edith finch
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,fire watch is an awesome game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,although i agree there is a limit to this. i can enjoy a 6 to 10 hour well crafted linear game for sure with good replay value but stray is barely 2 hours with no gameplay or replay value at all to speak of and the one mechanic it has is clunk and poorly handled.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"honestly the story was deeper and more emotional than i expected going in, i thought it would just be a cyberpunky cat simulator but i was pleasantly surprised!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,well it was nominated for goty at the geoff awards
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,it got hate? it seemed to me like it was very well loved.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i don't know what you consider ps5 exclusive because stray was available on ps4 too from day one. agreed that it wouldn't get that much attention if not the circumstances, but it was more about good release date and hype because of cats"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,most games are
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"also the story feels incomplete, near the end you would expect to at least see certain characters that showed up at the beginning of the game but it never happens"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"exactly. i just started it last night, and you couldn't be more correct. it's a pretty weak platformer, and there's very little to interact with so far anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i stopped once all the people showed up and the town. i have no idea how far that is into the game, but it was after many puzzles."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,the first question was about quality. the second about quantity.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,cyberpunk game...political? no way. how is that possible. it's almost like the setting is inherently political.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,cex uk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,intro and ending
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,when the cat gets the backpack though...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i disagree in that its the best game ever made for rping as a cat. not that it has any competition
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i think some folks call it shit because their expectations were way off from reality. they were expecting a full openworld cyberpunk with cats from a studio with a couple dozen developers. wasnt gonna happen. but with expectations in check, its a great little game. i do agree though, absolutely not goty material, but again, it wasnt supposed to be. its fine for what it was  a cute little story about a lost cat in a cyberstyle world."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"havent played the game but it did seem like the game earned its goty nomination. it definitely wasnt goty but seems like it was an excellently executed game. i currently have it on my wishlist on my series x, just waiting for a good sale on it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i just don't call it a game because it isn't.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,its also a gorgeous game too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"but goats, they will be remembered."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"it'll be remembered. not because of it's actual gameplay, but still remembered."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"people calling it to be goty were mostly trying the rile up elden ring fans, which generally worked."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i wanna say honda civic, but i am not a car guy. can anyone confirm?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i feel bad that youre getting downvoted because you happened to post that reply just before you saw that id edited my original comment
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,orange
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,you can run around holding the jump button to make the transitions more seamless.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,you can also turn off the prompts in the settings. still no free jumping but its less immersion breaking if you need it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"it used to be on ps plus extra or premium, whichever one is basically sonys game pass. that may be what youre thinking. not sure if it is anymore however."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,no
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i'm sure they'd love it, but you might need to help them out in some of the trickier bits."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,. it was the first game my 5yo nephew played kinda well without frustration. altho they can sometimes get stuck in an area n u might need to help them out. also some areas can be a bit creepy so there's that to consider. nothing hectic though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,check out untitled goose game. that's a riot for kids
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"totally, very simple and linear. nothing super intense. very hand holdy but the charm is in the exploration anyways"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,the cute little astro game that comes with the ps5 is great for teaching about the controller and a basic rudimentary way games work.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"yeah its not too bad. there are enemies, but you mostly just run from them, and theyre only in a few spots. mostly just puzzles, exploration, and vibing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,yeah i think she would be able to as long as she doesnt have a tendency to get too frustrated if she has to retry certain parts multiple times. all the jumping is automatic with one button press so you cant really mess that up. some of the enemy encounters are challenging and the exploration to find all the collectibles and do the side quests could be difficult as well.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,yes. there are some chase scenes that might be a bit much so be ready to step in. also there's a bambi opening so prep to tell them it'll all turn out fine.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,theres some robots that can shoot lasers or something at you. some weird blobs that chase you. so could be scary but depends on the kid
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,my 5 year old loves it. there are a lot of good kids out there. just find what she likes and look for games similar to her interests.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,my 10 year old loved it very much.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,exactly how i played too. 1010
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,what games are 120 hours?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"so you're saying it's not about the destiny, but the journey?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,2 hours? did you play it? were you rushing? it's a game that should be savored and played as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,stray is eight to ten hours long on a blind playthrough. are you sure you're not thinking of the speedrun? or another game entirely?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,every awards show is bullshit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"yeah there was some hate initially, because it was a cat game. people were like youre a cat wow so innovative etc etc"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i knew someone was gonna say this... yes, while cyberpunk as a genre leans into specific themes, it's not always as hamfisted about it and it doesn't have to. you wouldn't normally expect a game about a cat trying to get back to his friends to actually just be 10 hours of completely unapologetic political commentary that just happens to have a cat in the background, even if set in a cyberpunk setting. by all means, i'll take my downvotes for not jerking off that particular horse like the rest of reddit loves to."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"a street cat's tale. you straightup roleplay a cat's daily life. what i didn't expect was how easy it is to, er, fail. i was expecting more of a cute rpg and less cat survival rpg."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,little kitty big city
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,cattails!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"the mithra race in ffxi and ffxiv would like a word... if you're into mmos and wanna play a cat girl, well, there you go."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"cat quest edit, the purring quest also, i liked that one"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,but khajit has wares if you have coin!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,borgo the cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i mean, even if all you were expecting was actual platforming, you'll be disappointed. it's cute, but it has little gameplay  a few puzzles and a little bit of blob dodging."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i don't think there's really enough game there to even nominate it for goty, honestly. it's a very well executed little oddity, but even though i freaking love cats imo there are many games that have done the 'limited gameplay to tell an immersive story' genre far better. but those games don't have the novelty or name recognition of stray, so they're overlooked while this one is overexposed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,its definitely high purrrformance whatever it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,slaps hood this baby can fit so many hours in it

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"do the right thing, edit it back to car."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"this is why i always add this bit to the bottom of an edited comment edit cat, not car"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"true, but it's still not free movement. i would have wished for 100  control over where to jump and crawl and explore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,yea thats what i was thinking
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,when i was 7 and got stuck in a game i would just play the beginning over and over again. and i would like it. kids these days have it so easy...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,ehh all the jumping just takes a hit off the bottom. no g real skill needed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-30,"thanks for the recommendation! didn't realize that was a playable game, thought it was just a basic tutorial. both my kids are loving it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,persona 5
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,honestly like a fuckload of games but its not always quality

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,the persona games are crazy long. dragon quest 11 also took me 100 hours to 100.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"elden ring took me about 140h to complete for the first time witcher 3, about 150h baldur's gate 3, about 120h shadow of war, a bit over 100h ...the list goes on, but there's a couple that i can remember.  online  live service games are obviously also up there i literally have 30 000h in wow, but i guess you're asking about singleplayer games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,games wtih good game mechanics repeated actions are so fun that you don't mind pressing the same button for 100 hours like elden ring both visual and mechanical fun or enter the gungeon repetition is literally the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"lots of games can have 120 hours of content. or rather, there's games where you can reasonably sink 120 hours in. like ones with a lot of replayability. rpgs with lots of sidequests. mmoslive service games. fighting games. there's some overlap in those"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i'd say oblivion, skyrim, and factorio, but those games are at least 200 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,the witcher 3  dlc's
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,there's literally an achievement to beat the game in under 2 hours. casually it will take longer but it's not a long game if you play semi efficiently
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"8 to 10 hours is gigantic stretch. the game is not 2 hours like that other guy said but it's about 5h at most, if you take it slowly. you'd have to play the game twice and get all the trophies to get to 10 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,"i don't think that's why there was hate it was a while ago so maybe i forget. the problem was that it had so much hype surrounding it the reveal trailer was one of the most interesting i've seen for ages, with such amazing atmosphere and tone. combine that with internet cat frenzy, some of the news that came out about how they'd been working on it for quite a while and spent a lot of time trying to replicate realistic cat movement, everyone's imagination went wild on a hugely innovative game. the atmosphere and tone in the game itself is great, and the story behind it pretty cool, but the game behind it is very simple. movement and platforming was fairly simplistic and there isn't much to it beyond following the story and the cool world they created. this was reflected in its price, and is clearly all it was ever really meant to be, but expectations are guided by hopes and dreams sometimes. i thought it was a fun game. great atmosphere and a nice story, chill to play."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,i think making a game where you play as a cat is innovative lol never understood the sarcasm sentiment behind those statements

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"that's not playing as a cat. it's just being a weeb. it's still fun, but the wrong idea for this"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i mean people in this thread are being harsh on stray for limited gameplay but surely strays more complex and longer than something like limbo, which many people had the same fondness for when it came out. some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance. a short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isnt automatically bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-27,good taste.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i'd hope most people would understand than six great hours is better than forty mediocre hours. 3 hours of shawshank redemption is better than 100 hours of qvc on loop.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"never mind the car, let's talk about the henge"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"but then it wouldn't jump like a cat? i'm confused. cat jumps are point a to point b in a very brief instant just like the game did, which is why it was restricted that way. i'm sure you don't mean it should jump like mario but maybe you're thinking of little kitty big city, where the jump has more freedom but is more floaty which kills some realism. stray has more realistic environment so it would be jarring if the cat jumped like that. cat is small enough to go under cars and if it crawled they'd have to add invisible walls because cats can virtually crawl anywhere. they let you explore roofs? i thought the cat feel was the thing they nailed compared to the rest"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"ugh the tomb raider game undersea or we that one was, i dropped it at the start cuz it was too hard for my yet undeveloped brain"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i remember just playing the hercules demo that came with my ps1 like 3000x.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,yeah tutorials were amazing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i absolutely loved majoras mask as a kid but i swear i never got past like the second temple of the game. i think the bull was the furthest i got as a kid. i feel like i spent majority of the time just getting to the first skull kid fight on the final day . i dont think ive ever completed a mario game. i dont think i finished donkey kong country until i was an adult getting into retro games. subzero mythologies i never got past level 2 without cheat codes. i think i just replayed the first level over and over until i was over the game theres something about just being entertained as a kid with games. didnt have to jump through so many hoops for it to be a good game. you just had fun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,the zurk level can be challenging because you have to be fast and is also a bit creepy for a 7 year old. the stealth levels are better but depending on the skill level they might be a bit tricky. keep in mind kids are usually way less coordinated than adults.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,this is precisely the game i meant. i was so tired of ludicrous farming same types of mobs that act the same i quit the game just before the final boss.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,i could definitely understand it being a gimmick but they put a lot of effort into making a cat protagonist be a core mechanic to the game that it felt innovative. it was a pretty well made simulator.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,"sounds a whole lot more like you're the one offended here. learn to have a civil conversation. i'm a big fan of cyberpunk as a genre, and stray very much felt like a bait and switch with what it was actually about. but please, insult me some more for acknowledging that you can try to tell a story about something and kind of do a shitty job at it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"i think you're deliberately missing my point. i said myself that stray executes its concept well. i figured the implication was obvious but in case you missed it, i like stray and i think it's a good game. i just don't think it's an amazing game. regardless of the genre or scope, that ought to be the bar for a goty nomination, right? some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance. again, i think you're mixing up meanings here. there's a difference between a game with low interactivity and a game with little substance. i love games that function as storytelling devices rather than highly interactive gaming mechanisms. i simply think there are better examples of the genre than stray. a short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isnt automatically bad. i agree. but once again, i did not claim stray was bad, merely that i think the scope of its ambition is stretched a little thin by the relatively bland gameplay. i'd rather it committed one way or the other."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,what henge is that again?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-12-28,"don't do that. don't write out a response but then when i bother to take the time to address what you said, act like you didn't actually care anyway. why are you commenting on a discussion thread if not to have a discussion?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,puss in boots
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,"this is really good! im not an 2d artists so take my 2 cents for what its worth, but so much of that game is about the setting and ambience that i think youre piece would be furthur elevated but creating a scene of some kind behind the cat. i dont even thinnk it would have to be something specific from the game but could even be something abstract like just the color pallet from one of the scenes or areas you explore from the game. keep it up!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,"blend those color borders together. also, you did great on the eyes and everyone knows eyes are the hardest."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,"yeah, this is good! keep drawing, keep trying and your skills will improve, but don't be at all ashamed of efforts like this! good job!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,i need to finish this game. i think i needed one more journal in the first area before moving on but i can't seem to find it when i boot it up
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,"it is just missing the texturing. for fur texturing, you draw strands in bunches. youtube has many tutorials."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,i like the colors and shading. keep practicing!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,nice!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,i certainly recognised it straight away  great job
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,i feel like cats are hard. theres whole ass anime that cant even properly illustrate a cat lol this is fantastic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,pro tip op. literally shade the entire background as dark as you can super mindful around the whiskers and i think your colors would look more spot on. maybe tint the shading dark orange or yellow on the right side since you have probably an incandescent light source above your subject in the reference image if you used one and it would balance out what you've already done.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,"perhaps the yellow is a bit bright but honestly you nailed the face shape, it's clearly recognizable as the cat from the game. great job!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,gj
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,nice

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,"agreed the colors are meh , probably shouldnt have even tried at all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,she's beautiful. i'd hang that on my wall. great job!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,the secret to getting good is to keep trying.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,add more layers of colors and you should be able to get more definition from that period art student throughout almost all of my school life. layers are the key . it looks great so don't let someone else tell you otherwise.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,honestly? if not for the peach patch say you used more yellow instead it'd be a really nice colour palette. the contrast on the face looks really cool

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,love it!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,it's really cute what do you mean? if you asked me to draw that it would look like the cat got compressed

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,looks great!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,"it is about gaming, and this means, it is about trying. to play a game and art are similar things. both need more practice to develop skill. but whom to i talk to? gamers these days enjoy simple games, i assume according to my sales. stay curious!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,great work sir

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,completely agree ! it's always the effort that counts and the enjoyment you got while doing it you only get better by continuing the attempts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,i would even normalize doing hobbies for fun and not necessarily improving on them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,seriously. this is a great first attempt. op does this a couple more times and its probably gonna look fire.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,yeah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,yes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,he even got the cape
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,exactly. in a few years im sure they can put this side by side with a current drawing and it will show so much progress. as an artist myself everyone should know we go through a how to draw anime phase and this drawing is already much better than that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,palico
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,"he has a small little robot companion in the game, so he needs the backpack to fit him"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-25,perfect. now the only way you'll get better is by continuing!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-26,it's a backpack for his robot friend
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i think maybe it would deserve most innovative concept, though not specifically innovative gameplay. i mean, besides being a cat, you're not really doing anything we haven't done in games before a little action, a little stealth, etc. how you go about doing it is a little different because the mechanic is altered due to the cat's movement, but i still think it's more of a uniqueness in concept than anything else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"as someone pointed out in the cyberpunk2077 threadhttpsi.redd.itintn4b03p2aa1.jpg, steam awards  popularity contest and shouldn't be taken personally if your opinion is different."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i don't pay much attention to gaming awards, but is there an award for settingvibeatmosphere? stray seems like it would absolutely be a favorite for that. gameplaywise it is incredibly generic. didn't create any sort of new mechanic or anything. but the world creation and the experience for the player is top notch and very immersive."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i really like stray. it has a very unique premise, but there's no innovation in its gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,hitman won vr game of the year aswell
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,meme votes won. that simple.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yes. name another game with a dedicated meow button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the internet likes cats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,steam awards are a joke
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the fans of this game or any other that didn't win something just nominated it everywhere to make sure that their favorite game has won something.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"absolutely not. gameplaywise, it's basically the same contextual parkour system we've seen assassin's creed use since the first game came out fifteen years ago. you don't get any upgrades and the most innovative the platforming gets is that sometimes, when you jump on an object, it will swingrotatewhatever to allow you to jump to the next location. plus, you basically can't fail at it. the puzzle solvingfetch quests are really basic, as well. most of it involves picking up the obvious object and putting it in the obvious slot, knocking an item off a shelf, luring a moving machine to give you a platform to reach an otherwise inaccessible area, etc. if you've played any 3d puzzle game in the past, you've seen everything stray has to offer except for maybe one or two puzzles where you have to scratch at something on the wall to pull down a sheet or whatever. sometimes you'll have to go to a place, solve a puzzle, and then bring the thing you get for solving the puzzle back to the person who gave it. the combat and stealth segments are sigh say it with me, basic. the combat primarily consists of running away, except for one segment where you get a flashlight which fries enemies and you have to manage the battery. this then stops being a mechanic about ten minutes later. stealthwise, metal gear solid on ps1 offered more variety in the very first area before snake gets any tools than the entirety of stray, and consists entirely of avoiding obvious camera cones of vision by hiding behind or under objects and running away for a bit if you're caught. the biggest sequence which combines the two basically involves tricking the floating sentries following you into a room and hitting a switch to lock them in. it's a very pretty game, and the story and setting are very innovative and everything, but gameplaywise this should not have won an award for innovation."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"oh my sweet child, you're only now realizing industry awards are just pointless popularity contests?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"spiderman, with the default graphics of nowadays 3d games won outstanding visual style."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,mainstream has incredibly low standards.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i didnt want to say anything, as i havent played the game yet, but the gameplay looked like your normal run of the mill 3rd person game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,pussy power.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"but okay, how much really innovative gameplay came out last year? a game where you play a cat, with actual cat behaviors, is pretty good for the past couple years, even if it is pretty much just a walking simulator. also, one might want to question the voting block as much as the game's credentials, here."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"although i did enjoy the game, this is absolutely unjustified."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i agree its different, but the 'gameplay isn't innovative. the narrative is for sure. x200b i was super excited for stray, until i saw it was all promptbased parkour. it was a real bummer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"yeah idk about most innovative gameplay, but the story made my heart warm. you cant even free run, its all just click button to jump up on this thing, click button to press lever, etc honestly nothing innovative about it besides the wonderful world building and story telling"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i enjoyed the game. but i thought while i was playing it that there was so much more cool stuff they could have done with puzzles and what not.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i honestly found it hard to stay awake playing it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i enjoyed the game. award, maybe. what i would have liked was more cat abilities to do cat things. i was sorta hoping for a cat simulator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i think its definitely innovative enough to be nominated. even though stray is my favorite game of all time, the gameplay is not the best the game has to offer by far."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"this might be a hot take but innovative gameplay is almost a meaningless buzzword by this point. ill gladly be proven wrong, but i believe that for the foreseeable future of accessible gaming were past the era of games truly innovating gameplay to heights that are such a leap from what came before to the point wed have need for a reward based solely around innovation. i think vr is the one avenue where this can still happen, but its still an expensive niche that most gamers havent experienced. i, for one, have never even physically seen or held a headset in my life, only pictures and videos of other peoples experiences. but for normal games, we likely will never see something like super mario 64 basically invent gaming in three dimensions, or halo combat evolved proving that shooters can work on consoles. or hell, halo 2 followed that up by inventing matchmaking as we currently understand it. groundbreaking games of the modern era are all about refinement over true innovation. breath of the wild combined gameplay elements seen before into a singular, refined package, and the last of us offers a highly polished but familiar survival gameplay loop packaged with a story thats not just good for a video game, but a story that actually stands up among the greats of television and cinema. but all award shows are popularity contests, and the steam awards more so. stray winning the steam innovative gameplay award is pretty meaningless and speaks more to people seeing normal gameplay but as a cat being refreshing more than anything else, i wouldnt sweat it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"stray had a very unique concept for a story and theme, both of which are very clearly not gameplay. i loved my time with the game but i don't think it was particularly innovative in its gameplay. if i had to pick a replacement i'd put the death stranding rerelease on there not because i think the rerelease changed too much, but because i think it's still unique and engaging enough in gameplay to at least warrant most players to give it a peek."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,my wife who hasn't ever played video games and my two dogs wholeheartedly believe this is the most ground breaking gameplay ever imagined. the meow button had them all glued to the screen.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"all of the awards are just someones opinion. none of them are 'deserved' more than any other, they are just chosen by a sub group of people and put on the fridge."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"what are some examples of competitors in the category? seems like all the aaa titles are just football v30, futbol v23, fps v203. i know there are innovative indie games but i dont know of them. would like to know for comparison."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,definitely not. although i enjoyed stray i found myself wondering if there wasn't the novelty of playing as a cat would the gameplay even be enjoyable? it's very basic and shallow at its core.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,people are basic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,nah i stand totally with you on this one! there where candidates like elden ring guys come oooooon!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yep
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,awards are the most pointless thing in existence.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i would have expected sifu to pick this award up
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,no. literally any other award it was nominated for.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yeah this surprised me too. like what did it do the was really new? aside from the ability to meow on command and rub against peoples legs? i voted it for most relaxing. its not at all innovative
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"most innovative gameplay probably not, personally i didn't see anything particularly innovative in terms of actual gameplay or game mechanics. but innovative game design in general, yes. in a world where every game looks like a direct copy of another, stray really stood out as something different for once. i wish more developers would focus on creating something new and unique, rather than recreating something we've played a hundred times over already."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"death stranding won best game on the go. personally, that alone invalidates the entire awards list"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i nominated it for the sit back and relax award. i don't think it deserves the most innovative gameplay but it was an enjoyable game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"it's the only game with a dedicated meow button, that is pretty innovative"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-07,"neon white should have had that in the bag for sure. that game is basically nothing but great gameplay. seems like not enough people played it. stray is nice and all, but not much more than a walking simulator with minor twists."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"to be fair, there was only one other nominated game that seemed to be at the front lines of creative experimentation...with newness never played before. that was dome keeper and it was incredibly innovative. the other nominees were subpar  mount  blade 2 is literally a sequel that polished the innovative gameplay of mount  blade. i honestly don't understand how this even got nominated.  teardown could be a minecraft mod with an updated engine. blow things up in voxel game is pretty tired. it deserves the nomination because at least it combines heist gameplay with voxels, which is at least somewhat new. i don't see how this wins though.  neon white has some novelty with weapons being replaced with soul cards. to be blunt though, it doesn't affect the gameplay very much. it's basically a speedrunner fps something quake did in 1996 with a card mechanic that sounds much more impactful than it actually is. so, we've got stray and dome keeper. both solidly deserve a win in the category. one game has 97k reviews while the other has 5k. this is where it came down to a popularity contest."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i found it quite dull and didn't notice anything innovative. just standard indie game fodder
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"when i fire a rpg at a chess set and it stands there undamaged none of the pieces moved but a cat jumps onto it and rip, putting a entire mini guns ammo box into a vase that moves around but never breaks.....cat knocks it off the shelf and it breaks, also the movement and traveling in the game is really fun , , it did quite a bit of different gameplay stuff compared to well....most games unless someone can name a game that's like stray this year"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,another shining example of why the fan vote doesnt work for the majority of categories.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i didn't think i would like it, but once i started playing it was immersive. it's the panic mode that it puts you in that makes the game for me. because its a cat, learning how to play the game is just about learning how to behave like a cat. great story too. i didn't realise people hate cats this much."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"unfortunately, i cant think of any games that have had extremely innovative gameplay. we get soulslikes, fps, and racing games, as well as outliers that don't deviate very much from those categories."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"no, i think stray is good, but there's nothing special about it's gameplay. it's a walking simulator adventure game with some occasional puzzles."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,video game awards lost their meaning a long time ago imo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i love the game but no, i dont think it deserves this."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"here's the thing, can you name a game that came out this year that actually had innovative gameplay? you can't. games that actually have innovative gameplay come out like once every five years or so. in years that there's nothing really new, you have to give it to a game that did something slightly different, which stray kinda fits. it's not that stray really did anything all that innovative, it's that no other game even really tried."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,lol it feels like a pity award. the game was just ok
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i dont get it . stray aint even a game. maybe call it a cat walking simulator.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,people care waaaay too much about these awards. gamers cry when something they don't agree with wins as if it makes any difference.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,you're not supposed to pay attention to game awards my guy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"dude...you play as a cat and you can meow, so yes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"nothing innovative about it, or really any of the nominated games. the real travesty is that darktide wasn't even an option for the best soundtrack."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,theres nothing inovative about a platformer that jumps for you. thats like calling cuphead a looter shooter. its a terrible take. most inivative should have gone to something like metal helsinger.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"ehh elden ring won game of the year, and unless you're a souls fanboy, you either enjoy it or hate it. goty? not really. most innovative gameplay for stray? also not really."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"im sorry, in how many games is there a meow button?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"press a to start a mini cut scene every time you move is innovative? zero skill involved, which of course means you can't really progress gameplay wise. you're just along for the ride, press a until you can find the person or object you need to press x on. it's a visual novel not a game. yeah it looks good and has a neat idea, but innovative gameplay over teardown or bannerlord? what a joke."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"who cares about video game wards? it doesn't change anything. the game is still the game and a fancy award won't change shit. consumers shouldn't even care about any awards...that shits for the devs, not everyone."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,should of won the biggest cringe
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"cp2077 won for labor of love. these awards mean jackshit then again, cant the same be said about any award?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"stray should not even exsist as a game imo. so of course it won an award, because thats what money buys. itbhas nothing to do with actual gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,meow meow meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,its a popularity contest. so... i think it was an imaginative game and i enjoyed most of the 8.2 hours it took me to finish it. i also voted for cyberpunk 2077 so you can disregard me if you'd like.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,stray was the best game of 2022
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"the cats are considered being the eternal and universal god emperor lords and ladies of earth. stray is about a cat. oh, of course it will be the most innovative game!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i mean, it's all been done before. it's all additive at best. all gameplay and mechanics can be boiled down to you mash buttons in a specific order to trigger flavor text. it's the same with tabletop games, or books and movies  the hobbit is really just a rehash of the epic of gilgamesh. 95 of games are basically the same game you've played 5 years ago but you need a better gpu for it. what stray did that was unusual if not innovative was to create a high end game experience that was inviting and engrossing, while being accessible and appealing by most metrics to more casual gamers. it was a super cozy experience on the steam deck, just walking around being a cat. it was also mostly nonviolent while not feeling childish or hokey. i can see that many of the aspects of the game it some other thiefstealth games, but stealing sheet music and listening to a robot play it feels different than doing a stealth assassination and getting gold coins in return."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the fact that elden ring beat gow should show you that the game awards arent actually a good indicator of quality
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"it was the only game from that category that i played, so yeah"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,it didnt but it had a cat in it. not sure if youve been on the internet butcats are kinda popular. and most people cant discern between good gameplay mechanics and omg this cat is cute.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"its all because of the cat. people like cuteness. stray does not deserve this award, however. its not innovate at all. there is nothing special about controls nor its parkour features. if to look at the narrative, it is okay. but not the most breathtaking ive ever experienced."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i havent played it yet, but isnt it basically a walking simulator? like with puzzles and platforming, yea. but i heard its a cute game with lots of charm and not much else worth the hype it got. heard from many reddit comments. it doesnt sound like it would stand out as innovative gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"most people just play and fuck everything, they dont really care about this things and its totally fine. why do you think poor optimized and microtransaction infested titles are most positive?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"huge disappointment in that game. controls are wonky, story is so so, puzzles are weak, and i though everyone is sick already of slime, and repulsive imagery with slime and monsters. as if im playing scorn. props to designers and artists for those nice models of city. everything else is just bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"because people voted for it. dont like it? then get off your ass and fucking vote for something else yourself instead of crying on reddit like you always do! fucks sake, its a game! dont like it? no one cares, karen!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"there were a lot of questionable winners this year. i mean labour of love cp2077 just why?, most innovative gameplay is a walking simulator with a cat and the best visual is a real life based game, even if the category said it shouldn't be that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i don't know, out of all the nominees for most innovative game, i would argue that stray is the most unique when compared to almost anything other game that came out this year. i think stray is a pretty bad example of the steam awards being a popularity contest..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yes. it was a revelation as a game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the only people complaining are the genshin impact simps.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"unless we talk about graphics meh aaa games are not innovative, most games available on consoles are not innovative simply because of the target audience. unknow pconly indie games from obscure websites or indiecentric websites are truly innovative"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,y'all really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really don't like playstation exclusives huh ?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,terrible movement. no charisma. euthanise stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"it was unique in the gameplay because it's wasn't just another animal game like bee simulator or man eater. you played as a cat, but that was not the whole premise of the game. it was interactive, the story was quite well made, out there graphics, and the puzzles were complex in design but not in a way where it was limited to be played by a certain age range. kids, teens, and adults could play this game and thoroughly enjoy their time. it was popular for a reason, and as others mentioned, it was not worth the starting price because it was a short game, but it was a fun game through and through"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,crying over spilt beer
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"not trying to flame anyone yet, this is exactly what you do with this useless post, and you know it... tf did you expect to happen ?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,you keep using that word. i don't think it means what you think it means.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"yes, it did. did you play it?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,fitgirl gunna crack the shits over that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,dont worry about anything steam awards . hitman 3 vr won vr game of the year... and it barely works
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,most astroturfing game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"havent played it yet, but its easily the most unique game from a gameplay standpoint out of all the big titles this year. what other major title did anything truly unique?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,innovation apparently means using non innovative gamellay and making it a cat. i'm working on elder cats and fallout new catvas.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,was it because of irl cats interaction with the game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i didn't like the game. didn't think it looked that nice. definitely overhyped by cat lovers similar to high on life. turned it off after 20 mins of meowing around.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,teardown is just as fun imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,its just measuring how popular a game is
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,imma keep it a stack i don't think it should have won anything.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,it's just for lols don't think about it too much.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,we should have a more honest awards show focusing on gameplay and actual innovation involving unique never before seen mechanics like the mordor games with the orc generation and how they remember you or metal gears psycho mantis and the old man sniper.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,well i personally never played anything like it stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the obvious winner for innovative gameplay was immortality. was it a good innovation? no. was it an innovation? hell yes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i dont know, man. how many games have you played with a o button to meow mechanic?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"never played, but saw the mini trailer a while back on instagram. can't believe it blew up so big,"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i absolutely loved stray but i wasnt innovative except for the fact you played a cat, i think it deserved an award for visuals more than anything. it was an absolutely beautiful game and super fun to play"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"my first thought when i see that had won was no it isn't? i can't even name a game that has, but the fact it's just controlling a cat with fancy animations isn't innovative gameplay. solving puzzles too from what i can tell, i haven't seen much stray as you can tell. no idea who the award would go to though. sonic frontiers maybe? sonic was the most fun to play in that, despite how shit the game is overall."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i'd bet it has something to do with the fact that they donate money to real cat charities when you buy the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i didnt play it but watched a few trailers. not sure of the innovative part.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,gaming innovation lacks
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,cat sim. cant beat that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"that game just didn't hook me. once the novelty of he he he a kitty! wore off, it was a pretty mediocre game... i think the concept was cool and all, but objectively, a pretty middleoftheroad game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i've beaten stray and, although i like the game and think it's a perfectly good product, it is monumentally overrated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"it was overall a pretty mediocre indie darling, without cat cute mechanic nobody would have cared about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"it certainly deserved an award. maybe not this particular award, but im happy for them all the same."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i love the game. i'd give it the cute cat award for adorable cats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,why the fuck do redditors care so much about steam awards. they are completely meaningless and are fan voted lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,how do you think the sonic community feels with sonic frontiers losing the best soundtrack award to a fucking dlc?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,pity award for the crowd favorite.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,it was nice to see at least one category not go to elden ring. of the games that were nominated it was certainly the most innovative. 99.9 of games feature a humanhumanoid protagonist. i hope stray starts a trend of games centering nonhumanoid characters.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,years ago clap trap won character of the year! fucking clap trap?! so yeah nothings off the table
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,dumb fucking game about a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,so you guys actually pick you favorite? i usually just randomly click through it to get the steam cards for the badge. no one care about my opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"it's a sightseeing game at best and has barely any gameplay. it's pretty, but barely on the same category as other games known for their graphics. being a cat is not grounds for winning awards. you practically play as the robot more than the cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i mean awards shows are a terrible metric for anything other than what games made the most money...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"imo the opening of the game was innovative there was no language needed, you just were a cat. you were offered a rug and you scratched it, not because it gave you a bonus or anything, but because you're a cat and that's what cats do. i found it deeply relaxing to not have to read anything or have deeper motivations than to just be that cat. once you got a robot and an inventory and all that it was just another exploring game on rails."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"the steam awards were a bit akward this year... i participated to the nominations a few times, and this year you couldn't pick up any game you'd like from your library, but there were only a few games per category which you could pick. or i missed something idk..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"it's all bogus anyway, i wouldn't even be surprised if they paid to get it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,well lets look at other innovations in gaming this year. which i can't think of off the top of my head. so playing as a cat that isn't cartoonish or a mascot type like sonic is enough for 2022.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i struggled to finish it over five hours. im glad other are enjoying it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"honestly i dont think this game deserves any awards, its just mediocre all around and feels like it was cut drastically short."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i got downvoted for saying it, but no it doesn't deserve it. its a good game no doubt, but nothing in it is innovative. sure you play a cat, it's cool the first hour, but then it loses all interest and becomes another adventure game like others. again, it's a solid game i'd give it a 810, but no it's not innovative."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,it definitely deserved some award there's a certain charm about the game even though it's short. not really that innovative but we can't change it now. still love the game btw.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"steam awards are just the popular vote, and you wonder why a game about a cat won?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i liked stray but it is far from being innovative in terms of gameplay. in fact, i think the gameplay was limited by their budget and size. it would have been a lot more free flowing if it wasn't promptbased though i guess it made it to appeal with more people because it's simple. in any case, any awards doesn't have to be the sole basis of playing games and appreciating them. people will always disagree with the awards whether they are decided by critics and experts or gamers themselves like the steam awards."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i voted that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"the whole thing is like that with all the games. everyone harps on about indie games being better than aaas and how much we should support them as gamers, fuck ea and etc, but when it comes to award time look at who won and was nominated? all of them are big studio names with well known ips. bottom line, is don't take them seriously people meme voted hitman 3 as best vr and that game was awful."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"not my personal choice but i'm not mad about it for a few reasons. the game managed to reach a demographic that does not usually play games, and i think that contributed a lot. my so, who is as nongamery as they get, really wanted me to get stray for her even before it was released. i was a bit hesitant at first because i told her if she doesn't end up playing it, i won't either just not my type of game. she actually spent 8h beating it and i was really impressed, with both her and the game itself. yes, for hardened gamers the gameplay certainly wasn't innovative in any way, but it was able to present very generic gaming tropes stealth, combat, puzzles, exploration to casuals without stressing them about it, while controlling a cute cat that can meow on demand. people joke about this, but my girlfriend absolutely smashed the meow button! all in all, when the game awards came around, i voted for stray here and there simply on my so's behalf."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i love cats but didn't love this game at all. it was super boring to me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"dont look at me, i voted for teardown"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,hearing people complain about what other people liked and voted for incessantly is really odd to be honest.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"cyberpunk even won an award, don't take them seriously"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"just like most game awards, these ones are voted by for by all kinds of people. thus including people you or i think are stupid."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,it is infuriatingly absurd how many incredible games are exclusive to playstation. in comparison to xbox exclusives well... there is no comparison. one is in the stratosphere while the other is lying facedown in a mud puddle.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-06,is this really what youre mad about????
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,cats are cute. i loved playing as a cat. i'm gonna vote for stray. i imagine that's how it got so many votes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,but do other games allow you to scratch couches?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i dont know, i spent way too much time in the fuck your carpet! mode that was pretty novel."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"yes the actual gameplay kinda sucks. you can only interact at certain parts. like you can't just jump on or off anything. only where the x is. concept, yes! gameplay 410"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,shouldnt be taken personally if your opinion is different. but thats the whole reason i use the internet!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"all award shows and the like are, which is why i stopped paying attention to them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,most awards that are voted upon are popularity contest.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"that's my running theory. that was the only category that stray was nominated in, so people voted for it to win that category because they wanted the game to win awards. the game's development was innovative for sure, but the gameplay wasn't."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"death stranding winning best game on the go is either a big joke that everyone is in on, or the people voting are idiots and took the category literally. probably a bit of both."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i was one of those that voted stray because i hadnt played any of the other games available to pick. if i had played more than one game in a line up for the other ones i obviously picked the best pick for that category. edit what should i have done then o wise reddit? vote for a game i had never played before? ignored? that doesnt really make sense because i really enjoyed stray, it was the first game i have ever platinumed. the game awards nominated it, i chose it, the end. why are people so pressed about this? the awards are about as useful as reddit awards. you didnt create the game, you arent the company that lost, so i really truly dont understand. these awards are not supposed to be serious, they are supposed to be fun. thanks reddit for trying to suck the fun out everything when you dont get your way"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"sure. still, i'm curious if it is 100 popularity contest, or 90 popularity  10 peopleactuallythinkthis."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"yeah, awards in general are usually industry bs, but the steam awards are especially bs. its just marketing for a storefront to push engagement."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"they did an award for outstanding visual style i've seen a post complaining about this award as well. the description for the award says the category is specifically for games that don't go for real world graphics, and spiderman miles morales won."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"well said i was trying to figure out how to articulate this. like, it's not innovative gameplay in terms of mechanics, but it is innovative gameplay in terms of atmosphere, perspective, etc. it feels unique in that respect, so it feels like it should win something. maybe the exact award category just doesn't exist."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"idk man, dedicated button to meow was pretty revolutionary"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"yeah my friends and i are guilty of that, we all voted stray for a bunch of categories that it didn't deserve to win, although we did enjoy the game very much"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"god damn it, stray has been on my backlog but i might have to push it up now xd"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,any source engine game i can keybind chat messages.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,innovation
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"gordy cuddley carnage also, okami had bark button."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i didnt forget one of the best aspects of the game but im now connecting it. best innovation  meow button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"stray owes everything it has, including the dedicated meow button, to time splitters 2 cat racing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i can do that, another sight."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i dunno man, luigi's mansion had a button to say mario? and that's pretty close"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,luigi's mansion had a call for mario button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"all awards are if you are a consumer. if they didn't exist, the games that won would still be amazing games regardless."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"no hate for stray, but comparing assassins creed and stray parkour system is really flattering to stray because it basically doesn't have such mechanic. all jumps are provided in advance, you just have to push one button. as you already said, you can't even fail. if you look at especially older acs their parkour system was really complex. yes, it was simplified in years but it remained in games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"it takes two was innovative, stray... not so much."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the whole game fails when they couldn't tell any story through actually being a cat and had to rely on robots talking to you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,contextual parkour
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"like, we also had stuff like neon white and cult of the lamb there. even the damn award literally says that this is for games that do not go for photorealistic graphics."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i think it worked well for telling the story, though id be interested to see what it would look like with different mechanics"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i should have considered the canine voters.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,its the only game my gf has ever beaten. tbh its the only game shes every played for more than a half hour. so it can have game of the year for me. it brought back memories of me finally beating super mario world like 25 years ago. nobody forgets their first game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-10,"neon white, an fpsplatformer that utilizes a weaponcard system that double as your movement options. highly stylized and plays like a dream, providing joy and challenge from casual play to speedruns. teardown  a sortof destruction simulator. everything in the game is voxelbased and allows complete and totally destruction of building elements to complete challenges in a variety of ways. the other two, i'm not so familiar mb 2 bannerlord and dome keeper."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i'd argue that mb2, even though it's a sequel and not that different from mb1, is still weirdly unique in its mechanics. i've yet to find anything that i would call a mountbladelike. in context of the rest of the industry, its combination of mechanics still feels fresh and original to me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"not sure you really get what teardown did, and no it absolutely could not be a minecraft mod. teardown comes towards a very very technical level of innovation, where the performance and density of the destruction is what made it technically innovative. plus, well, setting up and destroying things to create paths for a speed timed heist, is very new. or as far as i know, have not seen any other game do anything similar."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,have you actually played teardown?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,not even trying to be edgy but was there ever a time when gaming awards mattered...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,please tell me you're joking?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"exactly. i got my own goty, xenoblade 3. and i don't care which game wins any of the other goty's."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i didn't play gow but you might be right. elden ring is the most overhyped game i ever played.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,nothing you described is innovative. we've had all that in games for generations.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i didn't. i got really excited by the thumbnail and title. but then i skimmed some playthroughs and was disappointed in the gameplay. what did you find fresh about it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,unique? yes. innovative? no. source i played it to the end.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,and reddit posts
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i dont see the problem
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,that's 100 how it went down. that or a lack of understanding on what the word innovative meant.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"well, there is that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,no specifically but i am really bad at setting up vr
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i did not know this was in the game. i'm going to be purchasing and doing this after work. thanks!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i don't really agree with that. the gameplay was quite solid in my estimation.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"idk why this is downvoted, this game truly triggers people"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,the game sucks because you cant bunnyhop as a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,but thats the whole reason i use the internet! wait. that's why you are here? i'm here for a different thing. i don't like you therefore..
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"clearly, award shows that arent all playerchoice produce more sensible results than this. i like awards. people act like award shows suck because it should be this perfect objective thing but thats an impossible standard. i like them for what they are. theyre there to give people recognition for their work. and it gets people talking and thinking about what they value in games, what makes a great game, etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,people hate the oscars because it isn't a popularity contest. coda won last year and only did 2 million at the box office.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,check out how the bafta winners are chosen.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"what this list really tells me is even the people who buy cod know it's not that great a franchise, else it would have won at least once right?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,thats like voting tacos as the best burger of 2020 because you hadnt eaten anything other than tacos.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"10 would fit well, since a cat simulator that is actually a fully polished game hasn't been done before, although gameplay is just basic puzzles. but in the end yeah, it is basically a popularity contest. the steam awards don't really mean anything anyway. i could give gow2 the legendary odysseyan award for best beard in a game. it means just as much"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"what it should probably tell you is that there was a game that filled a huge gap that didnt have enough representation versus the interest. the internet loves cats. its a game about an endearing cat. so really your question should be given these results, why are there not 1,000 cat simulations out there?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"most innovative is certainly an overstatement. in a way, songs of conquest offered more innovation despite only setting out to recapture homm3. i'm sure there are more innovative games out there but that is just one that came to mind on top of my head. realistically only games with enough exposure win such awards and taking that into consideration i don't think it's silly. in skyrim i ran over many tables in my kajiit playthrough but the button prompts always suggested picking up the items. no, i want the game to expect me to throw them on the ground. i'm playing a cat damnit. it was about time that there is a game with proper cat gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yea that seems backwards for sure
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i've seen posts complaining about pretty much every award at this point. god of war, the skywalker saga, and elden ring may be the only games that reddit is happy they won"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,and spiderman miles morales won well you can activate a into the spiderverse filter by wearing a special suit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"that's mostly just art direction and regular old direction, which i agree is something the game excelled at. innovative gameplay isn't even close and is probably the game's weakest area."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"innovative gameplay in terms of atmosphere, perspective, etc. that's not gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"as an older gamer with kids, wife, and other responsibilities, my time is limited to play games. it's hard for me to get into new games that take time to be successful at. i used to love rpgs and now i find myself struggling to start witcher 3, rdr2, etc. for me, stray, was an outstanding game since the 12ish hours that it took to beat was more like a few weeks for me and i truly value the immersion of the games i do play. i don't have much time to lose myself so when i do spend those precious few hours, i like that i can forget about my surroundings and get lost in a different place. stray was really fun for this even if it was easy and linear. for what it's worth, i love hell let loose which is far from easy and linear but is similarly immersive. the action of playing the game is more important than the action of completing it. and i agree that there should be a reward for games that offer this type of experience. stray definitely a great one for it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i wouldn't call them dumb or blind... people probably knew what they were doing when they voted stray for this award. trolls gonna troll.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,kudos to admitting it but im still gonna downvote you for that .
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,thats not funny
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,the honk could get modified by certain items. this makes it objectively superior to the meow button.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,okami has a bark button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i thought heavy rain did it first with the dedicated shaun button?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,look at my pfp... i know about honk button.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i remember some 2d duck platform battle royale game on switch having a quack button. stray is far from the first.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,the first south park rpg had a dedicated honk button as well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,duck game did it first
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,okami had a bark button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"duck game has always had a quack button, also you can modify the pitch of it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,so did gta 1 iirc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"between that, the movement, and context sensitive prompts to push things off ledges they really captured the essence of being a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i read that as portal 2 at first and thought there was something about that game i had yet to discover.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,nice. right up there with heavy rain and untitled goose game then
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,scarface already did that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,its honestly a really fun game. it wasnt worth full price as its neither long nor complex enough for me... but it was fun and beautiful all the same.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,if anything it's a good way to find a bunch of games people have enjoyed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"it's an oversimplification to be sure, but it's basically the same press parkour to parkour system. that said, i played the assassin's creed games when they were coming out and haven't touched the series since assassin's creed 3, so i'm probably overgeneralizing due to a foggy memory, here."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"hmm, i wonder what mirrors edge would be like if the protagonist was a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,how so? enjoyed the game  but i struggle to see why that was innovative. what was in takes two that hadn't been done before?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"yeah. honestly, it should have won that category. the forced twoplayer coop is a major selling point for it. me and my brother had an insane amount of fun playing it. especially the dark laughter at that one scene. you know the one if you played it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"really enjoyed it takes two. also a way out was really cool in how it handled coop, similarly. and it's made by the same guys! there needs to be more games like that for sure"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"honestly, the protagonist being a cat is something they should have leaned into more heavily than they did. keep the robot talk incomprehensible and make the little floating bastard treat you like an actual cat, basically whizzing to objectives and convincing you to hit switches for puzzles and stuff with a laser pointer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yep. this bendy game also had cool looking graphics.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"as a huge mb fan, bannerlord doesnt really innovate on its predecessor in any significant way. most of the new features were still incomplete and didnt work years after release."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,how many voxel games have you seen or played? voxel demolition games are pretty common.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"bannerlord in that list is also a technical level of innovation, where they made up to 1000 technically 2048 but due to horses having their own ai you are only allowed up to 1000 npcs fight each other, correctly calculate this each time one of them hits the other relative speed of weapon to target perks of attacker perks of defender perks effecting both of them via party leaders and formation leaders as well as banners armor of defender weapon skill of the attacker which body part is hit base damage of weapon. damage type of weapon. for 1000 npcs, they also do pathfinding, threat assesment, following orders of the party leader, calculate their perks for movement speed of the units movement speed also calculates equipment load and both you and ai pick up weapons when they need to so it can change during gameplay. all of this needs to happen at the same time smoothly for the game to even work and it does pretty smoothly. not to mention every npc even has cloth physics enabled. every single one of them. all of this are massive achievements technically. whenever i see people online esp in reddit not understanding how hard it is to make it work smoothly and downplay the games innovation like that i get a bit sad as a programmer. there is massive work in there that make it all possible and some people think it is the same game with a bit more polish. gameplay mechanics are not that different but technical improvement is massive, even compared to other titles from way bigger studios."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i've watched other people play.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,so youre literally bitching about a game you never played?! go take some midol and sit the fuck down
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"read the thread, dude. you're just completely wrong on this. next time maybe form an opinion on something you played."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,more innovative than anything else really
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,you can also get a paper bag stuck on your head which is apparently the funniest thing my 4 year old has ever seen
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,he's not a bunny he's a cat. have you even played it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"to me, they suck because they're bloated and masturbatory, and are more about the commercial ads and product placement than they are the actual awards or winners. for every minute of awarding and acceptance speeches, there must be 5 of skitstrailersads. not to mention how many official awards shows are mostly bribe competitions between dev studios amd the award authorities"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,thing about award shows though is that they're filled with people who likely never even played any of the games. why should they decide as opposed to people who at least play them.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"clearly, award shows that arent all playerchoice produce more sensible results than this you should read up on prestigious film awards. to win an oscar, it's generally a marketing campaign worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars aimed at a few thousand people in hollywood who vote for the films. all that time, effort, and money is spent wooing all the known judges and their network of friends and acquaintances, in order to get them a little more positively disposed towards certain movies.  most oscar awardwinning movies get awards not because they were good, but because people spent an unholy amount of time and money wooing the judges. this is one of the reasons foreign films almost never win the oscar  even though many of them are standout quality above their peers, the people who make them generally don't have the time or money or connections to run an efficient oscar campaign. unlike their hollywoodmade peers.  tldr the oscars are a popularity contest among a few thousand hollywood insiders that people connected in the movie industry spend an absurd amount of money and time trying to win over."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,award shows should have a mix of both. start with people voting for games that sold x amount of copies so that way shitty shovelware doesnt get nominated as a joke. then the judges can take the top 100 games and narrow that down and let the people vote again. it wont be perfect but i think it will be alright
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,meh. the best animated film oscar has been quite clearly be shown that the voters dont even watch the nominees in a lot of cases. they jsut see disneypixar or dreamworks and check the box.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,people will find a way to bitch no matter what
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"the academy awards are still a popularity contest, just not one that the general public can vote in. the problem is that award shows always insist on creating awards that are entirely subjective and people take it all way too seriously."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"cod is a great franchise, it's just not trying to be goty material. it's the snackfood of games while things like elden ring are steak. you're supposed to play cod a lot to get used to it and get good. it's light so you can keep munching all day and it's great at staying interesting and fun despite playing for hours every day with your friends. on the other hand, games that win goty are typically amazing crafted experiences that are great because they end and you can judge the game as a whole. you're satisfied after a good steak while chips just leave you reaching for a new bag."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"there are years where i wonder how cod stays the most sold game, in particular 2021, 2017, and 2016. but still i legitimately think that a number of cod entries are worthy of at least a nomination for goty.  cod 4 needs no introduction.  world at war kicked off the zombies trend for the industry  modern warfare 2019 for the clean house mission"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,not a really a fan of tacos so in this case i wouldnt vote at all. and why should i have to play every game in the line up in order to vote? its the game awards fault for even nominating stray. what sold me over for innovative gameplay though is dedicated meow button.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i'm not completely happy with god of war even being on the ballot. i understand that it was only added to steam in 2022, but it's still a 4 year old game. but that's just my opinion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"elden ring has a great story...not! didn't play the others but can only day from my personal experience, i didn't like nor was the story impressionable at all for me in elden ring. does that count towards anything in regards to reddit being happy...? lol. the only thing i still remember now is the combat and ranni. you barely see melina nor affect her storychoice at all which is just disappointing for how importanthype she is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"you shouldnt get downovoted. gameplay is in most cases defined as a way player interacts with the game and is distictive from graphic, music, artstyle or atmosphere."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i think you have a borked concept of time tbh, 12 hours? unless you spent 6 hours scratching the couches i don't see it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,and a pee button and a poop button and you can draw dicks on the screen at will perfect game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,ico would like a word.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i dont know if i can trust a goose
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"its called duck game, it isnt a battle royale but a multiplayer round based game think stick fight, and it was on pc long before it was on switch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,and both south park rpgs
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"this. it felt innovative. fairly common gameplay mechanics felt totally different because of the cat flavor added by the free parkour, the size and scale of the environment, and the fast pace."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,and it's actually an integral part of the gameplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i got it for free with ps. i would not have paid money for it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,stray climbing is closer to god of war than to assasins creed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,coop gameplay where you pivot between a wide variety of radically asymmetric gameplay modes? what game has done that before?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,played it with my girl... it was so much fun!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,lol. i felt so bad and cried laughing with my boyfriend. we had so much fun with that whole game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"you mean !elephant queen!, right?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"within its own franchise, i absolutely agree. it was more of the same, with a little more polish. it didn't innovate on itself at all. what i do appreciate though is its uniqueness when viewed in the lens of the rest of the games industry. it's still a unique combination that nobody else has really replicated or made successful. maybe i'm just mislabeling that as innovative. if there are other games out there with the same grand campaign structure, i would absolutely love to hear about them and play them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"so is your take, that because there's voxels and you can destroy them, that teardown isn't very innovative? there's quite a bit more going on than this face value perspective. very reductive. dome keeper has 2d voxels with destruction too. it's terraria with mods and a new engine. see how that works? it's easy to be reductive. in both of these games, what make's them unique is what you do with the voxels and why. in teardown your often not just destroying stuff, your often building paths via destruction using very limited resources, all in order to find the fastest path to complete a heist speedrun. that is what i have not seen any other games do, and what i would call most certainly innovative. plus, the innovation of the tech used. you can't get anything at the scale of destruction teardown has, anywhere else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"teardown isn't a game good to just watch, honestly. most of it's fun comes from the freedom the impressive destruction system provides. i've never seen such an astounding physics system combined with raytracing. it definitely got my vote for most innovative. we've never seen such a physics system before."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,most of the top comments say that it won because you play a cat and not because it has tight gameplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,im genuinely curious what part of it comes across as a new method or an original method to a game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,worst troll award 2023
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"where is the evidence of bribery? i see some pretty dumb decisions from the oscars or grammys, but the decisions of major video game award showspublications generally make sense to me. even when i strongly disagree with an outcome, i can understand it. ive never seen or read of any evidence of bribery and the outcomes have never led me to suspect it. i dont generally watch award shows all the way through, i watch some clips. having said thatand not knowing what the full extent of commercials and product placement may bei cannot see what your problem would be with trailers. showing off upcoming games is great. combining it with awards is great. the trailers bring a bigger audience to appreciate the nominees and winners, the awards bring a bigger audience to check out upcoming games. seems like a good thing to me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"yea most of them are. there are more reliable ones tho like gdc, bafta etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,they're filled with people who likely never even played any of the games. how did you come to that conclusion?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,the oscars seem obviously shittier than the game awards.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,is judge a fulltime job? because how would a judge screen 100games per year and make a competent decision?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-06,"i like awards but definitely not all award shows. like, the game awards are good. the oscars make more questionable decisions on a regular basis. grammys too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i'll be with you on world at war, the zombies trend as you've put it although i'd further it to horde modes in general came on light years just because of what it did. i've not played any since blops 3 they were consistently ahead of the game in creating a world inside a horde mode that kept me interested past simply beating my score, i wanted to find the easter eggs and get a feel for the howwhy of the zombies universe. cod 4 did completely turn the fps genre on its head but from a personal level i don't think i enjoy it as much as more traditional fps and i haven't played mw2019 so don't know the mission."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,untitled goose game has a honk button
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,so... an emote button? not that innovative
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,he's talking about ragnarok. no one's giving gow 2018 awards in 2022.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,you can trust me when i say that not trusting me is one of the smartest things you can do.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,duck game should of been nominated imo. innovative duck play.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i paid 25 and it was worth it. much rather a short sweet game than a 70 game bloated with 100 hours of nothing hi ubisoft!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"but that's not innovative anymore than gluing a clock onto a hammer is innovative. all been done before in their component parts, this was just mushing them together albeit expertly mushing them together. and i'm not down on the game, but i don't see the innovation here other than, as i said, combining existing things in one game. but really my point is that real innovation in games are few and far between. i agree stray isn't very innovative, but neither is takes two"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,yep. it's so over the top it crosses the line twice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"for so many people, that was a mm no that's not good i don't like this moment. i thought it found refuge in audacity."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"yeah the mb combat system is still one of the best around, and still by far the best of any game ive seen when it comes to mounted combat. and while id call that innovative when it was first released like 14 years ago, bannerlord imo didnt do much to innovate on it. if there was a category for best combatgameplay, you could definitely put bannerlord in the convo there since its still mb."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"i don't think i was being unfairly reductive. the gameplay loop is destroying voxels to complete heists. the to complete heists part is innovative, and the polish of voxel destruction is excellent. scale of technology isn't innovative, it's iterative. i'm not saying iterative tech isn't important or an achievement in itself, but it's not the same as creating something brand new. don't get me wrong, there is innovation here and teardown deserves a nomination. i just don't think it deserved a win as much as stray or dome keeper do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"im genuinely curious how you dont see it as more unique than all the other big games this year. all the others were, while good, your run of the mill 1st or 3rd person fare, all playing as humans with generic combat and movement mechanics."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,that's not trolling.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"trailers aren't really the problem, they're just a piece of the whole. i don't have a problem with trailers at all. i have a problem with holding tga up on a pedestal like they're the final authority on game quality when they're being paid to dole out awards as a marketing tool to sell primetime adspace to companies with new trailers to show off. it's the same problem i have with superbowl commercials. how much money did kojima productions pay tga to reveal death stranding 2? how much did fromsoftware pay to reveal armored core vi? the trailers were sick, sure, but like... let's not pretend they're doing it out of the kindness of their hearts. award shows usually exist as a thing to attach highly viewed adspace to. and trailers are not the only type of ad they run, there's plenty of traditional advertising during breaks and product placement during the show itself. it's how they make money. they would not put on an award show unless they could make money"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i don't know if they are right or wrong, but i wouldn't be surprised unless the judges are paid fulltime jobs i don't see them coincidentially playing all the nominated games properly"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,well i play a lot of games every year and every judge wouldnt play the exact same games so that would cover a lot of them. then for ones they havent played they can look up a review by someone competent

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,mixing components together creates new gameplay loops that didn't exist before. if we really boil it all down then nothing released in the past 10 years was really original.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,that's like saying the cell phone wasn't an innovation because it's just mushed together technologies that already existed. or maybe electric vehicles aren't innovative because motors run by batteries and cars already existed. that's such a weird argument. the fact that no one stuck those elements together like that before and made it work so well is the innovation.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,i did see it as unique. i said that in my first comment. i just dont see it as innovative
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,of course they wouldnt put on an award show if they could not make some money. theyre not gonna do it for free. but how would that money influence the voting? the game awards as an entity is distinct from the voting outlets which all vote anonymously. its primarily the editorial staff of dozens of media outlets that cover games doing the voting.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,it's how they make money. they would not put on an award show unless they could make money that was the reply that was floating in my head while reading your comment. but then you wrote it yourself at the end. now i am confused x200b x200b do you not consume any forms of entertainment that only exist because it makes money?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"so a 3d cat puzzle platformer with a realistic cat is, by exactly the same definition, great innovation. the fact that no one stuck those elements together like that before and made it work so well is the innovation."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"and as i have said more than once now, its more innovative and unique than the competition. i would argue its innovative because it introduced a lot of people to walking simulators. a lot of people who previously were not into walking simulators because they had false preconceptions about them being slow and boring"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"the purchasing of the adspace is what i am referring to. most businesses are savvy enough to bribe while skirting legality, so they do it through coercion or other means. i don't believe a company should be allowed within 100 yards of an award show ad if any of their or their susbidiaries' products are up for any category. not to mention, those publications and media outlets doing the voting are also convinced to write good reviews. not every time, but a lot of the time. from a comment in an ancient reddit thread  the reviewers are never offered money for a high review score. that is inefficient and obvious. the way it happens is that the pr at the gaming companies puts subtle pressure on the review sites to keep the scores high. they create conditional review embargos you can't release your review before x date unless the score is higher than 80, buy ads on the site, and the gaming sites are reliant on the developers for content. so there is a lot of pressure to keep developers happy on the business end."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"dont you ever question all this hostility towards games media and how much it is driven by pure speculation? yes i do, in general reddit comments almost always are jumping to conclusions and their authors do not reflect even when called out. x200b happens to myself also from time to time. i also sometimes forget that fact when i read a good comment that confirms my previous prejudices x200b that said, to properly gauge for example goty although it depends on the games you would have to put in 50100hours into an eldenring so you can compare it to another game. that summed up, combined with the games sometimes being unavailable on the same platform is another hurdle, etc..."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"nope, as pointed out elsewhere, this is assassin's creed as a cat without the violence. it's just a skin"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"the cat is a skin. it acts like a cat in the first half an hour of the game's runtime and is basically not actually a cat after that in terms of how it addresses the situation. i've got a pretty fucking smart cat. it's even orange! but that little motherfucker does not have the brain capacity to find a random robot the clothing it needs to help it sneak my cat into a factory so he can metal gear his way through flying robots to get a specific, guarded battery. just as an example. it's not a realistic cat, and they didn't frame it as one."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"you said you havent played it, but debar the gameplay? having played it to completion i can say its like most generic rpgs in terms of game play. just that your a cat. go to area a talk to npc 1 go find npc 2 return to npc 1 solve problem, go to area b rinse, wash, repeat. get new tool to use as you progress. its really doing nothing new in terms of game play except that your a cat. also introducing someone to something is not innovative. im saying it does literally nothing new except you being a cat. im not saying the game was bad, i enjoyed my time with it enough. just does nothing i havent seen before in many other games, thus, making it not innovative."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"when i look at past goty nominees and winners at the game awards, these things do not seem like real barriers. exclusives routinely win botw gow 18 which beat out rdr2 tlou2. hard games that plenty of critics will bounce off of win sekiro elden ring. and long games win botw elden ring. of course not every person in every voting outlet has played every nominee. but they probably average more games than actual players do. and both the nominees and the outcomes generally seem reasonable. when i look at all the different award shows together and their different results i just think yeah, makes sense. occasionally it does look like one of these factors difficulty, exclusivity may have pushed things in some direction, eg, sekiro losing to untitled goose game in some award shows. but it cant be perfect and its not supposed to be. i think a lot of gamers just have this territorial attitude and resentment towards games critics and award shows, maybe because they imagine, consciously or subconsciously, that their intense love of games qualifies them to not only do the job of a critic but do it better. but i dont think so. i think a lot of gamers with this attitude have tunnel vision. one, they assume that their opinions are universalsee the backlash to all tlou2s goty wins, like it had to be rigged except a lot of people voted for it in the players choice category. im not a fan of the game, it doesnt embody what i value in games, and i truly did not enjoy it. but it got its awards fairly. frankly, the players get it wrong too. there have been some cases in the last few years where i think players wildly overrated or underappreciated something but the critics went the other way. and although that it is just my opinion, it also validates the critics. theyre speaking to something that a group of players that includes me will understand and agree with, and that means theyre doing their jobs, same as when they give tlou2 10s. that may not vibe with me, but a lot of people feel that way. basically i just think theres way too much unjustified hostility and distrust directed toward games journalismcriticsaward shows. were all gonna have strong disagreements with them sometimes, because we all have different tastes and values. a bunch of people think deathloop is meh and got way better reviews than it deserved, well, i think those people never understood the games purpose and that it presents some of the best innovations to the immersive sim genre ever. critics gave ghost of tsushima good reviews, gamers go further and call it a masterpiece, i think its incredibly meh on almost every level. theres always going to be some amount of disagreement. we should be able to stick to substance and argue our views without waging a culture war. because it really is often completely detached from any substance or purpose beyond attacking games journalism. an example, i remember seeing people on the doom sub absolutely obsessed with how terrible the gameplay in igns review video for doom eternal was. and there was some argument around the idea that a critic needs to really be good at a game to review it fairly i get this to some extent, as i do think its impossible to fully appreciate a game until youre good at it, and doom eternal takes multiple playthroughs to really understand it. but ign gave it a 9, and its not realistic to demand that a critic replay a game on its hardest difficulty multiple times before scoring it. everything written in the review was accurate. what was the problem? its just this territorial thing. because sometimes you can read a criticism and know the person is wrong because they are unknowingly just describing their novice playlike if someone describes a game as slow andor clunky but you can blitz through it with the grace of a ballerinabut i rarely see that in reviews from mainstream outlets. i see it a lot from players. if game critics are held back from experiencing the best of a game by their lack of skill, they do a good job of hiding it maybe they understand if something isnt clicking for them, they might be the problem. theyre open to that. players, by contrast, are quick to complain that a game sucks because xyz feels wrong, and even if you know exactly what theyre talking about, and you tell them yes, that goes away once you get better, they stick to their guns. they are very bad at considering that their knowledge may be incomplete."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,everything you just said is wrong. its not an rpg nor is it generic. it was popular because it was so unique and new
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-04,"thats a fair point tbh. though people are taking this whole thing way too seriously, its supposed to be fun, not countless posts raging about it. cat game won cuz they put it on ps, plus its a cat game. that was the entire reason it won. as for cyberpunk, total popularity contest there too. but who cares, its not like a single person in this comment section is or even knows someone who was a developer in one of the games that lost. theyre just getting mad for no reason."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,answer asunamyag's question. what game did this?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,bruh read the dudes damn post. he said multiple times its unique just not innovative. gawd damn. and the man is right. i got bored once i got past the first robot village. shits a fetch quest game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,i literally listed 5 games in the post you are replying to. what more do you want exactly?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,bruh read my damn post. i have said multiple times now that it is innovative. it introduced a huge number of people to a previously very niche genre. the same cant be said of any of the other contenders.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"innovative invdiv adjective of a product, idea, etc. featuring new methods advanced and original. innovative designs of a person introducing new ideas original and creative in thinking. i think you definition of innovative is a little bit skewed. also i never said anything about it not introducing people to the genre just that it does nothing new in the genre apart from making the player a cat, which is also not a new thing, just not common."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,except it did innovate. name one other game where you play as a cat with such fluid and well done catlike movement. that extremely new idea introduced tons of new people to a genre they otherwise likely wouldnt have played and its entirely why it was so popular.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-05,"i do agree completely that the cat animations are unique and good but that is just mocap and done well. in terms of game it is not innovative. thats creative and unique. it does not add to the game outside of new animations which are made all the time. if you look at the unreal asset store there are tons of really good cat animations as well as tons of other animals here is a video to one such asset that any dev can download and put in their game and if they wanted to put the player in control of httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vv2xu8lpowkhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vv2xu8lpowk again, the game is unique, not innovative. they have done nothing new and ground break or original. there are other games where you can play as a cat and roam around, think tokyo jungle, animations are not as fluid ill agree there but you can, if you choose, roam around as a cat. or calico where you can ride a cat but the cat animations look just like a cat. if you replace the cat with a humanor orc, elf, ect the gameplay would be the same. now if they made it where you live as a cat, go out and hunt like a cat, and live life as a cat onlyrealistically that is, tokyo jungle kind off does this. that i could say is innovative. i will say again, and probably for the last time as you seem die hard stuck on this and i have other things i can be doing with my time. the game is unique. the game is good. the game does nothing new other than make you a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-06,"im done arguing with you. ive given you multiple reasons why it was innovative and unique and you refuse to see reality. you keep making up arbitrary bullshit to refuse admitting the truth. youre disingenuous and vapid, and youre not worth wasting my time on any further."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"this game is so good i still remember it fondly and platinumed it on ps, i liked it so much that i'm thinking to buy it just to give anna purna's sh my money cause they deserve every cents of it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i love this game. when the kitty disappears for the last time.... i feel something very strong and i don't know what it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,it was a very fun game. i look forward to seeing more of this world and this cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i played this the day after my cat died, even found a mod to make the cat look like mine. it was a beautiful game that hit me hard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,this is a great game. i havent finished but a very good story so far. love these kind of stories.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,one of my favorite games even though it was so short. i'm hoping they make another.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"stray was my 2022 game of the year and is number 16 on my personal top 50 games of all time list. absolutely adore that game. teared up at the end, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"really enjoyed this one. the way the story was told and the atmosphere of the world. definitely recommend playing through it, and it's short enough you can probably finish it in a weekend."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"one of the best games i have finished in recent years. perfect length for the story.. i'd recommend watching some making of's on yt, there are some cute scenes, with the cat actor in its motion capture suit.. some scenes in the game are just random things the cat did while filming.."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,plus the music slaps
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,if anyone has not heard open the skyhttpsyoutu.beb2tcdn9mbq?sipygs4hg3l1foqjwm by stupendium i strongly recommend it. an awesome emotional song based on the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i hope they never make a sequel to this game, but i'd take a dozen or so spiritual successors that follow the same formula. such a relaxing and atmospheric experience from start to finish"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i just finished it. was amazing. hope for more!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"loved the game, but i don't think it was that simple at some places, still puts up a challenge"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,perfect short peaceful and slightly different game. except for that one damn achievement
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,oh i love this game  it's just that it gives me motion sickness after 5 minutes!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,loved it! and love cats!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,still my favourite indie game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"oh man, you should try get a vr headset and play moss. you help a white mouse called quill to find her missing uncle in an enchanted forest. every tiny little thing is so lovingly animated, and quill is so adorable, you get a genuine cuteness overload playing that game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i need to plays this game, such cute"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,really immersive game indeed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i played this game shortly after my cat passed away. it's very close to my heart, and the ending was beautiful and emotional."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,"absolutely loved the atmosphere. a rare, simple game that doesn't bore you for what it is. the atmosphere, music,, environmental settings and concept arts just makes you keep going till the end."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,so mad they didnt leave it in the psn store for later members to get they just basically put it right on the normal purchase smh my psn ran out that exact month
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,whys it look like he has lips
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,one of the best soundtracks too. especially the club music! httpsyoutu.bencgs9ruodx8?sit1nciii3f3j6jvw
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,a lovely little adventure
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"yes, this game was really great, i was pretty disappointed when it was over. i hope there is a sequel in the works as i think ive read."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i sobbed violently through the second half of the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,an amazing game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,it really bothered me that you still talk to everyone like normal through the backpack. it made it feel like you were playing as a person in a cat suit instead of as a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,imagine a warriors game series in this style
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-03,"i really was surprised by the game, but i enjoyed it quite a bit"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,sounds whimsical.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i was sad at the part where kitty had to say goodbye to one of his friends.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,the only thing i hated about stray was how linear it was. it really felt like the same gameplay everytime.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"most of the trophies are cat puns and i throughly enjoyed that, game is good too i guess"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i found it pretty average, a fun first time experience in a small studio puzzle game. won't be revisiting and forgot about it not long after finishing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,one big cutscene it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"honestly though? it's really overhyped. i played the game as soon as it came out on my ps4 and was pretty underwhelmed. i mean i get it, i have a cat and playing as a cat is a novel experience and shit but charging 30 bucks for a game the size of a dlc is just daylight robbery."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,does it a game? i thought it is a movie! can i play on mobile?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,yeah i want to experience this but i hate cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i find it nice to have some short games here and there. it's a nice break. some games just drag on for too long. titanfall 2 and portal 2 are perfect examples of short games where their length only made me appreciate them more. but gimme some more baldur's gate and zelda too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"while it was a little short, they didn't charge full price for it either, so i'm pretty happy with what i got"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i also thought it was quite expensive for the short game duration but otherwise it was fun!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"absolutely worth it, we should support studios who make unique games, hopefully a sequel or something new!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,i bought a copy around christmas for this exact reason. it was on sale from amazon and wanted to give them credit for making a good game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-07-21,its nice to support indie studios.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"sense of happiness they found they're way out, but sad your journey has come to end with the four leg friend"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,jeez. i would not want to wreck myself so hard as that. i guess people can be pretty different.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i bought this to play with my cat. she died before we got the chance and i can't bring myself to play it now
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"mine died too shortly before the game came out, and i couldn't handle the game. i still can't, hurts too damn much."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,share the top 50 list please d
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,"just got catch catch me a few hours ago, took me at least 30mins. honestly one of worst most random bs chance based ones i've even experienced"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"hollow knight edges it out for me, but only just."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,for me that was a nice change of pave for once but i get that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"that's why you should wait for games to go in sale, i did an was worth the 19 for me"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,you can't play it on mobile but you can probably find full gameplay without any commentary on youtube.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,i dont think so. it's a console game you can get on steam.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,there is a movie called strays but its unrelated
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,titanfall 2 3
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,try inside
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"that could be. but i'm not sure. there's also the cat's lifespan is short, and his adventure forgotten soon. the loss of humanity. the thousand years the robots were trapped. it's a lot of stuff mixed. i slept in that last sleep spot and watched the entire animation of the ceiling opening. what a game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-01,took me days to get!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-02-29,"i think i did? i'll check it again later, but it is the problem of low visual angle i guess."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-05-14,dogs can see and take interest in the tv now because of its high resolution and i think partly because of a new refresh rate. before they saw tv screens the way we would if we recorded it in a camcorder with horizontal lines pulsing up it. now they can actually see it the same way we do. i used to put videos of birds and squirrels picking at seeds and i had to stop because my cats jumped at the tv.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i recently finished chants of sennaar and was impressed by how much it moved me. i thought it was going to be a language puzzle solver but had no idea it would have stealth or horror segments too. it also did a good job at pointing out bias and how language connects people. the opening area starts with a conflict between the devotees and the warriors. the warriors are being assholes and not letting the devotees go to their god. the warriors brandish weapons and threaten the devotees, so you have to sneak past them to enter the fortress. but... the devotees have a temple in the first area with parts that are off limits. they kick you out if you trespass, so why can't the warriors do the same thing? maybe it's a misunderstanding? after sneaking through the fortress and learning the warrior language, you learn things about them to make them more relatable. they love music, they traveled far due to their own devotion to their duty, and they simply aren't sure whether the devotees are good or not. once you bridge the gap between languages and help them connect, !the warriors open the gates for the devotees and allow them into the fortress, and warriors enter the abbey to enjoy the music.! i also loved how each tribe had different names for each other. like how the warriors believe the tribe above them are the chosen ones, but that tribe calls themselves !bards, a people who cherish art and music, and look down on other tribes.! the chosen ones have a beautiful area, but the cracks begin to show eventually  bullying, a caste system, people unwilling to help those beneath them. and then the ending of the game uses the lines drawn between each tribe to form words in each language. like how the connections between everyone form the devotee word for !god! and then show the word for !duty! to the warriors. it was a nice message about how we all more or less want the same thing, even if we have different points of view."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"mount and blade bannerlord i had never heard of this game until last year. when i first played it i was kind of unimpressed with the combat. you start as a tribal warrior with a small band of troops, chasing down bandits and running errands for various townspeople. i felt like i died in battle pretty quickly. but that was because i had bad armor and weapons and a slow, unarmored horse. theres a big map you move your party around. if you encounter bandits you can engage them, and it loads a battlefield where a battle is simulated that you take part in as a commander. you can position your troops, have them charge or retreat or form a shield wall. its fun! eventually a lord invites you to serve as a mercenary for their kingdom in a war, where you can start chasing down parties of enemy kingdoms who are real troops, not just looters in rags with farm tools, and take part in 100 on 100 battles, and raiding villages to disrupt the supply lines of enemy kingdoms. if you perform well enough, you can ask to be made a vassal to your kingdom. then you can start raising armies to besiege castles and cities. now im having 1,000 on 1,000 battles. i have a massive party of elite troops who can take fortified castles defended by 400 men and only lose 40 men. i kill 120 soldiers myself in battles by rushing behind the lines to target their archers. i havent been this into a game in a long, long time."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this is a game i've never heard anyone talk about. it's called stories untold. it's a modern text based game very clearly inspired by nostalgia for the original genre. i don't even really know how to describe it without spoilers but it was fucking awesome and truly unique. the first chapter is actually pretty scary horror even though you're just sitting typing on a computer. and the game surprised me with it's actual meaning at the end, which i thought was really really beautifully done. it's a game i've had friends over to play through as it's relatively short and everyone's always has an oh shit moment at the end. very worth the sale price on steam and only takes a short sitting to finish."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the first game that ever caught me completely off guard in a whole not just one mission was red dead redemption 2, which has been my favorite game for years now. my brother played it first when it came out but didnt spoil it for me. i played it because at the time we had a shared xbox one with not a lot of space and it was one of the few games on there. there are so many twists and turns in that game that i cant even begin to summarize all of them. the main one was what really got me. even after finding out in saint denis, i was in denial. i thought ! you cant kill the only playable character in a video game ! because i had never even seen that before. but you absolutely can, and they did. i am so heartbroken about it every time i play. its kind of like rewatching revenge of the sith and hoping anakin doesnt turn to the dark side. also doki doki literature club. i bought it because i kept seeing how good it was and wanted to see how a dating simulator could be good. i never read the reviews, tags, or summary which label it as psychological horror so i had no idea it wasnt actually a dating sim. i named my character phoenix. when i saw sayori in her room my heart actually dropped. seeing yuri in the hallway, hearing monika talk about it along with everything else that happens. the absolute craziest part for me was when monika called me by my real name instead of phoenix. now i know they just read your computer files, but at the time i hadnt built my own computer yet and had no idea that was possible. probably the best game to go in blind to, but has a lot of violence and other triggering things in it that its not wise to do"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"soma. oh man... i didn't expect anything special from this game. i just wanted it to be as good as outlast or observer, and not as terrible as layers of fear no offense to the fans, but the game is not scary at all, plot is incredibly boring, and my protg's limping walk made me sick. it was supposed to be a simple walking simulator with horror elements with my favorite underwater theme. and in terms of design game is amazing. the underwater gameplay segments look natural, there is no feeling that the water surrounding the character is just an imposed color filter. and the way the design of the buildings changes as the characters go deeper enhances the feeling of presence. what i will definitely remember for the rest of my life is the elevator ride into the abyss. as for the plot... damn. i don't even know how to clearly express my thoughts. the game managed to make me feel diametrically opposed things. on the one hand, it was incredibly immersive  i was the one exploring the world, i was fighting for my life, i was making very difficult and heartbreaking decisions, not simon. on the other hand, every time i watched simon and catherine communicate, the game reminded me that this is their journey, their story. and i am just an outside observer who helps this story happen. i will not go into details of the plot, because i do not want to spoil anything for those who have not played yet. i will just say that the game more than once made me stop and think hard about what i just saw and heard. by the end of the story, simon and catherine became almost family to me. i worried about them, more than about myself. the final moment on fi made me stare blankly at the screen while the credits rolled. and the scene after the credits made me, a 34 year old man, wipe away tears for several minutes."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,bioshock would you kindly..?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,dishonored. i didn't know anything about the game other than it was a first person stealth game. did not think i'd be getting super powers from the outsider
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,assassins creed origins
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the binding of isaac so so sad backstory and lore.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,the first telltale walking dead game. i saw zombies and the ability to choose my own adventure. i didn't expect to have my life ruined.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"the binding of isaac. seemed so simple and straightforward the first time i played it. 6 years later and over 600 hours in, i am still unlocking items and floors and bosses."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,when i got rdr2 i was not prepared for the emotional damage it would cause me. this sums it up pretty wellhttpsimgflip.comi908cna
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,metal gear rising revengeance . shit blew my mind
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this might be a tad controversial, but hoyoverse games genshin impact, honkai star rail, and zenless zone zero mainly i know a lot of people look at them and see gacha game and immediately dismiss them, and i get it. gacha's are predatory, and paying to play a character is not great. this is not praising them for being gacha games. however if you look past it, those three are really quite fun. they all have great story, incredible animations and characters, and their combat systems all are very different, but very fun to play."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i was thrown by final fantasy 14 for having a genuinely amazing story with amazing character writing and plot structure for an mmo. i went in expecting it to be a lackluster plot that would be at least interesting enough to propel me through the boring quests. this is a game that made me cry like a bitch at some points in the story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"most recently, the real plot of bugsnax"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"similarly, the beginner's guide took a somewhat darker turn."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"when stanley came to a set of two reddit vote buttons, he pressed the one on his left."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the deluxe version ups the ante.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this game is far deeper than many realize
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,yeah i could not have predicted the experience i would have with that one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,redacted for privacy reasons
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"when you get to the skip button area, i really feel bad for the narrator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"same, i played this for a while then my daughter 6 at the time wanted to try it. she did what was asked and won. i kept playing after and she would mock me about how she beat that game already and what you haven't beat that yet, it's easy. hard to explain how beating it isn't the point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"please, press k to watch tv. you realize you're playing a piece of art when at some point you just stop and begin to think what you're doing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i have to check that one.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the demo for it really hooked me, you should play it too if you haven't, it's different from the game, but not too different"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,time to go into the broom closet and do sweet fa? best ending ever!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,this game made me wanna make games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,the broom closet ending is my favorite ending
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i broke that game on my first try. 1010 would recommend.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the melody of for river still plays inside my head occasionaly. that game's pure art.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"god that game is incredible for being made in rpg maker and easily one of my favorite games of all time. i have some beautiful memories thanks to it! if you'll allow me to indulge myself... i played the game a decade ago and it just hit me so hard and made me cry a lot. a thematically on point game with a soundtrack that elevated the story. i think to the moon is one of the best uses of video games as a medium. i told my thengf about it at the time and she was super interested in it. so i gifted her a copy of the game. she played through it and it moved her as well. then, maybe a few months later in the early stage of our relationship she plays me an inperson rendition of for river, and it was just so incredibly powerful and touching. fast forward to only a couple months ago and my now wife is walking down the aisle again to for river. it was really beautiful and special. so, for a game i played over a decade ago and with less than 4 hours of total gameplay time, it's really left its mark on my life in the best ways possible. i really can't recommend it enough. a short game that's left me with a long and deep fondness for both it and games like it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,finding paradise was like that for me. such an emotional roller coaster
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oh boy oh boy, was this game a punch in the gut. jesus fucking christ i was bawling my eyes out, hugging a pillow at the end. the concept is absolute, batshit insanely good scifi. and with such a simple game did not enjoy the puzzles though, i just wanted to know what happened next."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i love dredge music so much it's probably my favourite ost after halo. and i am shit scared of the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this i was recommended by a buddy to play it. beautiful scenery, thought it was a quick 10 hours play but honestly the storyside story missions are great. such a simple concept that turned out to be very immersive and fun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,same. people give me the side eye when i call it cozy horror but thats really what it is eh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,check out the youtube channel noclip  video game documentaries. just today they released a documentary in collaboration with the developers! literally watching it as i read your comment.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,no other game has me wishing for selective memory wipe technology as outer wilds... how can such a cute lil game make you so sad once its over and you know you wont be able to experience again for the first time...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,haven't completed this. keep starting and getting lost about what to do. worth giving another shot then i take it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,just started the dlc. shit is fantastic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"yeah man, just starting out, flying around in space and doing whatever, and then you get hit with the event."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"just floating around and messing with the physics is so much fun, to say nothing of the story and investigation."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,sorry guys. i didn't get all the hype. i've tried it out. twice. i did explore a bit. solved some puzzles... but then i just dropped it. it's not for everyone i suppose.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,and then the dlc blows your mind in an entirely new way.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,meant to download the outer worlds. best mistake ive ever made.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this one never clicked with me. i tried it a couple times, couldnt really get into it. eventually i just looked up the rest of the plot or whatever and i just dont think the whole thing connected with me at all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"for the longest time, i thought it was just another crashed on alien planet, crafting and survival game so i avoided it for the longest time thinking it wasnt for me. i uh it was certainly not that. the goodbad news is because my ass waited so long, ive been doing my first play through in vr sirxexyz has already informed me that the dlc is required for reasons he teases to no end, lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"fucking fine ill play outerwilds i havent seen a game hyped up by its dedicated cult fan base to this extent since, like, undertale"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i've tried getting into this game twice, cause i've only heard good things about it, but the controls felt kinda janky, so it never stuck with me. glad to hear you enjoyed it, though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i want to play this game so bad but space freaks me right tf out so exploration is genuinely a little difficult for me lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i went in blind and the first few thingies really messed me up for days after. imagine a life like that. like a blake crouch book except a videogame.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i don't even remember when i bought it. just that one day i was bored and scrolled down my list of game, saw it and decided to install, thinking it would keep me busy 10 minutes. unexpected lifechanging experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i had to google the very end of it. the sands changingstand in one place thing. i never would have known
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,tried it but the controls were just too hard to master. even the tutorial was hard. i guess too much keyboard and not enough joystick time.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,amazing game. one of the very few times i was upset that a piece of media ended
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,is this the one from the folks who made new vegas? i could y play it for more then 30 minutes it was so bad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,outer wilds is just a game where i'm like now what? i just wandered around doing stuff until that got boring.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"it's basically starfield light which is basically fallout with pig lipstick. it's in space now! adds nothing, but it's space now!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this is a true example of games as an art form.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"that's a great call. i was generally prepared for an interactive story and walking simulator. but i wasn't prepared for the variety of feelings. delight. dread. devastation. wonderment. relatability. appreciation, honestly. giant sparrow really knows how to push all the right buttons."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the main character being !pregnant the whole time! is what got me. and its not even like the game tries to hide it either, it just doesnt outright say anything about it until towards the end. its neat once you know and go back to see all the foreshadowing and the literal !baby bump! on edith."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"also was expecting a short story based game, nothing too crazy and and was in awe at the end of it! love watching others play it in youtube too, the reactions, the feels"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the bathtub hit me like a tonne of bricks, thats all ill say."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i had to take a break after the factory level
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oh, that one surprised me big time. i went in thinking i'd just get some quick achievementstrophies, but i was hooked. amazing game and music. i couldn't put it down until i did everything. that game is also what helped me pay attention to anapurna interactive."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"annapurna really has a thing for .. and then he fake them out to the right and just dropkick them in the face with emotions they didn't expect. edith finch, outer wilds, stray .. someone over there really knows how to pick 'em."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,really feels like the bathtub sequence is what hits you the hardest
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,i removed picking that game up because it was free on gamepass and i figured i could blow and hour or two messing around with it. i finished the whole game in one city and stared at my tv screen in complete silence through the entire credits experiencing every emotion at once after finishing it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,one of the best waling simulator games. i wish gone home was the same kind of experience but that game was just a whole lot of nothing. i'm still kinda mad that everyone was praising it to high heavens.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i was actually turned away from it for a while because i thought its popularity leaned on hot chick's butt without anything meaningful. i was in for a treat. also, hot android chick's butt."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,same. talk about genre bending. i've been gaming since the original fallout on windows 95. still sits in it's own category in my head. hands down one of the best games ever made.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,same. i'd never cried at an ending credits sequence before until then. that game is a complete masterpiece.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"came here to say this. nier automata was a huge surprise for me. i think it's only the second game i've 100 twice, besides zelda ocarina of time. i was actually thinking of playing it again recently, which inspired me to watch the nier automata anime."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"same, but still got the cool robot fights tho, amazing gameplay"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i dont think ill ever want to play it again, but man, that was a once in a lifetime experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,me  im gonna tell them. commander dont you dare.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"that was mine. i was not prepared for a certain boss fight early on. that was when i was like oo um...what am i playing? it was not what i expected at all lol, but it was great"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i was into it because of wotw, was not amazed with the game when playing and finished it, but got amazed few months after it until now. i think that's the game that left me trying to be more humane."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i came here to mention nier. the og. the ending.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the thing i hate about that game is that a text log near the end tells you !there are no humans on the moon.! nobody reacts and everyone just keeps fighting the robots which is now pointless. killed the game for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,just wanted to comment that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,found it on switch for 10. wild.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"never played nier, but that sounds like the evangelion anime to me. came for the robots, went with depression."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,consider me curious now
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,the best!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"same, but the opposite. went in expecting deep story based game with some combat. found basic combat based game with some story rubbed on top, to make it look deep. emotional meltdown is not character development. gave up on it after 8 hours of being bored out of my mind, and instead watched 20 hours worth of cutscenes and full plot summaries on youtube instead. that part was actually enjoyable."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i keep bouncing off it, the pc version still has performance issues so i never make any progress. the awful voice acting doesnt help."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i was so bad at that game. i just couldn't win. i'd get close to the cabin and i'd die every time.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,yes and then the lore is crazy too. there's like a subgame to the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oh my god i was looking for this response and seeing yours here made me so happy. the game just has so much beautiful narrative. i !got out of stage 1 in the room with that bright light ! at like 1 in the morning and it was so euphoric, and i almost cried at the end"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"lol, isn't it usually the other way round? subnautica is a thalassophobia superspreader"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this was my choice as well. it started out as a rudimentary survival game and then just got bigger and bigger and more aweinspiring.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i feel this. i dont think it cured my fear, but i know now what steps i need to take to lessen the fear. i even found out that taking the basic seascooter accidentally into the edge of the crash zone is not one of the ways to make it easier. also, i will not go snorkeling. no thank you"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i went into it hearing a lot of hype about how it was secretly a survival horror game and was curious. the starting area kinda threw me...oh, everything is colorful and there's manatees and stuff. this isn't bad besides the crashfish. then my intuition told me to go check out the aurora wreck for gear. the horror found me pretty quick."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i played that game the first time on hardcore 1 life mode without looking at any guides or wikis. i will never forget that experience, holy crap."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this is my choice too. i went in expecting some kind of survival game in the water, but the story blew me away. the lack of handholding and how the game just let's you figure it out with subtle clues was great."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"my first time playing that game was magical and idk if anything else will match that feeling. was going through a rough time in my life when i played it. i messed up some easy platforming and lost the player i was exploring with. i didn't realize losing them would affect me so much and i kinda got down on myself thinking go figure, i can't even keep up in a video game. got near the end of that section and realized the other player waited for me and even came back to find me. i was so touched by that and we ended up finishing the rest of the journey together."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"a few years back i got it in ps plus and i started playing it. my teenage brain saw there was no gameplay other than walking and said i'll give it 10 minutes and if it's not fun i'll leave it ended up playing the whole thing in one sitting. i still remember going up the mountain with another person and seeing them wait for me when i got behind, and all of the sudden, after not paying attention for one moment, they were gone, nowhere to be seen. i felt so alone then."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i play this game once a year since it came out. right when i wake up on my birthday. in my top5 games to just sit back, wander, and enjoy the journey until the credits roll."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the end scene of act one when each character is shown looking up at the snowstorm. incredible
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"not sure about 2, and before the storm was meh, but you gotta play true colors."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i finished it last week and yup it was my first thought. i didn't really know anything about the game and just thought it would be some fun little mystery with the tornado and everything. i did not expect things to get so dark, twisted and bleak. i chose !save arcadia bay! and it's got the most emotional and harrowing ending i've ever played. i was just crying throughout the whole sequence and it hurts to think about because of how attached i got to the characters. !seeing chloe get shot for real, all the moments between her and max that week disappearing and the funeral absolutely broke me. especially after their final moments at the lighthouse where, in my game, they kissed.! !and then max can't even talk to anyone about what happened, not even warren, because even if they believed her, they could never truly understand.! !i'm playing before the storm now and it's nice to see chloe again plus rachel. although it makes her death even sadder. i'm looking forward to the bonus farewell episode with max and chloe.! lis is definitely in my top 5 gaming experiences of all time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the fourth episode really fucked me up. going from starting the episode with !chloe being completely paralyzed! only to end with !chloe being killed, again! destroyed me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this is the one for me too, it made me cry. no game, book or movie has ever done that to me before."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this game taught me a lesson in my late teens i really needed to learn. it was probably the start of my journey to recovery from mental health problems
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the first lis is unlike any other game that i've ever played. my wife said it's the only game she's ever played that made her feel like she was watching real people, and i can definitely see it. i can take or leave the sequelsprequel but the original has a place on my personal top 5"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oof yeah, we've all been there  brutal."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the dlc was solid too, fit perfectly"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,everyone tells me this and says ill love it based on other things i like. ive been holding out hoping it goes on game pass but it hasnt yet.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i still need to finish this. i played a bit, got really lost on some rock, and... haven't returned to it yet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,yep... iykyk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,that rock and roll gunfight through the trippy hallways man that was good.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i can't wait for control 2
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,control is a game i restart from time to time. it is always a pleasure. the gameplay is fun enough to make me comeback but the story and all the documents to read are adding a thick layer of interest to the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"there is so much to unpack with that game. polaris actually being you the player, jesse and dylan potentially being the same person, the whole theme of the futility of trying to control the supernatural"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,x files meet david lynch meet scp is my goto explanation of the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"one of my favorites from the last few years. if you've never read the scp wiki before, i highly recommend you do so. control was based on the idea of the fictional scp foundation. enjoy!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"firewatch did it for me during its introduction where you have to pick options for your backstory. i'd recently been through a breakup, and having to choose between two bad options for why your relationship died hit hard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i saved that game so many times expecting to die around the corner.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,great game. that jump scare when you lose the radio freaked me tf out. i knew from the trailer there would be a mystery but the resolution caught me completely off guard and i had to replay the game to really make peace with it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i played it in vr and it was amazing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i base a lot of the new games i buy off of their similarities to firewatch. some that i've found are the invincible, the lake and nobody wants to die."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i gotta be honest, man, firewatch is the most overrated game i've ever played. the dialogue wasn't that interesting and i didn't find it to be anywhere as deep as some other people claimed it to be. i went in expecting some compelling story and got nothing but average conversations. i get that the characters had some shit they were dealing with and we were supposed to empathize with them but there wasn't really anything thoughtprovoking about this game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this. even though the psychohorror tag kind of implied that something is going to happen,."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"a friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, so i never really looked into it at all. 1010 going it blind was amazing in the end"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i never got spoiled. loved that game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i was especially not ready for the game to dig into my pc's user file and have monica suddenly pull out my real fucking name!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i think about this game a lot. the existential horror of being an npc in a limited simulation. nothing you can do, even rewriting the rules of your own universe and existence, can ever really put you on the same level as the player that you've been programmed to love. and to the player it's a disposable dating sim and even if you wanted to stay with her there's really nothing there except to sit in an empty room together at the end of the in game universe. i dunno man. it makes me sad to think if we ever really crack agi and it gets put into things like this for our entertainment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,as an avid anime watcher dont ever underestimate the power of anime girs!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,my friend bought me this game told me to read nothing just jump in .... yeah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i have hundreds of hours in this small and cheap game. amazing design and i'm always wishing for sequel
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the sound track still grips me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,ftl?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"if you liked it, there are mods, if you dont know. there are two major total conversion mods i know of, and various others that support those. captains edition, and multiverse. captains is like a new expansion. multiverse is almost ftl 2. both mods add more events, ships, weapons, i think both add races. ive not played captains edition since i learned about multiverse, so i dont remember. captains has an infinite mod addon where you can just keep going if you want. multiverse is a wip on that, until after a later version."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i've logged so many hours in ftl it's not funny... it's just such a wellrealized game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,never beat that fucking game. but i love it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i was amazed how a seemingly small game provided such replayability and diverse experience. there are several simple mechanics in it but they all are perfectly polished and smoothly work together.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,so happy i beat it once! probably took 50 tries.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,wish they would put this on mobile or switch
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"it's been a decade since i first played it and still love firing it up every so often, was first game i played on my new pc after being out of pc gaming for 5 or 6 years. into the breach, same devs, is also an excellent tactical game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"glad to see this here. did not expect much, had an absolute blast and wanted to replay immediately. using the huddle while struggling with a fight and low health and come out of the huddle owning everything felt great. used it before i nearly died on the last boss, and it actually brought a tear to my eye. one of the few times a gameplay feature actually moved me, the other being brothers  a tale of two sons."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,... most important question tho did you save the space lama?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it being released after the avengers game, really didn't help it much. i had to argue with several people into trying the game out, and still, only one person did."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"just did my 2nd play through of this after doing my 1st last year. cannot recommend this game highly enough. it requires attention and to buy into the story a bit but man, what a rewarding game. that last chapter twist too"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,you sat down with cozy. i sat down to prove time loops couldnt work well in a game. never been happier to say i was proven wrong in my entire damned life.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i played rdr1 on the ps3, so i knew many characters but i bought rdr2 without any knowledge, had enough muuneeeh left in my steam wallet, so i just got it. western is usually also not my genre. it's actually a great thing for any artist, that includes game devs, when you can get the players aka audience fascinated for a scenario that is not their preferred genre. just like when you play music, like people would like to hear rock, but you play jazz... and you do it so fucking good, that the people will cheer and be happy, that's a serious performance and achievement."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this game is a masterpiece. it's a true work of art that shows what's possible when thousands of people work together on something for 10 years.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this game was great. i very much enjoyed the story, but mostly it was because of the contrasting experiences between my wife and my playthrough. i played through on the normal difficulty i think, while my wife chose the easier one. and we both finished our playthroughs at around the same time, but we took very different paths and had amazingly different outcomes. she basically got a fairly happy ending, everyone lives, etc. while in my playthrough, almost everyone died and the only one who didn't had to survive robot auschwitz."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this should be up top. i went in expecting another minimal combat survival horror and came out ... i believe the term is shook. that ending. jfc. profound indeed. this game is so tough to describe because you have to essentially explain the entire plot to convey what it is.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"to be as vague as possible, it's just darker than most people expected. the marketing focussed on the cat, and everyone presumed it would be a cutesy, happy lil game. it is, inasmuch as cats and robots are cute, but it definitely has an edge. good game though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"as was noted by the other responses, the game has a darker theme than just a cute cat exploring a city. if you are looking for a more lighthearted game about a cute cat in a city, i'd recommend little kitty, big cityhttpsstore.steampowered.comapp1177980littlekittybigcity"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's kind of the unhappy conclusion of blade runner seen through the eyes of a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's a neat wee game not too long and not too difficult. casual friendly linear structure with a few open areas sprinkled between to break things up a bit. it's 1 of those games where it's best experienced knowing less about what's going on to add to the immersion. i very highly recommend it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,without sounding diminishing it is a story driven walking simulator with some light stealth and platforming. very casual friendly and short. the games narrative jabs at some deeper issues while having lots of character and good animations. recommend for a lazy saturday when you need to chill and other games are too much effort.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the cat is very cute, and you get to do a lot of cat stuff. the platforming of being a cat is quite unique, and the only thing that comes a little close to that is mirror's edge. but, to not be too revealing, there is a darkness and fear to the game. what are the robots terrified of? why does the city appear to be completely dead? what happened before things got to the state they were in? you may learn about some of these if you play your cards right. basically the dead city is also a character in this game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"stray was my game of the year that year. it's very short, but has strong characters and a great story. it felt very unique and being able to do random cat things was fun. it mixes up the gameplay a lot, but mostly exploration, light platforming, and some puzzles if i recall. also, it is the perfect game for the steam deck."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"just a fun, but yes dark, game about a cat who can understand robots helping them out all while trying to make it back to the surface to reunite with his feline friends. the game itself really doesn't hold your hand with what to do and is a nice refresher of how games used to be before quest markers on a map. though i do think that doesn't help the general audience of the game, my husband wanted it so badly and allot of nights we sat there where i'd help him by looking up what to do as he'd run around. still hasn't beaten it, but then again its the most game he's played other than luigi's mansion 3. bought him mario wonder and he forgets he has it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i played it for about 34h. you have these drones that you can shoot out and take pictures with. i shot one of these drones into a gassy white planet core and took some pics. shit was haunting. not gonna spoil anything but i got spooked real good. i kept going and found a planet that had a water surface. i went closer and closer, thinking i should somewhat submerge but i just got closer and the planet bigger. for some reason that also made me shit my pants and i haven't touched it since. i wanna continue at some point because of fomo, but that freaked me out and made me stop."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"on one hand, 100 this. on the other, it is amazing how getting completely familiar with things is just how the game works. i adore the way the game leans into practiced familiarity as a firstclass game mechanic. its like nothing else ive ever played. progressing from wtf is happening here to musclememory is just an amazing experience. i dont so much want that to be wiped as i want more games that do this thing. i got outer wilds during the steam summer sale and only just wrapped up the dlc a few days ago."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"you hit the nail on the head. i didnt have any idea what it was going in, and now i hate myself for playing it before the dlc came out because i cant forget how it ends. it doesnt help that i cant stop watching lets plays."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,this. i was so hooked watching a streamer pick it up and experience it first time that i wish i had stopped watching  if i'd known how crazy it was i would've wanted to do it myself first time. amazing game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"a core design philosophy for this game is that if a place looks barren, its most likely have nothing of interest there. so you dont need to crash land into every surface like you do in dark souls and try to spot pois"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"my favorite game of all time, but the first time i tried it i played for a little over an hour, didn't understand shit, felt lost and not knowing what to do, thought it was boring af then put it down and didn't touch it for two weeks. turns out your only goal at first is to explore, just like an archeologist would. that's why the game gives you many things to try and catch your curiosity at the start, such as 1. the fisherman guy telling about a monster gabbro saw at the bottom of giant's deep 2. people constantly mentioning feldspar, the traveller who disappeared 3. the instrument lady mentioning that you can get to every traveller by following the sound of their instruments with your signalscope 4. the museum curator asking you what you wanna do once you're in space and giving you a bunch of options to answer, instead of telling you what to do 5. the obvious thing that happens 22 minutes after you interact with the statue in the museum each one of those is a lead for you to follow. just pick the one you're more curious about. if you're not curious about any of those, just go explore wherever you feel like it! at some point the game will hopefully make you say okay, now i need to know what happened here, and you'll be hooked. it worked for me at least, and i was really skeptical if i was going to enjoy this game the second time i picked it up. good luck out there, and be curious on your journey."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this was me exactly! my recommendation dont look anything up. i wish i hadnt. spoiled so much of the experience for me, and hearing people talk about it, im so bummed i wont get to experience it for myself. but the small bits of discovery i did find on my own were amazing!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the aesthetic of the dlc is amazing. i've revisted just to go site seeing a couple of times.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the dlc is an incredibly close 2nd to the main game, imo. i went in knowing how the main game plays out so i think it hampered the story a tiny amount but it was still fantastic."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's spooky. also kinda hard to start. it's the sort of game that doesn't have big ol' arrows pointing to the content so... just finding where to start the dlc will involve some dinking around until you notice new stuff.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,my first time playing i accidentally fell down into a thing and got a nice view of the event and thought i had obviously caused it what with my mistake and all. i thought that for a long time. it takes oh so little to throw someone off a trail.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i remember that point and thinking it was odd no one brought it up, but that does get brought up as a main story beat later. the pointless battle with the robots is kind of the entire plot of the game. what is the point of existing when your task has no meaning? could be the slogan for the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i think that kinda helped make the game for me. the idea of this endless war, because nobody really knows what else to do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"should probably spoiler tag your comment for anyone who hasnt played it. but on your topic, fundamentally that doesnt matter since the androids are at war with the machines. they have to keep fighting if they dont want to just roll over and die. humanity is there for morale because too many androids were committing suicide. according to their programming, fighting for humanity provides a reason for fighting and keeps their morale up which is why it was introduced in the first place."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i think you fell for the trap the game tries to set. route a makes you think oh this is just a game trying to look deep by throwing overdone philosophies and random philosopher names route b tips you off maybe theres something more route c hits you over the head with a crowbar made out of pure storytelling mastery while i find the story of route a to still be very good, it definitely isnt until route c that you fully understand why it has the reputation it does."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's like that one saying. art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. but in this case it's subnautica should cure thalassophobia for those who have it and give thalassophobia to those who don't.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"before the storm is a bit anticlimactic since it's a prequel, and its big plot beats are the reason the story in the first game exists at all. there's an alternate ending, but the fork isn't until the very end, the game comes right out and tells you it's noncanonical and you were supposed to pick the other one, and it's almost as sad. great fucking game, though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"!i couldn't get chloe to get killed again, especially dying without knowing about rachel or what max did to save her, so i sacrificed arcadia bay. maybe out of selfishness for max's love for her. like max said you are all that matters to me.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the fourth episode was me internally screaming from the first to the last second. thank god i played the game after every episode was released. can't imagine the stress of the people waiting 2 months for the last episode after that cliffhanger.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"shit, i still tear up at the ending."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"its already been in there twice, itll probably show up again."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,scp the game is my unofficial headcanon.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"at the time i played, my dog had just started showing signs of his old age. i bawled after some of the events in the backstory and the game hadnt even started yet! my dog is okie doke still. hes definitely older, blinder, and has some doggie dementia but hes still a super happy dude."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,yeah just walking around in the forest was terrifying at parts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"thats what got me too, the game was simultaneously super chill and subtly terrifying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this is the joy of the blind run. i had no clue what kind of game i was getting into, but i saved often. i wont spoil anything here regarding the game. if you dont know about it, buy it and play it. if you feel the urge to save, do so. if you dont, then dont."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"obligatory the dude quote here no, but for real that's an entirely valid opinion. the story hit hard for me for a number of reasons which i'll not go into, but that's not to say it has to do so for you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i think it really really depends on things that have happened in your actual life. for some of us there will be a huge impact. for others, a partial with a fascinating twist. but there are absolutely folk i wouldnt recommend it to, as i already know they wouldnt have the same emotional reaction to it, and thats just fine."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"not everything has to invoke deep existential thought. firewatch is great because it gets you invested in the characters and their emotions, combined with simplisticyetfun wilderness exploration gameplay and some darker elements. if that doesn't cut it for you, that's entirely fair. but the game is certainly not overrated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"while i liked and had fun playing it, i agree. it's held up like some paragon of interactive storytelling, but it's a neat little game with some interesting sliceoflife dialogue. i really like it, but it's not the masterfully crafted story with twists and turns, nuanced characters and an epic mystery that so many portray it to be online."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"same here. it was a fun little game, with an incredibly beautiful style, but it fell flat. the game kept hinting that it was going to be deep and philosophical, with a mind melting twist, but it never happened. i was expecting much more. maybe that was the point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,same. the game gets super hyped here but i found it boring. also that ending was just blah.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i don't agree with you but i upvoted you because i see a controversial marker and i hate it when people get downvoted just for having a contrary opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"agreed. it's just not the worst walking simulator, but also not much else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"youre not wrong, but people are lonely and just like hearing the story of two people talking on the radio, with a story mixed in"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i had the same feeling, but i think it was because i didnt fall for what they were shelling out. major spoilers !theres no shame for not being able to care for a family member with dementia especially after you gave it your all, those girls at the lake were just goofing around so i didnt throw their boombox, just had a hunch the kid died because of an accident, not a murder! the game just didnt lead me where they wanted me to go so ive come to the conclusion that unless you jump to conclusions throughout the story, youre just gonna be bored."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the ending was such a letdown. there was this big mystery build up and then it just fizzled.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,captains mod is old now and unbalanced. multiverse is much much better since they actually had more freedom as they reverse engineered the game and shit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it's a cold, hateful person that doesn't save kammy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"you're either going to love it or hate it. it's a game entirely revolving around you wanting to make new discoveries, piecing things together, go out and find places, etc. nothing is being handfed to you other than some hints or you being observant enough to notice how certain things work. going in fully blind is absolutely the way to go as the discovery is the bread and butter of the game. i guess you could kinda consider it like a soulslike storytelling? if i could erase my memories just to play the game again without knowing anything like the first time i played it, i'd do it in a heartbeat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"for the record, lots of people talk about it making them sad, shedding some tears etc. and i do not resonate with that at all. it's amazingincrediblealsomytopgameofthelastdecade, but i just thought it was supercool starttofinish, a sad moment or two but absolutely not a sad game imo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"as a brit, i think the way they nailed small village aesthetics really helped and possibly contributed to why i was so affected by it, it felt so much more real and tangible."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oh its a really nice little game, if you like the kind where you are uncovering little stories that build up to a full picture. it's not really depressing imo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it's a little melancholy, but the scenery is so beautiful and many of the stories are sweet in their own way. some details may be open to interpretation, and it's implied that the rapture felt differently for different people. as you would expect, the different types of people viewed it through different lenses. if you were to talk to a scientist, a doctor, a priest, a soldier following orders or a farmer about the biblical rapture, they'd all have something different to say."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's like finding a stranger's photos from the past kind of sad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it is a great story with horrible story telling. you are either playing a game fighting robot animals for loot and experience or getting this hour long info dump with audio and written exposition explaining exactly what is going on. i was surprised by the 'twist' because i didn't think it would go that hard. but then the twist gets beaten into you while you pick up logfile after logfile after logfile.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it took me awhile to start it because it felt clunky compared to other third person type of shooters. taking down the robots also took a lot of time which to me felt like a grind. i kept at it though and eventually it became really fun. it took planning to take down the robots and you could do it faster by shooting off their armor or exploding some canisters on their body. you can also lay traps to weaken them first. if you enjoy stealth, you can pick them off one by one too. im playing the sequel now on the ps5. the lack of loading time and settings customizations takes it to another level. there is some awe and wonder to see how the game makers created an aged america with little tidbits of stories hidden throughout the land."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"don't know if it was your case, but it's amazing how so many people were wary of a new protagonist at first, believing it impossible for arthur to live up to john, and then came to eat their words by the end of the game. for me, personally, arthur morgan might just be the best protagonist i've ever seen in a game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"my nephew does the same thing, it's actually pretty impressive that they're able to just completely ignore it haha!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,definitely it wasn't a game i was expecting to like but i got it for free and was blown away

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"yeah! i thought it was just going to be like what people think of when you mention cod to people who dont play cod, but it didnt take me long to notice things werent quite right that i initially wrote off as glitches until they were impossible to write off. then the fucking white phosphorus level came. then the twists. off course when i was able to reassemble my brain i looked into it to find out there were different endings which i didnt hesitate to play through again to get them and see what other weird shit i didnt notice. i almost feel like that first stop sign was a blatant message along"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the trailer for it made it look like a generic tough guy military man shooter also which is both a good and a bad thing. it helped with subverting your expectations but i feel that that's also why it flew under the radar so hard when it was first released. a shame honestly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i think because the game is is from 2012 12 years old now, and wasn't a blockbuster. this is still the game i try to tell everyone about."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"did you play the blind forest? personally, this one hit me harder. earlier this year marchapril 2024 i played them back to back with my 5yo son experiencing everything alongside me. i cant believe id slept on both of these for so long. theyre incredible story and mechanics and some of the tightest platforming ive ever played. definitely blind sided by a lot of the feels i was getting, too. at the games climax and end game we both had some tearstained cheeks. i found it was a special moment for us to share as i wrestled with trying to explain the complexities of everything in the most simple terms elhes5. that game is absolutely beautiful. my hope is it made a similar core memory for him as it did me his little hands dont care for the controller yet so i drove and read everything aloud to keep it moving. and since i didnt care about how many times id die getting thru a tight section, id ask him to make the choices of our travel giving him more engagement and buyin. it was a pretty good system for us"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,it's also the environment right. the game is very immersive. you can truly get lost in that world. a lot of people don't even fast travel because of how immersive it is.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"if you know anything about the nature of cyberpunk as a genre, then you probably know what you are going to get. if not, then cyberpunk is best described as a capitalist hellhole wherein corporations and governments own the very essence of humanity. they are almost always dystopian and feature themes of depersonalisation, loss of humanity, an invasive technological aspect and nihilism. it was made as a response to the utopian scifi of the early 20th century, with writers like phillip k. dick instead focusing on societal collapse or the loss of humanity. it almost always focuses on the outsiders of society, like those who rebel against the current order or those that refuse to consume the mindless media andor drugs used to pacify the masses. if you've seen blade runner, you know what to expect from 2077. so the game is gritty, almost every ending is a downer with suicide being one of the options and many quests end badly for at least one character. characters grapple with loss, legacy especially with the deuteragonist, who you are and just what to live for. it's a beautiful game and i love it, but be aware that it contains topics that are hard to discuss for some people."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"cyberpunk itself is very much a critique on modern society and the pitfalls we as the normal rank and file members of society fall into. as a genre that is what it wants to discuss basically, the perils of late stage capitalism. cyberpunk 2077 has a number of missions that engage with various aspects of what that means, very serious and dark topics, in in my opinion a very good and respectful way. beyond that, the game structure is cool. if you just do the main missions, you only get a small chunk of the story and limited endings. doing the secondary missions  letting your v branch out and do things  is where you make your connections, get the rest of the story, make enemies and allies, and unlock additional endings for how you want to solve your core problem. if you watched batman beyond as a kid, one of the main characters in the game is basically mad stan. only, with how cyberpunk presents things he kind of has a point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i can't wait for their nivalis game to come out. though it's a different genre, if it's the same world building it should be phenomenal"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"me and my 2 buddies from work would spend all day talking about it and then go home and play until bedtime. the game was decent, great even, but that was what made it amazing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i dunno, after putting about ten hours in, it probably ranks in my top 10 crpgs ever if it keeps this level of quality up. the opposite of an average game. obviously haven't finished the game yet. i'm just extrapolating from what i've seen. the very opening wasn't my thing,but immediately after that it started getting really, really good. gunplay feels excellent, story is actually going places, characters are written really well, looks pretty, quests offer a lot of branching paths, does everything really well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,and it has one of the best osts of all time

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"also  there's hardly any useless filler, just about everything has a purpose for being placed there, telling the story or guiding the player. this i didn't figure out till my second world tour where i essentially went sight seeing, and everywhere i went, i saw things and was like ooohhhhhh..... i get it now.... why didn't i see that earlier????"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i'll start it tonight then! thank you all. been looking for a new game to fall in love with.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"after playing this game, it really did highlight how badly i skimmed information presented to me, and how strongly i held to my initial assumptions of things. both of those facts really screwed me playing the base game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"point 4 is something i noticed has no impact on the game whatsoever. the monster guides you towards giant's deep, searching for feldspar is a lead, etc. but asking the player what they want to do provides next to no information to the player, and serves only to make them choose their own first line of engagement without thinking about it. iirc, that bit with the curator was added because play testers were frustrated by the lack of direction. safe to say it worked out great."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i really found the dlc to be a significant step down  the slideshow mechanic always felt a little contrived, and while i played the entire main game without hints, the dlc had me googling at least 5 times. not saying the solutions or design are any less genius, but it felt like ow had the exact perfect balance of challenge for me, and echoes felt like it went just a little bit too far."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the dlc gave me my first real jump scare. so far, all the humanoids you encounter were friendly the one on the starting planet and the nomai you chat with at the end so when i saw a figure in the distance holding a lantern, i thought yay, people to talk to ! so i let out a little scream when i saw thay weird owndeer face grab me and snuff my lantern"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"yeah, it's no crime to have a hot girl as the main character but it did raise me an eyebrow since a lot of poor quality media tend to slap hot chicks to try and make up for it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,my problem was by route c i was so mind numbly bored by the shallow gameplay that i was trying to rush through as quickly as possible.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"this game failed to land for me narratively. really enjoyed the gameplay and the whole chip system a lot and i did 100 it so i have seen all the endings and variations because i 100 everything i pick up before moving on. i don't know why, but the story has no impact or engagement at all and i didn't really find much interesting in there. pascal was a cool character and i enjoyed his arc, but any of the protagonist drama fell incredibly flat for me. if i had to guess, i didn't like 9s at all and found him really whiney in route a  so anything linked to his narratives later was just annoying and had no emotional impact. kinda made all the story beats poor because i couldn't emphasize with him at all maybe? either way, i found the story to be a real dud for me, but the gameplay was excellent."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"not really. and yeah, i'm well aware of the full and complete story and it's many endings. i did watch all of it on youtube. i would have though reference to !9s's! emotional meltdown would have given that away. i'm well aware of the !chapters!, that the game desperately tries to convince you are actually !playhroughs!. i straight up refuse to call them that. these are by far the biggest gimmick of the entire game. i did watch all of it. from the reviewers shouting praise at the novel gameplay and amazing story, i went in expecting a great story based game. instead, i got a dramafest that tries to !philosophize on the idea of what it means to be a human!, but then takes all that and sets it on fire to drive basic emotional drama in the most cheapest way possible. that's not exactly bad, but it does not live up to the hype. the gameplay is an ok beatemup, with a few gimmicks thrown in to make it look like it's not just another beatemup. it is not the unique and innovative experience the reviews would like you to believe."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the game is meant to be finished, not played indefinitely. you are meant to find broken combos because the enemy isn't playing fair either. it's all part of the genius of this game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,there are so many really overpowered combos that i feel like it couldnt be an oversight. i can think of two combos with the squirrel head statue that turn every round into a win in two hands or less.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,the game desperately wants you to win. ouroboros is one of like a dozen ways to cheese your way through.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it is a narrative game. each act has a card where, once you play enough, will guarantee you to move forward. the point of the game is to experience the game, not to, get stuck until you get good."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,you should spoiler mark this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,yes it is the point. the characters are both focusing so hard on this big mystery while getting closer and closer over time only for there to be a mundane solution to the weird things going on. they wanted to be distracted from their real lives and thats exactly what they did for each other. they let their minds wander and create a ton of different explanations when real life is much more boring and depressing than the glorified versions in our heads. its why !the main character doesnt even meet delilah at the end.!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"if it was anything other than the ending, it would have been disappointing. if there was an actual conspiracy going on, it would have gone against all of the themes of the narrative, and made it feel like it jumped the shark. the ending is what seals the deal for one of the best narratives i've ever experienced in a video game. if you want schlocky twists in your narrative, there are hundreds out there, but i'm glad this game went for something more different and exploring the human condition"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,i think it benefits the game. one reason is that most people wouldnt even have touched the game if it was really just a cute girls do cute things game. being warned in the beginning just increases curiosity. also it doesnt really spoil much but rather misguides you as youll soon think it got that tag because of depression and suicide.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,also depends if you got it on steam or from the official website. they dont hint at anything over there

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"not been through shropshire much but it looks exactly like almost anywhere in the west country and lead to it affecting me a lot for similar reasons. i've spent holidays in holiday camps just like the one from the game, and the thought of living out the rapture in a caravan or the main activity hall seems so bleak when it's meant to be a happy place. and trying to hop on one of those train lines in order to flee. those parts of the country used to be lucky to have 2 or 3 trains a day even if they weren't all cancelled."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"disagree with it's pure sandbox you're not given an objective, but there is an objective. you have to discover it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"you're not given an objective, it's pure sandbox. its a puzzlebox, not a sandbox. sandbox games are like lego, the point is to see what you do with the pieces and mechanics not necessarily find intended solutions examples minecraft obviously, cityzooetc simulators, tabs, and sid meiers' pirates. outer wilds wants you to solve its puzzles, and each one has a specific solution. you can approach the puzzles in mostly any order, but nonlinearity in a game is not automatically a sandbox. zelda 1 is not a sandbox, collectathon platformers are not sandboxes. a puzzle box, on the other hand is a collection of interactable pieces that, when manipulated in a specific way, reveal what's inside. that's what outer wilds is."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"you couldn't be more right about not spoilering this game, you absolutely want to avoid googling anything about this game before you get into it, it makes the playstyle so much more incredible."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i started, played one session and then haven't picked it back up yet. not sure why. my gameplay so far !i got the launch codes, took off, went to some planet, did some translating, went through some sort of teleporter, saw a giant bright ball come towards me, died. realized i had to start over again without having to get the launch codes again. that's when i quit. i just have no clue what to do really. what planets do i need to visit first? or do i just explore and die until it all start making sense? !"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"as someone who dislikes open world games, especially with no directions given and prefers linear story based games should i skip it then? this game really intrigues me since i often hear how great it's supposed to be. alright you guys convinced me, after finishing my second playthrough of persona 5 royal i'll next give outer wilds a shot. thanks for the answers."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,you dont need a schlocky twist. you just need to follow through. the game takes you through a big exposition setting up a mystery and the resolution is a few throwaway lines.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,who do you mean by these people tho i'm confused
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,sure. so's minecraft. you're not told to find a stronghold and kill the ender dragon. you would have to discover it if minecraft wasn't the most popular game of all time. but if it isn't a pure sandbox then what exactly is it? don't just tell someone they're wrong and don't offer any alternative.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"the spaceship? yeah the controls are a bit..off, but you learn it relatively quickly with some practice. everyone flies their ship into the sun or hits a planet too hard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"if you're talking about the model ship at the beginning, it's weirdly difficult to control compared to the real thing. the ship has its quirks but you'll adapt to them quickly, and you can always use autopilot to get you most of the way there though it also has its quirks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"not everything if you check your ship log anything you scanned of importance is saved there under the rumour system, and by the sounds of it you must have picked up something. unfortunately though you are mostly on your own. the only subtle way i can say this is remember. you're a space archaeologist. what planet do you want to explore? go there, look around outer wilds is a game where you have to want to play it, !you want to learn the lore you want to find out what happened to this civilization before you got there? were there any conversatiosn that had terms you want to learn about? why did you die? my piece of advice, if you didn't. talk to the guy at the campfire, see what happens.! keep asking questions you want to knkw, all of the answers are out there, somewhere in that universe. these aren't spoilers for you djabber just anyone who hasn't played the game. also the game isn't infuriatingabout clues, you're never gonna be running around an empty field looking for a specific leaf that's different. every clue is found in a place of interest and you know it's a place of interest because look at it it's pretty obvious. finally my pushing advice. don't read if you still want to give another blind run a try. i don't recommend it but this is a jumping point based on what i did if you really can't handle not having any startline, no judgement. but no pressure either, you can't do this game wrong and every playthrough is unique because everyone has a different route. !go to the ember twins, find the escape pod, follow the messages.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"as the other person said it's unique but from that description i'm inclined to say no. the first and last objevtive you're told to do is get the launch codes to the ship platform from there, you're an archaeologist. you have a ship log that gives vague clues, you're given a number of planets to explore but where you go, who you speak to and what you find are entirely on your ability to explore, solve puzzles and think linearly, based solely off of your own intrigue to explore and find out about the history of the games lore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"honestly? no, you probably wont. the single most important driving factor of the game is your own curiosity. it counts on you to go ooo, whats that over there? and then go explore it. it counts on you to be curious when you find texts, to read all the things and follow the little breadcrumb trails. the onus is entirely on you and thats kind of what makes it special to those of us that adore it. in a universe where you have no idea what youre doing or why youre there, suddenly and all at once, you understand what youre meant to be doing. and then you go do it. and then the story is over. so, no judgement to people who prefer more specific directions and waypoints to guide them and steady progression of levels or skill points in order to enjoy a game, but this one might not appeal to you. but id still say give it a shot if you can afford to spend money on a game that just might not click with you on the odd chance that youll really enjoy it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i was convinced i wouldn't like it, since i like linear narrative games a lot. however, i loved this game. it has a story, but it's not linear. you can stumble into any part of the story, but it doesn't matter what part you stumble into. doing so will kind of put you on a track to discover the rest of the story. once in a while, you may be completely lost, but there's a board in your ship that keeps important facts and reminders of things you may want to seek out resulting from those facts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,its 100 unique game. you wont know if you like it without trying. everything is unlocked from the start and its up to you to figure shit out by chasing whatever interests you. definately requires more thinking than your average game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"why are people so defensive about nier, none of the topics explored in the game were absolutely novel, and if you had come across those concepts previously through books or philosophy courses, the game wouldn't have had the same impact on you. it doesn't mean you didn't getunderstand the topics presented by the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"i did get it. realized i fell for hype which the game doesn't live up to, and am kinda miffed about it. that doesn't mean you shouldn't like it. i'm certain that people who like beatemups enjoy it a lot."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"some bits that person skipped over. one of dylan's dreams is about how he was actually a girl, and his name was jesse dylan faden. he goes on to say how isnt it funny that both of their names could be a girls or a boys name? both jesse and dylan can be gender neutral. dylan also yells about how jesse is nothing but a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. theres also the bit that jesse's favorite author isn't from the reality she currently lives in. thomas zane  her therapist says he cant find any record of that author existing, which jesse has no response for. the fbc mentions that thomas zane is the writer in the book that alan wake writes that in turn writes about him.  confusing bit there, but anyway, jesse is familiar with an author from another dimension as if she was from there. dylan tells jesse about how he met and spoke to mr. door who is quite obviously mr. hatch from quantum break. hatchdoor notice how the names are synonyms talks about how he simultaneously exists in every conceivably dimension at once and the existence of other worlds. . i cant properly remember them right now, but there are several good counterarguments to this theory as well which honestly just makes it even more fun waiting for the next game. there is support for both sides of this theory."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"outer wilds is an exploration game with a linear beginning and end, and a remarkably nonlinear middle. it is in no way a sandbox, defined as a game where creative emergent play with the mechanics and content is the focus of the design. iirc, there is even almost always a stated objective in the ship's computer. the parent comment to yours is correct, and i'd say your earlier comment is misleading."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"i genuinely cannot fathom how you're willing to die on the hill that outer wilds is a sandbox. it's more of a space based walking sim than a sandbox game. sandbox generally implies mechanics you can mess with or at the very least a fucking inventory system. literally anything other than reading, pushing buttons and holding 1 object in your hand at a time with 1 predetermined destination for it. there's no sand in the box my guy. it's not a sandbox."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,that's really more of an optional goal and not the main focus of minecraft but alright man.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"lol thats good to know, maybe i will try it again dome timed"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,books and philosophy dont have a banger soundtrack though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"beatemup this just flags everything you are saying as an attempt to troll now honestly. you either didnt pay attention, didnt actually finish the game or didnt even play it. your opinion is one of minority too, meaning that, yeah, you likely didnt get it. its ok mate, just accept that you didnt get it. not everyone gets it with every game. i didnt get rdr2 and look how highly regarded that game is. im just not so delulu that i think the game is shit because it wasnt for me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,thanks for filling in friend!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"where emergent play with the mechanics and content is the focus of the design that has to be the worst definition of anything ever. you just described 99 of video games. any video video game where content has a focus is a sandbox. fortnite is a sandbox, destiny is a sandbox any liveservice video game is a sandbox if the only definitions are mechanics and contentfocused design."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"it's more of a puzzle game than a walking sim imo, though the lines between the two can be blurred so i can see your view."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"it's still an objective? there's still a credits sequence it's still a thing you have to do if you want to unlock certain exclusive items. sure you can make a minecraft world where all you do is make pixel art out of dyed sheep wool but i can boot up an outer wilds save and eat marshmallows for 5 hours. the point of the game is to explore and find the end of the game !ironically quite literally in both examples!. but again. feel free to clarify what it is, rather than dodging the question."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,no worries! glad to convince you to give it another try. it's definitely a story first game so patience and curiosity are your most important skills.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,neither you have to slog through hours of mediocre gameplay to get to the good stuff.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"if your argument stands on you didn't get it or that it is not the majority opinion, it's not a great argument. that's groupthink. creatively changing the camera, so it turns from a beatemup to bullet hell, arena shooter or sidescroller, is not creative gameplay mechanic. neither is addition of a hacking minigame midway through."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"oh? is a visual novel a sandbox? how about sports games? fighting games? tetris? sandboxes are great, but i think you're trying to stretch the use of the word beyond what actually makes sense for it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-14,"those games aren't sandbox, dude. sandboxes are games where you exist within a game world, and there are things you can do and interact with, but where there isn't a goal. introduce any sort of goal and the game ceases to be sandbox. that said, plenty of games can have sandbox aspects without being sandbox games. rdr2 has a whole lot of sandbox going on with how the world will just react, but rdr2 is not a sandbox game, it is a mostly free roam storymission game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"okay. i think there's a pretty clear and stark difference in the narrative between minecraft and outer wilds, and i get the vibe you are having trouble acknowledging you described it poorly and are getting defensive and i really don't want to engage with that or keep arguing about it. i said what i have to say here. e  feel free to clarify what it is, rather than dodging the question. don't edit questions in then act like i'm dodging them, dude."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,"how far do you wsnt to stretch your definition of sandbox? because if we take it from mechanics and content focus whichbis where we started to mechanics and content, period. then fucking pong is a sandbox game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-13,well then what would you call it if not a sandbox? cause you can't just call me wrong and then give 0 alternatives. that's why i'm defensive as you put it. i call it a sandbox. you say it isn't a sandbox...and then nothing. so what is it? a survival? an mmorpg? a first person shooter?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"make sure to actually spend time doing cat things instead of rushing through the story. too meany people just rush through the story and complain it's boring, but if you take your time and actually be a cat, you can meow at peoplerobots, drop things off shelves, make everyone trip over you and fall, climb to places you're not supposed to be, as well as other cat things. 1010, would cat again."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,i found it sad that you were only a cat doing cat things only a short while at the start of the game. the rest you're a cat doing human things and for me i think that's such a wrong direction to go for.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"honestly, i think that any success this game has had is because of the fact that the protagonist is a cat. that's really all it has going for it. take out the cat aspect and there isn't really anything here at all"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"i highly recommend the game. there are many people who don't care for it. it's a slow burn game that doesn't have much in the way of gameplay depth. but i think it makes up much more in the atmosphere, setting and the characters you meet along the way. it's also quite short."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"it's a nice game linear sure, but it's story is engaging good start though, any sort of followup would have to be more interactive, and have more routes to go through"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"the story is okay'ish. x200b the gameplay is good, it's fun, but the story went from a cosmic horror to an urban survival simulator to a puzzle game and then stealth game. it was all over the place."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"the game felt very unique and i've had a lot of fun playing it, but i wouldn't exactly say that the story was wonderful or anything like that. to me the story was the weakest part of it. it was far too minimalistic to say that it was great."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"stray is probably one of the best games i ever played. i mean the graphics and the storyline is really good, and it's kind of long too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,remember do not the cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"glad i waited to try this for free. not worth full price, unless youre really into cats i wouldnt recommend."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,this sounds like a review a cat would give...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"so basically, you don't want us to cat'apult through the game, but instead meow through the game at a cat'asrophically slow pace. purrfec... ok."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"i was curious about the game, but you just sold me ... on not playing it. enjoy, cat lovers."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,why would anyone do this? it's already boring just reading it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i havent played it yet, sadly but surely one day i will!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,what gameplay? lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,the scripted jumps are the worse part
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"i didn't finish it  i missed an achievement for a collectible and realized i wouldn't be able to complete it unless i did another run, and the game just wasn't engaging enough to keep on going. like you say, i wasn't getting a huge sense of accomplishment. if it had a qol feature to teleport back to previously completed areas i'd have kept playing though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,yeah it works like an assassins creedbatman game kind where you just hold x and it will sort of parkour yourself around the obstacles.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"it does allow the developers to make the jumps look really good and catlike though. i mean, if you've ever seen a cat jump onto anything, you know that they're incredibly graceful most of the times. you cant really mimic that same grace if you just let the player jump around willynilly."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"depends. the game is visually stunning and the developers really nailed the cat feeling  you can go and explore, meow, stratch furniture, jump on people's tables and knock stuff down, etc. half the activities are completely useless most of the time, but it shows somebody took their time actually observing cats. the other great part is the story  or rather the way it is told. the story itself is rather basic and without any major twists, but it is told through interction with your surroundings  there is very little text, only very little cutscenes. the game is rather short, though, about 8 hours to 100 it, but then again, the gameplay is also rather basic and the game length is about as long as it could hold my attention without getting boring. on the other hand, there is only very little unnecessary padding that would artificially increase the length. hunting down memories and those 23 side quests serves only as an incentive for exploring and didn't felt too forced. overall, i do not regret buying it on sale, but if money is the concern here, other games can offer much more content for less. if your main concern is invested time, i say you can't go wrong trying this one."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"wait for a sale. i purchased it on the ps5 for more than 50 off. i'm going to buy it again for the xsx at full price because i want a stray 2. i understand this game isn't for everyone, but this is why we have youtube. check it out before you buy. don't worry about spoilers. the game is pretty much a pointandclick system with an open sandbox design. i enjoy this linear progression because it prevents the stupid busy work to pad game time too many games have. while there are a few secrets which can be found, the story is the point of the game, not the play time. walk around, explore, be a cat. i do agree 30 is a bit much for an unknown game, which is why i waited for a sale, but depending on your take after playing it will determine if you found value in the game more than 30. not many did, and that's fine. can't say this game wasn't directed at cat fans, that's for sure."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,the game isnt worth anything more than 8
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"it's definitely boring, stupidly short, and ridiculously overpriced. it's a great looking game, but that's the only good thing about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"if this helps, jumping is scripted. you target your spot, a popup says press whatever to jump and then you press the corresponding button. this one fact alone made me not buy the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"g2a has codes for 15 for pc or ps5. i know people have had issues with them, but i buy from them a lot and so far everything is good."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"it even won indie game of the year in a year when tunic existed, which was honestly hilarious. i was laughing my ass off."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"the game awards usually likes to put at least one indie darling in the goty nominees with the rest of the big aaa games, even if theres almost a zero percent chance of them winning."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"except awesome ambiance, a solid story, and characters i ended up caring about."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"yeah, if you remove the protagonist and interaction system in a game it's almost like it's just settings and dialogue. you sound so fucking stupid. being a cat is fun, they made a good cat game, they should be celebrated not berated by children tier logic because it wasn't dark souls."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"reminds me of people who play jrpgs, skip all dialogue then call the game boring."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"this is what made me not buy the game. this was on my instabuy list but before i did i watched a streamer for a few minutes and saw the scripted jump system. i absolutely love cats and this game looked amazing, but scripted jumping is just not being a cat. so disappointed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"its almost like they have chapters and a screen that you can choose what chapter to play through. only reason you would need to do another run is to complete the game in under two hours. just 100 the game like, last week. if you miss anything, use chapter select."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"yea im a cat person my whole life, theyre very graceful. i mean, i get that it would be difficult to mimic manually, but not impossible. just difficult to figure out"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"based on the comments i got i wont buy it now, maybe wait for a discount like you said. well see! thanks guys."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"15 is still way, way too steep. i'd say the game is worth maybe 5. i bought it for like 20 a while back and felt ripped off."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"story huh? characters you ended up caring about, eh? you got jokes, for sure. that's a fact."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,lmao you are getting pretty worked up about your boring cat game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,god you are so fucking dumb.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"they didn't make a good cat game though, that's the problem. they made a game where jumping is context sensitive and scripted. that's fuckin pathetic, full stop."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"like, i loved the concept of a story game from the perspective of a cat and the platforming suddenly works perfectly within the game world. i'd like more games of this style. i'm not sure what was boring about it..the stories were lovely and the world was vibrant."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"exactly! we never found out if stray finds their way back to their cat friends... also, there were some robots and the fate of humanity, but we all know lieutenant cat wouldn't care all that much. maybe except for b12, but the rest is just a background noise."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,"i didn't know there was a chapter select! alright, i'll have to give it another go, thanks for pointing that out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-20,y'all really have a vendetta against this cat game. sorry people liked it more than your game that year. sorry they didn't make it stimulating enough for you.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2011-08-10,"it's a pretty fair assumption given the layout varies wildly from store to store. a lot of that has to do with how they obtain stores, often buying abandoned and unused stations and refitting them instead of building new ones. it's cheaper and more efficient. cheers!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,the only positive thing about how long it's taking for this game to come out is that i might actually be able to buy a ps5 in store to play it on when it finally comes out.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,hahahahaha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"it's also on steam, if your partner is on pc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,i saw a bit if gameplay. at some point it gets quite a lot of fighting against some dark monsters. you meet a professor helping you on your quest and putting some tech on your back.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,2023
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,the story will be a major factor in the success of the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,must be
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,why u say that can i know?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,hey man im from egypt and i love video game like you and any body here best gamers in the world sorry im speak arabic and try to be good in english i respect all video gamers and i have a video game store in egypt and i respect all console wish you good luck and much luv to all good people here
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"no. op is a legit game nerd. he just likes to talk about games. english is his second language and from his account, he speaks and writes in arabic. perhaps he is using online interactions to learn english better. broken english is common for learners but it just takes a bit more thinking to understand what he is saying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,"eh they've posted on rxbox too, and nothing he posted is any different than the usual top posts on this sub. just a basic question and picture of some game. honestly, this whole sub really is kinda just ads in a way. that's why i like it, i get to browse until something grabs my attention or reminds me of a game and next thing i know i'm playing it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,sometimes people just have one thing they feel they can or want to talk about.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"also a straight up lie, as you can also get it on steam, once it comes out that is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,"i hope that the release date of this game will be delayed at least a year and a half, it must be properly developed with its distinctive idea"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,its also on steam.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,thats y i have a ps4 on the side..for the exclusives!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,where do you find those???
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"in times they are needed, such times they appear"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,have you not heard of exclusives? i don't like them but there's tons of em. sea of thieves is pc and xbox exclusive for example
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,how can you prefer something youve never seen or touched?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,you prefer steam deck to what? it's a pc. you prefer it to all other pcs?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,gimme that haptic purring please.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,no! this game has to become a little masterpiece and should be given all its time to achieve that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,you should have just reposted this 5 hours ago when you knew your title was bullshit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. still looking forward to it though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,why are you even getting downvoted here
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,rengrish
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,this post smells of an add for playstation
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,steam says 2022 maybe it isn't as play station exclusive as you thought.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,an egyptian thats cat mad well i never
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,"good on ya, op!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,is it easy to get a ps5 in egypt? some of my friends in the smaller european countries can get one whenever they want. in other countries it's close to impossible.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"i feel bad for thinking they were a botshill then, but also, this post implies the game is only on ps false, and gives the impression the game is out now also false. so yeah.. i'd like to be more supportive but the content would need to merit it. thanks for clarifying anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,so there is a possibility that half the people on here are corporate marketers larping as gamers so they can lowkey advertise or recommend their games to us? wouldnt be surprised tbh.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,it came to my mind that i'm not the only one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"oh, cool!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,i might pick up a ps4 if the preowned price hits 100125. it's not worth it for stray and detroit for me. lol. not a fan of spiderman or gow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,i sure hope so
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,are you a bot? what the fuck is this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,fair enough.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,you think you can find those?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,exclusives and paying for multiplayer are the dumbest fucking things ever and why i hardly play console anymore. i dont pay for games if they are exclusive to one console.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,i watch thousands of reviews and all good
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,i prefer any console made me happy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,lovely
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"this is very true and wise! please stray take your time, become better then good become great!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,ok thnx for good word
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,because steam release says 2022
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,no need to be an asshole because op is english second language. how many do you speak?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,"i attribute more of it to karmafarming, but sure"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,oh yea i got a used one as well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"yes, easily. especially 4s."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,thats not what prefer means. prefer means its better for you. not random people on the internet. you cant know if its better for you because youve never even seen one.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,op sound like a bot or a very dumb human
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,when i wrote the reply it said 'not yet'
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"arabic,hebrew,english,and im looking to learn irish and germany or polish"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,enough languages to know i really dont care what others think. its a joke bro
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,just wanted to say my wife and i have been tracking this game for a while. we cannot wait to play it together
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,ok i take your advice and thats the reason why im in reddit and meet nice people like u
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,mate he's clearly not a native english speaker
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,i can reply for your unkind words but i give you respect to the end and remember all you say are coming from your environment
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-22,i like play games any where
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"it's clear english isn't their first language, so how are they a very dumb human?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"and below it says planned release date 2022, i doubt this got updated in the meantime since our comments are 2 minutes appart."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,nice! keep it up!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,x1
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,god bless you
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"if youre truly a nonnative english speaker, here is a word for you to learn that might make it easier for you to communicate on the internet. patronizing ptrnzing apparently kind or helpful but betraying a feeling of superiority condescending. your overt politeness comes off as sarcastic and condescending. dont be more polite to people in english than you would in your mother tongue."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,no i mean ops comment said not yet when i wrote the reply
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,thank you
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,i didn't know that my way was condescending. i didn't really mean that because i'm not professional in speaking english. i apologize a lot. i never mean to be condescending. i encourage a respectful discussion and benefit from nice information from you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-04-23,"oh, now that makes sense"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,bro made game statistics better than i keep my financial records
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,there's some extreme bangers in the play queue. op is in for a wild ride.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"what im about to share is not bragging. its more like a confession. my game spreadsheet catalogs my collection of roughly 6,000 games. it includes each games title original and released as, platform, launcher, original year of release, developer, igdbs critical rating, genre, visual perspective, theme, play mode single player, coop, etc, my personal achievements high score, completion, etc and the date i achieved it. making it, i learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. i think in the end the most important lessons i learned were about myself."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,yeahhhh outer wilds
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"for your interest, horizon forbidden west is coming to pc in february 2024"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,just bought outer wilds.... heard it's amazing and to go in blind
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,play kotor 2! though 1 would be higher on my ratings lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"love seeing outer wilds with a perfect score, hard agree. highly recommend bumping prey up your play queue. its an absolute banger, and if you enjoyed somas philosophical elements, youll dig prey a lot. putting the forgotten city on the queue instead of eventually. its pretty short and sweet and definitely scratched that outer wilds itch for me. drop subnautica below zero or put it wayyyy back in the backlog. it was okay but fell way short of the originals charm."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,anyone else satisfied that outer wilds is 3rd place and outer worlds is 3rd from the bottom? just makes the list look nice and symmetrical.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i loved to the moon
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,soma so high on the list made me smile. that game is an absolute hidden gem.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,yall doing gaming like its some sort of job or something
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,omg!!! chrono trigger is amazing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,halo mcc is def my top rec from your upcoming list. so much greatness in one download. it truly is fantastic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"if you get a playstation, i think you'll love ghost of tsushima. if you end up liking journey, i would strongly suggest following it up wirh abz and sky children of the light. both of those are absokutely delightful games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,thank god im not the only one doing this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i understand everyone has their opinion and you can have your opinion no offense but that new vegas under 4 placement hurts my soul
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,where's witcher 3?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i will suggest for you to get yourself a nintendo, they are cheap. once you get one, you will add at the very least 10 more titles to that list."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"baldurs gate 3 needs bumping up that play queue, its an absolute masterpiece."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"check out the witness if you like puzzle games, its a first person game. do not look up solutions, its much more rewarding not to."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,great shout with deus ex. my all time fave.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,this man spreadsheets
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,bro. you should really get to playing the witcher 3. no prerequisites required to understand the story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"no dark souls on the list, but bloodborneelden ring and sekiro? surprised."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,you need to move ori and the witcher 3 up in that que order haha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,deleted

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,mass effect andromeda ahead of portal? bruh..
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,it bothers me to see portal that low on the list
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i read theif as the if and thought what the heck is that game also you know whats missing? terraria.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i edited this into my initial comment, but you already upvoted the original, i think, so just to make sure you don't miss it if you end up liking journey, i would strongly suggest following it up with abz and sky children of the light. both of those are absolutely delightful games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,cheif
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,seeing as elden ring is in your favourites i dont see why demon souls is not under the play if i get a playstation section
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,so was rdr2 your first ever rpg? im always curious as to why its so disproportionatly loved on reddit as a 1010 yet ive never actually met anyone who thinks that in person. i personally have it average rated as a 7.2 since 4 in gameplay 7 in story tellingpacing 7 in art direction and world design 8 in sound and music flex slot 10 in graphical fidelity
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i wanna play steam games but i have only the playstation 4 and ps plus extra
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"from the play eventually list is chose inside, god of war , last of us edited to add ezio collection and limbo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,glad you like soma i love that game so much
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i would for sure add bioshock 2 to the list of games to play. you can get the trilogy remastered somewhat cheap now and thats my favorite games of all time so i recommend hopping to that. also id play last of us sooner rather then later unless you watched the series. my only addition to your list which is amazing! is the borderlands games. not so much one because its a bit dated and hard to get into but those games are a recipe for fun.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,if titanfall 2 won't make it into favorites i will be very disappointed...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i recommend adding sekiro to ur future games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,did i miss you playing starfield without mods?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i would move baldurs gate 3 up your queue. i would also insist you try witcher 3.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i know it's not next on the list but titanfall 2 is amazing, you should deffo play it asap"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"ah yes, another outer wilds connoisseur. cheers mate!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,9.7 for cyberpunk huh. i mean i liked it but 9.7?! lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-11-06,i don't mean this in a mean way but my dude this is some of the nerdiest shit lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i'd suggest either far cry 2 hates you, weapons jam and you get malaria or far cry new dawn colourful, post apocalyptic fun over 3. the villain in 3 is great and it's well regarded but i honestly enjoyed the other two a lot more, and new dawn is much more manageable in terms of area size!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"howlongtobeat.com would save you 5x more time. its exactly this, but automated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,the last of us 1  2 deserve to be on the if i get a playstation list
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"if you're a fan of the wizarding world, then hogwarts legacy is a mouthwateringly beautiful nostalgiaimmersion trip. if not then the gameplay is pretty repetitivenot very deep mechanically and the story is cool but pretty railroaded."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"careful of hades, friend...that one might logjam your queue if it clicks with you!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i have one too but i dont rank them, most are a short reason why ive binned them off. theyre in chronological order."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"our ratings would be very similar... some notes fallout 3 should be a priority... the lore of fallout is soooo good. seems you like sims as well... so i'd suggest the tropico series, cities skylines, civilization series, surviving mars, and planetbase."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,bro i'm copying your spreadsheet.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"lovely stuff! for me, completed story games my fav is control. so i was glad to see it so high on your list!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"mate enjoy prey, it's one of my favourites. i'm sure you will since you ranked half life so high."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"dude, i'll be honest, that's pretty cool. i love the play queue, it would probably help me decide what play next."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,keeping a spreadsheet seems so exhausting but so damn useful.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"oh my god, it's like looking in the mirror. glad i'm not the only freak who does this"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"lol i have the same playstation list too, just in my head. might finally bite the bullet and buy one during the coming holidays. also surprised to see soma so high up. i dont think i ever got past the last level, the diver guy was too scary"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,what app do you use for this? i'd like to try
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"move these to the top of the todo list witcher 3, dragon age origins, deus ex mankind divided, bioshock infinite, prey, assassins creed 2, chronotrigger, doom."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,where is your eh to terrible list of games?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,my favorite games are your amazing games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,no kotor 2?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,do you by chance play eve? lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,why though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"ive done a similar sheet before. just a quick heads up if you want more objective rankings per se, then you should probably divide games into categories and rate each category accordingly. that way, youll get a more complete picture of your favorite game. your rating inflation is too high. on a 110 scale, if youre using the same scale that game reviewers use, then 7.5ish should be the average."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i do the same but a bit different. mine is all games in one list and then there's a big pie chart with 4 categories completed, ongoing, not started and unlimited games that basically don't have an ending like racing, mmo or fighting games. by every game there is a completed date. it's too late now, but i wish i put a started date too so i know how long it took me to complete some games. the list is almost 400 titles now and my goal is to have every single one on completed by the end of my life. the reason why i started this list is bcs i replayed some games on and on and got bored with gaming. by having this thing, i played through titles that i knew for years but never touched them. there's just something in that green completed that makes you want to discover what's next."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i do this too!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,what's soma?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"love the list! but if i may make a small suggestion? do resident evil 2 before 4. not for story progression or anything, but man oh man itll whet your appetite for 4 like you wouldnt believe"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,gotta put part 2 alongside the last of us
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"... if you're ranking games out of 10 but using decimal points as well, why not just rank them out of 100? other than that, you've done well if you have managed not to play any games you thought were shit!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,just wait for forbidden west on pc. it should be arriving at some point next year
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,re4 before re2
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,play if i get playstation  bloodborne. i can see that why

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,woo mass effect representing!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"btw titan fall 2 imo is a 9.510 only because the story isnt that long, i def recommend it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i would recommend also trying resident evil 7 and village at some point
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"ok but where is the row with time spent playing and achievements gotten s no gta games, also i feel like youd like the dead space remake."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,soma

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,horizon forbidden west will be on pc in 2024... also you don't plan on trying atomic heart?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,is there a website or program where we can keep a list of these games? like tv time used for tv series or movies.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,future eve online player here
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i thought that i'm the only guy who does that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,original half life is a must if you haven't played it before.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,damn i should do this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i used to keep a spreadsheet similar to this, then i found out about playnite. you can import your steam, xbox, switch, and ps games or any custom games and categorize them the same way i.e., completed, score, not yet completed, want to play. not 100 sure how you would handle the play queue but i guess you could make that a custom field called play queue and then rank each game e.g., 10 for cyberpunk, 9 for inside, etc. its nice because it gives you a visual library since it downloads covers and artwork and also allows you to filter and sort easily. one of my favorite features if i dont know what i want to play is to click random game which essentially picks a random game from your library you can exclude games youve beaten or already played. send me a message if you have any questions about playnite. it took me about a day to set up and i totally abandoned my spreadsheet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,agree with most of those scores but bioshock at 8.4 is highly suspect. you likely didn't play the title when it first released so i'll let it slide
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,bloodborne is at the top of the list of you get a playstation. a dude of class
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"add dying light to your playlist, its the best game according to me an expert"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,fallout 4 rated higher than new vegas?? heresy!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"it makes me feel so out of touch when i see people with lists of game they've played and it has a ton of different games in it, because i feel like nothing gets me excited nowadays. last two games i got hyped for were persona 5 royal back in october 2022 and that wasn't even a new game and payday 3, which came out recently but suffers from a lack of update a month after its release. i envy people who can play very different genres of game and still have fun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"this is a new one, with only games i mean. i often see this but with trophy hunters and completion percentages, difficulty, estimated time, etc. there was a time when one guy on rtrophies posted his spreadsheet and people started popping out of nowhere with their own creations. i swear, every time i opened a thread, it was an ever better one. im talking line graphs, charts, and literally the most confusing shit ever lol. good list tho. you definitely have some quality stuff on deck."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"kotor below jedi survivor is blasphemy, mans prolly didn't read any dialogue."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"pc games or ps games op, i am assuming. please see if you can get gears of war a try too. not sure if it has an emulator thing on pc...but it is an xbox exclusive. great stats though. i keep my todo list in a similar fashion and basically try to get a disc in used condition once demand has gone down."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,put the arkham trilogy on that list.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"dude, baldurs gate 3 needs to be at the top of your list. everything about your preferences says it will be top 3 if not 1 for you"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i too have it, on my steam profile."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,between baldurs gate and prey you should plan bg3 second and thrid playthrough
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"haha, i have a spreadsheet of games i still want to play one day for all platforms. thanks to that i usually don't buy games at launch at full price anymore, there's still plenty of older ones that are discounted now."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,add demon souls remake to your playstation catalog.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,you need to bump bg3 to the top of your queue damn hades is really good too

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"when it comes to the play eventually list, prioritise the dead space remake. the game is absolutely phenomenal."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i keep one as well, mine is different, i track the cost and playtime to see my average cost per hour for each game and total, to remind myself it is very inexpensive for the numbers of hours i get out of it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,detroit over disco elysium?????!!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,it's frustrating me that resident evil 4 is higher on your play list than resident evil 2. i know there are other games between them but that just seems wrong to me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"youve got god of war ragnarok bur from what i see, you've skipped god of war. cant play the sequel without playing the first. plus i highly recommend it anyway. plus the spiderman games. death stranding. uncharted series. last of us 1  2."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"dont know if someone mentioned it, but if you loved that much elden ring and want to ply bloodbourne, you should play the entire saga"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,your personal feedback on each is overly appreciated by me!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,courious how would you rate the last of us part 1 and 2
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"glad you appreciate soma, truly one of the best stories told in a game as well as a super immersive setting, the interaction with the world is great too and increases this believability."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,no spiderman?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,definitely dont skip then 2018 god of war. the story builds off that foundation and i think its arguably the better game in a lot of ways
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"if you played sandbox style flash games when you were young, rimworld might be the perfect game for you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"you would love this site called backloggd, its all about logging the games you play and reviewing them. its basically letterboxd for games if you know what that is."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,can i get a copy for the template?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i'm not seeing stray on there...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,there is a really good app of tracking games you played called gg would recommend!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"you should try using backloggd. it can help you track how long it took to beat the game. httpswww.backloggd.comulatodeszcz thats my account as an example, i mainly use it to store my wish list and backlog"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,damn! jedi survivor being rated higher than fallen order is just blasphemy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"stray, hm?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"if youre jumping on the fromsoft train, add armored code 6 to your list"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i don't trust anyone rating a cat simulator at anything less than 10.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i like it. personally i upload my reviews in backloggedhttpswww.backloggd.com it's like letterboxd but for games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"so many good ones coming up, like titanfall 2, bg3, and, when you get it, bioshock infinite might i recommend nier replicant and automata? my top two favorite games of all time automata then replicant. and if youre potentially interested in turn based games, i would recommend the persona series. all in all though, a great list. people often forget that even 7s are still above average and i think thats why some are even a bit upset with the list."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,you are my favorite kind of person
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"bro, please play breath of the wild!! i got similar tastes and it is my favourite"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,im slightly out raged by fallout nv being lower than fallout 4
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"highly recommend adding metroid prime remastered or primehack on pc steamdeck, shadow of the colossus, and demon's souls edit also glad to see you're planning on playing the old thief games  absolute classics"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i didnt expect to see me andromeda in there.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,put gta v story on the list to play
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,nice list for sure. not sure if you want recommendations but witcher 3 is probably up your alley.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"real q. what metric do you use to rate your games? looking at andromeda with a 7.1, i played it on release and then after several patches and can see maybe a 6.0 i barely rate on a 1 to 5 scale. same style games ish. metroid dread. 15. hated the levels and the 1 shot robot zones. the stupid counter mechanic that doesn't work on said robots. it's randomly timed, yea.. hollow knight 55 atmosphere, maneuverability, and customization. i'd give it 65 just for the extra splat noises. 75 if dung defender showed up throughout the game and yelled numa numa numa at you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,hades is going to fuck up top of your chart
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"just a recommendation since you have playstation on your list if you do get one, id honestly add the entire metal gear solid series to your list of games. the story alone is worth it. the legend of zelda franchise across various games would also be a worthy addition to your spread sheet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i can not get 1 soul to try and play outer wilds.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,please play titanfall 2
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,play dark souls.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,no gta?????
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i also keep a spreadsheet on my gaming. but im mostly just keeping track of what games ive completed from what system. ive gotten into retro gaming in the last couple of years, so its fun to watch the list grow. i dont personally like generating numbers to describe how i feel about a game, but i do also keep lists in my notes app of the games ive completed by system ranked based on personal preference rather than ranking on a stricter critical review system. its fun to organize."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"you and i have similar tastes, id move god of war 2018 up your list to play."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,do you have anything for games you dont like? or are you good enough at picking them that it doesnt happen much?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,im gonna do this

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i do this too, but my list is just what i played, and what i completed, broken into weeks and months. its help me to focus and keep track, without hopping around not finishing anything. i also mark the year the game came out, and as ive been going through my backlog from the last 5 years, ive only played 3 games from 2023, and played about 40 in total so far."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,get middle earth shadow of mordor  shadow of war on there. i think that you'll enjoy them both
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"oh nice, glad to know i'm not the only one who does this. good way to keep things organized and remember what i have available."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,soma and outer wilds? immaculate taste
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,you have to play ghost of tsushima. one of the greatest experiences i have ever had. if you love samurais you would enjoy it. the combat is near perfect. only complaint is which there was more beheadings
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,7.5 on papers please despite making this whole spreadsheet op clearly doesn't like paperwork
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,man if only i understood wtf to do in outer wilds

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i keep a list of games that ive completed with their difficulty and my hours to complete. very helpful for wading through a backlog.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,what i am getting from your spreadsheet is kotor2 is next on your list to play.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,damn and mine has almost 900 games on it

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i think you should play game franchises back to back. i guess though it depends cause sometimes the games are too similar, but thats what i like to do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"as someone who also keeps a google doc to track, rank and review all the games i finish, i have never felt so seen by a stranger on the internet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"soma was a 9.8!?!? the story was pretty peak tbf, but the gameplay was kinda garbo. except that one puzzle where they spell out to you how the consciousness copying works if you haven't wrapped your head around it yet"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"would recommend putting in life is strange1, before the storm, true colors in the might play section. those games aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have great stories and characters that can maybe be relatable to you. i don't see spiderman in there either, they are fun games if you like spiderman. the batman games are must play, people hate on batman arkham origins but i'd recommend you play it and arkham knight. god of war 2018 is brilliant. i love seeing lists like these of people who play games just to enjoy them and maybe walk away with something if not at the very least a good time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,man people really love outer wilds dont they?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,metal gear solid v still a must play to this day
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i am very saddened to see that the metal gear franchise is no where to be seen not even on the pkaystation list.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,for your own sake move baldurs gate up in the q. i havent been invested in a game like that since skyrim came out.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,add tears of the kingdom and add spiderman 1 and 2 to the playstation list.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"do you use howlongtobeat.com? i feel like it works well for this too. i don't even really bother with inputting the completion times, i just use it to keep track of games i played and the make notes about what i liked."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"cool list! i will definitely be checking out your top 3 at some point. currently thoroughly enjoying my first time through hollow knight  masterpiece imo along with elden ring. there is such an absurd number of extremely great games now, it's hard to keep track, let alone try to play them all. this is a handy way to keep it organized  might do something similar myself."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,shadow of the colossas
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i wish they'd release ghost of tsushima for pc already. it's a sin not to have played it. ranks up there with rdr2 for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i love this!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,nice! only thing i would add to that list would be ff7 remake.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"based on how you've enjoyed the games in that list, the two ori games will likely break into your top 20."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"this is cool, i did something similar until i found out about backloggd. you should look into the website, it does have free statistics, ratings, etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,it just hurts seeing the last of us in the eventuall category

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,can you elaborate on why stray is in your top 10? out of curiosity.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,putting new vegas that low should be a crime.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"good post, i just finished forbidden west, you'll love it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"no dishonored or gta v? elden ring is a favorite, but no dark souls?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i didn't especially like subnautica below zero. it's a bit dry. in a nonliteral sense
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i'm glad you ranked soma so high.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,cyberpunk may end up top 5 for you if youve never played it. surely is for me now.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"it's cool to see to the moon on someone's list. as an autistic man, that game hit hard. it left me sobbing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,feel like if you want to play aw2 you should play control first as you can probably get it much cheaper and it still holds up very well in terms of visuals and gameplay
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"if you liked cyberpunk before phantom liberty and patch 2.0, youll be blown away by whats new. its now a great game"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i figured i'd mention that it's baldur's gate iii, not baulders gate 3. it's possible you don't care, but i figure for someone exacting enough to make a spreadsheet for this sort of thing, you may care about the accuracy of the name."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i love that soma has such a high score, it's such a hidden gem! i never play horror games, but the story kept me pushing through until the end. that final scene with simon and catherine on the launch pad was so brutal. even knowing that simon was wrong about the coin toss, a little part of me was still hoping he was going to magically appear on the ark and not his copy."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i was about to suggest adding prey to your list, but i'm glad to see its in there already assuming its the 2016 prey. prey has by far the best level design i've ever seen in any game. the entire game world makes sense from a story and gameplay standpoint. the space station feels lived in, like an actual place that could exist and be run by people and function. and just like real life, there usually isn't just one way to get to somewhere you want to be, and the game gives you tools to bypass locked areas using a bit of thinking and experimenting. there's one section where you go into the lab that runs and repairs the 3d screens around the station, and the devs of the game made a 3d color grid test that 100 percent makes sense. its like the color bar tests used on real life monitors, just pushed into the 3rd dimension. its a small detail but to me it showcased the amount of effort put into to making a believable environment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i don't keep excel i just use google notes on my phone. it's helpful

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i'd recommend the devil may cry series besides the 2nd game honestly most fun i had and being one of my all time favourites. would start off with dmc3 since that has the best written story and being chronologically the first game in the series, dmc5 has great combat and a great storyline as well but nowhere near dmc3 lvl of storytelling. overall still an amazing series and a great experience. if not, i'd also recommend the gears of war series"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,soma was such a good game that i feel like wasn't spoken about much. the gameplay was kinda meh but the narrative and perspectives were done so nicely.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"just as a recommendation, i'd check out obsidian. it's a powerful note taking app that can let you build a database out of things like this. i'll attach a video of someone doing something similar with movies. httpsyoutu.bethkcgghquk?sirdscw0bxcnno080a is it a little more complicated? for sure, but you can do a lot with it in addition to your ratings"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,you got to play the 3 watch dogs games they are so good in my opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i'll say that, in my opinion, deus ex mankind divided is both better and not as good as human revolution. mapsetting wise i think i liked hr more, but gameplay wise mk is an improvement. even let's you properly beat bosses without killing them! still absolutely worth checking out as it's a direct continuation of hr. if you like deus ex, you'll definitely love dishonored. probably one of my top series by far. just don't forget the dlcside games, and consider deathloop if you like dishonored. different setting and not for everyone, but it's very dishonoredlike. i also recommend sekiro, but just know that it is a hard game. you can definitely feel it's made by fromsoft, but it's plays nothing like elden ring or other souls games. still, i highly recommend it if you can stick it out. last, if you don't mind a rhythm oriented game, i highly recommend hifi rush. came out this year and is personally my game of the year though i haven't played baldur's gate or finished totk, so that skews things a bit. it's also on game pass, so if you get into that, you don't need to pay full price!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i was thinking about posting mine spreadsheet, because i came with similar idea and kept it updated since 2020, but i don't really want to steal thunder from op. since i'm mostly playing on ps i keep separate sheets for games released on sony consoles and separate for other platforms which is abysmal in details compared to ps one. this is mainly due to ps trophy hunting since i'm very invested in it. my spreadsheet is organized with the following columns  sorting nr  game title  game series  dev  publisher  psn  disc is physical release available?  ownership do i own digital or physical copy of game, or f2p  hmiwi? how much i want it? 5point scale, separate for standard, vr and classic ps1ps3 games  ps plus was it given in ps plus  ps plus extra is it available in ps plus extra  ps plus premium is it available in ps plus premium  hype lvl only for unreleased games, 3point scale, lowmidmax  platform ps 12345  ps5 optimizedimproved only when the game was released both on ps4  ps5 or received ps5 version at some point, i.e. games have separate entries and trophy lists  ps console exclusive yn, selfexplanatory  currently playinginstalled yn  owned yesnoavailable in subscription  100 yesnostarted  percent trophy completion percent  plat platinum100 full completionunobtainable  plat diff taken from trophy guides published either on psnprofiles, powerpyx, playstationtrophies or other sites which aggregate guides  plat time as above  how difficult i think it was to 100 game? my plat diff rating  plat diff rating  my own calculation which involves diff  time taken from published trophy guides as well as average percent of trophies  completion from psnprofiles. results are between 0.55  100, where 0.55 indicates game with 1 diff rating which be completed up to 1h and has 100 completion on psnprofiles. new games that have 00 completion and no trophy guide reach rating of 100 i round it to 1 to avoid calculation errors. this effectively helps me to keep track of what to plat next  what to expect from games. some games are long  easy, some games are short  difficult as well as all the flavors in between. rating is spread by centiles  based on calculated difficulty to acquire plat 0.551.29 i.e., what remains of edith finch 0.89 1.301.79 i.e., bugsnax 1.62 1.802.29 i.e., ghost of tsushima 1.94 2.302.79 i.e., god of war ragnarok 2.58 2.803.29 i.e., tomb raider 2.89 3.303.89 i.e., fallout 4 3.71 3.904.79 i.e., dark souls iii 4.19 4.805.99 i.e., the witcher 3 wild hunt 5.63 6.007.99 i.e., red dead redemption 2 7.75 8.00100 i.e., deep rock galactic 14.58 some examples of platinum difficulty calculations from 2023 baldur's gate iii 6.68 resident evil 4 remake 3.31 diablo iv 6.60 marvel's spiderman 2 1.80 dead space remake 2.51 alan wake 2 2.26 armored core vi fires of rubicon 4.07 x200b  average completion on psnprofiles selfexplanatory  plat percent on psnprofiles selfexplanatory  score sorting nr  rating  legendary 90, mighty 8489, strong 7583, fair 6674, weak 6065, awful 5059, trash 50  weighted score  calculated from opencritic score 45, opencritic recommended 20, metaritic score 35  my reviewscore 80, only for games i have at least 1 trophy in.  opencritic top critics rating  opencritic recommended percent.  metacritic rating  my reviewmy rating  release date  borrowed who did i borrowed my physical copy to so far, my library has more than 3000 entries of released games on playstation systems  i'm tracking 340 games that have been announced. it also helps me to keep track of what i own, since thanks to it i know that i   own 481 ps games 60 physical  421 digital  have access to additonal 675 games through subscriptions"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,lemme see
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,but no rating?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,you cannot leave us hanging like this. c'mon?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i thought i was a psycho with my database but it's not nearly as complete as yours, i need to see this"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"making it, i learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. i think in the end the most important lessons i learned were about myself. did you make any friends along the way?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,bro. you have to share it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,outer wilds and cross code are my two off the beaten path favorites lately
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i'm playing the dlc right now. the base game is amazing. the dlc is amazing as well. landing on the sun station, most frustrating thing ive experienced in a long while until i learned how a trick through trial and error."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i really liked that game but i got stuck like 3 hours in and never went back. i really need to get back to it to finish the story!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i am still mourning the fact i can never play it again
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"how do you know somebody is an outer wilds fan? coz theyll tell you! just kidding i love it, its the most creative thing ive played for a long time  but its difficult to get my mates to play it without giving anything away!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,no fucking way.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"and gow ragnarok will follow. then spiderman 2. eventually ffxvi. in other words, if you don't usually play sony exclusives at launch, they'll be on pc eventually."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,this gives me hope that we will see spiderman 2 in two years on pc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"also fyi op, you can play most of the games in your playstation list on pc via cloud with a ps plus ultimate subscription. i know because i did exactly that last year, now prices skyrocketed but could still be worth"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,well with the final shape destiny 2 been delayed till june. guess ill have plenty of time to play hfw
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"so like most games, that means it'll be playable smoothly august 2024"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"have a blast, by far my favorite game!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"go in blind, but know this. if youre stuck somewhere, go somewhere else. the game never expects you to brute force anything. theres an easy way to do everything. all information you need to proceed is given at least three different ways in three different locations."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,godspeed. i wish i could wipe that part of my brain and experience all over again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,play the dlc if you have not
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,fantastic game. it was difficult for me to complete the game because of thalassophobia but for people without that fear. blind is 100 the way to go.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,kotor is definitely in my favorites. it can't not be.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,kotor is a 10 for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i feel that comparing forgotten city to outer wilds just sets it up to be a disappointment. it's a fun mystery, but imo it's nowhere near as satisfying as outer wilds"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"agreed with below zero it had no soul, and the ipad voice, good jesus it was awful"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i really loved below zero. thought it was fantastic!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"prey 2017 is so underrated, always hyed to see it getting recognition"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"the forgotten city is one of my favorite games of all time, the feels, the music, and everything! not at all what i was expecting. i just want to stay in that city forever almost."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,which one is the new vegas in space?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,played it years a go and still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. banger.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i thought the story was amazing!! that was my first time playing a game in that style though, so the gameplay was a bit of a hurdle for me though, deff not a bad game by any regard tho !!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,it holds a special place in my heart. its one of very few games that had me dwelling on its story for weeks.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,whats the full name?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"lol yeah i do this to kill time, mostly on lunch breaks cuz find ranking stuff fun. my movies and shows ones are even bigger"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,brains like what they like
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,that's only because this would feel like a job to you. to other people like op this is fun to do.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"shockingly, some people find it pleasing to keep things and lists organized."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,chrono effing trigger
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"if you like chrono trigger, you should check out sea of stars. it's a pure love letter to the snes era rpgs. i'm about halfway through and i love it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"beat every campaign on legendary a couple months ago for the first time ever in about a month i think im ready for a replay lol, of the first three that is. excellent series"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"that's totally valid!! i had nv higher for the longest time but recently moved fo4 up when i looked back at how much i enjoyed each game. nv is 100 the better rpg, but i think the actionvisualsthe fact i live in boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. i do wish it had as many clans and groups as nv did though!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,it's in the play eventually section!! i do think ill love that one but the amount of game there is can be a bit daunting  full intention on doing a full playthrough though!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,do you mean  baulders gate
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i'm actually surprised this is the first comment questioning the low portal 1 placement  for some reason as a kid, i played portal 2 and skipped 1 but years later i went back to 1 and it just felt underwhelming compared to the scale of 2. definitely a great game, but unfortunately i ended up mostly comparing it to 2"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"when i was young i played 2 without 1 for some reason, i recently went back to 1 and was underwhelmed comparing it to 2  still an absolute classic and a great game!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"ooo hell yes!! i'll add those to the list, because i have a strong feeling i'm going to love journey!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"that's a really good shout, i forgot about that one!! added"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,especially since uncharted is listed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,then he should check out system shock after that since he loves bioshock also
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i'd recommend black mesa tbh hl1 looks a little rough these days. hl2 is still decent though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,fo3 above both
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,its one of those games. a game i wish i could forget so that i could experience it again for the first time. it starts slow but its very worth it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i do think i'll play those ones eventually!! i kept the playstation list on the shorter side for the ones the really excite me but the spiderman games do look pretty cool too!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,it looks really good!!! it's in early access so i'm waiting to see if a bunch more content comes out before i start it  but the styledetective gameplay has me keeping a close eye on it!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"also, didn't see the metal gear solid series"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"tbh the first time i played, the flight controls and the wonkiness of walking around on giant's deep made me quit an hour in. i questioned all the praise it would get on here and eventually gave it another shot before it finally clicked! my favorite part of the game is how thought out and intricate the solar system and it's physics really were! i really appreciate how unique each planet is and how it's dynamics worked perfectly with the time loop. i love mysteries so finding out stuff along the way that i literally couldve done at any point with the tools i've had the whole time to solve the final puzzle within 30 minutes. when things finally started clicking and made me feel like a genius, it just made me appreciate how well thought out every single bit of the game and design really was. i had genuine curiosity to find out what happened to the nomai and figure out the unique physics of each of the planets that i've found so hard to match by another game! and the way music plays into the game, the soundtrack as a whole, and the epicness of score of the final mission was amazing! all leading up to the ending which i felt was super well done, invoking some sort of existential feeling thats hard to explain. i cant fault you for hating the gameplay though, since i felt it too when i first playedquit ahahah. im just so lucky it finally clicked for me, which, if it doesnt happen for you and the physicsstory dont connect to you thats okay too!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,the ambiencecolor scheme in that game was unlike anything i've played and sooo cool!! i really wanted to meet the girl in the end though ill admit lol the section where you feel like you are being watched is so unforgettable though! will def check out the hellblade game !
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-11-01,omg i need to check this out!!! thank you so much!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"that's totally valid!! i had nv higher for the longest time but recently moved fo4 up when i looked back at how much i enjoyed each game. nv is 100 the better rpg, but i think the actionvisualsthe fact i live in boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. i do wish it had as many clans and groups as nv did though!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"it definitely is a slow burn! for me a lot of the fun was actually just vibing! going around and robbing peopleenjoying the sceneryhuntingfinding a new arearandom encounters was such a vibe during the pandemic for me and spending time getting to know the crew and hanging around camp made the big momentstwists in the late game super hard hitting  and the end emotional!! i do get the criticism i see a lot that it feels like a chore with certain aspects, so i do feel like it gets better if you start to get attached to the characters but can deff take awhile to get there"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"the game gets a little bit better until you get to the end of chapter 3, then it gets exponentially better. there's a pretty lengthy compilation of streamers at the beginning of the game talking about how boring it is and then by the end of the game they're, let's just say all in."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"no, it doesn't."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-11-01,"i'm not a rdr2 fanboy, it get's a little better but not by much, it stays extremely slow and scripted in missions, the world opens up a bit more to do some side activities but they are not rewarding or anything, just flavor."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"the story has 6 chapters, and an epilogue. 50 of the story is told in 4.5 chapters, the other 50 only in 1.5 chapters. however, before some people disagree with me, until reaching that point where the story escalates and you go doing mission after mission, there are plenty of things to do in the open world. rockstar gives the player the freedom of exploring a full and lively open world, compensating for the linearness of the main missions. game offers amazing views, from big cities to creepy swamps vast grasslands to challenging mountainous paths livestock towns to deserts and much more. the prologue, or the first chapter to be more clear, is very slow. the 2nd and 3rd chapters are where you should engage with the open world the most, to hunt, to play games, to interact with npcs, events etc. from the middle of ch. 4 and onward is a downhill for the story, it becomes quite gripping and may even be hard to follow. but it is definitely a game that has a lot to offer, an incredible detailed world and characters that feel real."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"as a bostonian i just had to!! i've walked down half those streets irl, such a fun experience"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i was going to say, no minecraft?!?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,with how much hype it's getting online in super pumped to be able to give it a move up from the queue
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"story wise those 2 deff have stray beat, i really don't know what it is about stray but i was just so engulfed in that world! visuals aren't everything but i also think that game was one of the most gorgeous ones i've ever played with the neon lights and reflections i also loved the aesthetic of the greenerynature combining with the cyberpunk. i also loved exploring the civilization of robot people and learning about them! it just holds a special place in my heart!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i read somewhere that they can be played out of order and everyone keeps hyping up 4 to the point i shot it up a bunch out of excitement lol but if it's better to play then in order maybe i should contain myself and wait ahahah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"autism, probably."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,prey and phantom liberty are superior.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i read somewhere that sekiro is harder so part of me is just lowkey scared i won't progress lol, i barely beat elden beast by the skin of my teeth. i do really wanna try it though!!  a buddy of mine told me ragnarok hits better if you play them back to back so i'm half waiting to see when it's coming to pc and half waiting to see if i'll get a playstation. but i fully expect god of war gamea to be 9s or 10s"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,it's actually in my top 10!!  my goodness that game is fantastic. i listen to the soundtrack to chill still
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"ahaha yeah that one turned some heads  when i was young i skipped 1 and played 2 for some odd reason, and when i played 1 recently i felt underwhelmed comparing it to 2  definitely a classic and deserving of all the praise it gets!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,yeah for sure!! i'll dm you a copy when i get home from work!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"outer worlds was deff not the most fun for me, just pretty visuals  i will say kotor is deff a good game i can see why people love, but i had the twist spoiled for me and am not huge on the combat system so it didn't go super high, but i think if the twist was a full surprise it would've been up a few slots on my personal enjoyment scale! great characters for sure though"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,lol tbf the bigger one isn't in order just the shorter queue!! i feel like i would be in more of a rush to play it if i hadn't already watched the entire game on youtube  but i do fully plan on playing it myself some day!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"both incredible games!! but ranked on enjoyment, i had to give skyrim the edge partially due to nostalgia and being my first rpg! i remember watching it on youtube as a kid and finally buying it with my own money. such a special place in my heart!!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,for the longest time i had new vegas higher but recently thought back to each game and how much fun i had  moved fallout 4 up. i really liked how new vegas had a ton more groups to interact with but i think i just personally enjoyed fallout 4 more due to the combatvibeand exploration more. part of it is also that i live in boston and it was kinda crazy how accurate some of the areas were  so it was cool exploring and fighting on streets i've been on before. i also loved the story and i filtrating the institute
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,i have a fiance  i know when we get married next year i won't be gaming much so trying to get through my catalog ahahaba
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"that's why i keep pushing it back, im worried characters will feel bland afterwards lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,luckily i actually haven't played a game id consider bad yet !! i rank based on soo many things but mainly how much fun am i having? does it feel like a chore to do certain parts? how much am i connecting to this gamehow engulfed into this world am i? am i craving exploring and finding more? how much do i wanna go home and play this game? and stuff like soundtrackgameplaygraphicsatmospherestoryending factor in too !
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,my memory is kinda bad so sometimes i just like reading back what games i've played and it helps me remember my favorite ones!! like i look at certain titles and just reminisce what parts i adored. mostly a time killer during lunch breaks though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,those ones are ones im considering moving up to the queue once i get through the current ones!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,thank you my friend!! i've actually not had a game i didn't like so far luckily!! if i had one below a 7 id probably just drop it though  i mostly avoid games i know i wouldn't like too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,ahaha i'm sorry!! the combat wasn't my favorite and the twist got spoiled for me so it took a bit of a hit for my enjoyment scale  still incredible characters that deserved a slot in the great section !

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-11-01,"yeah it was just beautiful and relaxing. you forgot about the world and all other things playing it. i mean we all wanted to, to be honest  do that, i think you wont be disappointed based on your list!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-11-01,"i saw you mentioning being in love with mass effect now i do not know what is going on in that game, but from what i understood enderal and mass effect trilogy share common concept of the world and plot simply put, enderal is mass effect trilogy under skyrim's skin seeing you hyped made me curious, mind to share your experience once you thouch the enderal?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"told in 4.5 chapters chapter 2,3,6"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"is it that accurate? i didn't realize! i'm playing through now 40 levels in and i'm loving it so much, played nv, 3 76 before this and i've gotta say this has been by far my fav fallout experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,that's awesome! o got a rec bullet storm! super duper fun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i grew up playing so much minecraft but didn't feel like it had enough of a story to rank it compared to such different types of games. but with how influential it's been on my life, it would be top 3 if i had to rank it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"you're correct, even story wise i prefer stray too. just an awesome game from start to finish"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,really depends on the person. i found sekiro to be easier than elden ring. it is faster but parry focused and more aggressive. the lack of equipment and stat leveling means you dont have to worry about having a bad build but you also wont be able to overlevel to beat a hard boss. imo its more satisfying that way so i prefer sekiros combat but both are great games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,favorite soundtrack? mine is between nkg and greenpath.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,me too please if you don't mind. this is awesome!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,youre wasting time!!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,haha totally fair!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"it is not a must play the puzzles are horrid. if you're willing to look up puzzle solutions when you get stuck, then ok maybe. but that's not really playing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,the issue that has plagued the outer wilds since it released. always mixed up with worlds..
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"i struggle giving things low scores and the ones i really hate i just don't finish so i can't rank but agree that outer worlds felt p bland, esp coming off of the crew from mass effect. the graphics in that game are one of the compliments i can give it tho, the world's had some super pretty colors!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"that's fair enough! did you play it years after it came out? when it was first released it was absolutely amazing, the graphics haven't held up well over time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,do you file them alphabetically. like d for doughnut.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,you keep them!?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i couldnt finish it. it was too many puzzles! i enjoyed the game despite the puzzles, in my experience. is the resolution of the game that good? i was very close to the end"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i mean, its completely optional. theres no reason to manually land on the sun station except to say that you did."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,i just wish there was a little more hand holding it explaining what you are supposed to do. i should watch a tips and tricks video. my younger self would have loved the less hand holding. have the new easier game styles made me soft?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"yeah i didn't really enjoy it. i feel like i would've enjoyed it more, if it had not been for everyone on the internet treating it as the holy grail of gaming. i understood the plot in like an hour, explored for a few more hours and then beat it. at the end i was just confused as to what the big fuss was all about. a great puzzle adventure game, sure. but i wouldn't call it one of the greatest games of all time like many claim."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,or 0 if it doesn't have denuvo
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,the game released in 2015 when i'm in high school and now i'm unemployed

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,then im happy. as a person who completed it what would you say to someone who dropped it after arrival in the hub station and cant find motivation to get back to it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,lmao this convo made me laugh

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"bg3 is an amazing game. the sheer level of quality and tedious detail put into every last square inch of that game is unrivaled by any game i've ever played or even heard of. i would say you should bump it up in your queue, but it'll make every other game feel meh after you play it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,"its only similar to me in that dialogue can have consequences. everything else is different so not sure why that comparison was made but its still a good game, at least the first act is"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"given the effort youve obviously put into this spreadsheet, i suspect you might come to hate bg3  youll have to introduce a new category for games that score 1110."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"a short hike was a very pleasant way to spend an hour. i had a little kick of underwater games abzu, beyond blue, and in other waters. having developers listed helped me realize i love annapurna, so ive explored some of their stuff machinarium, samorost, creaks. there so many more, but those are some of the most memorable."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"yeah understandable, the puzzles do feel like too much sometimes. it's satisfying to complete them but it can get frustrating. i really enjoyed the conclusion so would recommend you to finish it but do note that you will want to do the dlc as well since that's essentially the final conclusion and it might not feel complete without it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"nah this is the vast majority of peoples experience playing the game. after the tutorial section your free to roam so checking out each location does give you something to do for a few hours. the frustration comes imo from the fact that since its a nonlinear game, the info you do find is all relative and usually somewhat out of order, which makes it really hard to get a grip on whats going on. once you hit this point you more or less have to trust that it will start to make sense the more you play. eventually when you start making connections the game becomes the best thing youve ever played. my suggestion is to pick a location in the solar system, explore it, and if there is info mentioning another location try to go there next. if you follow a string of clues like this its way easier to understand the underlying narrative. once you make it farther into the game, there will be puzzles that you get stuck on. my advice is to try exploring elsewhere because the answer to some of these puzzles are located in a completely different area of the solar system. good luck and youre in for a treat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"for what it's worth, i gave up an hour in my first time and only returned months later because people on reddit loved it so much and now look where i have it  once you get it, you get it. just gotta keep exploring everything you can on each planet until you can start connecting dots to progress further on each! if you're stuck, move onto the next planet"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,it won't it's a sony game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,don't give ideas and delete this comment

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-30,cuz it just isn't very good. it's the definition of mediocre to me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-10-31,"i just finished it the ending, i wont ruin it for you, is very unexpected. i thought i was at the halfway point by the places i've visited and very few things i accomplished. suddenly, bam! thanks for playing if i were to get into it again, i'd play it like an absolute clown. just not give a rats ass. would make it way more fun"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i love how the announcer just straight up said after we remove all the bots idk why it was funny as fuck to me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"im sure the internet will react to this outcome in a calm and reasonable manner, as they are known to do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,unlike chris judge i am speechless
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,never diss the sheer power of spite
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what happened to sonic in this case is really the definition of shooting ones self in the foot. im fairly certain they would have stood a better chance if they had just kept quiet instead of stirring a hornets nest. one does not simply challenge the chinese gaming community. especially in a numbers game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what is this? is it just a cute way of saying players choice?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sort by controversy

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they found all the bot votes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the subreddit mods are going into full 1984 mode. they are pissed. also after we removed the botsif i remember correctly that was what the fan base accused genshin of doingoh boy did that not age well. i follow their subreddit for shits and gigglessome of the strangest and manic people on the net i swear.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,stray??? for voice award!?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,elden ring being on here is stupid. the player doesnt even have a voice in that game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,and i won no steam deck
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you could actually hear some people on the audience booing hah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"all of this most likely wouldn't happened if only a small portion of sonic fanbase just stfu and not being totally a dick. they had the higher ground, genshin fanbase don't give a shit about the award. but some assholes in sonic fanbase decided being radical for no reason to genshin community. now the damage has been done, nothing but salt and disappointment. while i'm enjoying freemogems although it's kinda worth whatever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i really think sonic would've won it had their fans just shut the fuck up for a bit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,are we really that surprised? its a f2p game with more downloads than the rest combined.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin impact really isnt a bad game. the only concerning thing would be their buisness model. where if you're vulnerable to such things you can easily spend much more than reasonable. you can play the game for free no problem though i've spent like 6 euros on it an had a ton of fun and definitely got my moneys worth of entertainment. updates over the past year have also been significant. graphics are amazing if you're into the ghiblianime aesthetic. exploration is well done and encouraged by scattering interesting sights and treasures all over. and while the combat mechanics might not be for everyone, they're not simplistic. and you can't beat the price of free to play provided you're not suspectible to overspending on micro transactions"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a genshin fan i am happy we won, but if people didn't bot for sonic, it actually would have been pretty close. but imo genshin doesn't compare to elden ring or god of war ragnarok in the slightest. it's like a match to a candle. but alls well that ends well i suppose."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,bahahahaha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,is there a criteria for games being allowed in the categories? genshin didn't even come out this year. where is my ocarina of time choice?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,am i the only one who feels like sifu got snubbed last night?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"never even heard of sonic frontiers. regardless of any sort of drama, there's no way genshin would lose in a popularity vote."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic toxic and racist fans triggered the wrong fanbaseespecially asian genshin fans,karma. anyway the game is good and fun,it not deserve all this hate honestly...i voted because i like the game and because sumeru is amazing,i appreciate the 800 primogemsgift for tga nominations,not for player voice but i didn't voted for that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,did stray win anything?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as much as i love playing the sonic games as a child i was actually expecting gowr to win tbh. sonic frontiers feels to me at least nostalgic from the characters to the open world but that is just it, nostalgic. the story to me was meh. also as an old sonic fan, i'm sorry that you have to deal with the toxic side of the community. sidenote while i do enjoy the sonic movies, arcane and edgerunners is just a whole other level of storytelling and visuals. i will be very surprised if they win."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,does this mean we can finally drop this topic and move on with our lives? even as someone who wanted sonic to win watching all of this toxicity hurt.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sonic fans in shambles
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,so whoever has a larger player base wins? what a great category.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin is a great game. congrats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,man fuck these weirdo sonic fans making the rest of us look bad. i just wanted to see the little blue homie win for once but seeing those racist remarks towards chinese people genuinely pissed me off. now us normal sonic fans have to get lumped with these toxic assholes and get treated as a joke.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic frontiers was so halfassed that im glad it lost. if sega wants an award, they should start pumping out actual masterpieces instead of technically incompetent games with cringetier writing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i feel like its weird that genshin won out of all of them but its also a free to play game on both pc and mobile so still not surprising
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"all sonic fans had to do was hype frontiers up by itself, without mentioning genshin and angering the entirety of china. the game was already well received and im still seeing a decent amount of posts on social media about it so there was no reason to start this fight to garner attention."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"does genship impact even have an ending yet? i've heard it was pretty good, but i'm not at all excited about starting a game, and they've only got like some of the story prepared for me, and i need to reboot the game years from now to continue."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah i think i'll stay away from twitter for a few days after this. let things simmer down.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,people really like to downplay how popular genshin is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,as a old genshin and sonic fan both... i can explain in great detail how it feels to be pulled apart in two directions
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"scrolled through about 100 comments and its genuinely frightening to see how onesided this discussion is. if youre gunning for frontiers, you get downvoted, if you support gi, you get upvoted. no exceptions. edit this comment is apparently an exception. go figure. i doubt this comment will produce any upvotes, but im tired of trying to ignore all of this, so here i go. i think frontiers had every right to get as far as it did. im not necessarily upset that it lost, but rather that people are celebrating its loss. of course, i get it, racists need to be punished, and i completely agree. however, not every sonic fan is a racist. far from it. for 99 of the sonic fanbase, winning this award isnt about beating gi. as far as theyre concerned, gi isnt even in the equation. reason 1 sonic frontiers was snubbed out of best soundtrack. you can hate on frontiers and sonic all you want, but the undeniable truth here is that sonics music is almost always toptier stuff. and frontiers is no exception. the common belief here is that it should have been nominated at the very least, and so the fans feel robbed of a nomination. hence, they voted in players voice to make up for it. reason 2 sonic fans want to convey to segasonic team that they have a good formula on their hands. over the last two decades, segasonic team or sst for short have been too quick to change or add mechanics to a sonic game. the whole reason behind their divisiveness is due to this constant experimentation, which stunts an ips ability to maintain an identity. sonic fans voted in players voice to tell sst that this is a really good foundation and that they shouldnt ditch it. thankfully, sst got the message despite not winning players voice, so no harm from it. either way, the vast majority of the fanbase dont actually care about gi, which is why you see most of them ask why its even nominated since its from 2020. for all the sonic fans reading this, id like you to know there was a very prominent sonic youtuber who told his fans to vote against frontiers out of spite. do with that what you will."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what stray doesn't win????
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,chinese gaming community is among most aggressive ones. once i've made a mistake and tried to play another chinese game. it was bad and i shared my thoughts through steam. there was a guy who traced every single negative review and in aggressive way answered them by any means necessary.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a reformed rabbi myself, im gonna have to say bill clinton deserved that category"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"are games like genshin impact available to win this every year? i ask because it came out in 2020. if it keeps updating then i don't see why it would for 2023, 2024, 2025... imagine a single game being voted players voice for something absurd like ten years running. i'd think they'd have to say you cannot win this award multiple times as the same game or i could see this scenario playing out."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,all the sonic fans had to do was keep their mouths shut. but nooooo they decided to antagonise a player base with over 30 million people!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah, but elden ring is goty"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,so a game doesn't have to be released the year of the awards to be nominated?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i feel like most people that shit on genshin have never played it. i for one thought it was completely different than how it is, i thought it was some multiplayer p2w game. it's actually a single player game, with while there is gacha elements, you can have a blast with the game without any gacha. it's singleplayer, nobodys forcing you to buy anything"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sonic fans were too toxic and genshin is a 2020 game so it shouldnt had been here next to 2022 games but they won anyways so cant complain
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"im honestly not mad, genshin may have some questionable fan base sometime but cast that aside and the game is pretty good looking, and i saw some of the boss music and i gotta say its really good, not my favorite game but i do play sometime when my friend want to show me something"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,oh no! anyway
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,im just happy anything else but sonic won after watching all the neckbeards reeeeeeee
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,we did it! genshin won
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i dont think ive ever been able to scroll to the downvoted comments so fast
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,thanks to this now i know sonic fans are more toxic than genshin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,not surprising consider the active playerbase of genshin is 600 times more than the total amount of sonic games sold.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what a motherfucker will do for allegedly 1600 primogems
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,of course it did.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"so between mihoyo buying votes, a weirdly racist sanic fan pissing off a massive demographic of genshin fans and causing a spite vote, and it being pretty evident that sanic fans were botting...is anyone taking this shit seriously?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you shitting me god of war or elden ring didint win this one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"this makes me happy, i love sonic and genshin but considering how toxic and racist the sonic voters were, plus going as far as using bots to vote, they didn't deserve to win"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,im sorry but elden ring should have won player voice not genshin.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,not surprised.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,beryl approves this post.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,some of the awards given really surprised me. some great games didn't even get mentioned
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"how many of these votes were out of spite of what sonic voters did? can we not vote out of spite, pls same goes for sonic votes, btw? it's still very likely that genshin would've won anyway but this doesn't feel valid at all. after hearing of this nonsense i hoped neither of both games would win. the players voice award felt like who can gather more votes to tell the other faction to sit down.. that's not what this should be about, imo. i don't care about sweet revenge. congratz nonetheless, tho."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,wtf is genshin impact
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"hey, at least it wasnt gow. mofos won half the awards but still lost goty lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"neither sonic, nor genshin should have won."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,minecraft should have won players voice
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well thats some bullshit, especially considering the game came out two years ago and shouldnt have even been considered for any category."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin who?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i an a sonic fan and i did vote for frontiers and i am a little disappointed that it didn't win but i do congratulate the genshin impact fans even though the game sucks please dont hurt me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well, it's not my personal choice, but i'm glad the bots didn't dictate the outcome"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic fans underestimated gi player base and provoked them unnecessarily. they could've had this on the bag, they fumbled. y'all were right about the chinese community coming together but people also have to understand that outside japan, sonic isn't as popular these days on asia. especially the southeast asian region. malaysia, indonesia, philippines, thailand etc., all have huge genshin playerfan base because it's f2p and suits their tastes more. the accusations by the sonic fans were so absurd lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well, it's deserved. i played it for a while, not my thing, but my young siblings 1420yo play it frequently with friends over discord and i see them having fun and taking part on a consistent community. the other games communities are a little individual due to the single player nature. i would vote for elden ring myself but i didn't feel compelled to vote, maybe if i played genshin impact and hanged around on some discord server i would maybe feel compelled and encouraged to vote. tdlr regardless of your taste, it's well deserved."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,still feel elden ring should have won but it let itself down with the lack of content since release
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,wtf does the players voice even mean? like that one time when people were sending death threads via twitter to kokomis va because she wasn't meta? kinda cringe this particular award
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,at least it's not sonic frontiers
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"wait, how are these games picked for nomination? isn't genshin like 2 years old now?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i dont respect genshin impact or its fans but yikes the toxicity was enough to make me stop caring all together. it was the players choice and the majority of the players chose that game, theres nothing wrong with that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,gaming awards. stupid on every level.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"game about gambling your money away won players voice? seriously, why are gacha games even legal?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"idc who won this at all, but genshin is cringe af"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't get how genshin impact won the voice category probably because i never played it. elden ring and gow ragnark voices were top notch
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why was genshin even nominated in the first place? it didn't even release this year.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,of course it did. cause keith silverstein was part of the vas
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,okay someone fill me in. what does this mean for sonic? what the fuck is this a big deal for?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's the only free to play game on the list so i guess it makes sense.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why? either elden ring or god of war had far better
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"makes sense. one's a free live action gacha game that's already been running for years and had plenty of time to build up a devoted playerbase while the others are oneanddone games. now if gi had straight up won game of the year, i'd have called bullshit."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i was hope god of war would win
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i lost a reason to put 2020 game in 2022 nomination
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm happy sonic frontiers at least got to the top 5! sure it was a complete shitshow on the internet with toxicity on all sides and people being buffoons but then again when is that not the case on the internet? i was happy to see lots of support for sonic frontiers and even though it didn't win, a silver ain't too bad either."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,took all those bots out for players voice but steam decks goin to 7134246610008 smh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,does genshin have many current players? or is it just bots?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,neither sonic nor genshin deserved it. sonic especially is a 6.5 at best. its only a 9 compared to previous sonic games. this is why i basically ignore user scores on metacritic. fucking god of war is being review bombed for christs sake.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ok thats cool and all, but genshin is definitely not better than bill clinton. thats just facts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,should i be playing genshin impact?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"well deserved win, sonic fans getting called out for botting is the cherry on top."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,well deserved.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why was genshin part of the game awards for 2022? it released in 2020.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,isn't the whole point of the game awards to be about games that released this year? how the fuck did genshin get on that list?!?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,bunch of broke bois voted.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,who was the runner up? a slot machine?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,imagine voting for a gacha game lmfao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,for the voices??? i mean for anything else id understand but yeesh paimon is so grating i play genshin with the voices turned off lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i have never seen sonic frontiers before, but i would like anything on the list to win over genshin impact"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,gross
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,deserved
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i think genshin impact is a good game and i'm not taking merit away from it, but why genshin impact was in this category? it was the only game from a previous year. i understand if it was best ongoing game or something. can someone explain like i was 5yo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin impact could have easily been in my top 10 favorite games of all time. the soundtrack, the world, the characters everything was just so cool. but the have is completely ruined because every aspect of the game is built around the most insulting monetization designs. it's such a shame because of the gacha mechanics it's a 010 imo when it could easily have been a 10."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"how genshin impact beat elden ring is beyond me. still, the game awards are a joke anyway"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't like a single one of these games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"how, genshin impact sucks"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this was such a big l for the sonic community. what did it matter if genshin beat sonic?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this will not define us. we will overcome.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,wtf isnt that like a mobile ad game lol why does that make it make more sense sadly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm not for sonic winning but live service games giving in game incentives towin awards is pretty damn low imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,of course the fucking gacha game won.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,bro genshin fanbase has to be the most incel fanbase in gaming

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i don't give a shit about sonic or genshin, but the fact that a gacha game won an award is disgusting."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"we gotta love gacha mobile games with stamina systems and shitty gameplay loops winning awards, although it is players voice. people gotta protect their investment."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the one thing i don't get about genshin is didn't it come out in 2020?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,cool a game from years ago won this year's awards. good thing these really don't mean much.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,booooo!! a weeb
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,bull.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,question though. why was genshin in a category with games that came out all last year? seems unfair to pitch a game that's built its fanbase for years against them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why is that game popular? someone help me. being serious
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i heard genshin bribed players saying if they won everyone got in game currency
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sonic fans gave their lives for this battle
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what is a genshin impact?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a sonic fan that wasn't really into the bad mindset of this, i was yes angry that genshin was kinda winning, after all, we waited so long for a good sonic game and when we got it, i was pissed that a game that appeared before this one was winning, my thing is, why did the others not kept their mouths shut to not cause a controversy? like i know we waited so long and after that, sega finally did a great sonic game, and people got mad at genshin cause they were taking away what they have been long waiting, or at least that's what i see, didn't know about the whole bot situation tbh, i'm just disappointed, a bit mad that genshin won? yeah obviously, but not too much to cause a tantrum, we are all grown up adults for the love of god"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,having played genshin i really don't see the appeal at all to it though it's all subjective so to each their own good for the devs. from didn't need more awards i guess
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,oh god i bet they do some weird shit to those voices
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i mean, they probably botted the votes, but not as much as sonic fans. a lot of the sonic fans are mad coping at the loss while genshin fans are just making it worse. both communities are really funny."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic fans are mad? wtf when's the last time a 3d sonic game was worth investing time in, right never. i grew up with the franchise and it hasn't been good since sonic 3. so janky and bad mechanically. i can't believe the game is even on this list."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,all 3 sonic fans must have been devastated.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the fact that a full pay to win game, that has spending very tightly incorporated into the gameplay systems, won a player's choice award is depressing and tad disgusting."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"so, is that thing supposed to be purely a popularity vote? cuz anything else wouldn't make sense to me tbh, gi and sonic frontier is certainly not better than any of the other listed games. even then it's still sad to see that these two cheapshots are so popular. and as a long time sonic enjoyer it definitely sucks that sonic still loses as is history mario vs sonic, now gi. however, the community fully did that to themselves. making your own mods lock your subreddit because you are to toxic doesn't deserve a celebration let alone award."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why was genshin even in? it's 2 years old already.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this doesnt seem like a true measure of game quality. elden ring and gow are objectively better games. but muh anime waifu ig.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,paimon  princess electric emo should've disqualified this immediately.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,medic i like genshin impact genshim impact? more like gay shit infact
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,chinese bots downvoting any remotely negative comments about genshin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i don't think this was deserved honestly. whilst the sumeru update in genshin is one of the best patches so far, for story and the open world, it is still a live service game that is always online and has gambling. i wouldn't vote for genshin for that reason. it needs to fix that issue before it becomes a game i'd consider game of the year. also the community voted this mainly for the free primogems which don't even get you enough to get one 4 star character sonic frontiers was really close, and i didn't even like it, but i voted it anyway because i'd rather a singleplayer game, that at least made sonic fun again, be the game of the year. especially where the other three games there wouldn't get a chance to win. i would have rather seen elden ring or god of war ragnarok win. lead by example... seems people want gambling in games huh?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm just saying if they didn't give the players primogems none of them would have voted for it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,we did it reddit! the pedophile game won! start playing the reddit anthem!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,tbh this category was just pity points anyway
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i couldn't give the slightest fuck about who or what wins. but i do think it's insane that a gacha money draining game or any freemium game for that matter is present on an award show. there are 4 games on the list that don't play on addictive habits of human beings and trying to drain every penny out of their player base. yet they get encouraged to continue this terrible practice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its not even a real game smh gamer for the last 35 years and i refuse to see gacha mobile games as real games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this is why players shouldn't have a voice in these kind of awards lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,bruh kill me i don't wanna live in this world anymore

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,if i voted for genshin impact on any vote ever other than most shit game then i would never show my face in public again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,is that the cartoon pedophile game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i wonder what was the distribution of votes in the voting of the gaming community?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"who cares, man."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,fuck my life nothing has worked out the way i wanted it to this year why couldnt the blue furrys win

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sigh. the players choice awards are such shite. god of war ragnarok should of sweeped.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the one game on the list i've never heard of until it popped up on this sub for these awards a couple days ago.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,due to mass inflecxtion of chinese voting bots.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin impact bad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,weebs out. get out of here. out!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it sort of bums me out that a gacha game is actually taking home awards. gachas have sucked the soul out of gaming lol i get it though they're addictive. as far as gachas go, genshin is king so i guess they deserve it. i just don't get into weeb shit so it's not my thing. honestly i was hoping to see elden ring not win any awards because the souls community is actually mentally disabled. sonic deserved to get one. sonic finally got his shit together it's been so many years since a halfway decent sonic game came out."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i think that genshin won purely because it's free to play. of course there are more genshin players than any of the other games imo it should've been elden ring or gow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,stray could have one if they had created a more sympathetic main character. i mean everyone knows orange cats are just mean.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah because they were bought out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i still don't understand why it was on the list at all. it didn't come out this year. or even the year before!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,didnt the developers say there were rewards? surely that isnt fair if they had done that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,both fanbases used a tremendous amount of bots to beat out gow and er. disgusting
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin and sonic should've been disqualified after the botting tbh

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i mean, sonic and stray being on that list, makes the whole awards garbage, since they don't deserve to be anywhere near those 3 games. stray was unpolished, there was really nothing to do, lack of xyz. sonic frontier, empty world and the pop ups are like level of ps1. elden ring god of war genshin deserve to be there 100"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,shitstain impact fans trying to defend thag the games hated because its from china lmaaaao ignoring the fact its a gambling game. god why are third world countries so poor.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why genshin even in game awards its not 2022 game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i liked the part where he said after we removed all the bots. so after they removed all the bots, the game from the country with the most bots won the award."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,one of these games is not like the others.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"why was stray even on here? it was a good game but it's not one you really get excited to tell friends about, and most of the interest comes from being a cute cat. once you finish it, and its relatively short, there's no replay value"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"you mean the meow, mrrpp, meew wasn't good enough ?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"people like coldplay and voted for the nazis, you can't trust people jeremey"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i knew from the beginning genshin is gonna win lol. it's just a popularity contest, nothing more. the game with the most number of active players wins."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,people that are mad remember that most of the vote is biased because chinese fans of these game easily beat all fans of other game and because its a chinese game naturally most chinese are going to vote for it you'd do the same if a game made in your country made it that far

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"perfect salt in the wound for sonic fans, who accused genshin of botting first without any justification. there was a graph showing a steady rise of genshin vote with a correlation to when chinese fan woke up and vote. meanwhile sonic fan actually botted, because after the accusation, there was a abnormal spike in the voting for sonic. you can't get that kind of spike unless the community was very coordinated with their vote, so the only answer was that sonic fans botted and it crashed the site."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,that was the best part. i bursted out laughing

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,and then genshin won. i think they removed the real voters by accident.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"disclaimer i don't care about any of these games aside from stray, cause cat. so one side does a shitty thing to win a popularity contest, but the other side gets away with literally paying people to vote for them? kinda feels a bit hypocritical."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,looks at twitter im looking at you twitter
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,whats funny because before he announced the winners he said after removing all the bot votes the winner is genshin. sonic famboys are fuming. chat was glorious to see.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i am so happy christopher just won. the guy is amazing and has such a good personality. live chat was toxic chernobyl tho.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the sheer power of spite for real, it's incredibly easy to miss. for example, i recall posts about games warning that things like lootboxes became more predatory. basically telling people not to support that. then a bunch of people responds they are going to buy stuff just because of the post, lmao. perfect example how some simply live of spite. since there is a real difference between nice to know, but my choice still and for telling what i should do i'm going to do the opposite now, hahaha!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i love how a lot of the spite started with people accusing genshin players of voting to get rewards. then genshin players who genuinely liked the game started voting regardless of rewards, just to show they love the game. and when genshin won, they didn't even get enough rewards for a full multi. and in the social media circles im in, the majority who were originally insisting they only did it for rewards are outraged on behalf of the genshin players, because the rewards were so little compared to the achievement of the fans, here. they're like damn, girl. you're letting mihoyo treat you like this? like, even their enemies are stunned by the developer's sheer stinginess. and if you know genshin fans, pointing out their parent company's stinginess is probably unintentionally the best clapback sonic fans could ever utter"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,whats the context with genshin vs sonic community?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i honestly think they would've won if they just didn't say anything. genshin players didn't really give a shit about this until the drama started being talked about. and sonic fans seemed really passionate about wanting this win. people say genshin gives free primos for award wins and they might, but when they last gave primos for tga win it was for best mobileongoing game, not for fan voted award like this one. i'm honestly surprised it didn't win best mobile game but idk i've never playedheard about the marvel game before today so can't really say anything about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they fucked around and found out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic fans thought they were just going up against a regular game fandom, they didn't realize that they were also picking a fight with the greater chinese population. this was the equivalent of pearl harbor."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic fans are dumb, ok? i would know"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"lets not pretend genshin isnt popular outside of china. between a middling sonic game with a great soundtrack to an outstanding new region expansion in genshin, i think we all know what the better game is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,so true...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,basically yes.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the sonic subreddit started locking and banning all threads about tgathe players voice vote shortly after the drama started. i think theyre really just trying to stay out of it tbh.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i voted gowr for round 1 and then genshin round 23 cause how annoying it was to see poststweets about how we must stop genshit from winning and then seeing some being racist. hopefully they learn not to be idiots on social media next time if there is one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a genshin fan, we were more occupied with the new expansion. they added a new tcg mini game system in the game and it's pretty fun i haven't even got started with the new story yet. i only looked away when i saw the sonic fan calling the kettle black and started to shittalk us. imagine having a history of being ostracized and labeled by the broader community and then pulling the same shit on other people. at that point, i was like i was gonna not even watch this show, but i ain't gonna let myself be talked down by a furry. they probably could've won if they didn't piss off the chinese player base."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i voted genshin but i would have been happy anyway to see stray win lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm sure the genshin fandom is full of great people, but dammit after seeing sonic frontiers get 0 nominations and the movie get beaten out by arcane, i would've been happy for my favorite game from this year to win something."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ironic since the genshin fans are up there with lol as most toxic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i play genshin a lot, but seeing the amount of awards gow and er were nominated for, and seeing the genshin vs sonic drama, i wanted stray to win because cute cat"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,i don't like genshin but there are 0 universes where stray beats genshin.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,those meows were strong
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,shehttpsscreenrant.comstraycatgamevoiceactormeowsoundslala deserved all the awards. lala is a god tier va.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the glorious death ahhhhh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"probably salty sonic fans lol. i mean after all they worked so much hard to bring multiple communities, youtubers, botting and still didn't manage to defeat genshin. they underestimated how big genshin community is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"bit of a shame that you didn't get enough for a free multi, though. and that's me speaking as someone who didn't really care that genshin won at least sonic frontiers got mentioned, and was probably the runnerup for that category. i'm more miffed that sonic frontiers got utterly snubbed for best ost than i am that it didn't win player's choice."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's honestly great. i buy the monthly card and that's pretty much it. obviously that means that at some point i've paid more than i would for a fully released game but they keep updating the game so i'm paying 7 for consistent monthly content which is a good deal imo. plus if i ever decide i don't want to i can just not buy the card sometimes but the game is still there with all of the updates
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"in the first round of players choice there where other games that came out years ago like minecraft , apex ,destiny 2 , ffxiv ,fortnite etc. players choice is only about popularity nothing more and wether someone likes it or not you cant deny that genshin is popular."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,probably the yearly dlc areas?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,as long as the game receives updates then it can qualify.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,basically just a popularity contest.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,advertising potential to geoff is the main criteria.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,i thought it would get best action game but bayonneta is a tough competition
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,tell that to sonic fans. apparently they think genshin fans aint huge like them.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,best indie iirc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,best debutant indie game and best independent game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,as a sonic fan. agreed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the amount of toxic people supporting genshin in this thread and spreading lies about other fanbases shows that they're not moving on.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"more like annoyed at how us normal sonic fans are being lumped with the weirdos. fans like me just wanted to see sonic win something, we dont have anything against the genshin fans."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,size of the player base means nothing if they dont come together. this was a unified effort for genshin fans.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,dont doubt it. but this was about playerbase size haha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sorry about that. if it makes u feel better. genshin fans are no stranger to this, their twitter community is one of the most toxic. and it ruins the reputation of the whole playerbase as an result. i agree its unfair to the normal fans in both games"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm convinced sega simply made sonic for money, then used said money for development on better games like yakuza for example."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,...the writing in frontiers was bad ? i'll give the story not being amazing to you but the dialogue between the characters and the overall charatcerization was pretty good. edit it is so clear most of yall don't even know the story or played the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the game was made by 60 people and they only had a couple of years. the devs worked their asses off for this game. if you don't want to see that, then your loss."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i believe its also on playstation
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"most sonic fans did exactly what you said. they dont care that genshin won, they care that frontiers lost out. the whole reason most people voted for it was because frontiers was snubbed out of best soundtrack."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no it doesn't. and it won't have one for at least 3 or more years so i guess take your time. they come out with new updates every month though. a large portion of the updates relate to the main story archon quests and there are interlude storylines here and there. new areas and characters are always introduced so they have something to hook players. but if you're looking to play the main story in one go, it will be a little while heh."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,well i started assassin's creed valhalla months after it dropped in 2020 and still haven't seen an end yet. at least genshin is upfront about it lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"basically there are 7 main countries in the game and each country has its own set of characters with a unique storyline called the archon quest. alongside archon quests, there are a good number of quality world quests and character quests to complete. at the beginning, genshin started out with only two countries but it's a live service game and that number has increased to 4 now with sumeru being the latest. if you join genshin now there will be plenty of content for you to play through, even i started in march 2022 and completed the main storyline just now. i've easily put more than 100 hours in genshin impact and i still have tonnes of quality quests left to complete so there will be plenty of content for a newbie. as for the answer to your question, no it does not have an ending as of now but we'll reach the final region of the game within 34 years which is also speculated to be the end of the main story."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"lets talk about geography the continent is called teyvat, with 7 nations inside it with an archon god ruling over one of the seven elements and a heaven called celestia as their boss essentially  mondstadt and liyue germany and china inspired  the first areas available during launch  inazuma japan  released during patch 2 updates release in segments like 1.1, 1.2, etc.  sumeru middle eastern inspired  released during patch 3 current patch  fontaine france  natlan south american inspired  snezhnaya russia outside teyvat is an area called the dark sea where the jurisdiction of the seven dont apply. it is where the losers of the archon war that survived have fled to and for now theres one confirmed area called  khaenriah an area considered the final frontier of the game story there were two wars that shaped teyvat as it is right now the archon war and the cataclysm. the archon war was a ploy by celestia to have seven gods rule over the entirety of teyvat. the cataclysm was a recent occurrence that happened 500 years ago, it is also the cause of most of the unnatural phenomena that happens in each nation. there are lots of lore tidbits in the game but theyre contained in books, items, etc. so exploring is a fun way to learn about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if youre not into liveservice games, dont even bother. it receives updates very often and is designed to be ongoing, but no, it doesnt have an ending. on the other hand, if you do like liveservice games with very frequent new content, then its honestly one of the best choices. dont know of any other that gets quality updates so frequently."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the main story is currently at middle point with 47 main nations released and a region is released once per year.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,most of the genshin community didn't care about the award either. we were enjoying the latest update that was recently dropped. but we started voting mostly because we got insulted.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a sonic fan, i'd like to say that i agree with everything you said and apologize for every racist sonic fan. i personally think that the fact that gi gives ingame stuff if they win awards is dumb and should be banned. but it isn't, and gi won fair and square. i voted for sonic frontiers not because i wanted to beat genshin, but to get sonic the recognition the series deserves."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm sorry, but reason nr.1 just shows me how little you know about genshin. genshin has had probably the best and most refreshing music in the industry in the last 2 years. easily up there with nintendo, wow or square enix. the ost for the newest region, released a few months ago, is 3.5h long and every single piece is incredible. they've combined traditional middle eastern and indian instruments with an european orchestra, creating far better and authentic music than say the generic middle eastern stuff hollywood puts out. don't get me wrong, sonic ost is good and iconic... but gi is just on another level. i understand reason 2 however, that's valid."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,probably none
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it did for best debutant indie and independent game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,and yet they didn't start the drama this time. sonic fans could have just kept quiet and enjoy their win but they had to be dicks and bring out the racism. in the end they got what they deserved.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,if they kept on getting updates yes apparently. also keep in mind this is for a minor category called player's voice
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,elden ring should have wont but im glad it wasnt sonic frontiers because i think that game is just mid at best
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well, people said no. the award is voted by the people  a genshin player who follows logic"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,60 million monthly playerbase. i don't thats the full amount of playersbase too lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,nah. tga lets ongoing games qualify for any category if they have new content that merits inclusion according to the jury. no matter how old it is
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,haters never care about reason. but i can say compared to old days many actually appreciate genshin but thats only because they actually bothered to try the game and not take internet opinions as facts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it was all to spite one guy im pretty sure. one guy pissed off a community of 20 million people, then this happened."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's a popularity contest. whatever is more popular would've won.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,stray did get a very good award haul tbh. goty was hopeless for them but they brought home some good stuff
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,just popularity vote. whos fans can vote the most for their fav game kind of thing. only based on fan vote
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin fans didnt care about the players choice since mihoyo doesnt give gems popularity votes. they only did it out of spite. we only cared about being nominated in and winning in the actual categories. however, we lost in both meaning we only get 800 this year for the nominations alone."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"this was a popularity contest not a best game awards,though elden ring did win that. hard to compete with a game that has over 60million daily users."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"player voices are a popularity vote so the game with a larger community will usually win. i know that elden ring is a great game but it still costs money upfront to play and the genre of souls game is too hard for the casual majority to enjoy. compare that to a very casual friendly f2p mobile game, the sheer amount of voters is just too big of a difference."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,card game with an bigass open world
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,breath of the wild  lite with f2p gacha system for unlocking new characters  weapons. and now apparently a ccg when you hit a certain level.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"elden ring won goty. the player's voice is a low tier award voted only by the public, and the game with the biggest and most active playerbase wins, it's pretty pointless."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,popularity contest between the players basically. i think the other categories are mostly determined by stuff like the press and reviewers etc while players voice is just the players
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,there where older games like minecraft and fortnite which all lost in early rounds.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's choice award is for any 2022 release and any ongoing game deemed as relevant. in the first round, 30 nominees were picked including games like fortnite, apex, and destiny 2."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its kinda confusing. its not voice acting its whats more popular is an players choice
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it's a player's voice category, not best voice acting category. confusing name, i know."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i might get wooshed here but the voice in the players voice doesnt pertain to the va though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it seems sonic fans just wanted it to win because they didn't get nominated for best soundtrack award. but then some toxic part of their community started insulting the genshin community which included the massive chinese player base. they promptly started voting for genshin out of spite and here are the results.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it wasnt bots on steam it was a glitch showing their ids instead of usernames
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,9 million daily. 60 million monthly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,it's free to play... why not try it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,that was the best part. this category and the random kid coming in the end made this tga worth watching. i was bored af before.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"because this isnt the best of 2022 game award. that went to elden ring. the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,stray won over genshin impact. best indie title category.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this award is people's choice. it's as easy as that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,did i tried the new tcg gamemode. completely f2p kinda like gwent everything is obtained through ingame no monetization at all even has pvp and u can match with ur friends too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you realize that elden ring won the main category right? elden ring is a paid game so ofc it would have a lower playerbase than a f2p game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,based
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,not even ragnarok?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,everyone's allowed their opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"poor sweet little angel  here, take a tissue"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"funny troll, but if you are serious, at least give it an honest chance before saying it sucks. it's unironically better than most games, dare i say ever released."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,mobileps4ps5pc
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"big ass open world gacha game popular in the east and the west, and on a crap ton of platforms as well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ik it isnt anywhere else the only reason its up there is cuz its up for being on consoles and oc as well as mobile its not bad but i fee like its pay to play almost but if we were going with gacha games anything wouldve been better dokkan, legends, sds, master duel, duel links, pocket mortys kinda, teeny titans 12, treasure cruise but eh least they get some love"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,speaking from experience?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"if ff14, fortnite, minecraft, destiny 2, apex legends all can be in this category so can genshin. they just didn't made it to final rounds thats all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad, i haven't put any money in it and i think the gameplay is super fun and rewarding"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm sure an unlimited grind like world of warcraft has done is healthy s limitations are healthy for playerbases and the game, look at ffxiv."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"this comment, along with 10 years of comment history, has been overwritten to protest against reddit's hostile behaviour towards thirdparty apps and their developers."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it is kind of unfair to do that, but then again we dont decide what these votes include, and this one also includes popular ongoing games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"extremely accessible for all platform. super chill and casual gameplay, constant high quality updates, amazing music, a great story plot that keep you wanting to play to know what happen next, an expansive game world that doesn't feel empty. maybe you should download and play for one day then delete if you don't like it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"massive open world, great character building, great art, amazing world building and storyline, consistent updates giving us a hell of a lot of new content. it hooks you really quickly, but its not like its a bad game. its genuinely good and has a lot of care, time, and money put into but, but then again it also has addictive gacha with pretty bad rates and artifact farming which is just fuckin abysmal, but that doesnt inherently take away all the good."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"triplea open world rpg crossplay, crossplatform, and frequent and consistent content update cycle. add the fact that it's f2p makes it one of the most popular and accessible game in the world."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"we got it for the nominee, not for winning"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this is ironic considering the amount of pedos on the genshin side
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,why though? isn't that being hateful for no good reason?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"because players voice is for games released in 2022 and any ongoing game that still has relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like fortnite, apex, minecraft, and destiny 2 were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"maybe its not the type of game u like. there are people who find souls game, god of war etc boring because not every game appeals to everyone. the important part is majority and genshin appeals them and thats where its success relies."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what bribery mihoyo didnt even announce anything. also few people in the genshin community cared until the drama lol. probably a lot of the votes is from the chinese community who are angry about the racist shit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"a community of 20 million people was pissed off by one guy, who then proceeded to start telling everyone in the sonic community to start botting sonics votes. im just sad elden ring didnt get it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"players voice isnt just games released this year, its also about popular games that are ongoing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't think you ever played the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm 90 story tbh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i play on english lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i dont think anyone in the us plays for the japanese voice acting
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"there was proof of botting in the genshin sub, not just baseless accusations. sonic votes spiked by 10k in a minute"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"there were botting accusations from both sides. apparently what happened was that the racist memes were sent to chinese players. then, they decided to get involved leading to the influx of votes. on top of that, it was some sort of holiday or remembrance day meaning they were bored since all their game servers had to be closed. the sonic fans saw these huge spikes in votes, but didnt factor in the fact of time zone differences and just how huge genshin is internationally. thus, they thought the genshin players were botting. so, they decided to bot in retaliation. however, they botted stupidly and added a ton of votes in a short period of time leading to the site crashing. hence why geoff called them out yesterday before announcing the winner."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,geshin isnt p2w my guy. you can have a great experience without spending anything.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,it cant be pay to win if theres no pvp at all and you can clear the hardest content there is absolutely and 100 free. theres hardly ever a meta and no place to need to be extra strong like you can get by paying. genshin is about as far from p2p as it gets
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,whenever it comes to anything you like. don't go looking for the community. i like elden ring and dark souls and gow. but i avoid these communities like the plague because i know that most people are elitists and care too much about unimportant stuff
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well, theres a lot of peoples in asia"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,like?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the gacha system is annoying, especially when i see a character i like, but don't want to pay for... but as far as i can tell, the system provides enough freebies to tide one over, and you don't need them to play like 90 of the content. the primary gameplay loop of exploration and puzzle solving does not have a paywall."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing as game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it. usamuawesome"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this specific vote includes popular ongoing games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"no, spite motivated"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"tga lets ongoing games qualify for every category, not like we chose the rules"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yes, player's voice was basically a popularity vote. there is no disguise here, it was advertized as such already. and yeah, most gi players only voted after the vocal minority went a bit too far. if not, most gi players only care that gi was nominated, but don't actually care if it wins."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,many games like minecraft were up for that award but were voted out. the time of release doesn't matter for it only the popularity.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"its ongoing, and gets major updates at least once a year."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yup, its about the games popularity. f2p game thats been out for a while, massive in the east and west, and available on many platforms, its bound to have more fans than a lot of the more recent games. doesnt mean its a better game, hell no, but its more popular and thats what this award is for"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,tell me you know nothing of anything anime related without telling me you know nothing anime related
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,and idiotic ignorant commenters are ok tough?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"nice argument, unfortunately, genshin's compliance with chinese censorship laws suggest otherwise"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,how about you check the criteria for this award first before you comment? idk. it'll probably help you look less like an idiot.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its not about yearly but updated games that still receive content. fortnite and destiny were also on this list.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,source?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"again, we got a reward for the nomination, nothing for winning"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you realize how big genshin is in asia right?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-04-05,"ha. you fail to realize that when it comes to genshin characters, people barely care about the small ones. they're too indulged with yelans armpits, lisa's voice, alhaithams biceps, itto's abs, and mona's ass. and here you are believing we only have eyes for the small ones, poeple like you are the real creeps here, pedo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,genshin is single player for the most part.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,how about next time you come up with something more original?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"they didnt bribe anyone. after genshin won an award last year the gave out ingame currency, so of course some people were voting for that reason thinking the same would happen this year, but there were no promises from the game developers."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"well, you've seen 10 minutes of gameplay. it's free, why not try 10 minutes of gameplay?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,dude you dont even know things about the award youre talking about

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,imaginw being so bothered by a chinese gacha game winning a glorified popularity contest that you create a whole new reddit account just to spam a bunch hate comments on this thread. havria appreciates your dedication.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its only because of sonic fanboys started to harass genshin. if they kept their moth shut and didn't offend the asian playerbase they would have won.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"brainrot vtuber pfp user detected, opinion rejected, l existence. but still, keep the salt flowing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"leave it to braindead genshit fans to vote for a game that didnt even come out this year, amazing they even allow games in mental asylums. its almost like players voice wasnt about games that came out this year. minecraft was in the first round for fuck's sake."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,to qualify a game simply had to have a content update this year. other options included fortnite and minecraft.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i know it may be hard with the little amount of brain cells you have, but i think you should read the criteria for the award"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah the entire online pedo community revolves around that game so no suprise they won via numbers and bribery
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,we didnt get a promise for anything at all but even the rewards yall think we did it for were not skins or dlc so???
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"lots of currency lmaooo please. number one we didnt get bribed we got primos just for being nominated not winning, secondly 5 pulls when you sometimes need 90 is nothing. we did it because other fans were being shitty about the game and it turned into spite votes"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the voice in the players voice doesnt pertain to the vas. the category is just popularity contest based on number of player votes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,by making players addicted and telling them they get free crack for voting for the crack game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"for one, the games writing is better than anything we've getting for a while now with some surprisingly emotional atory beats, the combat is simple but solid and the soundtrack is straight fire. the only thing is there are a lot of references to events and characters from earlier games that you might not get if you're unfamiliar with the series and there is slight popin issues, but all in all it's a really good game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its a category where the winner is determined by 100 fans unlike other categories where its 90 critics and 10 fans.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,clearly you haven't played sonic before.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,popularity. this is a popularity vote. also sonic doesnt have furries and weebs?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,cringe commenter
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,redditors when someone has a different opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's just player's choice award.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"they didnt. they never promised anything and any expectation we might get something would be for the other awards of mobile game. we never expected anything for players voice, and they never said theyd give us any. this was more of a spite vote than anything"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah right lets just toss millions away to get a useless award
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,well genshin is that popular and its a single player game gacha or not and the games budget is now more than 500 million dollars.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,how is it p2w when there's no pvp?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"win what, the pve? it's very casual and easy though, they even nerfed the already easy main story difficulty just so the casual players still can enjoy it, idk for me it's really a far cry from p2w"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,there is pay but not win.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,they said they took away all the bot votes. hows it rigged exactly? dont say they bribed players to vote since there was basically no confirmation for any rewards being given until after it was won and theres people who voted because they actually like the game and then other who just voted to spite sonic fans
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,active on rpoliticalcompassmemes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"since people are bound to run into stupid comment when they sort by controversial, let me use your comment to educate people. mihoyo, the creators of gi, is not the shitty chinese gaming company called tencent. they even refused to talk to tencent when they were asked to sell gi."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the award is for games released in 2022 and other ongoing games like minecraft and fortnite.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"dude genshin won bc sonic frontiers decide to be racist and toxic and stir the cn community, which if you didnt know, id one of the biggest. they legit poked the hornets nest, if they stayed quiet, they wouldve won"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"they didnt promise any primogems and they havent given us any for winning lol. genshin players initially didnt vote for this reason and were perfectly fine with giving sonic the win. then, all the racist comments and harassment came out leading to genshin players voting out of spite. all we got was 800 gems for the two nominations we got. the players choice award didnt give us any rewards."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"if sonic fans didn't decide to poke the hornets nest, fuck around and find out, they'd have won."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"oh no, the victory here isn't the award. the true reward is the salt of the cocky sonic fans who talk mad shit and then lost."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they would have won if they didn't trash talk genshin community and piss of the asian community. they lost because of their ego and arrogance.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"maybe a wild guess, but if they didn't get nominated for anything else it maybe means the game was mid compared to other games? it shouldn't deserve awards because it's an okay game compared to previous flops in the franchise, it's a fact not many people played or liked it so it isn't surprising it didn't win any awards."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"claims to not give a shit then proceeds to slandering. lol! totally f2p here, it means i spent 0. the game gives you characters and equipment to complete the game out of the box for free. dafuq are you talking about? the only thing i'm invested in is the deep worldbuilding and intriguing story. this is evidenced by the hundreds of lore nut channels on youtube theorizing the big secrets of the world. lol at people running their mouth on a game they know nothing about."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it has a nice story, cool characters, a good open world, interesting bosses, beautiful landscape and get updated every months or so. that enough to qualify it as a game to me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's literally the players voice lol. you can't be upset that a popularity contest was won but a game with a larger fan base the most of the other games on this list combined
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its not goty
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it only needed a content update this year to qualify, both minecraft and fortnite were also running."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,jerma pfp  has a somewhat racist post in his profile checks out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,appropriate username btw
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"popular game wins popular choice award, what a surprise. sounds like it deserves it if more people voted for it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what bribes ? this is 100 fan votes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"same thing i say about marvel snap, like wtf is that game even about? thanos snap simulator?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,f2p btw. can't hurt to give her a go
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you should play it. my favourite game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if you put it that way, then no game deserve any award because no game is perfect."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,shouldnt have provoked them i guess
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,should've pump the bots smarter in hindsight no?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i think mentality disabled is too strong of a term but they are gatekeepers with a slight superiority complex. btw have you ever tried gacha? it has actually a good concept at its core you get to try the game for free for how long as you want and only pay of if you can afford it, outside of really extreme cases"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you had my upvote until you dissed the souls community.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,tga allows ongoing games to qualify for every category if they release enough content each time. minecraft is super old and was in the early nominations
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,they didnt.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,gi can give some aaa games a run for their money.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"so is minecraft, apex legend, ff14. what is your point?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"nah, he's happy with the ad revenue that games like that bring him."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't play this game myself but don't judge genshin if you've never played it. it has obviously done something right. and i'm sure you're oversimplifying things and just hating on it for the sake of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,so much salt flows in your blood
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,dude really glanced at the game and decided it was botw copy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ofc its the dude that joined whitepeopletwitter subreddit that says this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,please explain how playing an anime botw after a certain age makes it so you should be on a sexual predator watchlist..
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"this award is 100 voted by players, it's a popularity competition"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm sorry when did genshit release?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"i did that with guild wars 2! i loaded it up... hated how different it was from gw1, then quit. came back a couple years later, ended up putting 400 hours into it. 2 minutes grants a poor sense of a game, i suppose. especially if you come in with expectations that it will match another game exactly. you'll only really note what is not like the other game and get disgruntled."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,thats not a good reason and he one in 2018 why would he need to really have that award does not make sense
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the devs never promised anything tho... this is just the genshin fandom voting out of spite
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they didn't even bribed lol. stop hearing misinformation on internet and spreading it as facts. they even told to vote in this category
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its ongoing though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"so does apex, fortnite and every ongoing game. but we don't talk about that"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,what a stupid opinion. most people arent gambling anything away. its f2p friendly game with the totally optional option to spend money. most people spend 60 for a regular game for what 30100 hours? lots of genshin players probably already have several hundred hours of gameplay for a few dollars or none spent at all.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,f2p grinning ear to ear
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,no because of a way bigger fan base.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the company claims to have removed the bots for the final count, some others speculate the chinese company paid tga off but there's really no evidence of wrongdoing and it very well could be the chinese fanbase is larger and more organised."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"source? i checked all social media, can't see any sign of bribery?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they didnt bribe anyone
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,people saw that er wasn't going to win and wasted their vote on sonic because it looked closer just to spite genshin. it might have won if people just voted for what they like instead of voting against what they dont like.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"elden ring and ragnarok would be fighting for this award but its a public vote so who has more fanbase wins ,and of course ,won by bribery"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"an open world game where you can play as different characters and progress along a story where you look for your lost twin that was taken in a war against gods and humans. people like it for the story, combat, music, visuals, and the characters. it has a gacha element where you can pay but they also give a lot of the currency for free and you can finish all of the content even the hardest parts for completely free all the way through if you want. for a lot of people, its not their cup of tea. but for a lot, it is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its a single player open world gacha game. people really like it due to the appealing characters and expansive open world you can experience for free.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"lmao i cant get over that most of the game just reminds me of botw mostly from climbing, the fairy, glidinh"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the player's voice award applies to any game released in 2022 and any ongoing game with relevancy. in the initial first round of 30 nominees, games like destiny 2, fortnite, and apex were also in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,open world anime rpg with constant update every 6 weeks with gambling as monetization. games budget is now more than 500 million dollars and becoming the most expensive game ever made oof for star citizen. in new update they even released a full fledged tcg game with even pvp
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"apex also was, same with destiny 2 and fortnite, but no one talks about that.."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i find it quite enjoyable. the exploration is top notch, and it has a light breath of the wild vibe. english voices are hit and miss mostly miss early on, so i use japanese dubs with english subs. the problems occur when you want specific characters for top end content like the whole evermoredifficult abyss stuff, because of gacha element... but exploring the entire overworld and main story, plus side quests, should be doable without paying a cent, and you can still do gacha rolls semiregularly and get new characters. just don't expect to max anyone out. i've unlocked about 7 new characters 70 rolls in about 10 days of play, but it's slowed down a tad., and haven't spent a dime. there's also a pity system on just 5 star characters, so you don't get locked out of those if you are f2p. i think its 90 rolls guarantees a 5star.. and your rolls carry over between the limited time character events. if you have the time, i'd at least recommend trying it, since it's free."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"was it one guy? i heard it was a few. but damn, all to spite that one guy, its damn funny."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sonic was actually going to win by quite a margin. but 1 single post promoting botting votes to assure sonic win took internet off. people started voting for genshin in masses just because of 1 guy saying sonic shouldn't lose because of a weeb game or something like that xd if you watched the live stream you could see people in chat going totally ham about it xd people really took that post personal.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin beated all the other games by having most votes from players.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,no its just popularity like whos fans can vote the most for the game they liked kind of thing. like a fan choice game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"essentially a popularity contest, the only fully fan run vote. just what fans can mobilize the most and vote this year kind of category"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-11,"the player's voice award is the only category in the tga that's mainly fanvoted on rather than mainly judgedecided on like the other categories. in other words, it's basically a glorified fan poll. it involves both games that were released in 2022 and any ongoing game that has relevance. in the first round with 30 nominees, games like apex, minecraft, and destiny 2 were in it. because it was a fan poll, the genshin fanbase didn't really care for it at all since hoyoverse usually doesn't give out awards for fan polls. we only cared about getting nominated and maybe even winning for the judgebased categories. so, no one on genshin's side really saw the point of voting. sonic fans have had it rough over the decades. even though frontiers was a controversially received game in general, sonic fans were really happy for once being that it was relatively better than sonic games typically are. so, they really wanted this win and could've gotten it easily. when sonic was winning, some of the toxic fans within the sonic community started unnecessarily throwing insults and racist remarks at the genshin community. the genshin fanbase has gotten a lot of untrue hate online over the years and you can see a bunch of them repeated throughout the thread i.e. the p word being thrown around, chinese botw knockoff, a mobile game that isn't a real game, microtransaction infested, etc.. so, the sonic community basically kicked the hornet's nest because the genshin community decided to vote out of spite in order to stick up for themselves for once. additionally, a lot of these hateful memes and messages were sent to players in china. being that they see genshin as their pride and joy, they took a huge offense to it. furthermore, it was some kind of national day of remembrance or something meaning that their game servers were down and they were bored lol. sonic fans basically woke up seeing huge spikes in numbers, but didn't factor in the difference of time zones as well as how huge genshin is internationally. they thought we were botting, so they botted thinking that it was the only way they could get on even grounds. however, they did it stupidly by adding in huge numbers at one time rather than spreading them out evenly throughout the day leading to suspicious results and even the site crashing. during the tga awards, geoff had a snarky comment over the botting and announced genshin as the winner."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i think it should've been ragnarok or elden ring for sure, but genshin has been good too, and while the free primogems are nice, the salt from sonic fans who will remain in denial is funny. i think people took this too seriously. it's literally a popular vote, and genshin is incredibly popular, even for a f2p game. it's just silly to get worked up about."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they literally admitted to botting what are you on about

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,lmao ridiculous. its insane that people literally just hate genshin for what it looks like yet wont play it. genshin has one of the best stories ive played in a game in yearsonce you start heading to inazuma.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i bet they both were botting votes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,no botting necessary when you can just bribe people
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i do have to say the voice acting in my opinion for frontiers was much better than what i've seen from genshin. then again i also think ragnarok had both beaten.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,both sides botted. gi just gave their players currency so they won.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,how did they bot? i just voted as normal
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"nice deflection, genshinbot"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,is it just me or does that new sonic game really suck? i cannot get into it at all.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic frontiers is really meh. open world was a good idea but it is poorly made and the light in game probably was based on british weather, which makes you depressed. sure maps are vast but empty and look like they were made from bought unity assets by internt. enemies are total joke, zero creativity just some robot that do not even have a character or a sould to them. this game looks more like a prototype than finished product. i really wonder why it was even considered for awards. in comparison genshin has also huge open world but it does not look so empty, there is ton of things to do, story quests and enemies look much better and you can feel they are alive. ignore the gacha system and you have solid title comparable to zelda breath of the wild."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm still surprised there are sonic fans at all. most of their games end up garbage.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"but the sonic community was very coordinated. fadel, aka gamescage, basically rallied the community and people outside of it to increase the votes."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the rewards were for the two nominations, not for player's voice. same 800 after losing to among us in 2020. didn't get any for golden joystick's still playing award either. freemogems is a meme, rewards aren't guaranteed and anyone saying otherwise is lying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin fans were sleeping on player choice awards until sonic fans provoked em. if the primos were such a big influence wed have also won the mobile award. there is no nonsensical excuse as paying people to vote. it was silly cuz they didnt piss off just any fanbase, they pissed off china at a time of their mourning no less. sonic had no chance of winning the moment they woke us up when we honestly didnt care about voting otherwise. even without all those who may have voted just to spite sonic fans idiocy while not caring about genshin in the first place, sonic didnt have a chance after their racist drawings."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,3.6 roentgen. not great but not terrible
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i honestly got to the point where i tend to block chat especially if a minority shows up on screen. it's just too toxic.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin has been stingy since launch. they have periodic moments when they hand out primogems, but these periodic moments are set  anniversary, around chinese new year, etc. but nothing beyond that. this is also probably why genshin is so popular and so liked. it's complicated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i love how a lot of the spite started with people accusing genshin players of voting to get rewards...  ...when genshin won, they didn't even get enough rewards for a full multi. in other words, it was totally true"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"wait, so the real headline here is gacha game wins an award by bribing players?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"some sonic fan insult genshin chinese community with racist insult and calling them bots and hacking the vote, chinese player who didn't care about the award decide to vote genshin just to pissed sonic fan. then sonic fan decide to attack whole genshin community, which is the stupidest move ever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin commnunity is chilling when sonic community attack genshin players on twitter, and a very paticular fan arts and some racist tweets get leaked to the chinese community, then game over for sonic fans."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's surprising not many ppl know this but basically a bunch of anons from 4chan wanted genshin to lose so started to vote for sonic. looking at genshins player base there is no way any of those games stand a chance against their numbers.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"gonna be honest a big portion of the genshin base didn't care about the choice awards until the drama started. once you get someone upset in the community, though, all it takes is rumors of free rewards to get the hoard to awaken."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it didn't win most likely because it won last year. marvel snap which i didn't even know it's existence won instead. btw marvel owned by disney, so you know where this is going.."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"not just chinese. genshin impact is massive as a pop culture phenomenon in asia period. its pretty much a household name. dedicated merchandise shops in south korea, taiwan, singapore, malaysia. fan run conventions. heck, in my city there are statues in the roads."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they really thought they were on to something  rip...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"nah, this wasn't pearl harbor. this was more akin to the german attack on russia during ww2 bad actors pretending to be good ones and then causing a downfall with a bad choice of action."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,not to mention that genshin also has a great soundtrack lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah its routinely in the top games on psn
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah genshin is absolutely massive, and it's free, and it's on mobile, it's so much more accessible so it has such a clear advantage, weird move for the sonic fandom to try anything on them just to get assblasted back to sonic spinball"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,people just say genshin is a china game because they're salty. genshin is way more popular outside china than any of the other games in that category as well with maybe the exception of elden ring. and genshin is definitely going to outlast elden ring in popularity as well because it's a live service game. frontiers is a mid game at best being boosted by a nostalgic dedicated fandom for not being completely shit. i don't think genshin deserves players choice because i don't believe games that released in 2020 shouldn't be in the game awards but it certainly doesn't belong to sonic based on the quality of the game either. it would be elden ring. in terms of quality there's no competition between genshin and sonic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"middling sonic game outstanding new region expansion in genshin yeah, your bias isn't showing at all lmao."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"neither, one is a scam, and the other is just trash"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,but hey! you can draw among us in the grass whit sonic's trail
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-01-06,honkai is the better mihoyo game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic stood a chance. the sonic fandom mobilized, unlike the elden ringgod of warstray fandoms who didn't really seem to care, but from what i gather then they pissed on genshin fans for no reason and well, it turns out china is a huge country and genshin is super big there, so they kinda shot themselves in the proverbial foot."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yes. but they could have done it friday or saturday instead.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no. usually when i have problems with it, it's just staying up late on the weekend which is no problem. it's the weekday that's the problem."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"apex legends, destiny, ff14 were all in the list for round 1."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't get it tbh. why are games not released in 2022 allowed to run for game of the year 2022?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"objectively speaking, they should've at least been nominated for best ost. objectively speaking, it is the best game ost of 2022."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,dont blame em honestly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a genshin player, don't blame them. genshin mods restricted the number of times we could post about the awards."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its the one with the lgbt flag. nobody is posting shit about the awards because i suspect the mods are preventing them. ive only seen one post thats locked with 0 comments from a genshin player. i tried posting something with the discussion tag and it was immediately removed for low effort content which is bs
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"comments like this are why everyone thinks people who play genshin have zero social skills, jfc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,man tcg is so fun i didn't even start the new archon quest playing tcg all day. the game gets more deeper complex when u progress pvp is hella fun and where u git gud and realize how amazingly made this mode is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you have to be something else to think the sonic movie have any chance to be near arcane
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as a genshin fan, i'm sorry. the vocal minority in your community really screwed frontiers out of the award."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,sonic movies chances were slim considering edgerunners and arcane
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"you did not just say that the movie should have beat arcane...? good lord, sonic fans. like its cool that you're a fan of your game, but arcane is one of the greatest series created ever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,did you just not play any other games this year?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm sorry but the sonic movie was never gonna compete with arcane or edgerunners
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"arcane is probably the best video game adaptation of all time, what did you expect?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"weird, because i see more haters and toxic people like you, then ive seen genshin fans ever being toxic?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin haters are even more toxic lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,there are a very great many people opposed to genshin that do not fall under the banner of sonic fans or racists.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the sonic fan base isnt that big. its mostly people voting against genshin. its a gacha game, so of course people arent going to like it winning anything."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"i think that is reasonable yeah, everybody has a price that they're comfortable with spending for an hour of entertainment from a game. for me if i get about an hour of fun out of a euro i won't feel bad or cheated. game development is a buisness and they've got wages to pay too. i think in the case of the freemium buisiness model my only objection is that there is no cap on what someone could spend. healthy people generally won't spend more than they can afford but i must confess concern for the whales. and i think we've all heared those horror stories about kids, tablets and microtransactions"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no that's cool. was a legit question! played genshin a bit before, it was a lot of fun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,so the same game can just win player's voice over and over again year after year if it stays popular?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,honestly surprised ffxiv wasn't one of the 5 up there
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah it's only one of the most popular games in the country with the highest population! seriously, sonic fans really underestimated genshin."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"most of us sonic fans knew that genshin was really popular. it's why most of us were banking on us not mentioning anything. unfortunately for us, some junkwads decided to go and poke the tiger while masquerading as part of our community, and made the genshin impact community actually care."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"all i read are lies about genshin, but i imagine everyone here see what they want to see"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,kettle pot black or something
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"my dude. all fanbases are at least somewhat toxic. saying that genshin impact is toxic has no meaning in this context, as genshin impact has a very large playerbase. and that's me speaking as a sonic fan! the junkwads should've stayed out of this altogether. had they not gone and poked the sleeping tiger, then the genshin community at large wouldn't have cared enough to show up and vote in as large of a count as they did."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"as a genshin player i would also like to add that this whole ordeal was probably blown out of proportion because of the bad reputation genshin has in general due to, again, lumping everyone in with the weirdos"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,which is directly related to a couple factors like quality and nostalgia. gi has quality and no nostalgia.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you've committed the sin of liking a video game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i mean it isn't hard to make dialogue for absolutely 2d characters lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"none of that changes the fact that it's a mediocre product. sega needs to take their mascot more seriously. and full disclosure, i loved the hell out of sonic as a kid. i've been waiting for them to create a truly great game for far too long. the last masterpiece they made was sa2. generations is probably the only actually good game they've made since aside from some handheld titles that were also good. meanwhile mario's mainline games have all been masterpieces. frontiers is a step in the right direction, but still falls short and reeks of a game that was rushed to release. sega just doesn't seem interested in making quality sonic games because they know some people will buy them anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah kinda makes sense why it won
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"true, but the vocal and toxic minority always get the most attention. unless the whole community band together to push away that vocal minority, they will always represent the community in the eyes of outsiders. tbh, the genshin community also has this exact problem."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"not every month but every 6 weeks, and theyve been consistent with this since day 1"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"all kinds of fans slander genshin though. it is a gacha game with anime waifu characters. thats to be expected. the real question is, why did the genshin fandom snap back on sonic fans of all people the one fanbase that argues with itself more than any other?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"100 agreed, there is no way sonic frontierss soundtracks are remotely close in quality compared to genshin or mihoyo in general who has an entire music department, literal concerts held and a spotify page with millions of monthly listeners. if anything genshin couldshould have been nominated for best soundtrack this year because the sumeru update absolutely deserves. the production value is literally insane overall the list of games with soundtracks comparable to genshins can be counted with one hand or maybe two."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it's actually incredible how toxic the sonic fandom is  or at least, the perception of it which ended up getting proven here. but....why, though? what's with sonic that allegedly stirs up angry mobs? x200b assuming that sonic community wasn't just used as a smokescreen this time around, which while there's no evidence, isn't out of the realm of possibility"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,fair enough.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah, i know people said no. thats why i said shouldve."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i didn't hear about this. but this just reaffirms can't trust fan voting wild we do fan voting essentially for our elections lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"exactly, why are people salty over popular vote? its exactly that. elden ring won game of the year. electoral vote exists for a reason."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,omg. i should try it now.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,does dlc make a game ongoing? if it does then why werent games like smash bros on there when it was getting dlc?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ah.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin is a aaa title, this is like saying that ronaldo is better footbaler than lebron james. its true bcs they are 2 different categories."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,got it. thanks
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,no. it bored me after 2 hours
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if you think genshin is better than most games, you need to play more games lmao"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yes, at least try it, most who hate fortnite actually tried it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah, its definitely not better than most games. it is, however, not a terrible game and most of the hate is kind of undeserved considering its the fanbase that causes it to be hated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i am going to download it when i get a phone that can run it! my iphone from 2014 struggles lol. but hard to justify replacing it on student loans when it is still working
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i gave it an honest chance, here were my thoughts tldr i hated every second of it, it's grindy, and the story is boring. combat was button mashy, and bland buff, spam x, rinse repeat. the horrible rates during gacha is justified with a pity system, where you have increased chances the more you summon, said and if you reach 80 summons i think without getting a 5 star, you have a 5050 chance to get the featured 5 star on the banner, or one of their standard banner ones, if you don't get a featured 5 star, you are guaranteed one the next time you pull a 5 star why do you hate this? you may ask because it's a cheap tactic to try to get you to spend more money on the game. but some gachas don't have a pity system and they're better off because they actually have decent rates, and thus do not need a pity system peek ffbe half the story was empty dialogue, and what wasn't empty dialogue, was just boring. and god forbid a new player should get an inazuma character, because it ends up being unusable until they reach inazuma where they can finally get the materials to ascend them. having to stop doing story to grind my adventure rank killed the pacing of the story and this isn't a problem with the game, so much as it is the company behind the game, but they literally spoil the story in their ads, oh a character betrays you? that makes for a good advertisement! if you're an f2p you have to grind for hours to get a worthwhile amount of primogems. genuinely awful experience, i felt that grinding to level 99 in the first area of final fantasy 7 would've been a better use of my time also a bunch of lore is locked behind limited time event quests, and god forbid you miss a character's banner, because it's gonna be another century before they come around again characters that are features on their own banners, are not put in the standard pool afterwards, you literally have to wait for their featured banner to roll around i can safely say that genshin is one of, if not the worst game i have ever played."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no gacha game is better than genshin, because it is the most detached from being a gacha game. it's genuinely an amazing game gameplay with a beautiful story, unique and fun characters and a great deal of challenge without powercreep."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,they shouldnt be
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"holy shit, an unbiased comment in this comment section! no way!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the people who find gow and souls games boring can't buy progress to beat the game easier.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,elden ring got game of the year. no reason to be sad
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ah yes they were totally bot votes and not fan votes like the host annouced.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"looked into it further. yeah, i'll take that back."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,once in 2 months.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,apparently they are you're here after all
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no, i will not"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"on top of that, no one really expected to get anything for the players voice award since its a popularity award. hence why genshin players originally didnt care for it and only voted for it in the end due to spite. we still didnt get anything for it either in the end. we only got 800 for the nominations like we did back in 2020."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,because i have no interest in running around as an anime chick hitting boxes repeatedly in a poorly made chinese game. i'm honestly disgusted it's in the same list as elden ring and i'm not even a big souls fan.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's not entirely that but the provocation definitely helped a lot lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,how did you know it's a vtuber though? looks like an ordinary anime pfp to me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i know the criteria, dumb criteria. there's an award for 'best ongoing' for old games, choosing games for the players favourite in 2022 should only involve games from 2022 especially when the older games are literally bribing their players to get it what's the point of holding a show celebrating games from the past year if every year they nominate more and more old games for fresh awards"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ah ok. that makes more sense.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i still have yet to see a source for the free crack for voting on the game? can you link yours?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,yes i just meant that genshin was and i didnt too much about the other games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"both communities have huge issues, but i doubt that was a deciding factor in the voting. this community is full of lgbtq phobes, classism, and ableism."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"tbh a huge part of why genshin is so popular is because it is f2p, not in spite of it. it's super accessible, casualfriendly, and runs on pretty much anything lolhttpswww.youtube.comclipugxr7qkjborijgdqkaz4aaabcq pretty much the lowest barrier to entry for an rpg out there. it's not the most amazing game or anything, but it is probably the best f2p game out there and honestly stands on level ground with some paid games. it's definitely pushed the envelope of that category."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"blame the genshin haters, first they rallied on sonic to spite genshin fans. and then, they created that beating up lumine pic and used some slurs on cn. cn spotted it and chose  so they rallied everyone to vote for genshin"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin has been out for two years and has accumulated more fans. not necessarily that it is better than gow or elden ring, but gow hasnt even been out that long and is only available on playstation. elden ring is absolutely fantastic, but again, it isnt a game that was made for everyone. it was made specifically for a mature audience. genshin impact is available nearly on any device that you can think of and has no limitations on availability, and is continuously updated. genshin should have been the clear winner without any doubt."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"can confirm. i'm living in indonesia and have been to some cosplay conventions. literally 23rds of the gaming cosplay were genshin. combination of being free, available on smartphones that most people have a lot of people didn't have a pclaptop good enough to run genshin, much less a console and waifu characters."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,there's a dedicated merch store in taiwan? do you know where it is?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"genshin is also massive in japan, i just visited and every store in akihabara has some form of genshin merch. right outside the station exit are like 10 poles with character posters stuck on top with free wifi provided ssid genshin wifi"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ah yes, operation barbarossa."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,oi sonic spinball was fantastic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,gets downvoted by the chinese swarm from the genshin subreddit lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,lol someone is bitter
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,homie if you dont like it you dont have to play it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"you really never played genshin and it shows. calling the game a botw clone when it have mechanics that are not in botw is unfair. inspired by zelda? sure. a clone? not even close. and what about marrying npcs? you cant marry in genshin, what are you talking about?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,you're delusional if you think frontiers combat is anything good at least genshin has elemental reaction to it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,from the sonic community you're acting like a salty piece of shit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"wow you talk a ton of mad shit for someone who never even experience the first hour of the game. how can you so confidently form opinions when you only see things from the outside? does sonic losing the award bothers you that much? anyway, i wont argue with the uninformed hater. go on with your day."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,na.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,lol damn. those lonely anime nerds and their sickness with anime waifus. how low and pathetic. anyways dont mind me im just here getting into my suit. pffft genshit losers. lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"stray probably shouldnt have been up there for anything besides hey this is cute i dont think there is a stray community, just people who like it lol there really isnt much to talk about with the game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"actually, people were circulating vote for genshin stuff from the first round of the preliminary voting. by that point, it was already fairly clear genshin stood a strong chance of winning. what happened was that when the final votes opened, when it hit morning in asia, genshin got a spike of votes when the asians woke up. this led to some sonic fans on twitter claiming that the chinese were botting, and also a retweeted piece about how mihoyo was bribing their playerbase to win the award. those went absolutely viral through the genshin community and the large, national seabased facebook communities and cn users who found the translated tweets on their boards just went overdrive on voting out of spite. on the flipside, there were also a bunch of people who got galvanised to vote sonic just so genshin wouldn't win, but that number was a lot lower than the genshin fans motivated to vote. pretty much the main difference is just that without some toxic sonic fans triggering the beast, genshin's margin of victory would have just been slimmer"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin comunity is still bigger than these 4 combined.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ff14 is old af too.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i've seen this asked a lot here and it's honestly getting tiresome to answer something that can easily be googled. this is not the goty. this category is the people's choice, or player's voice as written above, a popularity contest. any ongoing game can and haved been nominated here so long as they have had an update recently. apex legends, destiny 2, fortnite, hell even minecraft, iirc, were in this category but was booted early because of low votes. edit httpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikithegameawards2022 idiots complaining about the awards given should really shut up and research first."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,honestly its the most unhinged group of people ive observed over the past month or so. which isnt saying much since we are talking about the sonic fandom. the same fandom which gave birth to chris chan of all horrid eldritch abominations.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i promised myself even that im going to avoid capping resin this patch day 1 i already broke that commitment lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"unfortunately, as much as i like the movie, there are 2 top dog this year, arcane and edgerunner. any other adaptation stood no chance."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,a guy can hope.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it didn't deserve it either it's such a mediocre platformer, to think it would even win anything is astounding, if sega wants an award, they should work for one"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yea yea, recency bias."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"god, they never learn, do they?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,no its not lmao.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i played xenoblade chronicles 3, which also got 0 wins out of 3. i spent most of my year playing that, or older games that i either just bought, or were in my backlog. i spent most of my year either playing the new xenoblade, or the xenoblade on the wii u chronicles x, great game btw, highly recommend."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin haters be out there legitimately accusing genshin players of pedophilia because... checks notes children exist in the game... they're not even sexualized...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,thank you. genshin represents almost all of the things that are annoying about gaming these days. nothing to do with sonic for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"and their opposition is still largely ridiculous unless they have a gambling addiction andor are concerned about people who do, which most don't genuinely seem to be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,all good enjoy the rest of the show.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its botw without the soul or fun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,technically yes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as long as it is continuously updated, sure. and we know genshin will have a major expansion again next year"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"technically yes, but as you can see fortnite and minecraft also in the list, and those are a lot more popular than elden ring, stray or sonic, but they didn't, because recency bias and not that many people care about the game awards. and to be honest, genshin was also not really care about the awards, most player wasn't even know about it and are looking forward to the new update. sonic had a very real chance of winning if they didn't mock genshin and wake the tiger up."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,well yeah. its getting constant updates that are essentially on the level of a new game coming out every year.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"honestly, for all the flak that they're receiving, it's a right shame that the genshin impact fandom isn't receiving more of a reward for showing up and voting than they are. stingy developers be stingy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,exactly!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,saying that genshin impact is toxic has no meaning in this context agreed. the people saying lies are the ones being toxic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,did you respond to the wrong person?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,yeah pretty much. at least us sane fans are around to keep the balance lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"also, the mobile gaming industry is just bigger than pc and console combined. and genshin is available on all platforms."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"also its 3 huge things mobile, anime, free"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its a surprise how good this game is despite it having a lot against it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i had fun with it and to me that's all that matters, subreddits like these are kinda circlejerky too so it doesn't bother me at all"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they literally aren't 2d characters in frontiers
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"have you actually played the game? you're calling it mediocre like you've played it. edit and are you saying that games like mario sunshine are better than sonic unleashed and sonic colors? stop downloading your opinions from gaming youtubers. edit 2 you've got some nerve saying that frontiers has cringetier writing while calling sa2 a masterpiece. that game's writing was silly as hell, like when tails hacked the government computer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,massive community of around 20 million gets pissed off by one guy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"well if you want to be pedantic, they had shortened patches recently because of ayakas last extended run. so not every 6 weeks due to covid. they will be going back to their regular schedule onwards."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"most other times genshin gets insulted mostly because of our own community's toxic minority, similar to your sonic's community this time, so there is nothing to defend there but this time we genuinely got attacked for no reason."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'm happy to see sonic lose because of the botting
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"because they had a way to fight back and show it globally. sure they could spend time bickering back and forth, but getting the award sonic was gunning for out of pure spite strikes fast and hard against them. plus they get 5 wishes out of it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't think it's fair to call the entire community toxic just because of a few morons who went overboard here. just like how the majority of the genshin community is pretty chill but has a bad reputation for the same reason.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"agreed. im just sad elden ring didnt get this, but hey, all the games up there deserved to be nominated."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i swear most people who complained don't even realized that people choice is just a fancy way to say popularity vote.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i recommend playing it on pc if you have it, it's not really graphically intensive, and the game is streamlined to be played even on your phone. i don't play on my phone anymore because it's getting bigger because of the updates."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it probably was just didnt make it to the later rounds or something.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if genshin impact is a triplea title, then it should not have been in the running for an indie title award."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"understandable, not elden ring? what do you like then? i'm honestly curious."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i've said it in other replies. been playing since ps1 era, have seriously played most games released since then and working on getting through most great indies on pc rn. genshin still remains top 10 games ever made for me. people either just don't really vibe with genshin's style or just are too closeminded to give it a chance and repeat the same thing they keep hearing on the hate bandwagon, and that's perfectly ok but don't forget that's subjective."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i recently played fortnite and it got better.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,most sane reddit user.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i've been playing most games released ever since ps1 era, triple a, indie, etc you name it. i truly believe genshin is a top 10 game of all time, the gacha is nonintrusive enough to not take away from how solid everything else is. nobody just seems to give it more than a couple hours of chance , and it's understandable, not everyone has that time but that just means the game's not for you, not that it's bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"pc, ps4, it works on everything, almost. it's a lot better with controller or mouse and keyboard cause it's not really a mobile game at this point anymore. super complex and precise combat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i've owned every console since the ps1 and have always had a midhigh end pc on the side. don't have a ps5 yet and got a 3070 main desktop rn. i've played most if not practically all games released ever since, besides some very obscure indies on pc, which i'm working on rn. and i want to say that genshin, gacha aside, is probably in my top 10 games ever made. the grind is just right to not be frustrating and also rewarding, maybe i just enjoy griding more than you or the avg person. i wanna say that i've never played other gachas before genshin and still haven't played other gachas besides genshin and i agree i hate the gacha, but i don't agree with the dislike for the pity system. i like having few characters that i love and build as good as i can, i usually save up for months not cause i'm restraining myself but because i'm not really interested in most characters, noticed the same thing in most of my friends, you just have enough primos to guarantee a character after a bit. i hate following the meta aswell, the game is easy enough to not really matter, abyss is a breeze with nonmeta characters and mediocre builds. i've had a friend start playing and his first 5 star was an inazuma character. the mats you get from trying out the character are enough to bring to lvl 40 and as a new player lvl 40 is high enough. in less than a week he already made it to inazuma and could farm for the character easily. i find it to be a nonproblem. again, watching my friend start playing through when sumeru came out a little whole ago, he never had ar problems just naturally advancing the story, farming for his characters in between and exploring. the pacing isn't made to be rushing through the story. ypu gotta explore, fill out the map, do some domains an some bosses from time to time etc. what betrayal have they spoiled through ads? grind what exactly for primos? quests give you primos, hangouts give you primos, exploring gives you primos, completing events and challenges gives you primos and finding oculuses gives you primos, which you gotta do anyway to lvl up stamina and i found out that by the time i gave a shit about the extra stamina and oculuses i had already collected at least 9095 of them by naturally exploring, same story for other friends who are playing. i agree 100 with the limited time event lore, but leaks have pointed towards a system to go back and play through past story events again or play them for the first time if you missed them, which is a good thing, they listen to the playerbase. with the new double banner system characters have been coming around way more often, 23 months actually, which isn't the best but pretty acceptable. also they added a new character to the standard banner, from the limited banner, so it seems like a slow start to maybe start adding more. i agree with you on this one, but it seems to be changing slowly and once again hoyo is proving that they actually listen to the community, just a bit slow. to me, by what you're saying, it seems that it's not the game that's objectively bad, it's you not really fitting into the playstyle of the game. also you omitted genshin's best parts. great elemental system, fun and varied combat because of the elemental system and multitude of characters and weapons with unique abilities and different synergies. amazing open world with great puzzles and exploration. many interesting quests and secret quests and challenge mechanics. don't forget the visuals, no gacha comes close to the quantity and quality of genshin's gameplayworldcombat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,a great deal of challenge? i summoned zhongli once and just shield tanked everything. while button mashing the attack button it was a boring experience. especially as an f2p
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,two scenes were copied along with summons are ass at least in dokkan im guaranteed a character that i can use without having to do extra shit and that evolve depeding on the work put jnto it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,u forgot the its the tga that make the rules not u or i.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-12,"its the tga. it's not limited to this year, unlike every other awards ceremony in existence. just make your own list and it's probably better anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,the easy game? the game in which all progression can be done with the characters given to you in tutorial? that game? you might struggle playing gow or any souls game if you think that's a valid argument against genshin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"let's start a flame war under bethesda games then, those let you use so many cheats and mods that the game end up as a hentai simulator with flying trains and... wait what? you say people like to do what they want with their games? i'm speechless. who could have ever imagined."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i mean the main complaint about gow is that it has a lot of cinematics. im personally fine with that but i can see why some people dont like it. also its not like gow is a difficult game and elden ring is easy compared to the previous games especially if you go the cheese sorcery build lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if you find a game boring it doesn't automatically mean you're bad at it. some people just don't care for specific gameplay loops, settings or stories"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"why are they booing, youre right?! edit i never mentioned genshin but if the shoe fits"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it did? hell yes i didnt see the awards yet, just this one"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,6 weeks
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"wow, did you come out with that answer all by yourself?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,because you can't come up with anything original
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"running around as an anime chick fair. hitting boxes extremely reductive and silly. poorly made just wrong. chinese game. there is some reason for minor concern here. though the hq is in singapore, and the anticheat actually shuts off when the game closes now. you seem to have some rather strong opinions of something you've seen just 10 minutes of. do you judge everything in your life that quickly?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"dude, legit no one was voting for the awards. genshin was second and sonic was winning by a lot, until they, again, commented racist things and made the cn community mad, which again, led to people voting to prove them wrong"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no, that was for the nominations. its similar to 2020s tga where we only got 800 for getting nominated but didnt win anything either."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"update genshin players got 800 primogems as a reward for gi winning players voice award. even if players did not know, they would boycott mihoyo, which they have done already on a previous occasion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,yeah even the sonic community don't like those toxic clowns now cause they ended up angering the asian part and give free advertising that this category exist. most don't even care about tga. they did just to teach a lesson to sonic community and don't mess with their community.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the thing with bad apples is that, while they are a minority, they still undoubtedly part of the community. it's impossible to prevent the community from catching flak for what the toxic minority does, but be assured that reasonable people don't judge the whole community based on those rotten apples."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"dude, you're attacking genshin fans for retaliating to an attack. we can also see your commenting history and you've had quite a few things to say about gi. sonic fans lose any right to complain about toxicity from other people for starting this shit."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if it's literally perfect, nobody would need to mod it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"ehhh more like misunderstanding. since we got rewards for being nominated last year after the award show not whether we won or not, although we did win that year a lot of fans thought this year for ongoing and mobile game that we also would get them. but they never told us wed be getting any, or offered it for a win or mentioned free rewards, and if we were getting some it wouldnt be because we won we did indeed end up getting some this year for our nominations even though we lost in the other categories. but genshin doesnt give out rewards for fan based stuff so nobody voted for players voice a fan award expecting primogems from it. does that make sense im half asleep i feel like maybe im wording it weird. tldr genshin did give us awards for being nominated so i see why people think we got bribed but they never said theyd give us any beforehand, we got them whether we won or not so it wasnt incentive to try and win, and it wasnt for the players voice but rather the nominations for the other two"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,how about playing the game first  goofy opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i really don't think it's right to imply that if a guy uses one of the 5 child characters outta the 60 current chars in the game which are all clothed and aren't sexualized by the game at all means they need to be on a watchlist. millions of grown women which is like almost half the fanbase also play this game too so it's strange how guys are singled out here. not even sure where the little clothing fighting against each other came from, this isn't that type of game. it's literally just anime breath of the wild."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i thought he was trans
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,that was given for 4 days because of the playstation partner award and that's it. edit and that was even for a thankyou gift
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they didnt say anything about this award though?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"edit your link, they just announced the reward from this award lmao"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,that and the criteria is still favoring genshin
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"1 they didnt promise rewards, the fanbase just assumed. 2 the rewards are for the nominations, not the win. they lost best mobile game to among us in 2020, but still gave out rewards for the nomination."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"nuh uh, they don't announce they will be giving currency if we win. they might send some compensation but its up to hoyoverse and they did not promise a thing. quite your accusation bullshit"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"in 2020 they gave out in game rewards simply just for the nominations even tho they lost both. the same would have been true this year too, but winning this fan vote made it a convenient excuse to reward for that reason instead. but no they didnt bribe anyone. stop spreading false information. players made an assumption that ultimately didnt matter since they would have rewarded us for the nomination for the nonplayer vote categories anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,they were giving primos for nominations.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,im hanging on to the other side
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i felt the same way when ace combat 7 was snubbed for the music nomination back a couple of years ago. the thing that sonic and ace combat games have in common is that their soundtracks always kick ass!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i like the vocal tracks but found a lot of the open world music to be kinda forgetful and bland.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin should have won even that one. they've released 3.5h of incredible ost just for one patch, pieces combining traditional middle eastern and indian instruments with european orchestra in a very respectful and unique way unlike generic middle eastern hollywood music. honestly, easily the best ost released this year, and easily on nintendo, wow or square enix level of good."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah, riling up a fanbase against yours isn't a good idea if you're trying to win a vote lol"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,lesson learned. don't be racist.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i don't think they would have won either way but it sure must've been a landslide after poking the hornet's nest.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i haven't played elden ring and gowr was objectively a better game in all fields, but players voice is a mass vote, and those games only really have a huge following in western countries, as opposed to the sheer might of genshin's fanbase internationally of course, including half or more of which is china they didn't stand much of a chance in a voting numbers game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"probably just because it's a fan base that finally got an okay game after a long time. the internet has been dunking on sonic games since 06 even though most of them aren't too bad. so to see so many people kind of digging this one, was kind of nice. plus, for the race to be between genshin and sonic while elden ring was there? normally the games community hates free to play games like genshin and loves stuff like elden ring. i think it was more than sonic fans, it included people that like memes haha. also genshin impact was the only game not from this year if i recall. without the sonic fan base, genshin would be the game most hated out of that group for the reasons above. heck, it's only the sonic fan base that people consider toxic, not the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"yup, tealc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"glad i could be a good example lmao. also, the fear of expressing your opinion on likingdisliking a game and calling things out is very valid. i risk being called a pedo or something by mentioning liking genshin. others risk getting downvoted for disliking genshin, even if it is a perfectly understandable reason. srry if what i said was not what u were trying to say. but i felt like it had to be said either way"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i mean working 14 hours a day is a bit different than spending like a minute to vote for something. also you shouldnt be doing it for the primogems anyways
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,if i pointed out what i consider obvious you guys would never see me in any social media again
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"has it won an award before? was it the same kind of deal, vote for us and get currency? i don't follow this stuff, i just sometimes vote and sometimes notice who wins and what gets announced."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,this is the funniest part. going rabid shit throwing crazy that you do what you accuse others of doing to such an extreme extent that you get caught doing it. id say they win the award for craziest fanbase.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"genshin impact is more popular than sonic and some people hate popular thing, so when sonic had more vote than genshin in round 2, their pride got over their head and celebrate it too early."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"becuase genshin impact  anime waifus and thus is only played by pedophiles. s i shit you not, ive seen people here on reddit who get super into that exact mindset to a frankly disturbing degree. made all the moreso because the sheer vitriol those people have for anime artstyles of any kind leads me to assume its entirely projection. it doesnt help either that some people also treat their own opinions on whats enjoyable as objective fact, and then fall into some sort of screeching ragemonkey mindset when confronted by someone else enjoying something they dont must be delusional. or worse, confronted by something they dislike being popular. when those two groups overlap.? yeah. this is the kind of shit that happens."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,because popular  badhate and tbh it's the sonic fans who started all of this just for being the most vote in round 3 and suddenly attacking the cn genshin with racial slurs and so the cn community voted genshin just to piss the sonic fans. they really did poked the wrong hornet's nest
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"a sonic fan from sound of it. lets not lump an entire community into the racist category because of some salty chucklefuck. not that i have any dog in this fight, but it sucks they had to go and tank the voting."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"as far as i know, we genshin player didn't care at all about this award. we care more about new update 3.3 contents and mihoyo's leaker hunt decree. we just vote for genshin to pissed sonic fans because they start throwing racist insult toward chinese players."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i could count with my fingers of users that care about it. we were just chilling then suddenly out of nowhere some dickheads started controversy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin has a cutesy anime style which is enough to get a lot of peoplemainly americans extremely upset for some reason this is despite its closest comparison maybe being botw which reddit loved
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"in my experience, genshin impact is great if you focus only on the story quests and ignore trying to progress in level and equipment. after finishing the story quests, i'd recomend any player to uninstall the game. i burnt myself repeating the same route dozens of times recollecting seashells and flowers to level up my characters, and doing the same repetitive dungeon another dozens times trying to get the equipment with the correct substats. it is not worth it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"sadly, like the way of fortnite, and minecraft before them, people who know jack shit about the game started hating on it and even major issues like alleged pedophilia, racism, etc. it got hate before it even released. people called it botw clone and also disliked the fact it was gacha. genshin is a wonderful game that could even be rereleased as a complete standalone game in the future once the story is done. i wish they did this though i know it'll never happen. would honestly throw more money at a complete offline standalone version than i would in pulls."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,genshin is a gacha scam
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"mihoyo is still a scummy company with a history of plagiarism. their previous game honkai impact or whatever its called, as well as genshin itself had a lot of animations ripped off from popular action games like nier series, dmc, bayonetta and more. also the infamous botw elements, some of the earlier footage of genshin is just 11 copy of botw with a reskinned anime character ui, environment art style, enemy design, controls like glider and wall climbing etc. are exactly the same as botw. not talking about just sharing the same elements but its more like copied every detail to the bones. anyone with a little bit of dignity will not support this company and its games but apparently most people don't have dignity so i guess this is just how things are now. it's like puzzle  dragons and tower of savior again."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,it's a pretty shit game because once you finish the story there is nothing to do. the side quests suck so god damn much your time is better spent watching concrete set. the game is only interesting every 2 years when a new story comes out.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,probably would've had a shot at it if it came out a year later.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'm not a sonic fan, but i've heard conflicting reports about frontiers. i've seen some say it's the botw of the sonic series, and others that sonic fans have huffed so much copium that a mediocre game seems great relative to the series which honestly, i relate to as a pokemon fan."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic was a good family movie, edgerunners were great and arcane was masterpiece."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,so no.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its not. the art style is definitely a ripoff though of course it looks more detailed and better especially on next gen but the combat isnt similar at all. too much of a time sink for me and i do not like waifu bullshit at all but a very fun game and absolutely beautiful world
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,3 more years and possibly more lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,exactly

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i tried playing it once after watching a glowing review but that high pitch anime voice was like nails on a chalkboard to me and i turned it off. i'm sure it's a great game other than that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"from its inception too. being shot down as a botw clone years before even being released, then the twitter mobs alleging isms, then this."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,me too. currently working towards getting 100 in the game. don't let some redditors ruin your enjoyment.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"played it for an hour and then refunded it after seeing how terrible the popin was. it actually interferes with gameplay. the character models, animations, and voicework were also dismal. gameplay is fun but that's not nearly enough to carry it above it's many flaws. also watched extensive reviews and learned that there are just 4 cyberspace level themes, 3 of which are rehashes from previous games, ones that have already been rehashed in generations. mario sunshine is in fact a vastly better game than either of those. unleashed was only 13 of a good game. the latter sonic levels are shit, and half the game is bogged down by miserable werehog levels. colors was much better but also suffers from level design issues here and there, but its main problem is how cringe the dialogue is. also, not everyone who isn't a fanboy like you is incapable of formulating their own opinion. beyond my own subjective point of view, it's impossible to ignore the pretty cutanddry critical reception difference of sonic vs mario. metacritic for example says mario sunshine 92 mario galaxy 97 mario galaxy 2 97 mario odyssey 97 and for sonic sonic unleashed 60 sonic colors 78 sonic generations 77 sonic lost world 63 sonic forces 57 sonic frontiers 71 sonic deserves better than sonic team."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,which community is it. because genshins is 65 million active players.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"and the rest of the fanbase is getting dragged through the mud again due to the actions of a tiny group of people. thats not cool. regardless, this is one of the few times in sonic history, where the entire fandom was united and shared the same opinion that frontiers deserved a w. i dont know about you, but if you were a sonic fan, im pretty sure you wouldnt be so happy. not to mention, there wouldnt even be a botting issue if the game was, as i mentioned above, actually nominated in best soundtrack."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"but why though? like i said, everyone slanders them, so why did they specifically target the sonic community of which 99 of them dont even care about gi? out of the top 5 sonic youtubers on yt, only one was even aware of the beef between the two games, thats how insignificant it was within the sonic community."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ultimately it's a silly thing that doesn't matter but elden ring deserved everything lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,thanks for advise.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"most of the games i play right now are like a decade old so take that criticism with a grain of salt. fallout 3, new vegas, silent hill homecoming, destiny 2, grim dawn, cyberpunk2077 and i will be getting back into witcher 3 when the free next gen upgrade comes in a few days."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i stopped playing at ar 56, if u reach that and still play it and still think its good u got a serious problem"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"yeah but i still hate it and so do many, i tried it and still hate it but i can see why its enjoyed, but theres many who hate it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"well i actually used to play genshin quite a bit. i think i reached ar 55 before i quit. the main problem with genshin is the open world feels extremely dead and the story isnt great. to me, each quest really did feel like a slog and thats what led to me quitting. genshin certainly isnt a bad game, and if its one of your favourites i dont think you should feel bad for enjoying it. but to say its one of the best games of all time even with its glaring issues terrible artifact grinding, poorly paced story, really dead open world, gacha system which encourages gambling habits is imo a bad take. that being said, the great thing about games and most forms of media is that the value of it depends on each person. if you feel like you really love genshin, then all the more power to you! i just think that if you go around saying genshin is objectively one of the best games you shouldnt expect others to agree with you not that it really matters in the end."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"my biggest problem with the combat is how simple it is to boil down to just button mashing on just about everything except spiral abyss, where you have to learn deeper mechanics and all that shit. the elemental system leads to annoying things like ice and water abyss mages that combination of enemies is the most annoying thing to ever be thought up, because you can't exist for two seconds without getting frozen. comparing genshin to other gachas in everything except the actual gacha, is not really a fair comparison... gachas are almost always trash, i pointed to ffbe as my primary example because i never once felt forced to grind, i like to play story at my own pace and generally, i felt that the story advanced too slow for my playstyle, so you might be right, maybe i just don't fit in with the typical playstyle, the only feature i really somewhat enjoyed, was the serenitea pot, only to be cutoff because of the stupid ass load limit, like holy shit! let me put this character in this room that i spent hours designing, specifically for them! this bit was just me complaining about the load limit the betrayal i was talking about was childe btw, oh what a cool character! i like him and then an ad outright shows you a cutscene that occurs mid bossfight i feel like the game just generally needs a lot of quality of life improvements, because honestly... so many of the features are just annoying especially the cooldowns on every other thing in the game, i found that particularly annoying"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"do that at 123 abyss please. see if you can 36 star it, that mans max score. good luck. zhongli is a dps loss."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i dont care about the gacho bro. i just want solid gameplay, open world, story. in those departments, few proper pcconsole games are on genshin's level and definitely no mobile games are on genshin's level. enjoy your slots lil bro, that's why i don't touch other gachas, lack of true gameplay. not a fan of pulling for worthless jpegs, that's the worst part of genshin, but the rest is so good that it can be overlooked. other gachas can't say that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"pay to play? a blatant lie. a guaranteed character? genshin have 6 base characters. you have to do extra shit when playing? boohoo. poorl little soul, he has to play to obtain what he wants, such a cruel world. here, let me give you a pat on the head"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if skyrim were running for gamers choice it would have been burned to the ground with the flame wars, maybe your game is just shit?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,my statement was less about the difficulty of the former than it was about whales and p2w in general.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,no he is very much not right you can't buy progress in genshin.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,oh sorry for spoiling you  but yes elden ring got game of the year and some other award too forgot which one. all others basically went for god of war
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"wow, did you come up with that response all by yourself?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"any games but those two deserved the award. sonic frontiers as i expected anyway, was positively review bombed by children. so we can expect that sonic, like genshin's community, is filled with children. and as i said before, both communities are awful. more toxic than moba communities i reckon. i would rather have had a nonlive service game win the award."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"dude, you're attacking genshin fans please don't lie.  we can also see your commenting history and you've had quite a few things to say about gi. anyone can see my comment history and see that you're lying about this, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,its a chinese p2w gacha game that aggressively targets overseas whales. if malicious intent was a game it would be this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,being able to mod it is part of what makes it perfect it can be taylored to the needs of the specific person.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"that's like every game, man. you have the option of blazing through the main storyline, or be a completionist minmaxer. that's not a unique thing to genshin. at least in gi, you are limited to 30mins to 1hr play per day by a stamina counter so you won't burn 1015 hrs doing farming routes. there's also no pvp or ranking or whatever tryhards do to populat a rankings board."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"you definitely responded to the wrong person, that has zero relation to anything being said edit they did the childish thing of responding then trying to prevent me from replying, by blocking me, so my response is here  so you say people are spreading lies, i explain its not lies and but you say it has zero relation i never said anything about bots. the person who did the votes even told geoff about it.  you say the genshin impact fans are toxic another thing you're completely imagining, i never said that. equating the actions of a few people with the whole fanbase is the exact kind of thing i'm pointing out is shitty behaviour.  im sorry reading is difficult for you i guess? i love the irony here. yet another person proving me right."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"stop blaming sonic team for this. the popin is worse than other games because they had to design it around the switch's twodecadeold hardware. also by nature, sonic moves much faster than other video game characters, which gives objects less time to load in. and popin obviously isnt exclusive to this game. ive played the newer spiderman games and the popin is very distracting there as well and cyberspace was a result of sega not giving them enough time or budget. sonic team deserves infinitely more than what they get credit for. and if you think critical reception directly translates to something's quality, your brain must've been off for the past few years. cuties got around an 87 on rt, as well as rise of skywalker. i guess those movies must be masterpieces. it's extremely wellknown how much critics and userscores differ, and game journalists are infamous for being inconsistent with their reviews. 95 of players on steam recommend sonic frontiers, and the metacritic user score is 84 despite being reviewbombed. but go ahead, ignore all that and just cherrypick the negative stuff. and this is not helped by the fact that there is a genuine bias against sonic. notice how almost every sonic review brings up sonic 06 for absolutely no reason. notice how sonic has gotten tremendous hate for things that other franchises have completely gotten away with. another note party babyz on the wii has a higher ign score than halflife."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"it takes one small spark to start a fire. it was pretty the chinese playerbase who makes up the majority iirc. one person lights off one fan of genshin, who lights two, who light two more each, so on and so forth. ill assure you now that if the game awards had already passed, nothing wouldve happened because nothing couldve happened, but seeing as the two were competing for one award, well more so they both had potential to win it, the genshin playerbase decided to take it. its at that point that you see three mindsets in the genshin playerbase. those whose attention was drawn to winning the award to strike back against sonic, those who now see the award as potentially pulls for weapons or characters, and those who simply do not care."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,ok mr high ground
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"the thing is, you're not completely wrong, the open world used to feel a bit dead, though the beauty saved it and the story was pretty weak. quests did feel like a slog, but now, somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 updates, something changed, and it changed even further from 3.0 onwards. they've obviously improved as devs. the world feels alive and is even more beautiful, the story has honestly gotten so good it could've been nominated for best narrative alongside ragnarok and plague tale, not won, but still nominated and the quests have really improved, a lot more interactive, with greater dialogue as long as the lore interests you and with more uniqur mechanics and activities to do for each quest, even random nonva quests found around the open world. but yes, this hasn't changed, don't like grindy games? don't play genshin, but the grind still isn't as bad as other games that i've but thousands of hours in, like warframe. all of the issues left, some smaller some bigger, are overblown in everyone's mind because the game is instantly judged very harsly as a cashgrab gacha. the game isn't any grindier than warframe and some other super popular and praised mmo's and the world isn't any deader than the game it was inspired by, botw, which has actually never changed ever aince release while genshin's world has improved past it by quite a lot, but nobody is ready to hear that or believe that, botw is held in very high regard, equal to games like gow, dark souls and elden ring."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ok i guess you haven't been playing they have only released 2 promotional lolis characters in the game during these 2 years, the first one was klee during its launch and the second one was nahida this year, so i don't understand where this pedophilia narrative comes from , when the game has been consistently releasing male character after male character this year."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"that's my take too. as a long time old school runescape player, when i hear something is grindy my reaction is always is it tho?. genshin isn't bad at all when it comes to grind. it's a bit time locked if you're f2p, but there's so much to do you can still easily spend hours a day progressing without spending a dime."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"im not even talking about open world or anything, having exact same movement and traverse options with nearly the same animations between 2 games is impossible. it has to be plagiarism. every action rpg has its own style when it comes to moving the character around, how your character and your command input interact with walls, slopes. how do they respond midair etc. you can compare dozens of decent action games say dmc, bayonetta, sekiro, nierautomata obviously all of these games have all the basic arpg control elements, walk, run sprint, dodge maybe parry, air jump and more complex things. there are a lot of similarities but they all interact very differently to enemies, environment and user inputs so none of these games feel the same despite the similarities. for example niera emphasizes on iframe dodging into counter and mid air combos, dmc emphasizes on manual combos via directionalcomposite inputs and exact timing inputs from the player. combat alone create vast differences in player experience. now what genshin did is copying botw's movement system essentially 11. handheld gliders mid air, rock scaling animation for climbing smooth walls. you could have had flying mounts like any other rpg, floating skateboards, birds carrying you, anything. but they just had to go with the tablecloth sized glider like in botw. why? it could have been a jetpack even. fine let's say that's a coincidence, the developers have a hardon on tablecloths. why the botw wall climbing then? almost every single action game doesn't do that. assassin's creed allows you to run a few feets up then you either grab onto some rocks or drop down. most action games have a ledge you grab onto then you character pulls himself up. some more fancier ones like sekiro have wall kicking which can be used to walljump, almost none handles them like botw. except genshin. don't even get me started on combat and others. you have to be in deep denial to think genshin did not plagiarize botw"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"well, i haven't watched any gameplay on genshin since i last touched it but i find it kind of hard to believe that the open world has really improved that much since i last played it. i'll take your word for it though. i don't mind grindy elements in games, i just mind when the reward isn't commensurate with the effort put in. my issue with genshin's artifact system wasn't that it was overly grindy  it was that i could spend an entire week grinding, and not improve my artifacts at all. for most games, they'll at least have some sort of luck mitigation system merging, crafting, etc. for genshin, it completely relied on luck. it felt like the game was compensating for a lack of content. the game really does lack content in between updates  there's not much to do besides the spiral abyss, and once you clear it, you basically have to wait another month to 'play' the game. regarding your last point about botw  you can't really compare the two in the sense that botw is a completed game, so of course it won't really change that much since its release. conversely, genshin is still in development so of course the world is only going to keep getting bigger. with respect to which game's open world is better, i personally find botw's better just due to how wellcrafted it is. in comparison, genshin's feels like the developers just dropped a bunch of random hilichurl camps around a map it feels way more dead."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i'd argue a lot of the genshin side quests are just as good if not better. the characterfocused sidequests are all very high quality with great cutscenes and worldbuilding and lore and backstory for the cast, and some of those optional sidequests even result in brand new major world bosses to fight which is nothing to sneeze at. the game introduces major events with limited time stories, and a lot of those are actually really good too. the visual novely types of side quests are also fun for anyone that enjoys more slice of life style content to complement the fighting."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"stray isn't a 10 game, it's 40. genshin doesn't make you pay 100 for every decent character, you'll get a range of free characters very soon into the game, they throw huge piles of free gems for rolls for a long time when you're new, and if there's a specific character you want past that it isn't hard to save gems up for one here and there. resin is especially irrelevant because none of the story or quests are locked behind it. genshin is a fantastic game well worth the awards it gets if you approach it smartly. don't waste the free gems, mess around with the characters you get free and see which ones you like, and focus on doing the quests and content you actually enjoy playing. you don't hit any absurd walls and the story and quest content remains easy even if you don't grind with resin, and once you've put the 100 hours it takes to catch up to the story while doing the other content you enjoy, you can just stop playing until the next major updates if you want. if you enjoy the house and personal land customizing features, play as much of that as you want, if you enjoy fishing or the massive tcg mode they just added, play those too, and if you don't enjoy any of those things just don't play them and there's nothing to complain about."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"he genuinely doesn't care guys, he doesn't care anything about the awards, genshin and certainly not our opinions. nope, he won't reply to this because he doesn't care at all!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,theres no ads? just say youve never played genshin and go drink some water for your dehydration
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,some people forgets that gacha system exist.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"if gacha games should be banned, why not ban gambling and casinos and loot boxes? all of those prey on people's addiction."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"the game is free, sir, all of it. constantly updated with loads of free content. the gacha part also have a system to guarantee that you can get the characters, still without paying anything. there is way less gambling involved in genshin than in lootboxes for some aaa games out there. this game has a combat system with depth, there is a housing system, hundreds of hours worth of exploration, main and side quests. really good sound track. and the last update introduced a whole card game within the game. but for some reason you are so angry with it winning the award that you're reducing it to gambling. again, very unfair. nobody is telling you to like or play the game, but there is no reason to be disrespectiful towards people who play it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,your name completely fits u cause u exactly act like one lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i thought arcane was really boring imho. i didnt enjoy any of the others either. imho cyberpunk shouldve won. not because it was that good. it wasnt as bad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,just described yourself perfectly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,my point there is mostly that they should hate both. genshin's is pretty loose insofar as gachas go though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,eh farming or getting lootboxes are impossible for the most part. you get like 1 or 2 good things after 3 months in fps multippayer games. when it comes to lootboxes. unless you pay alot. while in genshin its completely possible to get a lot of good things in the game by not even paying a single thing. i'm a genshin player who has not payed a buck or two. i still got like 70 of the premium characters in the game to enjoy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i played 50 hours, ive also never bothered to uninstall it so it still on my desktop"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"maybe they did play it, didn't play botw, didn't like genshin that much. so they throw the most common insultcomparison, because the first few enemies and areas do look like breath of the wild."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,breath of the wild invented european high fantasy? is nintendo suing tolkien next?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"sonic frontiers and pokmon legends of arceus were also compared to botw. also only 2 cutscenes in genshin from my memory straightup resembled botw. i cant exactly argue the art aspects, but thats because multiple games have similar art styles. i see commonality with genshin and botws art, but i see a difference. of course this could be in hindsight, but i have played both games."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,i'd love to hear an explanation for it. prejudice? a typo? why are you calling me ones? what is the l i'm supposed to be taking? what stuff are you even accusing me of spewing? why are making up stuff about me like the true 'gamer' nonsense?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ok, allow me to pick apart your faulty points and say which one of yours are valid. the switch does not have twodecade old hardware. thats hilariously untrue. accurate and fair. the switch hasn't even been out for half a decade at this point. multiplatform games have always existed, and others dont suffer from the sort of popin frontiers does. games should take full advantage of the hardware they are released for, and that goes for all games. most games have a different experience on switch than they do on other consoles when they get ported. point is not valid, as sega wanted the same experience on all platforms. your comment about taking full advantage of the hardware they're released for holds water, but the entire point is still moot because of how sega wanted a consistent experience. i will mention that breath of the wild didn't have as much popin, but i will say that there is the caveat that botw is a firstparty title while sonic frontiers is a thirdparty title. spider man doesnt have entire traversable structures popping in. counterpoint spiderman can cling to walls and walk on rooves. therefore, the buildings are traversable. you just don't see the popin because they hide it behind having no collision until you get to the popin distance thanks to being hidden by the architecture of nyc being so gridlike. this also means less difficulty rendering things due to the regularity. it doesnt directly translate but it sure as shit cant be entirely ignored merely because it inconveniences your illfated argument. you should have left this out entirely and instead mentioned how the game awards are orchestrated by the same people who pay the critics to rate games. thus why sonic frontiers didn't show up for best ost despite having an amazing selection of songs during the boss battles the critics don't like sonic all that much. metacritic user scores still show sonic titles as vastly lower than mario ones. incomparable franchises. mario has the backing of a company that produces merchandise and entire consoles, and nintendo is infamous for being very picky about who can carry their firstparty ip. sonic doesn't have much merchandising and sega has to liscence it out to companies that make other franchises. thus, it doesn't get to take advantage of the honeymoon phase of a console that firstparty games can. you ignoring critic scores  cherry picking see my above point in regards to it doesn't directly translate. sonic 06 is one of the worst aaa games ever released and it deserves to be brought up given that sonic team still hasnt released an amazing aaa sonic game since sonic unleashed, sonic generations, and sonic mania would like a word. plus, '06 was highly rushed. and as someone wise once said, a delayed game can eventually be good. a rushed game is forever bad. its not just bias when the games are actually lackluster in quality invalid point. mario games have extremely lackluster stories, and that doesn't make them lowquality in your book. pokemon games have lackluster graphics, and that doesn't make them lowquality, going off of that same logic. thus, you don't get to diss sonic for that when you yourself used examples of games that sacrifice aspects of themselves that you dissed sonic for."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"no they probably wouldnt have, at least not so aggressively. also its not my logic, its what happened and why it happened. if you have an issue with that, take it up with the people who voted, not me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i got a serious problem cause i enjoy this game, you obviously don't have a serious problem cause you hate the game and that makes you superior. ooorrr, your tastes just don't fit the game's style and it's a you problem, nothing wrong with the game. i feel highly invested in the story, love reading all dialogue and lore, love the challenging combat and love exploring the huge beautiful world filled to the brim with puzzles and fun quests, you don't."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"again, about your first and last point. genshin's world, events, dialogue quality and story pacing has changed drastically after 2.3, basically after the first anniversary, when the amount of money they made really started to show. it still hasn't only not showed any signs of stagnation in improvement, it just skyrocketed with 3.0, the fresh new clean slate they're getting to work with. there is so much good content and quests and stuff do explore and do and complete that i've found it personally impossible to complete the new content they always add every half month before the next half, so as long as you really just don't like the game cause it doesn't fit your tastes, there's never a lack of awesome stuff to do. but yes, the grinding is understandable, i personally enjoy it cause i like farming games and genshin relies so much on tactics and theory that numbers don't need to be so perfect on artifacts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,objectively wrong? i didn't enjoy the game so i uninstalled it freed up 40 gb
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,or your just mad its better cuz its dragon ball z? ive been playing it for years and i played genshin for a month and found out its trash and dont say its infair to compare when you were saying it was better

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,buy progress to make the game easier oh ok.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,and gi fans are just celebrating the win.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"i gotta disagree with this. when people say a game is pay to win, there's either pvp, or they're saying that progress in the game is artificially moneygated. since genshin has no competitive aspect and 99 of the game can be cleared easily with literally any characters, there really isnt a progress wall. the other one percent is endgame content and you're going to have a roster that can clear it by the time you really care about it. even if you don't have the most meta characters, one of the best characters in the game is given to you for free and your free starter characters will be able to clear this game mode with some investment. i'm not lying or exaggerating when i say that this game is so stupid easy that the gacha system only affects your ability to get charactersweapons you want, and never a characterweapon you need to progress. all a new character changes is your playstyle. yeah the gacha characters give you more dps but it's the difference between doing enough damage vs doing more than enough damage. there is an energy system in that timegates some of the characterweapon levelling mats. this aspect is the closest the game gets to a paywall. even with that in place though, there's so much content in the game, i feel like you'd have to be playing nonstop for days for that to actually lock your progress. im willing to bet that most paying players aren't even paying to bypass this aspect  it's only whales paying here because it's more of an inconvenience than a progress wall. the game definitely has some very welldeserved criticism. but calling it pay to win just doesn't make sense to me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"not really, if a mod fixes a bug, how can it be unstable because of said bug?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"ok so u playing 50 hours and calling it a botw copy without the soul or fun confuses me. there are only 2 cutscenes in the beginning of the game that makes everyone, even me, go wait, why does this look like botw? all other cutscenes unless you know of more, i only remember those 2 are unique. a botw copy would mean there being some kind of identical story. playing through all regions available as of now currently 4 nations, i dont see copypaste aspects. if u mean gameplay, is that because its open world? sonic frontiers has even been called a botw copy because of that. i dont know when u first started playing, but if it was when there were only 2 nations, i understand how it could be boring. it was like that for a very long time. you have your reasons for disliking, and some are understandable and purely subjective opinionpreference. i am trying to understand why you think its a botw copy, out of curiosity."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,right tell me something that happens after the first five minutes then
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"you forgot that nintendo invented gliding, stamina and cell shading."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"your comment about taking full advantage of the hardware they're released for holds water, but the entire point is still moot because of how sega wanted a consistent experience. hamstringing every platform to match your weakest link is a clearly braindead move. and they could clearly have made other compromises graphically for the switch that didn't negatively impact gameplay. this isn't rocket science. counterpoint spiderman can cling to walls and walk on rooves. therefore, the buildings are traversable. you just don't see the popin because they hide it behind having no collision until you get to the popin distance thanks to being hidden by the architecture of nyc being so gridlike. this also means less difficulty rendering things due to the regularity. sonic team were the ones that made the baffling decision to make random rails float over the world, rather than make the world natrually traversable like in spider man. that is not an excuse, it's yet another example of their incompetence. you should have left this out entirely and instead mentioned how the game awards are orchestrated by the same people who pay the critics to rate games. thus why sonic frontiers didn't show up for best ost despite having an amazing selection of songs during the boss battles the critics don't like sonic all that much. i love how you are so deluded that you think there is some grand conspiracy that virtually ever single game review site is in on. it's a lot more simple than that sonic games are generally bad to mediocre. incomparable franchises. mario has the backing of a company that produces merchandise and entire consoles, and nintendo is infamous for being very picky about who can carry their firstparty ip. sonic doesn't have much merchandising and sega has to liscence it out to companies that make other franchises. thus, it doesn't get to take advantage of the honeymoon phase of a console that firstparty games can. laughably bad argument and blatant goalpost moving. as if nintendo is the only franchise that pumps out critically acclaimed video games. see my above point in regards to it doesn't directly translate. so you reveal that this is in fact your alt, nice. sonic unleashed, sonic generations, and sonic mania would like a word. plus, '06 was highly rushed. and as someone wise once said, a delayed game can eventually be good. a rushed game is forever bad. unleashed was good for the first 13 of sonic levels, bad for the rest of the sonic levels, and then bogged down by half of the game being gimmicky and miserable werehog stages. generations was good and i already said that, but it was far from amazing and certainly not a masterpiece. mania wasn't even made by sonic team at all. also sonic team rushing games is quite literally the problem. them choosing to rush a game doesn't excuse the outcome. i can't believe i had to explain that. invalid point. mario games have extremely lackluster stories, and that doesn't make them lowquality in your book. pokemon games have lackluster graphics, and that doesn't make them lowquality, going off of that same logic. thus, you don't get to diss sonic for that when you yourself used examples of games that sacrifice aspects of themselves that you dissed sonic for. except mario isn't trying to tell some grand narrative, not all games do. sonic on the other hand does. it tries to develop characters and have a serious plot, and it hasn't landed in years. pokemon is absolutely low quality lately, but its use of popin doesn't negatively damage the core gameplay loop that way frontiers' does. please don't sign into a 3rd alt to pester me more. keep your fanboy delusions to the sonic sub."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-12,"most of what you said is pretty fair. however, you misinterpreted my first point. x200b the nintendo switch is about as powerful as the xbox 360. that's what i mean by decadeold hardware. sonic frontiers essentially has to be made for the xbox 360 upwards. it's honestly depressing how much the switch's hardware is holding back it's games. x200b and yes, sonic team made an infamously bad game in 2006, but i don't see the reason behind constantly bringing it up 16 years later. when people review mario, they don't constantly talk about hotel mario of mario is missing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"im sorry, but blaming the entire community for what one person did, especially when that community sorely despises that person, is just wrong. besides, were talking about one of the most divisive communities out there, who constantly argue among themselves, be united on a game for the first time in over 15 years. that should be celebrated, but this one idiot has ruined it for everyone. even then, like you said, a portion of gi players voted for the chance to get ingame items which they did get, while nearly every sonic fan just to get recognition for sonic team. edit youre likely right in that the first spark came from sonic fans, but who fanned the flames? who escalated it? at the end of the day, were talking about people trashtalking on twitterreddit, theyre always a cesspool of toxicity. and believe me, ive seen my fair share of toxicity from everybody."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"im using the term ive heard from others you fucking idiot. i dont play the game, i dont look at media in the game, but ive read numerous comments of people mentioning them. im trying to posit that the idea that at least some of the players being pedos might not be unfounded. if they arent being sexualized then just say so. what other term would you rather me use to describe the situation im asking about? cunt."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"jesus christ would you fuckers read my other comments. not all games with children are sexualized. that why i didnt just use the term child, i used the term that implies sexualization, because thats what i saw all over in some of those threads. a cursory google of does gi have lolis implies that it might not be complete bullshit, but im also not going to do a deep dive on it. other commenters have already mentioned they arent sexualized in genshin so it was probably just the sonic fans trying to twist the narrative."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"take a look at how the law functions and the precedent that has been set. even if a company contested this, genshin would likely win the case, because what they have used as references aren't copyright in and of themselves. and if nintendo sued for plagiarism of botw, they'd lose, because it's not even close. try actually playing the game, you'll see the differences. if immortals fenyx rising isn't botw plagiarism, then genshin definitely isn't."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"what free range of characters? amber and barbara? lol they're literally two of the worst characters in the whole game. lisa is pretty bad too, kaeya is decentish. i have to assume you're judging the game based on ancient knowledge because you're only mentioning characters you would have gotten for free years ago. on top of all of those there are a variety of other free characters everyone is guaranteed to get, you probably know about noelle and xiangling both of which are very good with the right builds but not about collei, a free dendro character. there are also frequent events that give out characters, including multiple that just said here, pick any 4 star from this region and you can have them. genshin does give you primos but they're not enough to get more than 34 5 star characters and it's hard to get the one you want with the dumb 5050 system i'm not sure why you're implying 34 top rarity characters is bad in a game where your team can only hold 4 characters anyway. that's how many you'll get soon in, yes, but you seem to just be completely ignoring the fact that the game exists over a period of time. i've gotten over 20 5 star rolls for free and i have been on breaks from the game longer than i've actively played it. if you want to grind for your characters which does become important after a certain point you need to use resins to grind the same shitty domains over and over. the parenthesis are just a lie, it is never important to grind. the only content of serious hardcore difficulty is the spiral abyss, and you never need to be able to beat the top floors. none of the story content is that difficult, if you're underlevelled for a fight you can pop a food item for a huge teamwide buff and it'll last longer than the fight will. you keep returning to arguments like this that are just irrelevant, again you never need to grind and would be much better off playing until you run out of content you think is fun and then dropping the game for a few months until more content comes out. if you don't like side quests don't do them, the game doesn't force you. this is the 2nd post in a row where i've had to say just play the content you like and ignore the rest because you keep arguing that the existence of optional content you personally dislike is a problem when it really isn't."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-13,"right. you've made me properly upset by throwing the insult of you're an alt of this completely unrelated guy at me. allow me to elaborate on why you're wrong in this matter. kid gloves off, bubba. hamstringing every platform to match your weakest link is a clearly braindead move. and they could clearly have made other compromises graphically for the switch that didn't negatively impact gameplay. this isn't rocket science. you'd be needling them for doing that instead if they did it. laughably bad argument and blatant goalpost moving. as if nintendo is the only franchise that pumps out critically acclaimed video games. different guy, meaning no goalpost moving here, just me pointing out a hole in the argument. besides, if i were to bring in another franchise, you'd just use the blatant goalpost moving argument on that one, too. can't use halo because that's a fps, and therefore a completely different genre. can't use fromsoft's games for the same reason. can't use spark the electric jester because that's made by an indie company as opposed to a heavy hitter. can't use banjo kazooie because it's a dormant franchise and made by a secondparty studio instead of a firstparty studio. can't use yookalaylee because it's an indie studio, even if the guys are from rareware originally. can't use freedom planet for the same reason as spark. you see the problem here? so you reveal that this is in fact your alt, nice. cherrypicked reading means faulty argument and it must be thrown out. me using the rebuttal that was a see an above point was me pointing out that the same logic could be used in two different places to hit both arguments. besides, there's nothing saying that you're not his alt, what with all the projecting you do! oh wait. there's his comments towards both you and me below. what's to say that you're not my alt, or that i'm not your alt. oh wait. this comment between both of us proves we're separate people. in other words, checkmate, joker. unleashed was good for the first 13 of sonic levels, bad for the rest of the sonic levels, and then bogged down by half of the game being gimmicky and miserable werehog stages. generations was good and i already said that, but it was far from amazing and certainly not a masterpiece. mania wasn't even made by sonic team at all. also sonic team rushing games is quite literally the problem. them choosing to rush a game doesn't excuse the outcome. i can't believe i had to explain that. so you're saying we agree on this point and do not need to argue over the cause of the problem because it's agreed on, meaning this argument can be skipped due to not being in contention. moving on! except mario isn't trying to tell some grand narrative, not all games do. sonic on the other hand does. it tries to develop characters and have a serious plot, and it hasn't landed in years. pokemon is absolutely low quality lately, but its use of popin doesn't negatively damage the core gameplay loop that way frontiers' does. the cdi games would like a word. those games tried to tell a grand narrative. and look at how much of a stinker they were. oh wait, that's just the cdi making a big ol' stench by peeing in the pool. and it actually does affect the core gameplay loop if you could see a pokemon you wanted from across the field, you'd beeline for it instead of just wandering. ditto for a platform in a platforming game. ditto for a pickup in metroid or another collectathon."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-12,"while the consoles may be onpar with each other in terms of power, they're powerful in different ways. the 360 didn't have to worry about having two dedicated modes that function rather differently or having a computer screen embedded in it, either. your analogy is actually quite accurate, however the xbox 360 had the rrod as its' infamous hardware problem, and the switch has joycon drift as its' infamous hardware problem. doesn't change the fact that the switch has newer and smaller hardware architecture at its' disposal, and that it doesn't have to worry about disc loading times. in any case, on to your point about part of the reason people constantly bring up '06 even sixteen years later. the reason they do that is because '06 released on multiple widespread consoles, and is a game released by their own company. hotel mario and mario is missing, on the other hand, were released on only one console that wasn't very widespread and was infamous for having bad games overall, and weren't even developed by the company that owns the ip. in the case of the cdi, it was the games being a hot mess collectively because of the company making them, and not because of any production rushing. in the case of '06, it was a unique stinker in the library of multiple consoles that people could point at rushing and call it out as a rushed hot mess."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,"where are you getting talk of blaming the entire community? i said so myself, one spark, one person. as for who escalated it, that goes to both sides. the salt and toxicity ran rampant when you looked inwards no matter which side you were on, but if you want to be upset at me for who knows what reason, be my guest."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"bruh. i own every nonxbox console since ps1, i can list them if you want but there's no point, most of the games released for them and my steam library is 2500 games. i played through all of the older ones especially on console but still have at least half my steam library to finish. yet i always find myself going back to genshin. i hate the gacha, but i love everything else about the game enough to ignore it or deal with it, gotta agree though, getting lucky sometimes is fun and getting unlucky doesn't really faze me cause i have all the characters i love lorewise and need performance wise. i love the story, especially the new sumeru one, honestly ps exclusive level, i gotta agree though inazuma main story was pretty damn weak but the lore kept me afloat. i love the dialogue cause it gives lore. if you say the combat is easy and braindead then either you've never played the game or you never bothered to always stay and max world level and challenge domainseventsabyss floors, i always play my other games on the hardest difficulties, besides soulslikes which have only one difficulty, the perfect one. the puzzles were indeed just for completionism up until this year's enkanomiya event where everything changed ever since and improved drastically even further past the golden arhipelago event a couple months ago. the game is improving heavily ever since the surge in popularity and mihoyo is actually, surprisingly listening to the community. what you said isn't wrong, back in mondstadtliyue days. stuff has really changed since then, but people's opinions haven't really, either cause they never tried it out and just repeat what they hear on clickbait videos about why genshin is the worst game ever produced by humankind, either cause they tried it when the game honestly wasn't much more than a boring free to play botw. hot take but it's already surpassed botw in my opinion and i'm really looking forward to playing the new zelda and see how it compares to today's genshin. you can't tell me to play an actual rpg when i'm 140 sure i've played more games, especially rpgs, than you've probably heard about, sorry if i sound rude, but you do too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-11,mf you enjoy xenoblade 2 ???
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-11,"again, beware, if you truly don't enjoy the theorycrafting and building behind the teams and can't stand farming for the characters, you'll probably never like the game no matter how good it gets. i started playing in 1.2 but it took me a week to give up and absolutely hate the game for a whole year. i despised the game, it was the worst game ever made in my eyes for the same reasons you mentioned. some friends begged me to try it again in 2.0 and it took them two month, up to 2.2 for me to give it another chance. i've been playing most days of the week ever since and i can't put it down."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"oooorrr maybe i just didn't like the game it's not an objective matter, at all. i just simply didn't enjoy it, i found the combat boring. is that so hard to accept? sorry for having an opinion"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,okay thank you im very sorry genshin is an alright game and it deserved its award newer players play this and dokkan aint been aroudn that as it used too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-10,idk bro the fact i just left it and didnt further instigate the arguement any further
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,refers to unconsciously taking unwanted emotions or traits you don't like about yourself and attributing them to someone else ence the comment about projecting on genshin being shit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-09,"to make the game easier what part are you so hung up about. idk what point hes making so i cant speak for him. but the way i took it as in god of war  elden ring, no matter how much money you spend nothing you can buy will make either game easier. if you are trying to convince me that a c6 ganyu doesnt make the game easier than a c6 kaeya youre out of your mind however im not trying to offend anyone these are just facts not opinion for once. tldr gacha games  easy games are okay just dont expect the same for souls like games  vice versa."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i would love a version where i just wander around meeting robots, exploring, and finding things."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,what a kitten.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"stray really hit hard. great game. end of game spoiler !i curled up next to the dead robot and pondered the whole time the lid opened. then when the cat leaves screen for the last time, i felt something very powerful, and i don't even know what it was.!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,it's a different concept of game for the today's standards
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"so good great atmosphere, story, and so many great references to other stories and games too! i absolutely loved it. wish it was longer, could have played it for another 20 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"ikr! the ending was so sad, i ended up staying in the same spot for like 10 minutes bc i was too sad to move on at first"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,kitty
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,"i love cats, but i didn't rush to buy the game. i wanted to see reviews before i purchased, and most of them stated while the game is every short, it's very well done. i finally downloaded it and played it and was not disappointed. everything about the game blended well and the different areas adding different immersive elements really brought it all together. even with the story no spoilers, i couldn't help but wonder how it all came to be like this. every area told a different story, if you looked for it, which i did on the next play through because i had to experience it again, this time taking more time to explore. it's a haunting game, and i'm so glad i played it. i'm sure i'm not alone when i say stray 2 cannot get released fast enough."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,this made me feel both lost and belong.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,stray was a pleasant surprise to be sure. short game but that kinda makes it work. the atmosphere was incredible.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i was disappointed when we didn't have the opportunity to find its family after opening the gates. but it still was a beautiful game to play, i just wanted to see them reunite."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i was put off a bit by the controls when i first tried it. i went back right before it dropped off ps plus and i'm going to buy a copy now just to 100 it. it's definitely not for everyone, but i really liked it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,engaging story with a beautiful and interesting aesthetic. i loved it and hope to see more interesting content from the creators.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i fucking hate cats and i still enjoyed it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"this game brought so much of the gaming world together in the kind of positivity that not many games manage  i'll always be thankful for the time where my timeline was just filled with people and their cats enjoying the pretty little cat game. also, it was a damn great game too. enjoyed every moment of it and can't wait to see what's next from these folks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,just bought it yesterday. enjoying the hell out of what i have played so far. even before i started though i had to turn cat deaths off.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"oh my, i almost forgot about this game! i bought it a while ago, but for some reason i haven't played it yet. op, thank you for reminding me about it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i thought this was cyberpunk for a moment like yes.. takemura wanted our love all along and that's the bitter sweet ending to an incredible game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i expected the game to be cute but what i didn't expect it to look so stunningly gorgeous on oled, it was such a beautiful sight!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,no game ever made me cry harder than this one.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i was gonna stop playing at the beginning when the cat got hurt  im glad i pushed through tho
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,you didnt cry shut up
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,bought this game coz of the buzz created by the online gamers and went downhill while playing.seriously wasted my pocket money on this shit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,loved this game. gutted i had to save in the control room and there was literally 30 seconds of game left when i was looking forward to more stray. unexpectedly awesome gsme
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i never got that far. i was so put off by it that i gut my first steam refund ever.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i cried too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i just couldn't play this game seeing this cute little guy get hurt and cry for his friends at the beginning was too much for me
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,"i was playing this and stopped just got past the prison because i was not having any fun. im glad people like the game, but it just wasnt for me"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,you will hate the ending of starfield.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i love this game i would like be an open world
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"i was disappointed when we didn't have the opportunity to find it's family after opening the gates. but it still was a beautiful game to play, i just wanted to see them reunite."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-27,"i was really excited for stray because i saw that the cat was running on rooftops in the trailer and i was hoping for the kind of freedom and exploration that mirror's edge catalyst offered. the game delivered that at first, but as it went on the exploration became very limited. rooftops got replaced with narrow streets with no way to get to the tops of buildings, so after that i didn't enjoy it as much. i loved the story and the world, but in terms of the quality of the gameplay it felt kind of like a school project, like they started off wanting to do something really ambitious but had to quickly wrap it up once the deadline got close."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"oh man me too! i was bummed that i wasn't able to go backwards, i never found all of the flowers for that one lady!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i was so so sad there wasnt a roam mode after beating the game. i convinced myself there would be and was so bummed when it ended and that was it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"yup, this is why i ended up quitting the game, was too tightly controlled. a similar concept but more openworld would be amazing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,the bestest!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,damn that's exactly how i felt! i was like... fuck man... it just felt too real for a moment
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i wish we could have taken him with us. there was something unbearable about just leaving him lying there.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"oh 100, it was truly refreshing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,same! i finished it in 5 hours and was so bummed about it. such an amazing story!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"yeah, it went by way too fast! but at least with a short game, i can look forward to many, many replays."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i know. i couldnt leave the room. that part was devastating. i felt the very end was hopeful though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,i was actually mildly angry for a week over this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,yeah i bought it day 1 on xbox but was side tracked on skyrim. jumped on it today and finished in 5 hours but it was so worth the price of admission!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i know! i hope the make a larger more freeroam style game in the future because that world was stunning!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"oh boy, i died 9 times amd got an achievement so there's that lol. also, search everything. before you move on to the next part make sure you completed everything that you wanted to. i missed some stuff thinking i could go back, now i need to replay it haha"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,i hope youll enjoy it!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,what put you off?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"yeah, that initial fall was rough. please consider giving it another chance though. its a wholesome and uplifting game, despite its sad parts."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,you werent that far from finishing it. its very short.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,i hated the zerg parts. i quit doom eternal because i could master the double jump drift magic button mash sequence.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-22,"hahhah i know the feeling, i still get sidetracked on skyrim. somehow they keep getting me to buy it again"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,"it just wasn't what i was advertised. the controls were not intuitive and at some point i just couldn't figure out what to do. i kinda wanted cat simulator with a touching story and instead i felt like i was being asked to just figure it out. this is one of those games imo that's just as enjoyable watching a let's play, if not moreso."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,"ironically, i found the game very intuitive. i dont recall it having a particularly great tutorial system though."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"kratos vs thor, who's winning? will they continue his kratos' story and let him live to be elderly or will the god of thunder dethrone the god killer sending boy into his own storyline to perhaps one day take revenge on the murderer of his father or failing the same way?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"this is absolutely true when god of war's indicative age rating is 18 years old in korea, while the stray game reaches 12 years old, i see why."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,you should include a pic of pressing circle to cancel a menu selection...cause why not? apparently then vs. now memes can be about anything that are not even related.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,can someone explain to me why a video game would prompt a player to hit one single button to perform an action where zero other buttons do anything and have no consequence? is the challenge here in deciding to hit the button or not hit the button?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,millennial vs gen z. playing as a god killer vs playing as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,the stupid cat walking sim god how i wish there was a way to block this shit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"what the fuck is this even comparing? what's the point of this? pressing buttons is vastly different in many games, regardless of years in which they were released."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,press circle to fix helios' neck problem.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its intentional that devs like to immerse gamers to be a cat such that there is a trophy for meow 1000 times i think. yup i also unlocked it after spamming it on my 3day playthrough. havent unlocked other trophy though but its fun to plat this game as well.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i would legit pay for someone to make a lennyyyy mod.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"for me, it's poseidon's beatdown. the 2ndperson pov was brilliant. that eye gouge, though..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"for me it was killing of hercules, he just kept on hitting his face until it wasn't there... you know, in hindsight kratos was way more fucked up of a character than i thought at the time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"originally when i played the game, i was fine. nowadays, it would be hard for me to swallow this game. however, looking at kratos as a character. phenomenal character building for him. in new game i cant help but see how he might be even disgusted of himself when thinking of himself in the past and all this violence."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,they certainly turn some heads
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i realised that when !blazer sent the cat to jail! and after that i kept on meowing on every cutscene
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i meowed over 100 times in the first hour, the achievement popped up, and suddenly i realised i was basically behaving like my own cat. the main difference being that my cat will stretch a single meow into at least 5 seconds at times. sometimes just saying hello, sometimes wanting attention or food, sometimes just because he's a little bastard. but man, i realised i am just as insufferable as a cat. i must've meowed well over a thousand times by now playing stray."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,impressive.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,plays a game about this cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,is it good? i was debating on getting it or waiting for it to go on sale
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,this is called progress. especially if you use the garfield mod. although god of war would also be improved by a garfield mod.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i've completed the game. there is no bad languagecursing. there are some action sequences where you are chased by little alien creatures or shot at by drones. the cat can die in these sequences but there is no blood and the game quickly starts again. the alien critters can also be exploded later in the game, but it's not bloody or graphic. there is really nothing in the game i would think inappropriate for a 9 year old."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"well, since it's rated e for everyone, i guess it's ok."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"my 7 year old is enjoying it. perfectly fine for kids, though they may have trouble with some progression."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,can't believe i had to scroll down to find this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"missed opportunity, to be honest. you could steal the meme, and put that title up, and you'd probably steal all the upvotes. lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its an ad for the game stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,a little context might help stray recently surpassed god of war as the highest rated game on steam.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,literally sitting here floored at how this completely unnecessary opinion got 20k upvotes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,welcome to reddit.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i played it and it's really chilled af... it's really a cat game through and through and i liked it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i dont get why are so many people hating on stray because it's too casual for them and because it's popular.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,just watch a playthrough and save your money
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,these violent video games are whats causing violence in society. fox news
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"agreed, cozy gaming is still gaming! that being said im still pumped for gow ragnarok. both are good"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"play cat game, i totally recommend it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,both things still exist
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"which is ok, gore really doesn't have to be in every game. that said, i'd just like to mention how much i hate games that try to have it both ways. like fallen order where you swing around one of the most dismembering weapons out there, but no dismembering takes place. i think if a game can't take the gore, it shouldn't have content that would realistically end in gore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,so you think a 2 hour demo with no content is better than a generational title?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i miss this god of war. new one didnt cut it for me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i hate seeing people talk about popular video games on my video game subreddits! think of all that wasted time we could have used to talk about le witcher 3 and microtransactions!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,tired of seeing them everyfwhere. feels like going to an isolated island for the next 4 years.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it's just more of duality of man type of joke but it's pressing circle.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,you need at least 500 to buy a ps5 and a ps membership
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,rwhoooosh
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"dunno, but be my guest anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"stray havent played it or seen any videos or it myself, but from what i gather, its a pretty wholesome game where you are a cat that can meow at will. this makes it game of the year apparently."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,game was released 12 years ago
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,probably the best l3r3 button prompt in the history of playstation.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,well accessibility in games just been refined for people with disabilities probably at the early days of ps4's time.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,please tell me how a 2ndperson pov works in this game i didn't played it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i think he did that to hercules because he didnt want to fight his brother, but hercules was brainwashed by hera and wouldnt listen to reason. i interpret it as kratos thinking whypunchdidntpunchyoupunchlistenpunch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"and the way they pivoted in the latest installment was masterful. it's unbelievable how much more mature of a rated m for mature game that is compared to it's heritage. it's almost metatextual in how it looks back at the franchise with shame in the same way kratos does his past actions. maybe i'm reading to much into it, but, death of the author means it's valid lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,oh yeah he clearly is so much wiser in the new game and there is hints that he is ashamed of a lot of things he did in his past . such a badass though lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yeah that's why he was so reluctant to get the blades of chaos
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"i once found this in a comment section on youtube of cutscenes from gow 2018, but at the scenes where his son goes into full on rage quits in battle. kratos gets pretty upset at him for doing so and tries to teach him to control his anger. someone once pointed out its as if kratos saw his past self in atreus."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,perv.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,same haha.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yeah i was streaming on my discord because everyone wanted to know if it was actually any good. they all immediately like why does the cat meow so much. because o is meow and i like meow noises. they muted the stream to watch after that. i would also trip the robots and push things off ledgesknock over books as much as possible. i wanted that full cat rpg experience ya know.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,when i was running away from the zurks for the first time i unlocked the 100 meow achievement as i was spamming the button making sure i would shake them off me. my cat was just sprinting and meowing at the same time haha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,i see your cat is giving you cheat codes! that's not fair!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"you know that thing cats do where as you're walking to feed them they will rub against your legs almost tripping you? never understood it, but immediately started trying to run between the legs of npcs when i had to wait while they slowly walked somewhere."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"i'm waiting to buy the disc, but me and my cats are gonna have some conversations."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,very nice. let's see paul allen's meow

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"love the originals. can't get into the new one. just feels slow, smile, and repetitive. enjoying stray though. slow and sloppy is great in a random be a cat' game, not so much in a gow game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it's decently good and something new, also pretty easy and very atmospheric with a cool soundtrack. it's definitely not the 2nd coming of christ like the cat nuts on the internet seem to be implying, the gameplay itself is kinda bland if you look at it objectively. in terms of length it's about 45 hours long so you decide if that is worth your money or not."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"well, it's not a bad game, i enjoyed it. but honestly a little overrated if you ask me. you being a cat is like 50 of why the game gets so much positive response i think. the other 50 is still very valid though! great story, decent gameplay and an amazing atmosphere!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"short game, on the easy side, some parts are pure exploration. being a cat really does carry it. however the story, attention to detail, character animation and world design are all incredible. stray has passion put into it, a rare thing in modern games, and most of your progress is through very catty behavior."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"its cute, i'd wait a few months for when its on sale"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"meh, i'd wait for a sale. it's like ohh cool, i'm a nimble cat, and then all platforming elements are just hit a to jump to next ledge. like, you can't miss a jump or jump wherever you like. it feels very limiting."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it's 100 an adventure game with good visual detail. if that fits your desires, then sure. it's about 10 hours to 100 the game, so at 30 u.s. dollars, you're talking 3 bucks to the hour."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i love it. i've already beaten it once and am on my second playthrough. it's cute, adorable, sad at times, but it's unlike any other adventure game i've played. you're a little kitty! what's not to dig?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"good is an opinion of view ofc, but its well made, cute, atmospheric, controls are easy, sometimes little thrilling, has puzzles, the world is beautifully done, movement mechanics are simple but nice and somehow really immersive for me, the motions of the cat and other little things are realistic enough that they bring smile to my face. overall i really like the game. it draws me in, feels comfy, interesting and cute. it is a good adventure game not fully played the game, probably still in quite early in the game. maybe 1h in the game as im very prone to explore. world is not big atleast yet though but there are fun side quests to do on the japanese vibed alleyways"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it's great! the atmosphere is amazing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,100 recommend. its honestly such a relaxing game. theres points when its a little tense due to some enemies but honestly the whole game was like a soothing balm for this kind of year.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i was actually kinda disappointed, there's not much to do except trigger some prompt commands. the cat you're playing doesn't really react to the world like it sees birds without doing anything, the jumping mechanic is pretty lame imo since all scripted and in the end you just meow or run, no other stuff to do as a cat. the physics are also terrible, you'll walk through anything like it has no weight which is already weird in most games but even more so as a tiny cat. but yeah the settings are very pretty and the word they built is very interesting, the gameplay is just too lazy imo. like give us some actual control over the jumps, add some different stances for the cat that we can pick, some hidden things to find, etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it's not so much a game as it is an experience. there is little actual game play outside of running around on fetch quests, a few sneaking sections, and a few running sections. it's not a complex game at all. but the atmosphere and story telling are top notch. it takes what would be like a 34 for game play and turns it into a solid 9 for an experience. absolutely worth a purchase, but maybe wait for it to go down to 20. also, it's a very short game. ther is even an achievement for beating the game in under 2 hours."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,eeehhhhhh...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"treat it as a narrative game first. kind of like a 3d limbo. the gameplay is there, but it's not the focus. the setting is the focus. the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the aesthetic, and the cat's interaction with the world is the focus. gameplay is mostly fluidish movement, and environmental puzzles. no waypoints or quest markers exist. you're immersed in the world. you are a cat. if you have cats, you know their lives aren't always action and excitement. there's a lot of just hanging around, being a cat. press o to meow."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"no, barely a game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,stray is an awesome game. i started a second play through immediately after finishing. world building is 1010.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i enjoyed it throughly. i took my time and tried to complete everything as i went and it took me a good 78 hours. really good story and fun puzzles. atmosphere and music are sweet. i paid the full 30 on ps4 and dont regret it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"worth the buy, having a lot of fun with it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its fun being a cat but it gets boring fast because the platforming kills your mood
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,thanks for sharing your thoughts! my son loves cats but has vivid nightmares so this is the info i needed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"yeah its jack and daxter level of violence, at most"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it's not necessarily advertising. sometimes a bandwagon starts and then it just rolls and rolls. negative bandwagons are the best example for this it was cool to hate cp2077 for bugs even though it didn't even have more bugs than any bethesda game ever. just underdelivered expectations. people like making something popularinfamous and then collectively circle it because it creates a sense of community that echos, conforms same views. very much like religions go."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"you know you're on the site that among other less savory things got famous for being a place to share cat pics? anytime someone talks about a cat there is a highly upvoted comment demanding cat tax. then a game comes along that accurately reflects the behavior of cats and you're surprised reddit loves it? edit they deleted their comment, i'm getting a sweet bonus this month."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"same here. combat was too clunky in the new one thanks to the camera. also really, really repetitive, there's not much replayability once you finish it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it's not even a game. it's a short interactive movie that limits your movement.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it took me a while, but the story is absolutely worth it. just play it on the lowest difficulty. truly though, combat is no longer god of war's most fun part, and i won't say it's okay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,youre missing out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yeah the satisfaction of being a cathttpsyoutu.bewb8pxz1y9o?t30 certainly seems to be the main selling point that turns it into a highlight for some players. the cat behaviour and movement are all very nicely done after all. those who just approach it as another game without that fascination naturally aren't going to be as hyped by it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i put it in the same ballpark as goose game, or little nightmares. its a short and perfectly sculpted experience that doesnt ask too much of you. just absolute vibes. goose game is focussed much more on its chaotic energy, i will admit. its the sort of game you come back to once a year or so and play on a rainy weekend."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,100ing it would increase the hours played  and its said to be an easy platinum. would also require a second play through for one of the trophies.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,the gameplay is so bland i think watching a playthrough and saving money is an option.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,the music and the small details does it for me. and the fact you can do dumb cat shit even as the situation looks more dire is my favorite bit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,you forgot the best part  you can make the sad robots smile.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,the 50 of you being a cat is also very valid. they went to great lengths to animate things in a way that looks and feels realistic. the limitations of where the cat will and won't jump to are for the most part spot on. you can also turn all the button prompts off for a completely hud free experience so you have to think about where a cat could get to and what it could interact with a lot of times being places a human could never reach. the advantages and limitations of being a cat tie into the story and objectives as well.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"the gameplay is walk and press button prompts for your character to do anything, aka it has no real gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"that sounds right up my alley, how is the soundtrack for this game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i do love immerse adventure games
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"im with you. i was a little caught offguard by how melancholy it is. there were a few times in the game where my wife and i were just like, damn. we are going there huh?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,that sounds good i love adventure games and i wanted to play this because i liked the idea of a cat to play as since my cat past away a couple of months ago and then i seen this game ill give it a try
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"really enjoy the game but glad i got it on playstation plus, considering the short length."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,so you think i should wait for it to be on sale
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,theyre side quest to this game? i thought it looked like a linear game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i did this too. upgraded
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,one more question did you upgrade to only extra and got the game. i upgraded to premium... if so.. well shit. have to downgrade or research some more. it was very unclear imo when i looked into it. and.. yeah or maybe im bit stupid d
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"well from your response and same as others gameplay wise the game is not the best but everything else as visual, audio etc. is well done but not worth the full amount, i might as well wait for it to go on sale"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,my fav are those spots where you can just curl up and chill while the camera pans out showing this vast strange landscape in intricate detail to the sound of ambient music. great vibe.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"aww thats sad to hear, was it bad what didnt you like about it"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i don't know man, i don't want to see goombas and koopas being crushed and their organs splattered around whenever mario jumps over them"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"there's a huge difference between and video game and an interactive movie, which is why it's in its own category."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,shaaaauuuuuuuuuuunnn
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yeah this was the version i'm familiar with and the laughter is so contagious lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,tetsuo!!!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,are you sure? isn't this your identification? patrick star?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"exactly. its the kid that gets picked to read, and the rest of the class has their lives pass before their eyes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"no, because you are still controlling kratos. first person is the point of view of the actor, second person is the point of view of the one being interacted with, and third person is the point of view of a spectator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,check the fight on youtube. kratos vs poseidon gowiii full scene. not child friendly. enjoy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,we do meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,is this thread full of bots or something? what is happening
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"thank you, fine sir."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yea the face kinda looks like moulded rice sometimes. it just doesn't have that extreme cuteness . but who care when i can meowww
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,the game somewhat reminds me of bad mojo 1996 where you play as a cockroach
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,are the meows from real cats? yeshttpsscreenrant.comstrayvoiceactorcatlalameowhiss
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,this type of content was carefully crafted to trigger redditors as effectively as possible and is best in class.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i regret adding that to my youtube history lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,you can make the robots smile.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,this rampant robophobia breaks my heart.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it's actually the robots that are downvoting. they are sad and lashing out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,oh absolutely. to me the feels is part of what makes it such an excellent experience. i just didnt know those would be coming through when i first downloaded it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i think you should try getting over that as it's pretty unrealistic and you'll constantly be troubled with this for the rest of your life
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"ideally i want someone who knows me and knows the kind of games i play to recommend me stuff. that is a bit unrealistic though. if it is an single player fps and it get good reviews chances are i will like it. i might take a quick peek at a trailer before i buy it. some developers deliver quality stuff or games i like. fromsoft for example. barely watched a trailer. basically ignored it until launch only getting some glimpses of it on the internet. there are some franchises i really like. if a new mass effect game comes out i'm probably going to play it. usually though i do watch a trailer or research a game before i buy it, but i do try and keep it as spoiler free as possible. i love getting suprised and discover things as they happen. if i play a star wars game i want to find out while playing that i am a jedi not via a jedi gameplay trailer. even if the reveal is only 2 hours in to the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"lmao, you've never been a kid in the 90s staring at a wall of video games with no idea what any of them have. imagine an age before the internet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"then maybe he should engage with them. find out their motivations, their hopes and dreams. try to see their point of view, try to make them see his. if his first and only choice is violence, is he really better than them? at least kratos is honest about who he is, and what he does."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"except the video game in question is still a.... video game. also the whole interactive movie thing isnt really something games attribute to themselves, its more of a label people put on games that focus more on story than pure gameplay. and its almost always used to discredit or diminish a games success."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i found the murderer shaauun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"got it, thanks"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,who cares about the meowing when i can knock tons of shit off of tables.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"oh okay good. i was going to be very disappointed. in that case, this makes me realize some people meow exactly like cats. skills"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"thats fair, well played. but based on the view count there are people consuming that stuff nonironically which is concerning"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"reddit is full of robophobes and morbophobes, it's a sad state of affairs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,rbotrights
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it makes too much sense. they're sad because all they can do is surf reddit, and not pet a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"whats there to get over? someone informed me of something that i would have preferred to learn later by myself? if you take that as anger then i really don't think you've been reading this conversation correctly at all. but why am i surprised, once people realize they don't have an argument they just switch to what, you mad?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i'm not offended, but i have my preferences. going in blind in to a game, movie or show is something i really recommend. it makes it a lot better in my opinion. even small moments like press o to meow is better find on your own. might give me a little laugh. if i ever play it now my reaction will be yep, there it is. i recently started to watch the boys and i recognized some of the memes. oh yeah that's that meme was my reaction. i played bioshock infinite without really knowing anything about it and i think that made the game a lot better. i did not know what to expect. i didn't even know there was magic in the game. i did the same with skyrim. was really surprised to find out i was a dragon born. i did not know i could become a jedi in kotor. i thought the movie from dusk till dawn was just about some robbers kidnapping a family and that family had to escape somehow."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,right because it's impossible to buy games you've never heard or seen about before. why would i buy one? why wouldn't i buy it? you're the one trying to state there is some reason i'm unable to buy it because i don't know anything about it. so you tell me the reason. how did people buy video games before trailers were common? before everyone had the internet?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"its not the 90s its 2022, of course this statement doesnt apply to a kid 30 years ago"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"is every single fucking comment praising a product somehow paid marketing? yes everyone knows that real people hate everything  if you're in any way positive about something, you're trying to sell something. duh."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"if it's a 5050 shot real praise or advertising, i'm treating it as advertising everytime"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"now i want to play mario and only kill the enemies i have to. that's probably how a speed run works, though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,probably one of my favorite moments in the game was when there were two robots playing a game and i jumped up to say hi and ruined their game. the fact i got a trophy for it was even better lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,some cats also meow like people.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vw7xlwjnnng
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,morbophobes yer kind ain't welcome 'round 'ere.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i didn't take anything as anger.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,you probably shouldnt be in a gaming sub if you never want to see a spoiler ever. get over yourself.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"and what? because the internet exists i must know about a video game before buying it? if i buy a video game i know nothing about are the cops going to come and shoot me? lmao, you're trying so hard to have a point but you literally have nothing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,okay what the fuck. that was a god damn trip
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"god you are a fucking dweeb, anyone who wants to waste their money on a game they know nothing about is free to do so. its your money youre wasting lmfao trying so hard to have a point youre taking it too serious bro. get off the internet, go take a walk. worked up over nothing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"you're calling me a dweeb about something that doesn't affect you what so ever, and yet i'm taking the internet too seriously... lmao, okay bud."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i am absolutely loving this game so far. so many little details like this. it's so charming
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the why you do this to me walk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"well my cat just stands still for a few seconds and then falls over, she wont move until i free her."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,wait is stray out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"every fing day its the same bs struggle with my ah cat. he knows its time for a walk, because he bitches about if we dont go. get the leash, try to put it on, and im calling ae for stitches. eventually we get the leash on and its the crouch walk until he sees a bird in the garden, and the leash doesnt bother him again weve been walking him every day for the last 3 years."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i have tried to harness my cat because she keeps pulling her collars off. she fights me to put it on and then she flips out and runs around the house trying to escape from it. i stopped trying to harness her after that. if she won't wear the collar, or the harness, then she can stay an indoor cat. we have a lot of wild animals around, i don't want an eagle or vulture to think she's bite sized we've seriously had some massive buzzards fly over our yard, they're pretty intimidating, or for her to get in a fight with a fox, so i want to try to supervise her outside if at all possible. at least until she gets used to it and i'm sure she'll stick close. also a tether to keep her from hiding under the porch indefinitely. but she won't let me get her dressed. maybe i'm worrying over nothing, but i'd rather keep her inside where it's safe. also she has long fur, which is hard enough to deal with as it is, i don't need her walking through the thistles and getting those tangled up in her fur too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"fun fact cats actually use what they feel around them with their bodies to navigate along with their other senses. so when you put a harness or sweater on them, it's similliar to making them precieve a wall or some other obstacle in the environment touching them. which is why you'll see them do this kind of movement, they are actively trying to avoid what they are precieving. it's kind of hard to explain the concept though. edit damn my all my years on reddit and now my 5th highest upvoted comment is a cat fact edit2 now it's my 2nd highest upvoted comment, damn guys lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that flop too. love all the details they put in this game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its the walk of an animal who is not yet certain they cant justduck underneath the obstruction if they crouch low enough.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the mocap on the flop and the weird crouch walk are so well done.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i laughed really hard at that point, very realistic."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ok... now i believe it's made by cat lovers.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my kitties did this when they were getting harnesstrained! very realistic. well done devs!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"tried to put one of our cats in a harness, he just went stiff and dramatically fell over, refusing to move unless we rook it off. once we did he sprang right up, demanding pets. as you do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat only walks backwards when she's in a harness
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"what game is this, sorry am new in the gaming world"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i keep the cat's harness on him. he got used to it. but this reminds me of the first time he got one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if you blink really fast, you'll notice you still get the exact same fps"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that bit cracked me up. absolutely love everything about the game itself. my choice to play it on pc with my gamepadmouse combo was stupid, and i suck at the combat i think i just heard king arthur yell run away!, but that's every nonmmo i play."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you can tell the devs all owned cats at some point. the details are great. however my biggest disappointment came when i started the game and realized there was no mechanism to choose my cats appearance, i thought i was gonna get to pick what cat i was"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat uses one and this is so accurate lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love when the cat wears a paper bag on its head and the controls are completely reversed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this part was perfection it was so accurate. so many little details.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,that's probably the first thing they captured when they put the motion capture suit on the cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is stray that good or are they just massively successful at manipulating the front page with post floods between my cat watches stray on the tv to check out these cool features. the marketing push on this game has been ubiquitous across reddit in the last 48hrs.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the flop is perfect.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i love that if you meow at a cam before getting to the bot, it nod at you. really cute game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this game is the new journey in terms of emotional affect and excellent execution.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i legit assumed the game glitched
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,they've got the cat like behaviors down perfectly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,removed
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,motion blur is wild..
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i have an orange cat and when i tried putting him in one this happened. when this happened in the game i lost it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i ran straight into the bedroom to tell my gf that the cat in the game did the clothes thing!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cats have never evolved passed the flop over stage of harness training
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"thanks for making me lol so hard at work, this game looks awesome and the harness sequence is so faithfully depicted. brought back lots of bittersweet memories of trying to take my princess for a walk, only to have her alternate between a pet rock and a cripple."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what is this game?? srry im uncultured
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so accurate but usually the just wouldnt move at all
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i loved this part!! there's so many times your just reminded that you're a cat!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i showed this to my wife, and she fucking tells me oh, so basically its a game based on you? i have never felt so personally offended, and yet simultaneously so deeply in love with her all over again after that comment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat just tries to shimmy backward out of it and bumps into furniture or the wall.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my daughter and i had a good laugh at that. shes 5. loves it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,these developers have been annoyed by a cat before and it shows
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,the lying down like you put a thousand pound weight vest on him
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i swear that one of the application requirements to work on this game was developers needed! must own cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"also if you lay a piece of tape over their back. not even firm enough to stick to any fur, just lay it lengthwise on top."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lol thats so accurate! my cat lost 50 agility when i put him some clothes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,cats always pretend like the harnest is killing them
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if you put my cat into a harness and pull her forward a bit, she starts walking backwards all the time"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,as a non cat owner i wondered wtf was going on
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this looks hilarious. i need it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"ngl, i'm not much a cat fan, but this game is gonna be a hit for sure. it's so damn perfect in every details that make me get even more scary about cats!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i played this part of the game last night and it made me laugh so hard. they nailed how cats behave
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"can confirm. i went to a minor league baseball game this past weekend and it was take your pet to the ballpark day. people brought all sorts of critters, including various reptiles, a duck in a baby stroller, and at least 12 dozen cats walking just like that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,question is the final game as choppy as this looks or is this a recording problem?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,they act like we attached a 10ib weight to their backs when we try to put a harness on. lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i am loving this game so far.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,move away dishonored 2 i have a new favorite game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,that initial flop tho 3
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat never got up just said fuck you and laid there till i took it off
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,mine just flat out refuses to walk in a harness. like he forgets how to.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ive never heard of stray until like a week ago and now im seeing content for it everywhere. what happened?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,one cat we trained from a kitten with a harness. the other cat will just continuously back up trying to get out. he doesnt stop backing up. we break the cat. its funny then sad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i love this game so much. all the details they put into this on how the cat behaves makes me appreciate my cats that much more. fuck the zurks though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so fucking accurate
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what game is this omg?!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,damn i didnt know this game was out already. might have to scoop it. how is it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,why does it look so stutterly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is there a part where the cat gets booties and it does the shakeywalky?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the cats ears would be back!! unplayable! s
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"why does every post of this game make it look like shit? first ps2 looking graphics, now laggy as hell gameplay?? i get wanting to show the game off but your systems make it look awful"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat just falls down and dies. end of clip.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yes cats do this in real life they aren't used to having harnesses on their body so they crouch walk lol my cats do this lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i don't have a cat and i thought that the vest was really heavy lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"amusing. depends on the cat. my siamese cats, a harness never seemed to bother them. my big brown tabby reacts just like this, though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,amazing. yes  that walk. then i gave it a heart attack when i removed the harness and the velcro made that sound.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,im downloading this right meow! i can not wait to play!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i don't think i've ever enjoyed playing a game more than this one.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,god damn put it on xbox
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i wanna play this so bad, can't wait to start working again"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,omg i love it. my cat does the same when i put his thunder shirt on
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lol you left out the best part where your little robocompanion gets flustered and says that the harness was designed for small quadrupeds and how could the cat possibly not like it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this just sold the game so hard to me lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"one of my cats is cool with it, we used to take him for walks. not sure about the other 2, they are scared of the outside."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,looks like a fun game lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,well thanks a lot. i was trying to hold off buying it. now i got no choice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,sure this game isnt going to be in contention for goty or anything but its by far the best indie game ive played in a long time. very fun and touching.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,oh god the fraaamereateee my eyes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,bro it's so accurate though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,that was it. the moment i decide to buy this game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,loving stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i can't handle the cuteness. only thing missing is a customizable kitty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i think i need this game, especially as a cat person"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ah the newest heavily advertised stylish platformer! doesn't appeal to me but i wish these ads were less wook at the kitty
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i haven't even play this game and i love it already.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i see they're marketing this game pretty hard.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i was watching day9 play this last night and he made a good point. that up until this point you were playing as a cat and having to interact with stuff as a cat. then you get this robot companion that can talk to people and operate door pinpads etc and now you are basically interacting with the world as a person in cat form.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"for 30 on steam,, it is a good buy?,, was thinking to buy it for my kids"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i want to play this so bad, but my laptop can't run it, i don't have a ps5, and my friend won't let me borrow his even though he's not playing it edit thanks to everyone encouraging me to buy this on my laptop anyway. it actually runs great!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i was cackling so hard at this scene
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i found a glitch the other day where you can jump on the planks that was destroyed and hover
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i really wish this was on xbox, actually want to play it pretty bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,so is there some cool plot to this or are you just a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,why do i see this cat simulator everywhere ?!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"a shame this game isnt on the xbox, playstation fanboys win this round"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"for every moron that doesnt understand this game or why its blasted all over the place, let me simplify it for you cats go meow and are cute as fuck. there are generally a lot of people that love cats in every group of society and definitely as far as gamers go. jfc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i can't get over the framerate? what are you playing this on?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what is this?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,should i buy it? i'm considering.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"non related question, why is everybody is posting this game? isn't it just goat similator with extra steps? people think like it is another elden ring or something."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,does the framrate really look this bad
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,dogs are better than cats. change my mind.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the new cat simulator looks pretty good! when will it be out of beta?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,lets just spoil the game immediately
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"very smart to make a mediocre game that will pander to the cat fanatic market who will share all 5 of the things the cat does incessantly. so much wasted potential and a mediocre plot. but hey, the cat scratches things and they even force it into the gameplay 4 times."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,still waiting for ps5 to release this for their premium monthly game.... edit it wasn't in the monthly games like i would expect. it's in the full catalog for premium.....
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,wait wait wait its already out? noooooo i passed the release... where is it please i need it. ig on steam? wait how is it called again? edit okay sometimes it's helpful to first read the comments and than write one lol. i found out that it came out yesterday and the name ist stray. sometimes emotions lead to stupid actions zitat from idk who cuz i forgot. is that even from someone? idk it just popped up in my head lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,can you add an spoiler tag next time?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we have had two boy cats and both do this. never could get them to walk no matter how long we leave them in it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hahaha, as someone that recently got a cute little harness for my own kitty, i know exactly how this is! such a great little detail!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat tries to back out of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my cat displayed the same behavior when i put on his thunder shirt. trying to help the little guy get over his intense fear of storms and loud noises. anyone need a used thunder shirt?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,well. at least one person who made the game is friends with a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the cat should have fallen over at least a few more times.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the action time was great, with that and the quite horror city it make me pump up the adrenaline"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,these type of details made me laugh so hard. truly awesome
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this game is what sold me on upgrading to psextra. the game costs 40 cad and my upgrade for 2 months was only 8. still might change it back before my renewal date but we'll see if i get enough use out of it. i'm kind of an ark addict so don't play many other games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the accuracy of this part had me laughing. my cats lost their minds hearing the meows and seeing the butterfly in the opening bit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,tangential i have a friend who will rant about how outdoor cats are mass murder machines and therefore it's a cardinal sin to allow a cat to roam outdoor without a harness. do other people share this view or is it a niche crackpot thing? he made it sound legit but i'm just wondering how popular this notion is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i wish there was an animation where the cat walks backwards trying to get the harness off without success.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i laughed out loud. this game is so unbelievably charming, visually stunning, and stuffed full of lovingly crafted little details... front runner for goty in my book."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i have never owned a ps system nor have i ever had the desire, but this cat game has me tempted to try and find a ps5, no lie"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my cats were so smart they always played dead if we'd see them wear their harness. it's a big city so we didn't want them to go outside on their own, and the instructions said that we should put on the harness and let the cat get adjusted to it one or two days. and they always walked with the harness, but only if no one was looking. if you snuck up on them, you could see them sit or stand, but as soon as you made a sound they would fall over and not stand up until we left the room again."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,never got past the collapsing part.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the best part of this game is that everyone you meet treats the cat like it is just a very small person.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what about a game where youre a street dog? in like india or something edit not anticat just spitballing

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,funny enough the stray cat we brought in instantly was fine with a harness and leash. he just doesn't even care about it edit by the way anyone playing this on ps4? how does it look and how does it run?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"son got me this as an early birthday gift. it's so dang cute! i have laughed, giggled and snorted. it's a tad confusing at times what i'm supposed to do and not a whole lot of help online, but i power on. only issue is the mouse part is so sensitive i got very motion sick after a few hours, so will have to limit exposure. other half said he definitely wants to get this game lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,it will be a memorable experience for me i dont usually play games like this more of an nfs and pvp player but i really like cats adopted 2 recently that i will get a platinum trophy on it no matter the time it takes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"same here, i saw a trailer a couple months ago and was pretty curious and excited to try it out. so far it's actually even better than i expected! i was kinda thinking i'd just be a stray cat exploring, but there's a whole story to uncover and it's actually a lot of fun going through the areas. the graphics and art style are absolutely beautiful as well"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my nine year old loves cats. i mean loves them. when i booted this game up he was sitting right next to me and cried when ! the cat fell down the drain in the beginning. ! we love all the purrs, noises, small cat details the devs put into stray. 1010."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,same here. i saw an ad for the game on reddit and immediately preordered it. love the game so much. the cat details are so adorable.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i ordered the physical from iam8bit so i wont get to play until december, but i'm stoked!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what game is this?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this seems awesome! they were definitely cat coexisters
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,one of my favorite parts so far is when you stick your head in a paper bag and suddenly you cant control where he walks because the poor little kitty cant see anything
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"same, i'm loving it so much"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,whats the game play like? all ive seen is a cat walking around.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hows the performance? this clip looks choppy af, but i really want to buy the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm contemplating buying it. but i've heard it's extremely short and for the price tag idk if it's worth it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i ordered the physical edition from iam8bit and i have to wait until september to play.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"oh shit, is it out! i had it on my steam wishlist"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i want to play it, but i refuse to buy it unless i can be an all white cat, like my cat. wouldn't everyone want to play as their cat?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you're playing this game have the cat take a nap when you can. it's so damn cute!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"im thinking of getting this game for my nine year old daughter because she loves cats. however, ive been hesitant because of a review i read that said there are several traumatic moments in the game that they hated. so far they are the only person ive heard with this complaint. do you feel that this may be a valid concern for a young child?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my partner is just getting into pc gaming. they really dig cozy games that aren't too stressful animal crossing, cozy grove. we're playing it takes two right now, and they surprisingly got into no man's sky for a hot minute. do you think strays is good for someone who doesn't want to be stressed out by games?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i live for little details like this to the point that im frustrated this wasnt marked as a spoiler haha
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,how long did they study cat behavior to get these details right?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's a solid 910 game imo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"the walk of if i walk under it enough, it'll go away"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i always considered it the i'm carrying the weight of the world walk... and then she collapses onto her side.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,mine pretends to choke like a drama queen. doesnt even touch his neck
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"the cat in the game does that too, you can see it in the video when she first puts it on. you can even have her meow while laying there all patheticlike! so funny!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,played it for the first time yesterday.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"this and walking on the keyboard made me fall in love with the game. i miss my cat, had to put her down a few weeks ago"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,released yesterday and is available on higher ps tiers for free.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yah
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"they usually are, the pets are inside, unless they're stealing food."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,steam didn't tell me either bro
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is that what its called? stray? ive been searching for the answer in these comments for forever.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,has it not been out for a while now? i thought i saw it on steam a few weeks back
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,out today
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"reminds me of my mom's dog. she had a little coat for him in the winter, since he had trouble staying warm in the snow and frost. but if he decided it was too warm for the coat, he'd just flop over and refuse to walk. mom would put it on him inside and he'd immediately flop over, since it wasn't cold inside. then once we dragged him out he'd be like oh!! it's cold now! ok! and he'd get up and walk his merry way around the yard, ever time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ah cat what's that?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the drama. why is it that instagram cats are so carefree with their leashes? mine did backflips as if the harness was burning his flesh.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"thanks for being one of the very few responsible cat owners who walk their pet on a leash instead of just letting it out pissing, shitting and destroying the wildlife all over the neighbourhood."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ppl walk cats. that just seems strange. never seen anyone walk a cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my dog does the same. runs away and hides when i take the harness out. we've had her since she was a puppy and she's had harnesses on forever. still does the my waist hurts walk and walks in circles at home. the second she's outside with harness she doesn't care. she loves collars though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what leash do you use? id love to try a leash on my cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've been putting harnesses on my two longhaired indoor cats and taken them outside a couple of times this summer. they have been quite scared of going outside, so you definitely need the keep them on a leash so they don't get spooked and run away, and also to keep them from eating things that might be poisonous for them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"housecats are problematic enough as invasive predators themselves to warrant being kept indoors. good on you for trying to harness train yours, but ultimately domestic cats do not belong outside at all, except in the near eastnorth africa where they're indigenous. i love cats, but they're an ecological disaster."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,haha are we the same person?? im having the same trouble with mine. but i tell him if he wants to go play outside with the neighborhood puppies hes good with them all indoors 1on1 then he has to wear the harness because thems the rules
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it is always safest for the cat and for all other critters outside for them to stay as indoor only. you made the right choice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, no. not hard at all. you made perfect sense."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"in other animals are weird facts, dogs use the pads on their feet to tell if they're on a surface or not, which is why boots results in them doing exaggerated lifting feet movement they think they're still standing in the ground."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,is that why my needy as fuck cat turns to liquid to avoid being pet?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's similar to humans who use vr who know that they are in a safe space mentally and with their other senses but since our primary sense is sight we still feel weird with it, since cats primary senses are more physical they act this way."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,are you a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my cat pays absolutely zero attention to his harness. the first time i put it on him i was expecting the tip over or goofy walk, but he just kept on trucking like nothing changed."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i was taught it was because they relax all muscles when mother grabs em by the scruff and putting a harness on feels similar to that so they relax all miscles and just flop over?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,seems like they could have improved the rotation animation.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,fun fact but its actually not mocap ! animations were made from the scratch based off a real life cat obviously but bluetwelve did not use mocap for it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i've done just enough animation work to appreciate how hard animating animals in a realistic way is. pretty much all of the animation work is amazing. the first five minutes where you're interacting with your cat posse just blew me away, so much work put in there."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,all of the devs' cats are in the credits
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"cat didn't try to back out of harness. emersion broken. 310s seriously though, their attention to the mannerisms of cats is impressive."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,stray it litteraly came out yesterday
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"stray, it's available on ps45 and pc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"sorry am new in the gaming world so is stray, the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i get a lot of these comments whenever i upload gifs. it is a fineline between encoding, framerate and file size. i know it sounds silly, but in my country fiber is not an option for a lot of peopleit makes me more conscious of bandwidth. i want everyone to be able to enjoy my posts, without having to wait for a gif to load."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,give it a month and youll have mods for that.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a cute little game with puzzles that need to be solved and a few action sequences where you need to outmaneuver enemies sometimes while solving puzzles. none of it was overly challenging, but it has a nice little story to it and a welldesigned atmosphere. the npcs were pretty charming and felt like real characters, rather than just twodimensional set pieces intended to move the plot along. maybe i'm a sap, but there were a few scenes that tugged at my heartstrings particularly the ending. i got it free through ps plus extra and i throughly enjoyed it. that being said, i probably wouldn't have payed 30 for such a short game with in my opinion little replay value."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a walking simulator. there's no dedicated jump button so you literally just press x to magnetize from one platform to another. i expected platforming or anything really, but the game is really all about pressing the stick forward while being a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,cats are carried by their mothers in their mouths. so cats when pitched at the neck go limp. and this basically is a thing for them even once they grow up. so if you grab a cat's skin at the back of its neck it will stop moving. cat harness usually put some pressure on that area so cats react the same way as being grabbed there and you have those results httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vdl2dv0yqoghttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vdl2dv0yqog httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vbkcxwlvietyhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vbkcxwlviety httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vjocqdkvgavyhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vjocqdkvgavy httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmvlm76b3wrshttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmvlm76b3wrs httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vleuaghdptw8httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vleuaghdptw8 httpswww.youtube.comshortsi10awpdfnxshttpswww.youtube.comshortsi10awpdfnxs

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"to me what i'm getting from that clip is what appears to be a super low frame rate. really low end pc maybe? that almost looks unplayable, imo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,im in the same boat as you after done scrolling i have come to the conclusion that it is called stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,this is pretty much a normal cat reaction if you try to make it wear anything. they eventually get used to it but usually not anywhere as quick as in the game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,marketing  game just came out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's called stray. is only came out yesterday but i'd for sure recommend!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a charming little game. im really enjoying it. it's a fun, interesting story too!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"not everyone has a super computer, bruh"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,people posting a thing they like doesnt make it an ad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's not a platformer lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"they dont even need marketing for this game, the players do it all for them for free. even still, without the players free marketing, they still wouldnt need to market, because cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it is considered an ok game if you are into cats. it isnt going to be the best game youve ever played but definitely an enjoyable, albeit short, adventure."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's not long, 6ish hours for most people, but i'm entirely happy with my purchase having just finished it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my gf and i played the entire game yesterday and it was incredible
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's very reasonably priced. it's about 5 hours long. i hear there is a second playthrough mode that changes it a bit? it's very cute and adorable. if you have a lot of stress in your life this is a mostly great game to relax to and soak in the atmosphere of being a cat in the future. there are some actiony bits, but so far it's been mostly relaxing and some puzzles for me"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"your laptop might be able run it better than you expect, what are your specs? i'm currently playing it on my onexplayer with an integrated intel xe gpu and i can pretty easily hit 60fps most of the time. the issue is that the game's handling of resolution is kinda wonky, much like the god of war pc port. essentially to run the game full screen you have to run it at native resolution and use the resolution scale but in practice the performance ends up being kinda bad this way. to get around this problem, set your desktop resolution to the resolution you want the game to run at, 1280x800 for example. that way, this value becomes the game's full screen resolution and you can scale down from there. don't be afraid of scaling down too, the game seems to have something like amd fsr built in that makes these low resolutions actually quite attractive, i don't think it's just the taa doing this. hopefully this helps, one thing to note is that there's currently a shader compilation issue with the game that means it will stutter heavily at certain points, but this will clear up."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's on ps4 as well if you have one if those
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"same. the husband and i lost when the kitty flopped, then got up and did the belly slink walk."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,the game is nothing but story. there's actually not that much exploration other than talking to npcs and looking for some items that are pretty easy to find.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's the most realistic cat simulator since talking tom
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,game called stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"in my opinion it's not really worth the full price. it's super short only 5 hours and it has zero replayability. it's a fun game and an ok story, but super linear and there's really not anything to do other than the story, so you would get the same amount of entertainment from just watching someone else play it on youtube or twitch that you would get from playing it yourself."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,don't know if you have a ps45 but it's included in the plus subscription.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yes buy it! just finished it, it was an incredible play"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i just finished it and definitely felt it was worth it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its goat simulator but its actually nothing like goat simulator and i dont know how you think they look similar
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, this game is not like goat simulator. closer to uncharted or last of us part 1"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,its like 10 minutes into the game. the cat wears it on every ad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it's true and you get fines here if you let em out
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"they kill the fuck out of small animal species, i believe they're responsible for 100 to 300 million bird deaths a year and it's not like they need to eat them."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's the it sort of feels like mom is carrying me by my scruff, but also not walk. they have a reflex to relax when something is gripping their back a certain way. hence the flopping down."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you're surprised the internet goes crazy about a cat game? early 2000s the internet was basically 50 cat pictures.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"literally a game where you play as a realistic cat. it never needed to be astroturfed, the internet was always going to love it. not everything is a conspiracy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i think you need to reeducate yourself on what that means...

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,haha walking on the keyboard was great. the game does a great job of making you relate to your cat. stuff you tend to find annoying the game spins as a fun game mechanic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i miss my cat, had to put her down a few weeks ago  i miss my cat too, she made it to 17 before we had to put her down"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i try to walk my cats at least once a week. ziggyhttpsimgur.comtwjaj8u linkhttpsimgur.comt0y00hn
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we walked our siamese. she loved it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's pretty dependent on the cat's personality. i went through 4 cat proof harnesses before giving up with one of my cats, the other loves going on walks with us. she's usually just prowling bushes around the yard, though. i don't trust dogs or people enough to really take her out in public"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"we moved countries. from a safe area with minimal traffic and big garden, to city living with no garden. from being a 100 outdoor cat, to fully indoors, he needs to be out and get a run every day."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm a dog walker and i've noticed it becoming more and more common out on my walks. i regularly bump into a lady who walks her norwegian forest cat on the same trail i use for most of my dogs. the cat is so well trained they know to hop on their owner's shoulders when they see a dog coming their way. makes me happy every time.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,my dad trained his cat to wear a harness. a far as i know he doesn't take the cat on walks but he does have a long leash anchored around a tree to put the cat outside.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"my cat loves walks. however, she has learned how to escape her harness. no walks until we find a better harness."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we have tried a few. its a simple harness i found in a pet store in south africa.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"my cat is like a dog and cries at the door for me to give him a walk. he wants this every day, and a snack afterward."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,ah slouchy back pets.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i'm like how dare you reject my affection every time i tried to pet her
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"our cats don't give a fuck about the vests, but i imagine some would until they get used to them. if you get them used to them when young, it shouldn't be a biggie."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,from my experience it depends on the cat. our old hubert loved his sweater
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,if you train them up it's fine. just takes time
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, definitally not. there's no reason to think otherwise with me doing human things like typing on a keyboard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah some cats are like that, they won't miss a beat with one of those put on. kinda reminds me of a cat i had who as a kitten would legit run headfirst into walls but then just stopped doing it after a year or 2. cats are weird af."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"idk, the theory sounds a bit shakey to me but i guess it would depend on the harness. i just can't imagine them having a feeling behind the neck like that, especially when it takes some effort to do it by hand. i suppose it's possible that the leash pulling the harness could cause that feeling too but i've seen plenty flop without a leash even attatched. i always thought that they flopped down like that because it was a sensory overload or they just where overwhelmed with this new feeling and didn't know what to do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i imagine it's difficult to make a game when most of your dev team is hospitalised trying to get a full mocap suit on a reluctant cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i believe the industry term is mocat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i feel like a lot of time could have been saved for an even better animation if they used mocap tho, right? i admittedly dont know shit about motion capture but one of the replies below linked a video of cats in mocap, so not impossible."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i appreciate this response. sounds like the cute  much wow factor is driving the attention. reddit does love a cat pic after all.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i had assumed they just were being dramatic. my cat doesnt do this anymore. he just does his best to stay lying down when he realizes the harness is going on. its hard to get food out of an elevated cave with just a paw though so we eventually win
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"you do not scruff an adult cat, that shit goes away when they grow up. this does not work how you think. they just feel weird wearing the harness."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that's what i'm in the comments for myself. not really understanding the allure of this game, esp if it runs like this..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,oh. i assumed it was a kind of old game from the contexts i was seeing it in.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it does, actually. inadvertently. it's an ad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you took turns?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that's what gets me, i looked at the minimum and recommended specs on steam, and i thought i'd be fine. then i go through a recommended website to have my specs evaluated against what the game needs, and it told me i won't be able to run it because my graphics ram is only 1gb instead of 2, and something with my cpu. i bought a decent gaming laptop 3 years ago, used it mostly to play world of warcraft at max settings, then played a bunch of xbox games pass games on it with no issue. that's why i'm confused that i'm being led to believe i can't play it. i don't want to pay 30 for a game i can't enjoy"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"hey pal. you suck, ok? those are my cats youre talking about."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"people also just love abbreviations. seriously, go into any parenting advice subreddit and you'll see everything abbreviated. it's fine once you know what everything means, but it's obnoxious at first."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"like someone else said, it's less walking the cat and more just letting the cat outside and the leash is there so they don't get spooked by a loud noise and run off. i've only ever had one cat that actually wanted to really walk anywhere, like you would a dog. i have one cat that absolutely does not mind being on a leash at all. i have another 2 cats that just want to be outside near the back door and just hang out, eating grass and shit. they'd rather not do the leash thing. luckily, they don't really go very far so it's been fine. but every cat i've ever heard in my life have all loved going outside. they might be scared at first of all the noises and stuff but they all get used to it and wind up being their happiest just rolling around in the grass."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i gotta ask are you giving him enough enrichment at home? like places to perch, hideaways and poles? he might be crying because he's bored to death."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"that's still our fault, though. we took an animal out if its natural habitat and just plopped them all over the globe. most local ecosystems don't do well when novel predators are introduced, especially en masse."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"someone posted on this sub the other day, that the suits andor white spheres, are not necessary any more."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i would bet mocaping a cat is insanely time intensive.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yeah just train cats to do things on command while wearing mocap suits easy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i don't want to poke too many holes here in your desire for mocap cats, but it's probably pretty unrealistic. look up what is required for a persons mocap and you'll quickly see the issue"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,oh yeh save time by getting a cat of all creatures to do what you want. i can't remember the show but a famous tv show spent ages trying to get a cat to jump onto a table for a scene and it took so long they settled for just letting the cat do whatever it wanted to in the back of the shot.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"as far as i know, motion capture with humans as well, not just animals is not really a timesaving feature. it's a way to introduce human actors into the game, and have some interesting or complex, genuine movements as a base  but i've seen animators bitterly say that people have no idea how much work goes into the animation once the mocap is done. basically, mocap data is a super rough draft that doesn't have the real animation itself in it simply speaking. the animators have to rig the model properly so that the model looks natural when it does these moves, and then edit and refine every single movement by hand to get a quality result."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"mocap isn't always that helpful, it gives you loads of data that often need so much tweaking you might as well make it from scratch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"if you put a mocap suit on a cat, you're only going to get it walking like in the harness example above."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"nah, this isn't indicative of the game really, just a very poor quality video. i played through the game and only had fps drop a couple of times and it was just for a second while playing on an hdd."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it has been in development for some time
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,yeah the gameplay is basically the same the whole time so i mostly just pointed at shit after a while and stopped taking the controller from her
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"ah there's your issue, those sorts of spec calculators don't tell the whole story. i'm running it so well on an integrated gpu with no vram so it sounds like you'd be absolutely fine. what's your gpu?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"both of my cats did. we rarely did it, but if they were being naughty or had caught an animal and we were trying to remove it from their jaws, grabbing their scruff would make them freeze up. this worked throughout their lives."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,you would know that they do if your condescending ass ever had a cat lmfao why do you think vets do it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"what's probably happening is the testing site is only reading the integrated gpu in your processor the vega 8, and whatever system ram is being allocated to it for general os usage. integrated gpus share ram with the rest of the cpu when you run actual games, it switches over to use the gtx 1650, which should have 4gb."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,running around with a paperbag on your head for more than 5 minutes can be dangerous and exhausting. yes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,there's a trophy to finish it in 2 hours. i haven't finished it yet so can't tell you exactly but hope that helps
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,about 56 hours with full exploration
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i believe i started around mid to late evening and ended up going until 6am. entirely depends on what you do in game. if youre a speed runner itll take you less time. if youre a stop and sniff the flowers kind of person, then itll take you longer. i messed around a lot and didnt beeline from one quest to another, so my experience was a bit longer than others. i also grabbed the napping achievement where you have to sleep for one hour on a sleeping spot."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,all quality storytelling knows when and where to end. how much can you possibly expect for an 'endgame' while running around as a cat? this isn't an mmo.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i have never understood the every game needs to be 50 hours long mentality. i have a finite amount of time on this earth and there many game i want to play, i don't have time to sink into games that are long just say they are long. i appreciate a game that knows how to do something really well without wearing out its welcome."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,at minimum id love a dlc that gives us closure on everyone else and my little clowder.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"exactly and tbh ive been burned too many times by overenthusiastic devs. games now cost over 100 in canada. minimum wage is 15....figure it out that said i do like stray and although i pirated it, since i do in fact enjoy it i will be talking about it positively online and encourage people to try it thus being a net positive for the game even as a pirate. might even pick it up on sale in the future for a second playthrough"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we are the definition of progress. we advanced faster than other species and now run the show. life has no point if it is just a bunch of low intelligence animals running around eating each other and nothing else.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,such patient cats. that must be a fun job!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah, so many people here apparently think that thing works on adult cats..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,what a stupid thing to argue about. i am now dumber simply by reading these comments.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"heck yeah, thanks for the explanation. i've done my share of pc gaming, but have always been a console gamer. so many of the technical details with pc gaming trip me up and confuse me"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it took intel and nvidia years to get that working right. i dont have much faith in an amdnvidia hybrid pulling it off the same. tldr if you do have a hybrid setup, the game is mostly going to expect an intelnvidia stack, not amdnvidia."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,if you say so. it doesn't look like that from here though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"no, no you may not."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"yeah it is, but for some reason i was convinced that 'editor' was the right word in english here. looks like i was wrong."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,wasn't paying attention. i'm dumb lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,we are a definition of progress. we advanced faster than other species and now run the show. life has no point from the ways that i personally choose to define it if it is just a bunch of low intelligence animals running around eating each other and nothing else. tried to fix that for you anyway. life doesn't have a defined point. humans aren't marking off some cosmic checklist any faster than dinosaurs were.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"good for you, friend."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"reported for spam, you bots do this all the time. jk, i know you're just fooling around."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i know, sorry. it's the same with uncharted 4 there's a trophy to finish it in like 6 hours or something but it can be way longer than that. i just didn't want to ignore your comment!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i got it on ps and finished it today, probably wouldn't have paid full price for it. it's in league with little nightmares 12 imo"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"i was talking about aaa releases. over 100 now in canada, wild stuff yes stray is 30 which is appropriate considering how short it was. probably worth it if you have the money to throw around. i however do not. gotta look out for 1 ya dig?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,for americans but remember not everyone is american. in poland averege pay is 3 times lower so it feels like 90 to you.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,all languages except from esperanto.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"french is way easier to learn than english. we have butchered, bastardized, and stolen words from so many other languages over the centuries, that we have precious few simple rules left and our grammar and syntax are confusing to learn at best. french, on the other hand, has way fewer exceptions to the rules. the gendered nouns thing is a bit odd, but what language doesn't have a couple oddities like that?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,it doesn't even seem fun to learn at least not in school already 1 year in only thing i say is je ne parler pas franais
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,i didn't say they were good languages i said they were better than french
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"appreciate it  i'm just wondering if that 2 hours is speeding through and doing everything, or if it's skipping big sections because you know what to do. hltb will probably start having good typical playthrough timings soon."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"and so by the arbitrary definition that you have chosen, progress is spreading off of the planet? and with an arbitrary we as though the humans are a hive species in your eyes as opposed to individual accomplishments or personal meaning? there is no great purpose or quest log for reality. if that's what you see as the meaning of life, that's fine for you. it definitely wouldn't match up with my own views, but everybody having their own views is fine in so far as it doesn't harm others. just don't mistake thinking that there is a preset meaning. or that interpretation of meaning is more real than anyone else's. including various animals that existed for millions of years quite happily before our little blip of existence. ... also, leading something with you sound confused because you can't understand other people will have different values than you is something you should think about. i place no personal value on whether or not mankind leaves earth. no personal value on whether or not our species survives our own failings. none. my own views on the meaning of life have nothing to do with the future of humanity. i'm an individual, not an ant."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,"this would never run on a gameboy, no way it could render this many unique, animated sprites at once. especially at this overblown resolution"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-08,that looks great but is way to detailed for a game boy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-08,don't know if you caught it when it was making the rounds but there was a game boy demake of the first act of elden ring making the rounds a few months back.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-08,"its an animation, not a game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-08,i had no idea.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,i don't talk like this at parties i talk like this in reddit threads. the title told me this was a gameboy game which there's no way it could be. i'd contact the creator if i cared that much but the redditor who posted this didn't care enough to link anything
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,nerds made libraries where you can go read for free and learn anything you want so you can become a nerd too!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,"youre getting really overwrought about this, its done stylistically like a gameboy game. i dont believe many people thought someone actually coded a rom chip, and put it into a gameboy cartridge."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,i did link
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-07,"lol. i want to say something, but this is pretty much me too."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-10-31,"there are loads of games i blaze through in a day but they remain unforgettable experiences, length does make a game good."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-10-31,nobody cares how fast you finish the game if it's good. it's better to really enjoy a game for 10 hours than to not really enjoy a game for 15.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-10-31,"next upgrade, i'm going to make a tiny backpack for my cat and have my b12 float above it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i cried because it didn't have the ending i wanted. i want to replay it but it hurts so much lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i love it, and i have no time for people who claim it's overrated or that people only liked it because it had a cat. the world building was excellent, and i love how it seemlessly moved between gameplay styles and tones as you move from area to area. one moment you're playing an adventure game, then it's a survival horror, then it's a stealth game. it also does a great job at being a cat game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,sure did. meow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i just finished the game with my kids. we love it. a little too short maybe but a very cool game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,im not the only one who just sat there and meowed for like five minutes at first right?? right???
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,and one of the rare single player games that isn't packed with crafting mechanics and upgrade trees.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i would like a game where i just explore. i loved exploring the city and meeting the inhabitants. hated the parts where i had to outrun the xerg
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,stray is fantastic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i didn't finish it, but i liked to pan the camera close to my character cat and make it meow to mess with my real cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,ngl it's one of the prettiest games i've ever seen
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-09,is the gameplay fun? the game looks great but i'm not sure about the gameplay from the trailers i've seen.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,unfortunately it's just an innovative form of visual novel in my opinion. the game really needed deeper game mechanics where you should git gud to progress or at least could git gud to progress faster.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i was really surprised how much i enjoyed this game, and would have really liked it if it was a little longer! it was all thanks to the ps subscription though, because i don't think i would have bought it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i love how the cat participates in a worldchanging event, but it just sits there grooming itself and looks back like meh... and then just saunters away."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"loved it, but too short... it had potential for many more sidequests"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"it's an exceptionally well made game. i loved the world building, music and tone this game had. and besides the general cuteness which comes with playing as a cat, it was also such a wonderful examination of all the great things which come from having an animal companion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,his fur though was disappointing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,truly enjoyed this game myself. played through it twice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,oh i absolutely loved it! the world building and setting were so good. that ending was also so incredibly sad...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"my partner wants to love this game but it gives them mild motion sickness, any suggestions to help?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-09,i think they spent alot on the cat stuff so that's why it's ab 24 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-09,i think they spent alot on the cat stuff so that's why it's ab 24 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,for real. i wanted him to see his old crew again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i don't think it's overrated at all, but rather overpriced. the game is great for what it offers but for a game that's relatively lacking in replay value, the price tag is a bit steep."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i had so much fun in the sewers or whatever that was fighting the monsters it was so ugly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"it could be a cat or a dog or whatever, still fun to play"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,it's a great game for a weekend. or even just a friday night and saturday afternoon. it wasn't terribly long and i pushed the play well beyond what it needed appreciating the environment and finding all the collectibles. controls are smooth but the platforming holds your hand like a mofo. it was still a fun play and the story had me tear up a few times. i got really invested in the characters really fast.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,but do not pay full price for it. this is a 815 dollar game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"fuck no, 40 dollars is crazy for what it is. it was beautiful and lovely and fun. but not 40 dollars worth. ps plus was pivotal in my enjoyment of it too lol"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i got my 'sleep for 1 hour' achievement by not wanting to leave my buddy at the end. i just sat there and cried a little bit. crazy this game was able to play my heart strings so completely.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"oh, i had this problem, and after searching, found that a bunch of other people also felt motion sick playing stray. i forgot what exactly i did to go from throwing up to being able to complete the game, but i remember turning off the motion blur setting, reducing controller sensitivity and wearing my antimotion sickness wristbands. there are other threads and steam community discussions with better solutions, try googling for them, should be better than my vague recollections."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,fuel for potential sequel. i also would like to see more of.. the eyes. you know the ones im talkin about.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,who is him? the cat or the professor?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"how did they fuck that up? the game isn't that long, i hadn't forgotten that my goal was to find them. everytime we lost a friend i tried to remember it was getting me closer to my pack. the ending really fucked me up."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i played it for free and loved it, but honestly it's 14 hours long and outside of the max payne time trial achievement you can get everything else on the first pass. i'd say wait for it to go on sale for 8 bucks. but 40 is without question an insane price for what it is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i thought it was overpriced at first. then i started making my own game, now nothing is overpriced. that shits hard and takes so much time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i bought it full price. i am a poor eastern european gamer. played it out once. don't mind a cent i spent on it. loved it all from beginning to end. cannot name another game that was similarly enjoyable. worth every cent
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,20?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"it would still be fun to play, but i think it's important that the way you traverse that world only makes sense if you're a cat. dogs don't jump up on railings and rooftops or through small gaps in windows the way the cat in stray does"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"yeah i even thought that after getting the platinum, it was too short and i'm glad i didn't purchase it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i also lay down for a while with my buddy and sat thinking about its passing. it got me. wonderful game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,omg! i did the same thing! i just couldn't go on...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"oh those are some great tips, thanks! i'll try checking out steam community discussions as well, glad we weren't the only ones with the issue"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,not sure if it's just hype or not but annapurna showed a teaser today for their showcase coming later this month and it showed stray a few times. i'm hoping for a sequel or some other additional content to be announced.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i did love their world. maybe for a little annoyed with the fetch quests but they were so overtly fetchy it felt charming in its own way
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,the cat you play as who was separated from his crew in the beginning.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,they didn't fuck anything up
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"i played this game with my two year old daughter, when the cat fell off the sewer grate she cried im a dumbass bc the cat fell and i go oh nooooo!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"while as a consumer i'd always want the price to be less, i appreciate stray for what it was. the game had a great story with characters i cared about in a world that was unique and cool. i would have loved for it to be longer and play more of course but i'm also glad that it wasn't riddled with microtransactions or other fluff to pad out the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,it was 30 on release if i recall correctly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,true. im not a cat person. but i am a dog person. and if a dog is on a railsomething has went wrong.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i still haven't got the platinum. i hate those max payne complete the game in one hour challenges. well done you!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"it was funny cause although the story and that scene at that moment made me sad, the image of the cat sadly curled up next to him is what had me bawling."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i just saw that too and thought what a coincidence. i hope that does mean theres a sequel in the works.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,here you go httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vteoeczzqhbo i hope that make you happy
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"yeah, they are be together after the end. there is a good video about this. where the heck is kitty cat after the ending not the real title. nice analytic about how far the cutie traveled and how far she still have to go spoiler a few 100 meters"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,you're wrong.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,little steep. id love to play a sequel tho.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,"it wasn't too bad tbh, i just used my trusty notebook to write out a progress route and did it first try. the hardest trophy was doing the no hit run on the chase sequence, that took a fair few attempts!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i got that one first try. wasn't aware it was a trophy til it popped. lucked out i suppose. maybe one day i'll go back and tackle it. maybe look up a strat cause i can't be arsed to play it a second time just to chart the course.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-08,i literally played it just for the platinum  went on a crazy splurge when i got my ps5 and did like 29 platinums in a year
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-06-09,the timing on that achievement is very generous. as long as you remember how to do all the necessary puzzles you're unlikely to have any problems hitting it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,meow meow meow! nothing feels better than the inside of a cat!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,hey man don't diss 3d world. it's great.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"i'm waiting for the physical edition, won't be here until september... whew."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,mom can we have stray? no we have stray at home. stray at home
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,the stray you have at home is pricier.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,im pretty sure theyre referring to the cartoonish look of cat mario vs the more realistic look of the cat protagonist in stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,l it would easily be game of the year if elden ring didn't exist x200b i'm convinced people that don't like stray dont like it because its a fairly laid back game and yall cant go 30 seconds without getting bored lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"yeah, it's pretty boring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,a free mario game? where?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,only if you have ps extra
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,its not free. i pay every month for access to those games. its included with a psplus  extra subscription is what you meant to say.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,i'd like to put this out there it wasn't an actual nintendo tweet
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,uh... what
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"what stray does can be accomplished by perhaps any form of media from books to film. i don't see why it had to be a video game. it's simply not what i want out of a game, you're correct. the game really does make me bored. that is why it is fundamentally not a good game. impeccable story, bad game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,its free. i had to pay 12 to go to extra and stray is 30 i think? or just go with a month and the game is still free for the price
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"some of the most popular games to ever exist are popular because of their stories and in my opinion could've probably been a movie instead of a game. x200b the walking dead? that's basically just a movie the last of us? again, literally just an interactive movie red dead redemption 2? just a cowboy movie. every visual novel to ever exist? they could've just made that a movie. x200b yes the game may not have much interactivity but if you made it a movie or a tv show it will lose all the puzzles, all the exploration, and all the little bits of world building you get when exploring while playing. for me, stray would be a 510 movie but because it's a video game it's easily a 910. i liked how i could meow whenever i want, i liked how i could scratch things whenever i want, i liked how i could talk to whoever i want, i like how i could find collectables to get more worldbuilding and story information. none of these things would be there if it was just a movie or tv show."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,im quite certain you dont know the definition of the word free.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"ah yes, free for the price"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,its included with a subscription. i dont say i watch movies for free because i pay for a netflix subscription.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"no, it was a shane dawson tweet."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"because you pay netflix to watch movies. no one buys ps plus because they want to play game xy that hasnt released yet in the future for discount. you pay for online. if you go for extra then its 40 more a year. you pay 40 more for the current catalogue of games and not for future ones. this means everyone who could play stray for free already had extra, meaning they didnt intentionally pay for playing this game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-16,theres no going back now

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"its basically a remade pokemon yellow, except with some changes never seen in pokemon before, such as manual poke ball throwing, which is hit or miss, and actual pokemon roaming around rather than hiding in grass. its easier than past games. if you're a pokemon fan, especially one who is a fan of the old gens, you'll probably love it. if not, its still one of the best games on the switch right now so you might as well get it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"honestly, it really is. way more than i expected it to be i might add"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,it's a desperate cash grab to push pokemon go by stripping out a bunch of content from pokemon yellow...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"after playing it for 3 hours, and originally owning red when i was 5, it's great. some people don't like how you catch wild pokemon, but attacking them down to low hp was a terrible mechanic. many reloads in the past were made to attempt to recatch pokemon that were killed. the map is the same, but in beautiful 3d. not 3ds 3d, but really polished console 3d. i'm having a really great time with it. i heard there's a mode after you beat the game with 150 different trainers, each with one of the original 150 pokemon at lvl 70 to beat. imo, pokemon has gotten way more complicated in the latest installments, and this game sort of bridges a gap between pokemon go and pokemon yellow. i've only beaten the first gym, but i hope this isn't the end of this series."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"you can't nuzlock it, which is the most fun way to play pokemon. on the other hand, eevee is an overpowered bastard in this edition, you can't evolve himher but you get access to 8 unique moves from each evolution, meaning you've got ridiculous type coverage all in one pokemon. so somehow eevee is legitimately an ou pokemon without z  move baton pass."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"to be objective, those brand new features aren't exactly something i'd drop 60 dollars for alone. if you're expecting it to play like any other pokemon game it should also be noted that the game was made to emulate pokemon go's mechanics. that is to say that the mechanics of encountering wild pokemon are heavily watered down from standard pokemon games, which is a nice way of saying that there aren't any wild pokemon battles at all in it. you simply encounter them, and throw a ball or run away. no danger, little challenge. there are still trainer and gym battles."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,never seen in the main games. both those changes sound like the mobile game adapted to the switch.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"hit or miss, huh?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,does this game use pokemon go any?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,wtf! i may buy a switch just for this lol. my main gripe with the new games is i have to keep learning new pokemon and the odd types they continue to add.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"hms are no longer a thing ever since gen 7 thank arceus. your starter pikachu or eevee will learn secret techniques that do the same thing, but don't take a move slot. you'll also be glad to know that while pikachu can't learn surf, it learns a move called splishy splash ugh which is exactly the same as surf, but also has a chance to paralyze, since it electrifies the water. the animation's even got the surf board. it also learns a flyequivalent that involves balloons."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"pikachu and eevee are overpowered. you also get xp from catching pokemon. i wouldn't say it's that much easier than previous games though, it's much easier than red and blue, but similar to xy in difficulty."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"yes, it's mechanics are based off of go. you can even send your pokemon in go to your switch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"ummmmmmmmm... assuming this is a serious question? kinda? like if you let them run around for a while, throwing pokeballs at everything, they could sorta have fun. but beyond that, this is still pokemon, and an rpg, for all the casualfriendly simplifications that have happened. and they're going to run out of pokeballs eventually."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"it's rated e for everyone, but i'd say anyone under 5 is going to need some guidance. there are many options within options and i found it a bit confusing at first. you can access your pokemon party from two different menus and you can move pokemon within your party, or just within your pokemon bag itself. also there's new candies that you get from scraping your pokemon, but this has replaced older items. it'll definitely be a learn together experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,can't evolve pikachu either
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"its base stats are higher, and it learns a 90 base power attack for every type of each of its evolutions, and all of them have guaranteed secondary effects. the fire one is a 90 bp willowisp, the electric is 90 bp thunder wave, water is 90 bp watertype giga drain, psychic is 90 bp reflect, dark is 90 bp light screen, grass is 90 bp leech seed, ice is 90 bp haze, and fairy is 90 bp heal bell. it can be taught these moves from tutors however many times you want. it can't evolve, but it's op as fuck."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-18,"it would be more like a fable. all these situations where they could use psychic powers to make their lives better, and they don't because they have better, more responsible ways of dealing with it."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"oh common it has some great ones. zigzagoon is a less annoying ratata, hoothoot is an early psychic, spinarak is a great bug type, the addition of baby pokemon, it was a great generation."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"eh, i liked the dark knight. the art was irritating, but i liked the story. 75 year old batman having to go all out because the worlds gone to shit cause reagan outlawed heroes and has superman, for whatever reason, basically blowing him."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,why did you edit it? that was great!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,kevin does.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,i'll agree with you that the best of gen2 is in the commons.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"i don't actually mind the loss of held items to be perfectly honest, but the lack of abilities is something i really don't agree with. and i don't get why they'd completely remove those and weather, yet leave in natures, ivs, and stealth rock."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"i wouldn't personally shell out the full price, but seeing as how its nintendo, that will never drop. side note, personally i dont know the storyline of the game, so that's a big question for me."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,i knew what this was before even clicking it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,lmao first time seeing this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,are you coming onto me?!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"yeah, games have lots of pokdex entries about pokmon hunting and eating other pokmon in any case. also one book about the right way for people to dispose of the bones after eating a fish pokmon. mmmm, goldeen fillet..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"true, i thought about that right after i posted my comment. though i doubt its ever happened during a battle. trainer arbok use bite! and swallow! other trainer wait what? oh god no! not pikachu!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"i used too but the older i get the more ridiculous it all is, from superman blowing reagan ignoring that most of the big name dc comics of the time took the piss on him more often than not including superman one of the earliest incidents of batman actually 'winning' a fight against superman and miller had superman act brain dead half the time, to make it even remotely plausible, and the shades of crazy steve and edgy batman that are seen throughout it all. part of it is definitely me projecting future works and trends onto it, but even beyond the art the story very much breaks my sod on several occasions. and as much as i dislike bruce timm i really enjoy batman beyond and i both enjoyed the concept and most of the execution of it. that said while edgy batman seems to be slowly phasing out finally it did give us some great stories and interesting characters. his daredevil work still holds up really well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,this guy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"karen, too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,it's like gen 2 all over again.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,because the game in and of itself is supposed to bridge pokemon go with the console games to which held items and abilities aren't present in the smartphone game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,it looks like the original yellow but there could be some slight changes to the story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,too late.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"ill miss edgy batman, but i am enjoying the more calculating, reserves batman ive seen more of. i know batman has always been that way, but it seems more emphasized maybe? any way, point is, i like what theyre doing. and i loved batman beyond, although young hormonal me enjoyed it for reasons beyond the stories. lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2018-11-17,"at least gen 2 had weather. i'd rather them remove natures than that. ivs are annoying enough to get without breeding, natures just make it even more of a dice roll."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"the environments were gorgeous, but unless you get a lot of joy from cat does cat things you basically play the entire game after like 30 minutes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"art is gorgeous, atmosphere is perfect, backgroundlore are interesting. that's it. that's all this game has."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,eh it's a fun sorta game for a while then it's really the same thing over and over. i'm glad it wasn't too long because it got dull less than half way through.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,stray is gorgeous!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"the art might be good, but the gameplay and the story aren't that good. it just had a huge publicity budget"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,adore this game and have played it through several times it is short.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,these screenshots basically give you the entire game experience. it's a pretty game but it's incredibly shallow and quick with basically zero replay ability.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-08,this game reminded me of journey or abzu in that i really didnt feel like i had a purpose. there is a little information about the game world and thats it and you just progress through the environment. no real challenges etc. i guess i dont like these games for the same reasons i dont like art museums either.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,stray was a piece of art.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"the game is indeed very pretty, it's a shame that my pc fies if i try to run it at 100 resolution... had to resort to 70 for it to run smoothly. still a very pleasant game to play, graphics and gameplay wise"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,if it goes on sale for like 15 bucks i would be down to play it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,loved it but unfortunately the game was too short!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"honestly, as much as i loved the cat the gameplay loop was just kinda okay and a bit short for what i paid."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,waiting for it to come to switch
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i wish i could play it but unfortunately this is yet another game sony paid to keep from xbox. the abk deal needs to go through and all sony's shitty practices need to be made public to teach jim ryan and anyone else who thinks that's the best way to do business a huge lesson.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,meh game with meh graphics carried by the fact it had a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"there's no challenge in this game, just watch a youtube playthru"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,you're a cat who can't jump. i won't play it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"best game of 2022 by a mile, imo! edit wah oh! a different opinion! downvote it!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,some people don't like it because of the simple controls and short story but...i really enjoyed it a lot. it's more a chillvibe game and boy did they nail the atmosphere. i could stroll the cities all day without doing much of anything. perhaps the simple controls is what reached out to a wider audience. i platinumed it a long time ago but i still think about it alot. may revisit soon.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"i dislike cats and i'm horrifyingly allergic to them but this game is a pleasure! i love the lore and environments and wish there was more, maybe a sequel or something, perhaps a prequel?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"i expected more when they introduced the weapon, but it really just turned out to be a platformer"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i don't know how you missed all the memes and posts when this first came out.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,is there like missions to this game? or are you really just a stray cat walking around? no disrespect if you like it. just curious.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i cracked it and was halfway trough.. then i had to formate my pc and my files got lost. buying it is too expensive now and cracking it again and playing to the same point kinda a drag. but its a very unique and beautiful game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,it was very fun game and i liked story. i was entertained whole time.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"i recommend playing it with cats around, it's truly wonderfuller!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"i played it with my 6 yr old, was a wonderful experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,if someone has played somerville and limbo it's for them as it's just the same except it is being made for mainstream as well as the budget was bigger
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,the lighting and the details it is a game i never seen before
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-08,love the environment modelling and the ambient soundtrack is fantastic
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-08,"out of all the hold up on the left stick to watch the game play itself for you games i've played, this was certainly one of them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"glad to hear that. i avoided it because i hate cats but everyone says its like some great revolutionary thing. but, since i dont like cars, it looked very boring. pretty, but boring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"its basically a press a over and over again, if it wasnt for the cat i don't think the game would be praised."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,yes but! you cant charge 30 dollars for a 4 hour game. thats just ridiculous
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,developing the proper length of a game is important and i think the devs did a pretty good job at that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,tell me you didn't play it without telling me you didn't play it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"it took me 8 hours to complete because i wanted 100 completion, but yeah, it was short. at least, it had a wonderful ending, even though it was simple."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,this game really feels like it was made for switch! but sony is gonna sony
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,somebody can't handle the truth. it's a fact that sony have been using the same shitty methods since day 1. it's why sega failed. sony don't like competition. they want to destroy everyone and they don't care how they do it all so they can say they are 1. their objection to the abk deal has nothing to do with cod and everything to do with not letting ms have anything. 1st party deal are one thing but paying a 3rd party to not release a game on a rival system is another.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,stray looked good but yea it was boring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,its okay we all have terrible takes every now and then
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,agreed. i'll happily take a unique game like this over dark souls 12 any day.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-08,"for real. if your entire concept falls apart because of a playable characters appearance, then you didn't make a good game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,why not? you'd get less time buying a movie on blueray for your money. i think it sold well so clearly enough people felt the value was good.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i 100 it. it took like 810 hours. it was a pretty game but it was easy and straight forward and only had enough content to knock it out in a couple evenings.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i also got about 8 hours but i didn't come close to 100 i was just soaking in the atmosphere. the vibes in this game are impeccable.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"actually if you didn't play as a cat, the game would be the exact same minus playing as a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"no it wouldn't lol, you could be in a miniaturizing suit and nothing would change. the only cat thing was the meow button."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"i dont hate the game or the idea. just the pricegameplay ratio. i feel like games are way too expensive for what you get sometimes, now more than ever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"what a stupid thing to say when the majority of you idiots are paying 70 for incomplete, broken fix it later ingame stores anymore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i dont pay for or watch movies
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,ah so you didn't actually play it. you just treated it like an achievement hunt. that's not real playing. that's just checking boxes.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i think if you swapped out the cat for super mario it'd actually be more fun.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"if you consider the amount of development needed to accurately model a cats movement, which really hasn't been done to this degree before, it's worth the price. it's also important to recognize when people take a risk on a new concept. yes it was short and the replayability is fairly low. what they produced was really refreshing from a gameplay perspective and it was executed very well."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,yea 4 hours should be 20 bucks and 10 on sale. if its on sale i would buy it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,ok but that doesn't really make a difference to my point.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,wut? no i played it and there was so little actual content that it was trivial to 100 it naturally in a very short period of time. if you enjoyed it i'm not taking that away from you. that's all that really matters. i'm just sharing my opinion based on my experience. you're welcome to add your own separate reply sharing your opinion and experience... you won't see me replying to it arguing with you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"hey, if people like it, buy it. i personally dont think its worth supporting for 30 dollars"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,"thats how i feel. i dont think every game should have boring garbage filler like ubisoft games nowadays do, but having a handful of interesting side quests and secrets that adds maybe another 10 hours of content is key if you want 30 dollars for your game. at least in my eyes"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,it does. my point i made was i myself dont see the value in this game being so short and 30 dollars. i also dont watch movies so your point doesnt work for me either i understand what youre saying though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,that's fair. i rarely buy games on release i'll wait for a sale and depending on my backlog i may end up waiting a year or two.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,thats why i like games like the order 1886.. the only game i finished without touching any other game. nowdays games are 100 hours and you dont remember even 10 of what happened in the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,that's not how you phrased it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i never actually played that game. i missed a lot of games. been stuck on siege mostly for the last 7 years
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i did in other comments
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,oh i cant stuck to one game mentally cause i got no patience.. i jump from one to another
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-07,i rage after 1 game and quit for 2 weeks xd

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's a small game, but very polished. like the original portal in terms of tone. postapocalyptic, funny, and cat."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"7 years should be long enough to understand that's how it works. when an anticipated gamemovieshow comes out, that's going to be what you see for a couple days. it's fine."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"it's good if you like cats and great if you love cats. most of the charm comes from the fact that you are a cat. but it's the definition of a casual game and that's not a bad thing. it's just a fun little journey and a cool little world to get immersed in for a bit. if you're hoping for something even slightly challenging, you will be disappointed. 8.510 for me as someone who loves cats but i'm about two thirds through."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"as long as your expectations aren't super longsuper deep it is well worth it. especially if you like cats, robots, and postapocalyptic stuff."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"story game, some decent but not too complex puzzling, a small amount of action. if that seems to be your jam, then the package is excellent. wonderfully animated cat just ... being a cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"fun game, well made, extremely extremely extremely short which is why im glad i got it free via ps. beat it like 4 hours later"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,its only 30 so its fucking excellent in my book. very happy.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,"but it doesn't have to be. as an example to explain my fatigue i'll use fall guys. fall guys was a huge hit when it came out and rgaming was flooded with posts on it. but here's the thing. the posts made were showcasing gameplay highlights of people goofing off, finally winning, losing embarrassingly, etc. in other words, things that are actually content and can be the basis of discussion. all of these posts are basically i bought game with the addition of an animal being on screen. there is no discussion to be had. no real content. this is a deluge that amounts to nothing g and is not what rgaming should be. rgaming deserves better than to be a free advertisement space."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-20,neat. might look into it

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,thats great and all but it has a name. the game is called stray not the cat game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,pretty sure this is the cover for warrior cats into the wild
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,this is a lovely piece of art. anyone can render a cat. but only a talented and skillful artist could render a cat that has some sort of smug and charming facial expression indicators such as this. great work!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,wow thats really really good

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,pretty sure the devs created bots to flood reddit with screenshots and fake posts to praise the game. its just a fucking cat but somehow its on all reddit smh

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its a charming world and story but its more of a interactive movie than a game. very linear and very short
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it's a highly novel concept with great art direction and abysmally mediocre gameplay.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its neither. reddit is just obsessed with cats. toxoplasmosis makes you weird.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"seriously. ive seen like 2030 posts about this game in the past week and its not even a aaa title. smells like an aggressive marketing campaign masquerading as user content. im starting to wonder if this is an experiment by the reddit admins to sell a new form of viral advertising. if this turns out to be the case, im going to have to unsubscribe from all subs targeted by this kind of insidious marketing content."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i'm a cat owner. i have two. this game is shallow and boring though. the only reason it's receiving so much attention is because cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i would have liked it more if it was a free roaming platformer instead of being on rails
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"what parkour? you are on rails, not even allowed to jump on your own."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i did a cosplay for halloween as vault 101 lone wanderer with my german shepherd wearing the goggles and red bandana to be dogmeat. needless to say i would welcome a spinoff prequel

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,having a radical allornothing way of thought is one of the subreddit rules though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,where bad partners in toxic relationships share life advice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"i remember one time on that sub, a woman was saying her husband was being sneaky and secretly texting people and she didn't know what to do. all the comments convinced her he was cheating and to start filing for divorce immediately and don't even tell him. she updated it the next day saying she confronted him against people's wishes. her birthday was in a couple weeks and he was texting everyone to throw her a surprise party. i don't know if the story was true or if they were trolling but either way it showed how crazy that subreddit is and how they immediately jump to get a divorce. it's like they're all miserable and want everyone else to be too."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it has been banned our prayers have been answered
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"jasoninhell, right? also a ton of subreddits like infedelity or deadbedrooms may make your spouse look better but holy fuck will they depress you."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"divorce your wife, delete the lawyer, hit the gym? is that how it is meant to be correctly?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"you were. in 5 years if someone finds the thread, they'd most likely have no idea what game it is meant to be."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"it's the way of social media in general. if there are two opinions, x and y, the hivemind will upvote one and downvote the other. in actuality the most rational approach will be a nuanced blend of x and y. but present that blended opinion and you will absolutely be downvoted. social media breeds extremism and destroys nuance imo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,its like asking the crystal meth subreddit for food recommendations
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,it wasnt banned. just privated. my other account is subbed and still has access

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,thats not true at all. you answered your own question. you can only jump on valid surfaces.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-03-20,the game wouldn't have been that good without the help of the cats' motion capture. credit where it's due!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,you got the action figure! is that a limited edition thing?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i keep telling people that pets want to join people in the gaming world. they see that we are very interested and involved in something  and they know we are interacting somehow, but they can't figure out how to get into the action. game systems need a pawpad for dogscats to touch that will do something on the screen  allow them to kill birds or rats in horror games, or maybe make stuff appear and runfly across the screen for the human players to shoot. i'm certain pets could understand some simple interactions. these should just be bonus animations and not essential in any way to the main game. so when you pet bores of pawing the pawpad and walks away, your game is not affected at all  but they can still join in at any time. after 50 years of video games it's ludicrous that pets are not part of it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"as they say, representation is important."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,nice
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,i find this so amusing. it's so cute seeing all the catowners posting picturesvideos of their cats reacting to stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i heard the cats from stray were originally based on the characters from the musical cats. glad they stuck with the stray rendition when they made them a real thing
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,omg!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,merch department is on point with that!! so lifelike!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,indeed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,my cat was sitting on my desk watching while the cat in the game was sitting on a robot's desk watching them type.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,a popular new game on a gaming sub? probably. if it was a bunch of super mario 3 screenshots that would be weird.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,youll never be able to escape the cat game. itll chase you to the ends of the earth
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,itll be heavily saturated for weeks then well get a few a month for the rest of our lives.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"game's only like 5 or 6 hours long, plus its very linear so i don't see a lot of replayability.. i imagine the hype will die off quick that said i fuckin loved it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,cat see cat. give upvote.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i am really convinced someone at blue12 said, we need to make a game that will go viral on reddit."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,yes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"a new video game that people enjoy playing might show up again in a video gaming sub, yes. that is certainly possible."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,yep. but thankfully its a short game and the parrots will move onto the next big thing soon.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"in all seriousness, if you ever really wanna watch tv with your cat, i actually will sometimes put these kinds of videos on for them httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vfbcaojas9d4 at first, i was a little worried they'd attack my screen, but they seem to realize they're not real but still are interested in it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"thats awesome, i really hope that sub grows"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"they have tablet and iphone games for cats. i think the primary problem with getting pets into gaming is that the reward is very cerebral for humans, often demanding we reward ourselves with our imaginations escapism, or numeric satisfaction scoring. animals are far more present in the world than we are."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,if only the beta fish playing pokemon games understood what was going on
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,im on it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,this might be the worst idea i have ever seen.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,its just the first thing popped in my head ashen i posted lol.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,adorable!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"the novelty of being a cat wore off for me.. at first it really felt cat like. you were behaving like a cat. then when you got into the city you started doing human stuff, understanding englishwhatever the language they use. youre plugging power into sockets, entering keycodes, etc. the cat behavior is mostly gone past some novelty interactions like scratching sofas and walls."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it's rather enjoyable as a short experience. like 510 hours.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,thats the better choice.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,you just have to wear those special glasses and then you can feel the fluffiness.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i had one that would bat at the computer screen when i used a mount with wings in wow. i wonder what they think of all that?!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,yeah it came out yesterday.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,deductive reasoning in action.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"yeah, game just came out so there's a large collection of easy karma posts and guerilla marketing"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,thats exactly what you have to do.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,do it!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i wouldnt say so. its dark but not scary.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"personally it missed the mark for me. the starting 30 minutes was really strong. a lot of environmental storytelling and cues and good use of objects to tell the story. then after that the game just became a repetitive walking sim where dialog and story was shoved down your throat through npc speech bubbles and there was just so much fetch quests. here, you need this item, but i want you to get this item first. so talk to that npc and she will tell you to get another item so she will give you this item. the art direction looks great, but the grandeur of exploration falls flat when you are forced to backtrack so much and the environments just become a chore. also, the ending was rather... unsatisfying?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,im enjoying it thoroughly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,they really pop and come to life!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-22,"wrong, all of it was just based on cats from the stray light novels from 2005"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,dangly any such game would likely be a completely obscure hidden gem underrated gem hidden dark souls game theory indie gem
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"posting things from a new game is fine, but it is very unoriginal for a 100th person to post a pic of their cat watching the game."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i thoroughly enjoyed it, except for one particular trophy. its not what i expected when i first heard of a cyberpunk cat game but at least i got it as part of ps."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it's a nice break from eldernring
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it's just an aggressive ad campaign for reddit. same shit they did for that goose game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,my cat does not have the brain capacity yours does. after 8 years of his silly little life he still tries to attack the screen.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"yes, but i should think pet owners would like having their pets involved in some way, even if they can't count like a horse or multiply like rabbits. people cite the smarts of dolphins and pigs all day and night but won't give cats and dogs a chance?"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,more like 3

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,if you guys ever want to hear non stop complaining you should really check out gaming sub reddits! some say if you hold a controller up to your ear you can faintly hear a man child complaining about some triviality.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,usually most posts from a new game aren't original
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i agree, i just felt like this picture was on point as my cat was looking in the same direction as in game and it just felt special in that moment."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,god forbid an unoriginal post on rgaming. that has never happened before!

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,it will end once the marketing contract is up.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,what if someone liked their hobby so much that they wanted a place to talk about it? what if that someone found a game they liked and wanted to share it with this community. people see the post and then share their own experiences with that game they liked? how can this forum be soo damn jaded it cant have a simple post without someone thinking its some corp viral campaign bullshit? people are playing this game and sharing their funny stories about it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,lol... you posted that and we both got downvoted immediately. something tells me there is truth to it... but also reddit loves cats by default.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"i am a human being,. not a bot, that disagrees with you both and think you're both missing the most obvious shit on the planet right now.  the game is reviewing extremely well. overwhelmingly positive on steam and a high metacritic score.  people love cats  people in rgaming love video games. ergo, people are talking about a very good video game about cats. it doesn't require a conspiracy theory for a few people to post content about it. maybe it's just a new good video game that people want to talk about...? ah, but i guess i got checkmated. cause uwhiskeyabuse knows ads when he sees them! thank god for him."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i know ads when i see em
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"lol ive been called an ad twice for this post now because i played a video game, my cat did something cute, and i shared a photo of it. man, redditors crack me up sometimes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,also if a lot of people like something then suddenly it's a circle jerk and that means we have to dislike it apparently.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,i literally said reddit loves cats by default and then you tell me people love cats your thinking i am the one missing something obvious?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"as much as i love god of war , elden ring just feels like more of a video game ...ya know?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,i honestly cant understand why people are so obsessed over a title and an award. honestly it means nothing yeah the company get more pr maybe some more sale. but honestly i think allot of games i played been fracking awesome and the year is not really over yet. and i hope warhammer 40k darktide will be epic as well.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"the cancer i got reading the comments, makes me wonder if gamers were always nonsensical or this is just a byproduct of antisocial media"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"stray, it is the cute cat game after all"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,if elden ring wasn't on there it would be a hard choice. but elden ring is just a masterpiece.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,i would vote for stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,its god of war for sure. it had a better story than any other game on the list.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,requiem
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"i feel like elden ring, regardless of your love or hate for other souls games, had a huge amount of content, was accessible to people new to the genre, had good a good look, good delivery of lore, and was a pretty excellent experience. i like stray, too, but it wasn't nearly the same feat as elden ring was."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"horizon forbidden west for me. haven't played elden ring because i've never played any of souls games did play jedi fallen order tho. i'm waiting for a decent discount on gow ragnarok because i'm not a huge fan of nordic mythology and i didn't like resource management , valkyrie bosses and way too many currencies in the 2018 game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,bloodborne is better than elden ring in every way. why people are getting crazy about it?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"elden ring, it has to be. other games are great but elden ring is a masterpiece."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"my vote is for elden ring. also i see that club penguin bookmark up there, respect!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,it has to be elden ring i think. i have never played such a masterpiece before
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,goty belongs to gow or er in my humble opinion.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,elden ring is the best gaming experience i've had in over 10 years easily. i haven't even started ragnarok yet though should be good! the fact that anyone here says stray is better then these is just a full blown troll in work lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"i think gow would win on brand name alone, but er did get a lot more media recognition and better reviews. really tough choice. horizon, xenoblade and plague tale have 0 chance of winning, and i could see them giving it to stray as some bizarre move to shake twitter up or something."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,how a plague tale made it on there i have no idea so uninspiring. horrible character development. garbage thrown together story. and glitchy as all hell.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"the impact and staying power that elden ring had was something you see come around very rarely. this game was nonstop in the media for months. if anything, that shows you how great of a game it is"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"anyone who picks stray as goty should be forced, by law, to never complain about an empty and boring game again for the rest of their lives"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,then don't vote.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,god of war
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-08,"i just finish god of war and honestly struggle with how one can really choose between elden ring and gowr. both are excellent. god of war r. is the among the best of what i have seen in term of story telling and punch out style combat. elden ring is the best open world i have played. ers story is also skillfully told  from the perspective of the tarnished warrior that is your avatar. its so cool. in any other year, these games being separated would likely be the goty. if i had to choose, however, it would be elden ring. both have excellent writing, music, and gameplay. but elden ring has more of it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,i liked it and i hope it will a few awards. but not goty obviosly. belongs to gow or er 100.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"honestly.. at this point i feel like they should just give the award to stray. this whole god of war vs elden ring war has been silly for too long. let's shut both camps up, lowkey troll them and reunite gamers through cute kitteh game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"to me it has to be elden ring, none are bad choices but there is so many things that can be done with elden ring . the world is actually pretty empty comparatively speaking. i thought skyrim was the best i'd ever played and it still is, but if elden ring ever had a story i gave a damn about or was organized in any way, it would be the best game i've ever played"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"yeah, a video game from years ago maybe... gow is what modern gaming can be, er is everything bad about gaming that should have been forgotten a long time ago."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,cancer? ah of course the drama queen diagnosis i get it now.  should get that looked at bud
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"is it? seems like a lot of people see it with rose colored glasses on. what exactly makes it a masterpiece? i can name at least 6 other open world games with better stories and pacing. the combat is insanely great unless we're talking about pvp meta. other than that, i can't really think of what makes it so much better than some of these other games, a few of which also have pretty fantastic combat and gameplay in general, not to mention more coherent stories and lore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"elden ring fans are downvoting you, although they know that you a right lol er barely has a story at all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"disagree on the lore delivery part. as a player with over 250 hours on it and have played through souls 13, er out of those four games is the least logical and least coherent when it comes to it's lorestory. as far as content goes, forbidden west objectively has more. more to do, more to see. much of elden ring's map itself is very empty compared to a lot of other open world games despite how good it all looks. if elden ring or gow win, it will be by popularity. most of the people in rgaming never even bothered to play stray or forbidden west, and even fewer gave a singular thought about xc3."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"elden ring is worth your time, but don't go into it expecting a decent story. however, the combat is fun and satisfying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,as much as i agree with you elden ring was the first fromsoft game that got massive hype in the mainstream in my opinion
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"in my opinion, elden ring is better than bloodborne in every way. wanna know the difference in those who share your opinions and those who share mine? those who like elden ring dont go around acting confused why everyone loves bloodborne. elden ring fans love bloodborne, bloodborne fans hate elden ring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,meh to me bloodborn is like the dark sheep that people like becuse its cool. after finishing bloodborn i was just mostly bored and sad on how damn easy all the bosses where. but thats my personal opinion.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"people keep calling it a masterpiece, but i'm failing to see why. the storylore is barely coherent, and the combat is what drew my attention the most, because it's excellent. i can't really think of what makes it goty over all these other games, most of which have really good writing and a couple even look just as good if not better than elden ring graphicswise."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,tell us you never even played it without telling us.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"you must not play very many games, then. elden ring hardly does anything new. it's a good game, but what makes it a masterpiece?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,0 chance of winning??? the gameplay and writing in forbidden west was top notch. i'm guessing you never even played it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"media hype does not automatically  good, though. with over 250 hours in er, i fail to see what exactly makes it goty worthy over certain others, especially when those others feature more engaging writing and lore."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,i'd pick any game on this list over stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,careful or all the gow and elden ring fans will get mad at you.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,not to mention er is going to be getting dlc at some point
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"elden ring fanboys will tell you the game has the best lore and story of any game for the last decade and that you're just dumb for not liking or understanding it. it's honestly kind of insane the hoops people will jump through for the godawful writing it had, george r.r martin's involvement be damned."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,you're a primo cornball
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"made my case, bud"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,elden ring is going to win by a landslide and folks who just don't understand why are going to have a very hard time next month. there's no rose tinted shades here. elden ring set the bar in video games and folks are just gonna have to get used to it. no one will be comparing god of war or horizon to future games in terms of how much content is in the actual game. er did that and there's no competition for the foreseeable future.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,ds2 would like to talk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,pretty sure the og demon souls is still the worst souls game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-18,"thank you. i think elden ring is a good game, but it isn't god of war ragnorak. it doesn't have the character depth, the story, or the emotional beats of god of war. the two games are pretty equivalent as far as the quality of their action and gameplay. we you list all the things that make each game special god of war is checking off more boxes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"most er fans on reddit can't tell you what makes er so much better than any of these other games, a majority of which have very engaging and coherent writing. er is a great game. goty though? i don't see it. it's just good because it is and anyone who disagrees gets down voted to oblivion and insulted. it's actually a little sad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"hype does not automatically  good, though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-16,"this popped up in the community as soon as elden ring hit the mainstream hype wave. a lot of souls veterans, and such seem to be nitpicking elden ring really hard to maintain their 'favourite' as the best. this is in no way a criticism of people who just prefer bloodborne, but there was a lot of soulsborne fans who wanted to hate er, right from the word go."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,''easy bosses'' ?!? have you played the old hunters? bloodborne literally has the hardest and creative bosses among all of the soulslike games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,ive heard the same from others soulsaddicts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,tell us you're 14 without telling us
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"indeed i never played it never liked the first one but my opinion is not based on the quality of the game but on its popularity and that of its competitors. it could be a good game, but it's been barely discussed whereas er and gow have been in everyone's mouths for months. yes i am aware gow came out last week, i mean people were talking about it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"i was talking more about the hype within the gaming community itself, rather than the media hype and media outlets talking about it. i also just think it evolves the genre and type of games fromsoft have been making. i can't really say the same thing about horizon  ragnarok"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"that's what i mean. there is so much potential there that's it's like this game is just the template, there are a few issues with it that have to do with controls that could be streamlined a bit. or just give us console players the same freedom the pc players have with button assignments and i'd be happy. but for muliplayer, imagine staged tournaments where the winner is an elden lord , he gets to be crazy powerful until a group kills him. and single player, imagine building a shelter or it's just so many possibilities"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"yeah, i read in an interview he did after he had done the talk shows to promote ellden ring where he said they didn't use very much of what he wrote. i get the whole make it what you want sorta thing, and it's a great game either way , i just like a little more straightforward story as opposed to learning it through the game, it's all good though , still love the game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-16,"i won't defend it blindly as i'm fully aware how obtuse the narrative in the game can be, but it is not badly written. it's just a different story delivery method, and past that point the enjoyment of this method is subjective."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"you're just further proving that elden ring bias, btw. hey watch out guys don't say anything bad about elden ring or else the souls fanboys will rip you a new one. yeah and never explain why it's such a great game or have any real discussion, it's always, it's a masterpiece or it set the bar in open world video game history or you're a primo cornball."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-19,"yeah, no"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"but you didn't actually explain what makes it good. you just praised it to high heavens without adding a single reason why it's just that good if not the best game ever. how did elden ring set the bar? what is the bar? it didn't exactly do anything new in gaming from what i could tell, and i have over 250 hours on it. the combat, while fun, was pretty much what we had in dark souls 3 with the addition of being able to jump. even a large portion of spells, weapons, weapon arts, and animations made it over from ds3. don't get me wrong, the gameplay and nearly endless potential for different builds is phenomenal. i don't disagree that it's a good game. it's just that you say no rose tinted glasses but can't explain why the game is so much better than any other game. you just defined the definition of the phrase. i feel like a lot of people here praising elden ring have never even played any of the other games and have no basis to how good any of them actually are. for example, while playing forbidden west, i found that there was always something to do and you get rewarded for exploring. there is never a dull moment and there are plenty of activities and challenges to come across. the story is engaging and keeps you invested. elden ring of course has dungeons to solve, major and minor bosses to fight, but those aren't new concepts in any way, and other than those things, there isn't actually a lot to do activity or contentwise. if er set the bar, and that bar being 'open world puzzle dungeon boss gauntlet with discoverable lore where you ride a horse', then breath of the wild already had that bar set years ago. there are a lot of open, empty areas in elden ring that seem to serve no purpose other than to give the player the illusion of content or to pad out the map size. are the map and graphics amazing? sure. so are that of gow and forbidden west. i might even say the graphics in ds3 were better, but i know that's a less popular opinion. while elden ring is open world, it still also requires that you follow a certain path in order to progress through the game, and again, this is nothing new, but as many have described, it's just dark souls but open world, which, in my opinion, doesn't lend itself well to how the storylore is told, unlike in previous souls games where you could pretty easily figure things out as you go along the linear areas and fight bosses that you have to kill in order to progress. you can skip or miss quite a few in elden ring, a lot of whom are supposedly important to the lorestory. so essentially, what you said is that it's just good just because it is, and anyone who doesn't understand is just foolish. so much for no rose tinted shades huh?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-19,"elden rings pros are that its deeper in combat, enemy variaty and its longer. thatd literally it haha"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-16,"i think why it deserves the praise is due to the design philosophy of letting the player tackle the world however they want. this starts at the bottom with the sheer amount ofbuild , weapon and skill variety, allowing you to play exactly how you want, whether it be a holy paladin, or a sneaky mage. this isn't unique to er, but the way it's presented and the tools you have as a player to achieve exactly the character you want are pretty unmatched in the industry. the second part being exploration, every corner, corridor, dungeon has something useful to it, upgrade materials, weapons, armour  and whilst god of war or zelda have similar rewards, the scale of elden rings rewards are insane, entire areas, main bosses and huge story reveals are hidden  and left entirely to player discretion to find and clear these, a normal playthrough can miss half the game  but it doesn't take away from the experience and further adds replay value. the story, i will admit is a controversial point  the story is absolutely fantastic, really solid base and a great example of worldbuilding. however, the delivery method is not to everyone's taste, as it requires investigation and active seeking of answers, which is a poor motivation for the narrative, but an extremely rich source of player engagement. tldr elden ring leaves much of the game up to the player to tackle in whatever way they see fit. story, combat and exploration are all playerled, leading to a really good video game, with immense replay value."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,its been years and i still have not beaten the orphan of kos.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,yes i have and they where a bit harder but not that hard the only one i liked was lady maria she was fun to fight. also not my fault it was hard for you dont deag every one to your level. but some people cant accept that others dont like the same games. pathetic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"what does playing stray have to do with age? i'm 30 and i play lego star wars. does that make me immature???? it's even more for kids than stray is. sorry for not only liking big boy games, i guess. come back with a real argument and stop projecting your insecurities. nobody is going to make fun of you for what you play, unless they're 14 like you apparently are."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"trust me, plenty of people have been talking about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-14,"it's a hella fun game, especially if you love challenging and varied combat. i personally just don't think it stands up to a couple of these other games, namely horizon and gow since they both feature great combat and more coherent storylines and writing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,you're a primo cornball
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-16,"dudes that's way too many words to read. no one said it's the best game ever. i said it was the best game of the year. i never praised it to high heavens, i said it set the bar in terms of how much content is in the game maybe you should do some actual reading, and stop replying to comments just for the sake of hearing yourself talk"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-28,"god of war has tons of enemy variety, solid combat and is a beefy game in its own right. it also has more meaningful and impactful moments than elden ring which is a good game in its own right. god of war ragnarok and elden ring both are fantastic games. i'm just saying god of war is a better overall experience."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,grown ass man... its okay bro you soft i get it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"not even remotely close to the extent of gow and er, which can be easily confirmed by just spending time in this sub."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"again, point proven."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-16,"bold to tell me to do some reading when you didn't even bother to read the majority of my comment. set the bar for content? plenty of other games have set that bar years ago. breath of the wild is one other open world game where you can do pretty much anything that you can do in elden ring, and more. it also encourages and rewards you for exploring. what content does er have that certain other games don't, exactly? i clearly must've missed something since it seems to have so much content beyond killing bossesenemies and doing dungeons. keep saying how great the game is with no real reason. it has content is not one. not like goty means much, anyway."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"as opposed to being hard and only liking cod or gow? yeah okay. go back to school, kid. maybe you can learn how to make better comebacks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"a single sub on reddit doesn't mean much. and if you never bothered to play it because you didn't like the first game, then you haven't bothered to pay attention to any attention it's been getting. so that 0 chance is based off nothing because you have no basis for how the game actually is."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,you're a primo cornball
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-17,"dude i'm not gonna sit here and explain it to you. you don't like the game? good. go play something else. you like having your hand held and feeling like a big boy solving puzzles? go for it. but i'm not gonna sit here and try to convince some reddit contrarian to why the best game of the year, is the best game if the year. it's going to win. it's not even a competition. and no i don't have to sit here and type a fucking book for some rando in the internet. sorry i just dont have that kind of time"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,i'm very offended i play fifa as well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-15,"it is a good indicator as there are 35 million people here. but not just here, it's barely discussed anywhere, i don't know why you have such a hard time accepting that. the first game won zero awards it was jokingly called like that for a while in most gaming boards. my opinion on the quality of the game is irrelevant, i know critics liked it, but its a whole different league beneath er and gow."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-21,"i already said i liked the game, though? you'd know that if you bothered to read any of what i said. you're a hypocrite. you have the time to praise the game and the time to say you don't have the time, but don't have the time to say why it deserves goty. it just does is a pretty shit reason. you're the epitome of souls fanboys who can't be bothered to explain what makes the game just that good, drooling over it and spitting on anyone who dares have any negative opinion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-21,your still on this subject 4 days later
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-22,and you replied. does that mean you have time to explain why elden ring is game of the year? it's okay to admit that you just like it and think it should win. nothing wrong with that. but you refused to back up your claims and then get all defensive when somebody calls you out. don't cry when you're the one who started this. it will stop if you explain why it's goty or don't reply.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-22,no
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-22,"point proven, then."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-11-23,yup
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"im confused, my cat does that when i pick her up lol whats the problem?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"but the ubisoft way is the way somemany cats act. hop up for cuddles and affection, then hop down once done. if they're anything like my cat, they'll also swipe at you and drag you back if you try to leave before they've had enough."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,well this is a dumb post to bash on ubi lol. do you think cats never want affection?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,my cat will do both simultaneously

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,my cats do both?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,not sure if op is trying to hate on ubisoft or on cats more. x200b x200b stupid either way
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,i hope they add animation to it's tail instead of just in neutral position.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,cats may not come up and cuddle you because your cat hates you. but other people have healthy relationships with their cats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,stupid post made by a stupid person
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,ubi is right. sorry for all y'all with broken cats.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,this is the most applestooranges comparison ever lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,i'm glad to see cats in both games. stray should be an interesting game.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,is that a game where you can play as a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,u forgot the 30 billion quests the cat gives you
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,my cat behaves like the ubisoft one. he loves it when i pick him up. he even does the little head thing to rub my face
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"my cat lets me hold her and pet her, to the best of my knowledge she seems to enjoy it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"...i have a cat that does the snuggling, as long as it's my fiance that picks her up. if i do, she climbs onto my shoulders and headbutts me."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,actually the last one's pretty catlike to me. they change whims on a dime.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"idk, when i pick up my cat to give him attention he loves it and is all into it. this is a dumb post."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,man i would like to have that chonk cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"my cat is actually super affectionate and follows me everywhere i go all day. i work from home most days and she legit just lays on me, around me etc. tbh my cat woukd act like this ubi soft cat"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,tell me you never had a cat without telling me you never had a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"nobody's paying for my games so i dnt care wot everybody says. personally i like farcry series, ac series, and watch dogs series but i won't pay 60 for copypasta games. but if i find a great deal i will surely buy and play them. splinter cell is just in a league of its own for me."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,how did you post a video? i couldnt upload video in this subreddit
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"ubisoft claiming they understand ux better than fromsoftware, when in reality they don't even understand cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"cats are like sour patch kids. sour, then sweet. just take out the sweet part"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,most cat hate belly rub. they will claw your eye out if you do that.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,both are true though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,if they add an option where the cat tips over things on tablesshelves its perfect
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,ohhh i get it ubisoft is a bad company hur dur!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,ngl i think ubisoft isnt that bad
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,my cat is literally like this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,cat behavior varies greatly.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"really depends on the cat. i have two cats. one is like the first video, and will literally murder me if i attempted to pick her up like the ubi video. the other is like the second and loves being cuddled and held in weird positions. animals have different personalities."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"i can't wait to play this game. first goal is to knock over all the things close to the ledge and then run around like crazy at 3am, then i'll eat too quickly and throw up on the rug, and claw up the lounge... i could go on"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,pretty bad post
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"cat used to roll with pharaohs, our quarrels are beneath them"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,what is the point of this lol. one is a massive open world game with the ability to interact with some animals. the other is a game where you play a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,awww
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,this new cat game seems fun
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,the cat  mostly will avoid to be grab and hold
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,my cat would claw the fuxk out of even us if we try to pick her up like that
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i really wanted him to start firing it like a laser cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,awwwww
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,op never had a cat

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i can't wait for stray and another cat game called little kitty in the big city.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,how many of you guys actually own a cat? just curious.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,shit on ubi  free karma. or people just upvote for stray as i first did.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i'm watching this with my silly ginger baby in my arms giving me all the smooches thinking if ubisoft got it wrong at all
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,if this upcoming cat game is cool id like to see a sick dog sequel
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,whats the game you play as a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,is this like that gdc where that indie dev says post ads on reddit with your game's animal mascot?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"my friend has a cat that would stand on his back legs and if you dont pick him up, this 19 yo huge cat would leap up and make you hold him. and when you do hold him he would push hard into you to make you cuddle him more and to just get closer to you. cats arent one and the same. my cat doesnt like to be held at all, but he will follow me and talk to me. he will lie as close to me as he possibly can without being on top of me. he will bonk my head really hard with his to show me how he loves me. cats have as many personalities as humans do."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"that's not a cat, it's a flerken !!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,game?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"see at it like this cats  adults, can be assholes, can lash out, can be kind and nice, needs cuddles when they want it, dont need much attention unless they are looking for it. dogs  children, need constant attention, if their parents are assholes and undisciplined, so will they be, need food always. can cuddle whenever. i love both animals, but this is usually how i see the animals."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"as a person who has own many cats, i can confirm that both assumptions are true"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,cat game good ubi bad
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,what is this ?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,wdym my cats do both of those things.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,my cat behaves like the ubisoft one
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,that's exactly like my cat behaves. i guess this post is done by a dog owner
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,inb4 games only appeal to the male fantasy meme
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,the cat is acting cute tho
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,also you're comparing a game completely about playing as a cat to one where you just can pet a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,lies! ubisoft bad!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,ubisoft bad i understand there are legit reasons to not like ubisoft but they choose this nonissue lmao
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,a game entirely based around cats has better animations for its cats than a game about vikings. who knew?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"my cat did it today then got scared by a loud noise, leaving me an inchlong cut on my hand from the emergency dismount."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"semirelated but my bird likes to kiss my fingernails and if i move away before he's done, he stretches his neck up tall and goes doot! goes back to normal, then stretches back up and releases another doot. repeats a few times or until i let him keep kissing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,honestly getting tired of the cats dont want affection and dont show affection meme or rather myth at this point. i known many cats that are super snuggly and social. but sure they are still cats so the level of snuggle is gonna be limited. its not like dogs that can never stop wanting to show or recieve affection.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"yeah, i have a big brown tabby that looks almost exactly like that who will do that. only he usually sticks around for longer."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,there's a cat in my street who often comes in my room i live on 1st floor when i have the window open to get attention
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"if your cat is taking a swipe at you after giving affection, you are not stopping early enough. its known as play aggression. watch your cats tail and when it drops too low, its time to stop."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"neh heh ubisoft bad yes billy, ubisoft is shit you are very original"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"exactly, like what? cats do all of these things"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"it's not a post, it's an advertisement."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,the animation is clunky and weird. why didnt they just motion capture a cat?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,yeah what does ubisoft really know about cats in an elder scrolls video game though??
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"every post is a good posst to bash ubi. edit guess not, do we love ubi now? sorry, i must have missed the circlejerk memo."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"bashing ubisoft is never wrong, but otherwise i agree."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"that type of affection is a bit much, have you ever tried to give said attention wanting cats a rub on the belly? they will either run away or try to bite you if they don't trust you very deeply, and if it's some strangers cat, they don't."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i mean i agree with you but ubisoft is still a garbage company.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,and i want the big ass cat
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,probably a lynx or smth
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmwe1mhvuriehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmwe1mhvurie probably took reference from this type of cat or one similar to it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"i mean, my cats are closer to the ubisoft cat."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,it's because it's an ad likely put together by whoever is publishing this new cat game. it's easy bait.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"yes you are lucky but not because that's rare, i see different cats behave like both situations multiple times a week. i'm guessing op doesn't have much contact with cats."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,makes me wonder if we should be feeling sorry for their cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i swear ppl cant just be happy with some things.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"i have never preordered a game before because, well, what's the point but my workmates got me a steam voucher for my birthday and i'm shit with money so just in case i run out when it releases i preordered stray. i'd like to say something smart about what's got me interested in the game but basically i like cats and i want to play a game where i get to be one"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,it's a upcoming game called stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"1st game stray, 2nd game ac valhalla"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"yes, stray, on steam i think? it releases in july according to other comments"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"headbonks mean, i love you, in cat"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,well splinter cell sure doesn't have cats though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,you the type to mass buy on sale. my man. i do the same. never bought a ubi game full price. i always buy them at 5060 discount some time later.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,if i'm not completly stupid it should be ac vallhalla.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"it varies greatly. some dont like it, some love it. the problem tends to be from people who dont understand their body language and try to belly rub when the cat is wound up and either wants to play or wants to be left alone entirely."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"actually a lot of cats love belly rubs when they actually ask for it! the problem is that cats often show their belly as a sign of trust and affection, they are more or less saying i trust you enough to make myself vulnerable, because you won't take advantage of it and when you rub their belly in response, in cat, you just said oh hell yeah i'm going to grab your vulnerable parts! of course they bite or scratch in response. if you are petting a cat on it's side or chest, and it moves to give you access to it's belly as you pet, then it wants a belly rub. if it flops on it's back in front of you, especially if it's a little bit away from you, and moves to expose it's belly, it probably does not want a belly rub, but is expressing affection."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,i'm a male and that's exactly how my cats act.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,sounds like you need to reevaluate how you treat cats if you think people are delusional when they say their cat is like the ac one.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"it's called stray. coming next month, preorder available on steam."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"assassin's creed valhalla, i think."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,about the only time my sweetheart and i think special cat has scratched me. spooked by the doorbell. any other time shes all snuggles or at least content to sleep within arms reach. now my other cat.well she plots my murder im very sure
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,some of it is a miss understanding of how they show affection also. sometimes its as simple as being in the same room as you or the way they hold their tail.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"honestly getting tired of the cats dont want affection and dont show affection meme or rather myth at this point. i am too. we have three cats. one likes to drape himself around my husband's neck like a scarf, for at least an hour after my husband gets home from work. one gets so excited when being pet, that she drools. and one just likes to be on someone whenever possible. and anybody who falls asleep in my house will likely wake up with a cat on or near them. yeah, i have had cats in the past that were less affectionate, and had some that were even more cuddly than these three. even a few that never seems to get enough attention no matter what. just like i have had or known dogs that loved everybody they met, and dogs that just weren't interested in most people and only really liked a few people, or even only one or two."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,"he'll grab if you try to walk past without petting him, or only giving passing scritchespets."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i argue with my brother about ubisoft all the time. i think most people just shit on it because other people shit on it. it's a fad. splinter cell far cry south park assassins creed watch dogs ghost recon rainbow six as for console gamers. you may not like every game these ips come out with. but most people definitely like some of them. hell they all defined there generation and innovated gaming at one point throughout the years. splinter cells never had a bad game. conviction set a standard for 3rd person stealth games. farcry 3 was a mash up of all the farcrys before it that just missed the mark. and also set a standard for open world fps games. assassin creed 2 was beloved by all. origins again changed the standard for what a assassins creed game could be. ghost recon was the mil sim game of my youth. wildlands revamped what ghost recon was. rainbow six was the swat for console gamers. seige changed what a 5v5 multiplayer match could be. watch dogs was the cyber punk of it's time. but watch dogs 2 was a great. legion well......its complete fucking trash. so the odds weren't with that ip. south park is fucking south park. you like the show? you'll like the game. everyone loves to hate on ubisoft for all the bad. but nobody ever seems to remember the good. i have genuinely never played a ubisoft game exception is legion that was just complete trash. i've had countless hours of fun with all the games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,remove the captions and you've just got a side by side of cats being cats.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,the first game or the second game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,gracias
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i think he was referring to stray...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"if your cat is taking a swipe at you before giving affection, you are not starting early enough."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i got watch dogs 1 and 2 for free and it didn't click for me. hated the gameplay and the storyline. i took a chance with legion and i love this game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,most ubi games are good for a little while but there is a point where it just feels like youre completing the same mission over and over the same way every time. watchdogs devolved into using the ctos scan and just running in with a silenced rifle and wildlands devolved into me using the mass scan from a drone and running in with a silenced rifle seriously though i did like both games 20 hours in watchdogs and 40 in wildlands but it does feel like im doing the same thing over and over. at least in wildlands loud gunfights were possible because you have heath but in watchdogs youre made of wet noodles and will often die in a second or two if youre not behind cover and get spotted so it feels like scanning and stealth kills are your only option
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"your examples are all mostly old ubisoft games. you put origins forth as an example of a good ubi game and while i agree that it was decent, it's what essentially started the looting rpg crap mechanics. i played origins, i played odyssey. may as well be witcher 3 spinoffs at this point."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,the way i think of ubisoft is a little buggy but fun overall i enjoy the hell out of most ubisoft games and dont understand the hate
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"it's kind of silly to look back at games like original splinter cell, far cry 3 or assassin's creed 2 when most of what ubisoft has made recently has been absolute cash grab garbage with awful micro transactions, huge bugs and other issues. it's like saying bro, why u bashing blizzard? they made warcraft 3 and diablo 2!."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,i played almost all ubi games and there wasn't a single one i didn't rage because of the shitty controls and dumb ai. optimization i wont even comment...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-04,i have both of these cats
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"buddy. i guess you don't either, because my cat shows affection in a very similar way to the second clip. cats aren't, or at least shouldn't, always be assholes. if your cat likes you, it will let you know."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,my cat will cry and cry till i pick him up to love on him. cats can definitely be loving and cuddly
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"it doesn't release until july 19th, so why would it have reviews?? the sale is a prepurchase promotion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,probably why it needs advertising
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,oop
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,yeah your cat did you get to the part about trust?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,yes
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"could be i didn't even knew that game exists or is in development, could be because there is that no actual ingame footage line in that clip."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"i completely get what you're saying. but i just somewhat disagree. every company has games that don't hit and are a bit scummy. but valhalla wasn't garbage to me? ghost recon breakpoint had a no mans sky trajectory. it launched as trash but had developers that stuck with and believed in there game and it was slowly turned into something good. i'm ok with that. at the end of the day creating games is a business. if you've invested millions of dollars into creating something and it's not what you wanted it to be. but deadlines are deadlines. the ceo is on your back. because the board is on his. those people see bottom lines and dollars and cents. it's a job not a passion for gaming. i just think making a game is a much harder thing to do now then it was 1520 years ago. when it was smaller companies that had the freedom to spend time creating exactly what they wanted. microtransactions has been this word that gets tossed around casually. but when you really look into it. i'd say 99 of all microtransactions are completely optional mostly skins that don't have any effect on the actual game at all. personally. i think remakes. even good ones are 100x more frustrating to me as a gamer then any microtransaction. there's only been a handful of games that gave me the feeling of experiencing something new, different and innovative in gaming as a console player. morrowindoblivion farcry 3 deus ex prey 2017 the hype for remakes just baffles me. i want something new. were in this stagnant era of gaming. ubisoft makes great open world games. but at the end of the day. what could they do to make the open world games feel different? i genuinely don't know. you have to fill the game with activities and side missions. what else can you do? for instance...i like the newer spiderman games. so do most gamers. but they are the worst case of what most people hate on ubisoft's open worlds for. big. empty and side activities that all feel the same. sorry i know my grammar is shit. and i'm honestly always open for a discussiondebate. don't mean any offense or to say you're wrong because of your opinion."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,with awful micro transactions? the only micro transactions that ive seen in ac is skins with no advantages. i think the only ac game that had pay to win was black flag bc you could upgrade your ship that way. that game is still considered the best ac game though
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,you sound like you have anger issues
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,from what i remember splinter cell was pretty flawless. now i understand they would feel like shit now going back and playing the original 2. but that's most games. i would say conviction and blacklist were pretty damn perfect. and idk. quirks i guess i maybe remember in ubisoft along with all games. but nothing game breaking from what i recall. nothing that made me stop playing the games.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-05,"same ,cats will want attention and not want attention"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-06-06,"oh really? didn't realise, just popped up on steam the other day. could have sworn it was on sale xd must have confused it with another game. it looks cool, my kids will love it"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,looks ok but i've got bored after an hour or two.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,it's too simplified for me. i didn't enjoy playing it. and i can't enjoy a game based purely on graphical settings and the looks of the main character.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,i've been meaning to check this out in vr. i saw someone playing it using the flatscreentovr mod and i can hardly imagine how gorgeous it would be
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"i played this with my 4 year old. i gave him a powered off controller and told him he was the cat and i was the robot. i played through the whole game while pretending to direct him and get his input and help. we finished the game months ago and he loved every minute, and still talks about it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"i just started playing it, too! it's so pretty!!!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"yep, i loved this game, beautiful, and interesting ideas. it was over way too quickly. i think i heard a sequel is being worked on, hopefully it is. i keep looking at steam hoping it gets down to 15, i played it on ps4 and would like to play it again with better visual fidelity."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,my daughter every now and then said to okay the cat game. loved the story and gameplay. also it allowed me to find something else to play then the goose game lol
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"i enjoyed it a lot. for sure, we can see that the developer isn't a big studio, and they have a lot of work to do and stuff to learn. i didn't get into it with much expectations, and it saved me from disappointments from certain things like gamebreaking bugs, which made me restart game from the beginning i think the visuals and optimization combo is great for such a game. the story might seem somewhat shallow in places, but i would definitely call this game a success"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-05-09,"i've had the opposite experience from a majority of reddit users in here. i absolutely love the game! granted, i had a couple edibles in me and it elevated the experience. still, i love how simple the gameplay is and that it's not too challenging and overwhelming. i've been playing games since ps1 and this is one of my all time favorites. it's a great game to come to after a long day of work or to just vibe to. i give it a solid 810."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"i don't get why so many people hate on it, one of the few games i bought and played on release day and i've never regretted doing so"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,it's a pretty great game. i hope it gets a sequel or something along those lines.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,had more fun doing dishes than playing this game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-06,this is one of those games where once it comes to game pass it will be the only thing i play. but i wouldn't spend money on it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,amazing game!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-06,this looks so cute
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-01-05,"i actually just started playing it. it's cute but it's kind of dull being on rails non stop. i don't really feel like there's any challenge and its just following the story line. maybe things will get better but it's getting close to sending me to sleep right now. also wtf is the field of view in this game? it's like playing a game through binoculars! thankfully found a fix for it but meh, it's getting boring fast."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,its free on psextra. i beat it in an afternoon and thought it was good. no game of the year but its gooddifferent.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"for once i agree with the media reviews on this. it is a walking simulator. it's very pretty, it's very cute, but it's a walking simulator with very little in the way of actual mechanics or interesting gameplay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,84 on metacritic for the ps5 version is fairly high. certainly above average.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"bots and marketing my dude, game is great, gameplay is progressive, visuals are great, if you're looking for a warm hearted short game this should be in your collection, but it's not goty, but it's dope to see the amount of hype because they did something pretty unique here, i'm tired of formulaic games and i would say this breaks the mold"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yeah... even if it wasn't a walking sim... 30 bucks for a 3 hour game is a little much in my opinion.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,the people saying it's goty are out of their minds. it's fun but not close to goty
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"idk about goty but if i see another look at my cat watching me play this cat game post, i'm gonna lose it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,reddit is a massive circlejerk. i can guarantee half the people upvoting stray posts haven't even played or seen gameplay of it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,reddit has a stupidstrange obsession with cats. that's all it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's because it's got cats in it as the main playable thing, so everyones losing their kidneys over it. it's fake social media excitement is all, to sound engaging and fun. x200b it's a fine game, it's not a great game, people are just vapid fucks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,84 hardly middling but wouldnt say goty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i was looking forward to playing stray but too bad it's just a walking sim. might buy it when it goes for sale but current price is way too much for a game like this.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,in other news redditor discovers mammal preference for other mammals. reptile minds blown.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"i think because most ? of them never experienced how unique walking simulators are. these have been around awhile but if its your first one, might leave a mark."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,there are so many games people love that they would have ignored entirely if the ip was different. that's just not a valid complaint.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"yeah... it's just a huge circlejerk atm. i mean, what's the state of gaming when just a walking simulator of a cat makes everyone go insane."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,replacing it with a lizard just turns it into spyro and everyone also loves that game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"maybe your own perception bias is at play. i've seen several nonreddit reviews praising the game highly. i've also seen shitty reddit hot takes shitting on the game. it's something to talk about so people who make content will milk it ... reddit, being an echo chamber for attention hungry and just people with no one to talk to. talk about shit too. i don't think there's some larger issue at play of people on reddit being a monolith that is somehow separate from supposed legit game reviews"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"it's effectively a viral trend, much like the goose game was. it's no technical marvel or narrative masterpiece, but it's a unique and genuine title that's found a wide and appreciative audience that can enjoy it for what it is and the unity it brings to the gaming community. and in all honesty all the game awards bs are so pointless it might as well be on the list, there's no objectivity to the goty anyway it's effectively a popularity contest of the most recent releases so fuck it cat game for best of the year, might as well be."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"its cause cats. tons of people spent 10 bucks on cat ears in halo infinite. i messaged my friends the other day calling it goty, i still havent even played it. but yeah i love cats, it might actually be my goty, plus i dont care for elden ring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"all i know is that i loved the game. didn't expect to get it day 1, but i did. very much a short but sweet experience. i just want more of it, but what we got was very impactful to me. i am playing elden ring right now. long anticipated game of mine that i am finally getting the chance to play. andd that game is great, but there's just something about stray that grabbed me more. if there was more to do i would be playing more stray right now."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,its a good walking sim but just a walking sim.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,change the premise of the game and the premise of the game would be different!1!!!!! hot take. as for the reviews vs reddit...that's pretty bog standard for most things isn't it? go through rotten tomatoes and you'll see the same trend of critics being at odds with users. professional critics aren't worth listening to on basically any topic.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i have seen exactly 0 people calling it a goty contender. i'm sure they exist but i guarantee you 99 of the time it's just a meme you might not be getting. also how is 84 even close to middling, lol. reviews for it are overall great."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"it's clearly a meme. the whole meme started because people on reddit noticed that user reviews for the game were very high. the reviews are high because people like the game, high user review score are subjective and often just result of expectations management."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,i played it a bit yesterday and i hardly see myself finishing it
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"yes, the game is boring, lazy gameplay etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,internet likes cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i don't understand the people that call stray a walking simulator. it has puzzles and roguelike portions, and it's quite possible to die in multiple areas from enemies. is it just a derogatory term for any narrative based game or are people just talking about the game without having played it?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"reviewers base themselves off of how the game sits within the current meta of what makes a good game. focus on graphics, gameplay, and how much the publisher spends on ads for their website. redditors are looking at originality."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"it's ok, but no goty for sure. it has nice visuals and some cute semcebes where you can be a cat. it's short, there's mininal cinematics or story, and there's nothing innovative behind bryond being a cat. it'll get mostly forgotten about in a few weeks."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"its the exact same with every story driven, walking sim type game. is it going to reinvent gameplay? nah. is it an artistic masterpiece? if you ask me, definetely. goty, fuck no."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,honestly... reptile sounds like a neat game as well. imagine you're just a chill iguana who gets kidnapped for use as a pet or food and has to find their way back home. i'd play it if it had the quality of stray.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"game is being memed hard, its ridiculous."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"because cat people are a breed of their own, so you're getting real reviews ans cat ppl reviews"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,it's a cute gimmick and that's about it. it's at least priced pretty fairly for what it is.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-11,"innovation should be rewarded. stray isn't just putting a cat in your average platformerwalking simulator. all the things a cat does are blended into gameplay as useful mechanics, usually pretty seamlessly. this game was built around being a cat. the game also has a fair bit of variety that i appreciated. it may be short but it never overstays its welcome and doesn't feel the need to endlessly repeat a stale gameplay loop. sometimes it's exploration, sometimes its light puzzles, sometimes it's chase sequences with environmental puzzles, sometimes it's stealth and sneaking. of course, the world itself is also very well developed and presented and kind of unique."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-15,"it's fun to play something chill sometimes. stray is the right amount of fun  i cannot spend hours gaming anymore and i'm past the point of playing hypedpopular games just because everyone likes them. i now prefer games that are engaging , but not so detailed that i spend too much timeenergy strategizing. stray is just that . i've never played walking simulators before , if that's what this is, then damn  it's good. this will appeal to the casual gamer and i guess that's why it's rated high on several forums."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-21,"played it for maybe an hour at the most and felt like i'd seen all there was to see. a game where you play as a cat should not be entirely context based. i was hoping for some hilarious failed jumps, knocking stuff over and ai that reacts to you being basically a stupid animal fumbling its way around a cyberpunk city. give me a cat platformer with combat, turf wars with other cats and the ability to act out every hilarious cat video on the internet and i'll play the shit out of it. very pretty game though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-12-05,"what's annoying is people negatively comparing it to death stranding as far as it being a walking simulator. death stranding has an stier story, tons of combat and stealth, as well as a layer of planning and problem solving. there are vehicles and ziplines for travel, too. the walking is meaningful and the story pushes you to want to. the multiplayer element is huge in making it fun, and the desire to help others pushes you to keep going, to lay down ropes and ladders, among other structures, to help others.. these walks are also magnified tenfold by some top notch music choices.. stray though?... i can't concretely judge until i play something but... is it really anything other than just a literal walking simulator with toddlerlevel puzzles? lol i've yet to see any interesting gameplay. if what i've seen is what it is... then it absolutely does not even deserve to be a nominee of goty. goty and most of the categories easily go to elden ring imo. gow ragnarok was just another woke, preachy, cycle of violence narrative with an anticlimactic ending and puzzles that the awful ai instantly and constantly solves for you, with no option to shut them up..."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"this is why i've been ignoring the people gushing about the game. the only things i've seen from it are cat posters and the cat trips random npcs. and runs from something in the sewer but i don't remember enough about that. so far i've seen no content posted, no fun game missions or weird but fun things. now, walking simulators are fine in their own right, they have a good calming aspect to them that not a lot of games can boast. but the reddit love for this game isn't anything more than crazy cat people coming out in bulk it seems. this is like if the witness made front page daily."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,but theres a run button... o
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,just because you found the mechanics boring doesn't make it a walking sim. and freeform movement would be a nightmare. you'd be falling off of pipes and thin ledges all the time. it'd be super frustrating.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"yeah, and the user score is 8.9, it's really not that much of discrepancy, i've seen way bigger ones."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i think you massively overestimate the amount of bots that exist in the marketing space. actual humans employed to say nice things, sure. but computer programs, not so much"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,replace cat with literally anything else and nobody cares about the game.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"goty can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. for me, i got more overall enjoyment and value stray far more than i did for even elden ring."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i sure hope it isn't important because you are gonna loose it if you haven't lost it already.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"yeah, the upvote system really creates an illusion of consensus."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,do you remember the early days of youtube? the internet as a whole has a stupidstrange obsession with cats.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"yes, if you replaced the cat with anything else people wouldn't even look at it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,free on psextra tier
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"it's effectively a viral trend, much like the goose game was exactly this, a popular game doesn't have to be groundbreaking mechanics or state of the art graphics or even an amazing story. it just needs to be something new and get lucky"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"the game is nothing remotely close to roguelike it's just dying and respawning at a checkpoint, puzzles are very light the end game area puzzles with the drones you do not even need stealth as just running causes them to miss and they won't fire into a box even if you get into it while they watch."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"are they though? the game is original in presentation, but the actual gameplay is very bog standard walking simulator stuff."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-13,"except it's literally a walking sim and nothing else. just because you can't make a good, fun gameplay, doesn't mean that replacing every action in your game with press x to watch a cute cat cartoon is a good game design with actual gameplay mechanics."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"fine, a crawling simulator."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i see this is the first time encountering an opinion. don't worry, you'll do better next time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,bow chicka bow wow
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"while believe you are correct because cats are generally superior and all forms, i think it depends on the theme and world built around the animal you want to make the game around."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,death stranding basically swaps the cat for norman reedus.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-08-24,true but that's why the game is made with a cat. i'd like a sequel with a doggo as well
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,you have a right to like stray more but youd be absolutely off your rocker to suggest it as goty.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,waiting for that goty stray release date.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"for me, i got more overall enjoyment and value stray far more than i did for even elden ring. i understand games are subjective and opinions and shit, but... that's just wrong lol."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"and the fact that saying the wrong thing earns you downvotes, and hides your post so that if enough people disagree with it it wont even get seen."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"i mean the cat is the usp of the game. that's like saying if you replaced the blocks in minecraft with smooth, well textured objects people wouldn't look at it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,that's really the best way to judge how good the game really is
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,yeah they give good reviews to pretty much all big games cause of money.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"you presented it as fact. don't worry, you'll do better next time."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,never did play that one. i was a kojima fan and was watching it. reviews were not that good so i skipped it.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"well let me ask you, what makes a game goty for you? edit it was a genuine question. if you cant answer what a goty game means to you, as an individual, you have no right to even discuss the topic. but downvote away."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,yes how dare that person enjoy one game more than another. next you'll be telling me some people prefer different music than me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-28,"elden ring is as overhyped as stray i put 200 hours into the game and while yes it is better than most games out in the market, it does not compare to older fromsoft titles in world design and gameplay balance this could be remedied easily with mods or proper balance patches but sadly fromsoft decided to put eac on a mainly singleplayer game, and they don't seem to give a shit to put some effort to fix this broken and buggy game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,me and my wife have reddit accounts. sometimes my post shows 1200 upvotes but on her account it shows my post on 1020. also the same with comments some of my comments have negatives but when she shows it doesn't show a number at all
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"no, it's not, like at all. the blocks are not sentient protagonists, they are inanimate solid objects in an open spaced sandbox. i do often wonder why i bother engaging with this kind of comment, but this one was particularly dumb. comparing apples and apples is fine, comparing apples and the titanic is not."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,that's not how opinions work. go back to school.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,yeah and they conveniently hide the controversial sort order when searching posts so you can't find the human posts.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,yeah but they're both an integral part of the game that makes it stand out from other games. if stray was a game about a human trying to escape then it wouldn't even get a second look. if minecraft was just a garrys mod clone it wouldn'tve gotten further than being a free download on a forum
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"controlling a narrative is social media speciality. just look at the media with things like rona, religion, politics etc. majority is bs."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,i made a comment saying consoles are expensive i immediately get 5 karma i hop to my other account and would you look at that it's hidden from plain view now because i said the wrong thing.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-09,"oh, the devs are busy porting the game. also i didn't know about the animated movie in development. hopefully all these means they want to expand the ip and there will be sequel someday."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,this was a fun game to playthrough and didn't take too long. the cat antic related achievements are pretty cutefunny too
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,"sweet, will have to replay it on the switch next."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,nice. it was fun to play this game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,"the graphics look extremely good for switch, they did a really good job on this port."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,"yes! and with the announcement of an animated movie based on this game, this makes me even more excited!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-09,why not just replay it on the device you already have it on?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-08,"youre gonna switch up your style of play! lol, get it? i do!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-09,i like the idea of having a version of the game i can take anywhere.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2024-08-09,"haha yeah i guess so. played it on ps4 first, so being able to replay it on the go is going to be fun."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2022-07-28,there's another skyrim reference later on as well. a robot looking through trash says some may call this junk. me i call them treasures. lmao

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i've tried to get into demon's souls, dark souls, and bloodbourne. i fucking love the atmosphere of all of the games. the artstyle is amazing. i just hate. cheap. deaths. and lack of checkpoints. i must've dumped at least 50 hours collectively into all these games. i got the furthest in dark souls, about halfway through the game. stopped once i got frustrated trying to navigate myself through blightown. demon's souls i restarted with new characters countless times. i would get to like, the first boss in every world, beat some of them, die to some of them. even grinded a ton on 41 the one with the rolling skele's. i just hated the fact that i'd make it so fucking far in an area, and then die to something fucking stupid  like an enemy jumps out from behind a wall, stuns me, and i die. fuck. now i have to restart the entire fucking thing and carefully retread my steps for 20 minutes. then you finally make it to the boss and he kills you in one hit. you have no idea what the move was, or what the pattern was, because you spent a total of 7 seconds in the bosses lair before you die. now it's another 25 minutes of getting to the boss again. and don't make a stupid, hasty mistake trying to get to him or you have to start over again. literally the only reason i put time in these games was people saying, oh, you just have to learn the enemy attack patterns and be prepared to die a lot. yup. i've realized that these are games where you have to memorize everything. honestly, that's not fun to me. i think these would be good games if i was a kid and i had time to dump into one game for months on end, but unfortunately i don't. i just love the way these games look and the atmosphere they present. i wish they were easier, though."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,swiftor's ragehttpsyoutu.bekx3ayznsmi is the video i show people when they ask me if they'll like the souls series.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i finally gave ds2 a whirl a few weeks ago, and wtf us up with that ui? looks like it's pulled straight from the late 90s"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,lmao this thread dark souls is mostly learning patterns so you can time your iframes right and not get punished. yea you'll die a lot before the end of the game but it can be beaten at lv1 with nothing but your fists. it's about timing your dodges and blocks properly which is totally doable by anyone who invests time into the game. so many of you guys give up way too easily.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i always wanted to play dark souls, but my attempt on pc was a fucking nightmare. 2 hours just to get the game moderately working with a controller. if they would fix the damn pc port, life would be so much better, and i may actually play it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i've never played a dark souls game but why are they so fun if all that happens is you die over and over again due to the difficulty?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-18,i knew that song was familiar... httpswww.youtube.comwatch?va7arsfctvma fitting i say.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i don't think i've ever really fought ceaseless discharge... i just run to the end of the arena and punch his hand like 5 times...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"agreed, the fume knight was a complete arsehole of a boss. the only other boss that made me turn a game off for a while was capra demon, putting those dogs in there with him was a cheap cheap move!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"you should watch the speed runs of bed of chaos, and then rage"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,don't forget the 4 kings. the only bosses that i refuse to fight by myself.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"most of them i can understand i.e. ceaseless and boc are just badly designed but in what makes stray demon hard? you got to watch out for his magical aoe attacks, but those are very telegraphed. btw. i think i had the hardest time with artorias, but at the same time, it's probably my favorite video game boss ever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"ceaseless discharge was easy as fuck, just wait for him to swipe after picking up that armor set, then run past all the way back to the fog. then wait for him and he'll put his arm down so you can wack away and then he dies after only a few hits. it was a gimmick of a boss, like the bed of chaos. man, fuck the bed of chaos, such a pointless battle."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"fume knight is fucking awesome. he wrecked me hard, but he's an awesome boss for the sheer variety of moves and combos. i like to take him on with either a partizan piercing damage is good against him or caestus manliness and it makes dodging easier if you're up his armpit. by far, my favorite boss of the whole souls series."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"exact opposite for me. to this day even though i have every achievement in the game on 360 and pc, os is the only boss i can't fight by myself. and bed of chaos?. that's barely a boss. four arrows and a jump is all you need. the area around bed of chaos is harder. to me the only boss that i feel is stupid hard besides os is the four kings on ng. first time i played them on ng made me quit the game for weeks. if i didn't care so much about achievements i probably would have stopped playing the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"the stray demon gave you trouble? i thought he was one of the hardest too at first, but on my second playthrough i realized he's actually one of the easiest bosses if you take it slow 12 hits at a time and study his moveset to learn when he's doing an aoe attack. just keep your distance most of the time, and use estus whenever your health is below like 70."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i had to fight artorias for the first time on new game . that was the toughest souls boss in dark souls for me. darklurker for dark souls 2, and flame lurker for demon souls. flame lurker largely because i refuse to use magic. ever."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,it seems like os has a bit more wiggle room in the way of strategies. where as with the stray demon and some of the others there's only one way to beat them without getting destroyed.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i don't know why but i had more trouble and fits of rage because of os than other of the the others. maybe because i had to play better to finally beat them with like 5 health left
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,deleted
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"really? os are the hardest boss in the game to me. i just cannot solo them for whatever reason. manus, four kings, artorias, and all the others are easy by comparison."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"for me, os are still the most dreaded bosses. i could never solo them, and i still cant on an ng. every other boss i managed solo most of the time, but not those two. even with solaire."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"fume knight and sir allone. that fucker with his bugged to hell stab hitbox. in ds1, however, no boss gave me even close to as much a hard time as os. i did kill smough first, thou melee only. killing ornstein first is 100 times easier."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"stray demon is super easy if you know what you're doing. ceaseless discharge is a joke if you know what you're doing, artorias is tough, but is manageable once you learn his moveset. sanctuary guardian is hard, but if you have fast rolling and react quickly to his moves, you can dodge all of his attacks. manus is pretty tough, i'll give you that. os however, no matter how much practice you have on this boss, they can still screw you over with bullshit. it is much harder to pay attention to two enemies than just one. the only way to make os a consistent win is to summon help, other than that, there is no strategy that works with absolute consistency against them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"oamps solo was ridiculously difficult for me to complete, but for some reason i had such an easy and fun time with artorius i would get him down to his last sliver of health and let him kill me so i could keep fighting him"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"os, the kings, artorias, black dragon, and manus were the only ones i couldn't solo. stray demon took me a solid 1020 tries though. that damn magic blast"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i would say that os are much harder than artorias and the stray demon. just poke the stray demon in the butt with no armor on. bam, problem solved."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"artorias actually isnt too bad on a ng if you're using a tank build with a lot of poise aka havel's  greatshield. on ng however, prepare your anus."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"noone you listed is nearly as hard as os, except manus. and dual sanctuary guardians. and many of the bosses in 2 are near os, and above the other ones you mentioned. seams like we have a classic case of warping perception. you started the game as a bad player, having problems with pushovers like stray demon. and by the time you got to ds2, the tougher bosses were now below your refined skills, so they appeared easier than they actually are."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"os solo took more tries on my first playthrough than any other boss. i'd put artorias and manus right up there in terms of difficulty level also you forgot that asshole kalameet but they still didn't give me nearly as much trouble as biggie smalls. i think it's the unpredictable nature of the fight that comes from having two seperate entities to fight. i haven't played the dark souls 2 dlc yet but as far as the base game, i thought velstadt was a real dick."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"it's funny how dark souls bosses can be. it seems most people dreaded fume knight, but i oneshot him. and yet, i struggled like hell against some other bosses that most found to be a pushover. same with bloodborne."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i don't know what i expected
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"you weren't supposed to be fighting those skeletons at that point. you went down the wrong path. if it's any consolation, you're far from the only one who made that mistake and then gave up on the game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-18,"i ended up giving in and summoning some other player to help, he beat them to a pulp in less than a minute. was kinda disappointing really, didn't summon for help again after that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"the fact that everyone knows this and still finds it difficult is proof that it is in fact hard and not just unfair. it is difficulty in its purest form because even when you know each and every aspect of it, it still comes down to player skill."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"patterns or not, it's still extremely easy to fuck up if you haven't mastered it. the four spooky lords still fuck me up from time to time. and even if it loses it's difficulty after experience, it's still a joy to replay."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i like it. the thing about dark souls is that dying is part of the game. you're an undead dude who keeps on dying and dying while trying to stay sane. everybody is undead. though if they lose their sanity at some point during their continuous cycle of deaths then they turn into demons or something. so dying being part of the game you go in, die, learn the mechanics, and then win. it's pretty fun, though i'm nowhere near as hardcore as a lot of the community."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"as someone who quit this game after twenty minutes, got that itch of incompletion, and returned, i have one piece of advice for you you are not supposed to go in to the graveyard with the skeletons after defeating the first tutorial boss. look around for an alternate path. you'll thank me later when you're really enjoying yourself."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"it takes awhile to get into and little bit of preknowledge what stats to upgrade, how to upgrade weapons, what humanity is, but it is all worth it. the first playthrough will make you want to fucking kill yourself, but when you look back on it and really think about the design and the mechanics, you realize how good it really was. some of the bosses are basically my favorite bosses from any game ever, and the dlc is in my top 3. not every boss and area is perfect, but no game is. dark souls 2 is kind of a asshole i'm not fond of it compared to the first game, but i like to think the first game just makes you work for it. when you die you have to get back up. the moment you rage quit, you lose. practice practice practice. practice rolling i frames, practice timing, practice parrying, etc."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"if the idea of a real challenge doesn't seem fun to you, then don't play it. it's challenging but not even close impossible."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,your friend gave you a game. play it or give it back.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"it's one of the most fun games i've ever played, and i think the amount of effort the other commenters are putting in to try and convince you of that speaks volumes."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"give it a go, i've never finished any of them, but i enjoy them. once you get the hang of it it becomes quite methodical, almost relaxing."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-18,the challenge and reward is very very addictive. small steps. i only finally beat it last week after putting it down for over a year.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i play on pc too. you need a controller.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,need to get a game pad.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"never stop moving. make sure you can see both of them at all times. my favorite way to play is straight strength so i'm always two handing a great club, but for your first go i'd recommend always keeping your shield up unless you are attacking or rolling through attacks although that obviously depends on your skill with i frames, especially since ornstein likes to be a little unpredictable and can hide attacks behind smough. you 100 need to upgrade the fire to 10 estus flasks if you haven't. make sure if you need to chug you are behind a pillar where you won't get hit. pillars are the easiest way to stop smough's charge attack. if you're fighting spoilers!!! big ornstein staying at his feet generally seems to be easier for me than mid range."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"me too, just got there the other day."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,some things to consider  summon a friend with humanity  if you summon try splitting the bosses  lightning resistance is good to have when facing them  silver knight armor has good lightening resistance  they are weak against fire  use the pillars against the big guy good luck. getgud.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,also only attack after you bait both of them to attack. i circle around the pillars.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"which boss, there's like dozens, unless you mean os, in which case you might be underleveled some, under upgraded, or trying to go about it the wrong or, maybe, not optimal? way..."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"ceaseless discharge ended the game for me, i couldn't beat him and lost a lot of souls trying too. so i ended up just quitting. i'm really disappointed in myself for that."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-18,i fought and killed him once. before i learned the easy way online. it was probably the single most brutal and unforgiving fight in the entire game. those tentacles are next to impossible to dodge.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,secret to beating fume knight dodge
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"good trick for dealing with those dogs. run past everyone and go up the stairs on the left of that room. you should see a little window ledge off to the right from the top of the stairs. if you time your jump right you can land on it and deal with the dogs from the high ground, then jump down and smack around capra."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"4 kings is just a dps race. go in there with the best armor you got, highest damage output you got and 20 estushumanity and just hammer away at them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,git gud.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i usually go for the full havel set and just tank them. the trick is to only focus on one at a time and keep on attacking when they die, so they continue to lose hp for a moment. as long as you don't get ganked, the fight is pretty easy."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"fighting it by yourself is the way to go. when you summon someone npc or human bosses get an hp boost. four kings already have the most health of any boss, so it's even worse with them. just get close and side roll into the swings."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"how do people have so much problems with this? i mean sl1 runs ... sure, could be hard. but other than that? 2h weapon and you can easily dps each of them down before the next spawns. hell even if they fucking grab you on every occasion there's usually enough time, it's not like you have to play perfectly."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,r u casual?

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,lol what you casual? jk
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,huh i just did the 4 kings for the first time a few weeks ago. i had this super defensive agility build where i use real heavy armor and a agility scaling sword. i thought the fight was so boring since all the kings did was tickle me.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"let me clarify i may rage and curse most of these bosses, but in reality, there is nothing better than the feeling of beating a hard boss fair and square. i don't think fumey is particularly cheap, he just has sick range and a fuckton of hp. very challenging is what i'd call him. the only really shitty boss in the whole souls series is the combo of throne defender and watcher. again, not incredibly difficult, just badly designed. the best boss in the entire souls series is a hard one. here are my favourites  old king allant demon's souls  penetrator demon's souls  sif dark souls  gwyn dark souls  looking glass knight dark souls 2  velstadt dark souls 2 and my absolute favourite of them all, darklurker. also dark souls 2."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,how can you not beat os after so much time spent on the game? kite ornstein away from smough and you basically have a 1on1 battle about the difficulty of dragonslayer in ds2. smough is fat and slow. just run from him. ornstein will follow you without problems and then you can duel him.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"never stop moving. make sure you can see both of them at all times. my favorite way to play is straight strength so i'm always two handing a great club, but for your first go i'd recommend always keeping your shield up unless you are attacking or rolling through attacks although that obviously depends on your skill with i frames, especially since ornstein likes to be a little unpredictable and can hide attacks behind smough. you 100 need to upgrade the fire to 10 estus flasks if you haven't. make sure if you need to chug you are behind a pillar where you won't get hit. pillars are the easiest way to stop smough's charge attack. if you're fighting spoilers!!! big ornstein staying at his feet generally seems to be easier for me than mid range."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,haven't found about that method until i saw it in a speedrun well after i finished the game  reaching the place where you can actually fight him after the initial encounter was brutal by itself. actually beating him was damn awesome.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"there's a way you can cheese him, aka kill him a cheap way. there's a few guilds online, that boss is extremely hard otherwise. you're almost to the end. don't go hollow on us!"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"yeah in the end i managed it, it was just such a small area and those dogs would trap you in a corner when you dodged the capra demon's initial smash attack. good of you to give advice though, appreciate that, thanks!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,went to fight him with all 4 nadalias and 2 summons in my 1st run...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"what about fume knight was so rage inducing? if you have agility andor doge timings down and don't doge the same direction as his attacks. what about him, other than the orb fire thing and large hitbox buff sword is different than the other humanoid bosses? if he had a smelter demon fire core, he would be pretty bad."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,so my first time playing through i was using velstadt's helm because of its good stats and it's cool silhouette. i had no idea wearing velstadt's gear pissed off the fume knight enough to make him go into turbo death mode immediately instead of only when he gets to low health. fume knight can most certainly go fuck himself after that two hour ordeal of misery.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,here's a hint you can beat bed of chaos in 30 seconds.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"how to beat the four kings 1. get havel's armor. 2. twohand any weapon that does a lot of damage with one hit. dragon tooth works nice. 3. get in real close, don't even try to roll. 4. make them smell what the rock is cooking."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,you can make the fight pretty intense by activating the red tearstone ring and relying on dodges only. go one step further and do it at soul level one. for full insane mode do all of the previous steps but wait for 4 of them to spawn and attempt it that way.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,yeah in ng as long as they don't do the aoe attack you're golden.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i like that bed of chaos is so shitty it doesn't even make the bad list. solid list though. i feel like humanoid enemies with combos and movesets are usually the most fun. i actually still need to go through darklurker though.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"gwyn took me so long to figure out. i was so used to blocked and countering enemies his size, that when he just kept slashing and doing damage through my shield, i really started panicking. his moves were quick, and difficult for me to tell which one he was going to do. eventually a buddy told me to trying parrying him, which never even occurred to me, and that's how i eventually beat him. i'm not sure how you're supposed to know that parrying is even an option. correct me if i'm wrong, but i don't think you can parry any other boss."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,i beat velstadt on the first go last night on ng5. i use the red eye ring to get his attention and let the companion do a lot of the work. mirror knight has never been a problem though. for some reason i lost to vendrick 5 times in a row even though i brought all five of my giant souls into the fight. he kept one shotting my ass.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i've read how to beat them. i've seen how to beat them. i'm a little pissed off that twitch could beat them. i just can't do it solo. it took about six months of stopping the game and trying to pick it back up. but since the game doesn't teach you shit i learned after that six month that there were summons in the game and multiplayer. i didn't even know the difference between human and non human was. i thought the effigy just gave you more health. then i watched a speed run, and started reading the wiki on how to actually play the game. there is no question that this is the best game of the last generation"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,that strategy works if you want smough's armor. i think it's way tougher to kill smough first for ornstein's set. never pulled it off alone.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-18,"yes indeed, and the victory was incredibly satisfying."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"yeah, that seems to typically be the case for any multi enemy boss fights."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,if you know what he does he's not hard. but fighting him the first few times i had no idea how to avoid his onehitkill aoe shit.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,manus is pretty easy as long as you have good shield stability. you can take manus without taking damage with a shield and the pendant.

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"for real. the graveyard is the obvious path, and i could not find another one. the skeletons there will wreck you. i made it through the tutorial and thought, what's everyone bitching about? sure this game is punishing, but not to an unfair degree! then i took the turn the game assumes you will takein addition to teaching you to follow enemy patterns and to never underestimate even the easiest creatures, the game also teaches you to explore if you want to succeedand ran in to those fucking skeletons. i've never ragequit so hard in my life. but it was a lesson, like all things in dark souls. if something isn't working for you, even after several tries, you probably need to try something else."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i agree to an extent. i tried to play spoiler free, but there was just too much i didn't understand. as for lautrec do you mean before or in anor londo because i think you should do the real fight the first time. just like how i think you should do blighttown the real way the first time and then you're free to take the shortcut."

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"the thing is though, as long as you have a weapon that does enough damage to keep 2 from spawning at once, rolling 4k attacks is a piece of cake."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"also, you shouldn't wear your ring of favor and protection until you beat the four kings... you'll need havel's ring so that you can run into close quarters fast enough to avoid the projectile magic attacks they throw at you. medium rolling is also very helpful, because even with full havel's on, some of those attacks can really waste your hp."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,havels still has more magic def than giants regardless of upgrade.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i've done full giants 5minus helm for mask of the child instead, no shield because you need full dps two handedjust put on glass crest for more stamina regen on unequipped offhand and i easily wrecked them in ng7 like a dozen different times. and what? they do way less damage when you are close to them."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"they did not spawn all at the same time at any point, but they did seem to spawn more quickly."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"well yeah, but the way he said it implies he means regular ng 4 kings"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,people keep commenting about ng while the guy i replied to didn't even mention that at all.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"a lot of people seem to. i don't understand it. especially since it isn't a fight with multiple entities ... unless you're too slow. i mean either you're underleveld and haven't upgraded your weapons properly aka you're not dealing enough damage or you're losing to much time getting hit by them instead of dodging their attacks. run to the first, smash his face in asap and he'll be dead easily 5 seconds or more before the second one spawns. it only becomes a multiple bosses fight if you're too slow. and i think players with a tank build have ways of dealing with this boss without rushing him down  seeing as there are a lot of comments here about people facetanking all four all of them with havels or some shit. i just kinda feel like you shouldn't stop trying. stip naked, get a claymore, upgrade it to 10 or some shit, twohand it and go wreck those bastards. just dodge their attacks and attack in between attacks. again i totally understand the problems with fights against multiple bosses but if you have more than one of the 4kings active you already fucked up imo. properly played this is a single entity boss fight."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"so you are telling me. i can make the game more challenging by making it harder for myself. never would have guessed. it's one of the things that annoy me about dark souls. you are not supposed to use magic because that makes the game too easy, or use a bow because the ai is too dumb to figure out where you shot from. you have to intentionally set limits on yourself for the game to actually be challenging."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"i love the conclusion of your post after all you have written before hahaha. pure genius! this game si so frustrating, i needed to take a 6 month pause. it teaches you absolutely nothing and without external sources of information a lot of the games contents are impossible to understand. truly the greatest game of it's time"

Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,1 felt like it had much better level design but i still had fun with 2. decided on another play through thanks to the steam sale on scholar of the first sin. the combat in this game is great. maybe it's nostalgia but demon's souls was my favorite of the series.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,can't do that because resting at a bonfire causes all normal enemies to respawn! so you have to use spells properly and find another bonfire ahead to rest at. or unlock shortcut so you can get back to this area through it and then you can use the closest bonfire to that shortcut.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"no because every time you go back to the bonfire the monsters respawn, which is one of the main reasons ds is so hard."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"use spells to clear area, go back to bonfire, go back to where you were rinse and repeat? it's adorable that you think this game is merciful. generally int focused builds spells scale off int will pick up some sort of melee weapon and imbue it with fire or lightning, which don't scale and thus are equally powerful for anyone who uses them but weaker than normal weapons with high strength or dexterity. in some cases they can also imbue them with magic, which causes them to scale off intelligence, but this is only good on very niche hybrid builds which really aren't popular. casters will generally use their melee weapon to clear easy enemies or enemies who are difficult to target and use their spells for the bigger or more annoying enemies."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2015-09-17,"oh. oh. ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh welp. i've been meaning to try dark souls for some time, but been waiting to get a controller adapter. think i might drag my feet some more now, build up some courage you know?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"what you expect from a short linear game, everyone that was gonna played it probably already played it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"it's not a live service or competitive multiplayer game, are people supposed to keep talking about the game they finished 6 months ago?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"stay multiplayer is doing well, i have 3.6 kd ratio and have 25 victory meows."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"in what way do you see a community building around it? its a short game, minimal replayability, no world building outside of the game and no multilayer. people play it, enjoy it, talk about it and then there's nowhere to go from there."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,you expect it to have growing active players or what?
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"now a days everyone wanna game like they got something to play, but nothing shows up when they move the 'sticks just a bit of ragnarok. and the tarnished act like forgot about stray. i'm sorry. i'm so, so sorry."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"there is no real replayability. play it through for the story once, then what? maybe a speed run? it was a one off came out with a novelty play as a cat and complete a lineal story. there really was no exploration. there was no crazy mechanics. you complete basic puzzles and outrun a swarm and meowed. then got dropped for the next flavor of the month. the game looked great. the music was decent. but it was very basic. occupied a few hours on a weekend and that's it"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"i mean it's a single player game. people play it, finish it and move on. there's no reason to keep playing it for years to come. and there's no real way to milk content out of it for ytbers and streamers either i mean this in a good way btw. same happened with ragnarok. people played it, extremely enjoyed it, finished it and that's it. there's no point playing it further, it's done. now it's just gonna be a couple posts a month about this with a title anyone remember this gem? or heard good things about this game, let's find out if it's really good!. happens to every game."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to play, but nothin comes out when they move the sticks, just a bunch of gacha mechanics, and motha fers act like they forgot about stray!"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"only very small number of games get attention past 6 months after releases. there are exceptions, like horizon and elden ring, but they are more exception than norm."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,it was short. downloaded. played. enjoyed. completed. end of story.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,thats your typical walking sim for ya.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"tons of games like that. critical praise but lost to the sands of time. music, tv, movies, books have a bunch of the same too. the classics and defining moments get remembered and everything else slowly gets forgotten."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,it's a short singleplayer game and it doesn't really have that much of a community like elden ring or gow.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"dude, thats normal. big fuzz for promo, and when its out, its out...standard behavior!?"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"weird, i'm not seeing people talking about elden ring as much and as often as they did near and after launch, guess it sucks. s"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"the game is very short and has essentially no replay value. people played it, enjoyed it, and moved on. simple as that."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"cat people gamers overhyped a pretty much boring game, and gen pop got wiser."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"thats the story of most video games. launch, do a majority of the volume of sales in the first week to month, and be forgotten. absolute rarity to have a game like nms that remains active after so many years."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,now days everybody talk like they got something to say but nothing meows it and when they mash square just a bunch of jibberish and mtherfkers act like like they forgot about stray
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,"i still recommend it to people, but it's a very encapsulated story with only a small amount of replay value and that's only if you missed things on your first run. i'm not surprised at all but i don't think it's necessarily a reflection of whether or not it was a good game. i loved it."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-15,they finishes the game and that was it i dont see the issue
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"it was very, very cute, but a pretty mediocre game. it was fun to play, but you'll never need to play it more than once. and you might literally only recommend it to cat people."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,its a short linear game where you walk around as a cat havent understood the hype when it came out but i certainly understand why people forgot about it already. not because its short and linear but because it looks boring except for the fact.. well that you walk around as a cat.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,certainly one of the most unique games i've played
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,i thought the same the other day. have bought but not started. isn't it the same with valheim though? completely different game but no hype anymore.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,my friends and i collectively agreed it was boring.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,its so niche.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out when they move their lips just a bunch of gibberish and motherfuckers act like they forgot about stray. joking aside, it was a very short and focused linear adventure game. i view it as a tech demo for an upcoming cat mmorpg with realistic cat physics."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,because it was a boring game
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,so you're telling me the 5 hour walking sim in which you couldn't manually jump has not left an impression? color me surprised.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-08-05,"it's a boring game. the hype was just that you play a cat, that's all."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"eh, i havent played it, but it is definitely something ill pick up during a steam sale for 9.99 or something. the game is just too short for 30."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,i keep talking about skyrim.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,you need to divide that kd ratio by 9 due to the nature of cats lives
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,bubut you play as a cat!!!! it's a goty material!!
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,1010
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,i came here for this
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"half life 2 is a single player game. still gets a video essay every 2 or 3 months. stray wasnt just a single player game, it was a really boring single player game"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,gow hype live maybe 2 week.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"there are puzzles and stuff, so it's more fun than you might think. depends on what kind of games you are into tho."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"i played it and loved it but i agree, even one of my favs games that least 230h o wouldnt pay more than 10 for it, and its one of my favs"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,same i would try it when its 0.99
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,nice try todd.
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,you're why we don't have es6...
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,there were gmod addons for that in 2016
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"yeah it gets a video essay now, cause it's like 20 years since release and reviewing old classics is pretty popular. stray is a brand new game. besides, comparing stray to one of the most influential and universally acclaimed video games of all time seems a bit unfair. you put the bar waaay too high man."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-13,in contrast to stray it still is widely more relevant
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"it not comparing the two literally. what i meant was that stray boring and forgotten half life 2 interesting and remembered. or hell, any singeplayer game where you can do something. it didnt flop because its a single player game, it flopped because it was boring"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"just because stray won't be remembered as much as hl2 doesn't mean it's bad or boring. it just means it isn't as good as one of the best games ever made. again, put the bar lower mate."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,it didn't flop though. the game sold around 2.5million copies. to add it also won several awards such as best indie game and ps game of the year
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"i meant they are remembered. interesting games are remembered, one way or the other. of course they dont get video essays but they still have a community or a modding scene"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"replace hl2 with almost any singleplayer game and my example would work. stray wont be remembered because its boring as a game. it will be remembered as the one game with da funny cat. of course a game doesnt need to reinvent the wheel to be interesting, but stray is a walking simulator where you press buttons to jump only when the game wants you to"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"awards mean nothing these days. and dont necro this argument, it was a giant dick measuring contest"
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,"stray is still remembered, just not as much. and that's normal."
Reddit,Adventure,Stray,2023-02-12,dont necro this argument it was a couple hours old...
