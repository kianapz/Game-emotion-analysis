Adventure,Stray,2025-03-17,amazing game. the movement of the cat was perfectly done and the landscape left me in awe at times. never thought a cat and mini robot could make me sad.

Adventure,Stray,2025-01-08,hermoso juego que no te vas a arrepentir de haberlo jugado de principio a fin. en especial si te gustan estos seres tan hermosos de 4 patas.
Adventure,Stray,2024-12-31,stray was a very lovely game with nice graphics and good gameplay. the puzzles were confusing at some points and i didnt know what to do next.
Adventure,Stray,2024-10-13,"stray offers a unique and immersive gaming experience that captivates players with its stunning visuals and engaging narrative. set in a vibrant, dystopian city inhabited by robots, you play as a stray cat navigating the environment, solving puzzles, and uncovering secrets. the game excels in its attention to detail, from the fluid movements of the cat to the atmospheric design of the city, which feels alive and rich with history. the gameplay is a blend of exploration and light platforming, making it accessible yet rewarding. the interactions with the robotic inhabitants add a layer of depth to the story, exploring themes of loneliness and companionship. the companion drone, b12, enhances the experience by providing insights and assistance. overall, stray is a beautifully crafted game that not only entertains but also evokes a sense of wonder and emotional connection, making it a mustplay for both cat lovers and adventure gamers"

Adventure,Stray,2024-06-17,"the game is pretty good, all things considered. the story blew me away. it's a beautiful game, the levels are beautifully drawn out and made. the mechanics can get a little unintuitive at times, though."
Adventure,Stray,2024-06-14,"probably a good game if you just wanna turn off your brain and vibe, but the game has nothing else to offer. there's close to no gameplay. you just  around the environments the whole game. i'd say the game has a nice, relaxed atmosphere to it, but vibes can only carry the game so far. the graphics are definitely nice. yes, it's 2015 level graphics, but the overall art direction is great. except for the cats themselves, which often trigger that uncanny valley feeling in the cutscenes. the music is sparse and amorphous. for the most part it felt very unintrusive, and intentionally so. i'd say it fits the game well, although there's a slim chance i'll ever wanna hear it outside of the game. i have to note though that some musical cues felt off at times. for example, there was this one time when i was just walking down an alley and this really intense action music started playing for some reason, even though there was no action going on in the game at the moment whatsoever. the game design felt inconsistent. a lot of the objects are climbable, while others that look exactly the same aren't for some reason. i wasn't a fan of the scripted events either. there is one early on in the game where you have to run from zurks and i failed it like four times in a row. why? because the moment you have to jump off the ledge you can't press wspace, you have to press just space, unlike the rest of the game where wspace works just fine. it's little inconsistencies like these that really ruin the enjoyment and leave a bitter taste in my mouth. overall, this is a pretty great scifi cat simulator. if you like cats and don't like thinking, i'd say this game is definitely for you. me though, i couldn't help but feel utterly bored."
Adventure,Stray,2024-05-06,"overrated for sure, game is simple but still it's very good looking with great atmosphere and what's the most important it's fun to play."

Adventure,Stray,2024-02-13,jogo de gatinho fofo com robs que sentem mais emoes que muitos humanos por ai.
Adventure,Stray,2024-02-01,"stray es un juego con un potencial que no alcanza. la base de todo es la fantasa de jugar como un gato, pero al final ms que hacer eso lo que tienes es un walking simulator donde el personaje es un gato pero mucho de lo que haces no es lo que hara un gato. aade al walking simulator algo de dilogo para crear una historia super bsica y genrica, algunos puzzles tan sencillos que llamarlos puzzles es una exageracin y algunas secciones un poco ms giles y ms o menos tienes el juego. lo que quedara es la parte de exploracin para encontrar objetos ocultos y as pero esa parte en general es floja, siendo las zonas muy pequeas en su mayora.grficamente el juego est bastante bien ejecutado, especialmente el gato est fantstico, pero a mi a nivel esttico me acab cansando mucho. el sonido es ms bien flojo, con unos efectos escasos y repetitivos, y una msica poco presente y que en general mejor sin ella. y el juego tiene importantes bugs, causando reinicios de ordenador e incluso llegu a un punto en que hay que hablar con un pnj y no quera, siendo imposible avanzar en el juego y me dio demasiada pereza volver a empezarlo prob a reempezar el captulo y mismo problema as que no pude acabarlo y eso que es un juego muy corto tiene un logro para hacerlo en menos de 2  resultado, en mi opinin, es una oportunidad perdida. un 4."

Adventure,Stray,2023-12-29,"i mean... the game is okay, i definitely can't call it bad, but the way everyone says how great it is... i don't have trouble with people having their own opinions, but when you call a game a masterpiece just because the main character is a cute cat is just... meh. i really can't understand it. the game itself is actually not bad for an indie team, but i don't find it special in any way. just a cool game."
Adventure,Stray,2023-12-24,"great game with an original concept and one of the most beautiful environments i have seen in quite some time. its also a beautiful story, beautifully told. however, i was able to comfortably finishing the game in about 7 hours, making it a bit short for my taste. the story would have offered room for a lot more content, and at the price point the game comes in  came in at release, it is just too short. another criticism i should ad is the low difficulty. the game makes it very hard to fail, i would have loved to see some kind of proper platforming system here. all in all the game is definitely worth playing, just get it on sale so you get a good amount of entertainment for your money."

Adventure,Stray,2023-09-13,"i'm not sure what the idea was, i don't understand why this obsession with taking the player so much by the hand, stray isn't that it's a bad game, the problem is that it doesn't do anything with its premise, it all boils down to making three actions throughout the game, the fact of being a cat harms the narrative and it feels as if being a cat had been thought of after starting the development of the game. what i want to say is that being a cat is wasted, specifically it does not fit with what the game proposes, nor with its world, nor with the missions. we are talking about a cat, it should not be able to understand the language or the orders or the motives of the characters. and to make matters worse, we find that absolutely all the missions are to act as a messenger, to go from one place to another to deliver i don't know what to i don't know  is irrelevant who asks you for help, or what is supposed to be happening, it doesn't make much effort to tell an interesting story, but i think that for a certain type of audience it can still be a great game, the world is created with a lot of detail and the artistic direction is impeccable.i think expectations were raised too high and at least for me, it was not what i expected."
Adventure,Stray,2023-08-28,"the most fun i have ever had with adventure game. i sank into this game and forgot about real world. the music, the graphics, story, everything works like a charm here."
Adventure,Stray,2023-08-23,"it was a great experience, super creative game. story 810. the story is about a cat that falls by accident in a big hole and gets trapped in some type of futuristic robotic world that is sealed from the exterior world. in this world, robots live as people in a city that resembles a human city, with favelas inequality, stores, robots singing, dancing, talking, drinking, and being oppressed by other robots. in that context, we find another robot that is actually, plot twist, the last human in the world, and with him, we communicate with other robots and discover little by little what happened in this world. in a nutshell, this is a dystopian world in which every human died from a plague but the robots that served them evolved to inherit the human's habits. the story isn't the best one but works very well, especially the mystery of discovering things slowly. the only thing it lacked was a longer duration since it took just 5h30 to finish it and maybe less disposable characters, since every character except the humanrobot and the cat are disposable even the human is disposable in the ending, and all of them are disposed of without a plausible reason. gameplay 810 no doubt this is one of the most creative games i've played in my life. playing as a cat is very interesting and creative but that is not the only thing that makes this game so creative, it is how he constantly introduces you of new mechanics and discards them, so they don't feel tiresome, for instance first you play just as a cat, then a cat  robot, then you have to flee from minikirby enemies type, then they give you a weapon that can kill them, then they remove this type of enemy and introduce a sentinel type of enemy. but the gameplay consists more of solving puzzles. the puzzles are mostly well done they aren't hard enough to search in the google the solution but they aren't so easy that you don't feel good for solving them. also, there are many situations you need the cat agility, speed and size to solve the puzzleissue and that feels good. but, there are some parts with puzzles that aren't so well done imo and although the gameplay mechanics aren't tiresome these parts can be. overall, it was a great experience."
Adventure,Stray,2023-08-21,"i was totally not expecting this game to be this good. it has amazing art style, great music and environment, really nice graphics and the cat and robots animations are just on point. in the other hand, i would have liked a little bit better to have another 5 hours of gameplay i finished it in 7 hours. maybe a little bit more side quests and finally some more exploration the city was really big from the last mission view. but, the game is still really really good and makes you think. its just beautiful."
Adventure,Stray,2023-08-19,"stray boasts stunning lifelike visuals, butterysmooth gameplay, and dynamic characters. the storyline is rich and engaging. you do not need to be a catlover to enjoy this game. however, those familiar with enduring feline antics will undoubtedly give stray a special place in their collection. it's worth playing more than once with lots of achievements to be earned, and one can only hope that a sequel is in the works for when all offerings have been exhausted. overall, i would rate stray as outstanding. its truly a masterpiece."

Adventure,Stray,2023-05-23,"a fresh adventure game that puts you in the position of a stray cat exploring a postapocalyptic world. read on for a genuine, unbiased review from someone who does not raise any pets. the environment of stray is designed beautifully, with some cyberpunk undertones and many aspects of the game that give the cat dynamic a realistic tune. the game necessitates selfguided exploration and puzzle solving, and spans across a few areas, which start from the bottom of the city, heading up. but despite the hype behind this game due to its main character being an adorable cat which heavily panders to the felineloving crowd, the game as a whole lacks content, and the extremely positive reviews are brought about by that hype and not a pragmatic analysis of the game. the ending was also anticlimactic, ending abruptly and leaving behind unresolved plot holes. there isn't much to do in the world besides blindly going around trying to figure out where to go next, which is where you spend the bulk of your time. the npcs in the game are unironically robotic and all but the main ones give no more than two lines of speech each. you could count the total number of quests that you must go through on a hand or two. overall, the aesthetic the developers were striving for was certainly achieved, but stray remains an early access proof of concept at best. there were many gameplay features introduced that only saw use once or twice. in its current state, i find it highly difficult to recommend this game at msrp. i'd advise waiting until it becomes 15 or less."
Adventure,Stray,2023-05-23,game that many waiting for many systems. graphically par with trilbe aaa titles. gameplay wise not use cat potansial crazy but stil leveling cat game animations bar quaite high to beat. the future theme good but unsual to use this game bcouse we dont have good normal cat game even yet until this.

Adventure,Stray,2023-04-10,"appealing, but too short. a friend suggested this game to me and saidyou will like it. exploration, a calm experience. he was right i enjoyed it. but it is not as great as many people say. when the first cutscene began, the graphics and the chosen colors reminded me of portal 2. the colors and the orangeteallook may be nice, but one the other hand many items, textures and effects are outdated. the game uses ue4, if i am not wrong. the developers achieved the maximum of what the engine offers. but for today's standard, its not enough. on ps4 i had to struggle with many lag issues, one time the game even crashed when entering a map in the sewers chapter. performance problems so long after the release are not good. also many objects have no or less weight, so colliding with the cat turns out ridiculous. the bad mirror animation is not acceptable. the main issue of the game is the very short play time. it took me six hours, you can finish it in four without missing any important part of the game. four hours is not enough to justify the price. when i stumbled on the first memory, the ui predicted that the story would be very short. the game is a walking simulator which is no problem at all. i see a huge problem in the way the cat is placed in the world. the only way to communicate is with a little hovering robot via text boxes like any rpg. this does not fit to the alive, speedy cat. why is the protagonist a cat? why not a dog or a mouse, a squirrel or a human? the story would not be different. furthermore the difficulty of the puzzles and the enemy encounters is way too low. you can finish the game without a single death on the first try without any problems. i like the setting, also the story and the idea is ok, but the whole story is way too predictable. you can summarize the whole plot in a single sentence. there are no eastereggs, not much catrelated, why is there not a single clue about humans owning cats? not a single joke about dogs, mice and so on. i don't understand the sum of good reviews. on the one hand stray is a beautiful and creative game which asks questions about pollution, evolution and the place of animals and humans in the present and future. on the other hand the game is nothing more than a four hour experience cutscenes included with technical issues, mediocore plot and more or less outdated graphics. i guess anything between 6 and 8 points is fair. but 9 or even 10 points are too much for this game. i would compare it to tiny and big. also an indie game, short story, creative way of storytelling, scifisetting. i had fun, i like the game, i will play it a second time, but i expected much more. 710"

Adventure,Stray,2022-11-22,"playing stray felt strange to me. while i was certainly enjoying the experience to some degree, i didn't really feel like i was actually controlling anything. it felt like i was bearing witness to a movie, just with myself telling the character where to go. a sense of disconnect washed over me, as i realised that all i was doing was playing a video game. this isn't exactly a problem for me, but i felt more and more like the game wasn't doing a good job at making me believe that everything that happened was real many parts felt too scripted, as if the only reason for things happening was that they needed to in order for the next thing to happen. while i would say that stray is good, i would also say it suffers greatly due to its somewhat forced design."

Adventure,Stray,2022-10-22,"stray, o que eu posso falar desse jogo? bom, no h muito para falar. se h algo apropiado para fazer aps jogar esse jogo  apenas aplaudir. aplaudir essa obra prima, onde cada frame se transforma numa pintura de um artista renomado. stray trs uma construo de mundo impecvel, onde voc, gatinho vou chamar o gato assim, acorda no mundo exterior, em uma rede de esgoto com seus amigos. aps uma noite de sono, gatinho sai com seu grupo para ir para outro lugar, mas em um deslize, gatinho acaba escorregando e caindo no esgoto. onde ele v algumas criaturas estranhas chamadas de zurk. gatinho, ento, abandonado e sozinho sai sem rumo pela cidade morta. numa caminha rdua e longa, gatinho chega num laboratrio abandonado que, depois de alguns puzzles, gatinha finalmente encontrara o seu melhor amigo, que o acompanharia por toda a sua aventura. com mais um pouco de esforo, gatinho acha uma vila segura, onde, ao chegar nela, todos estranharam gatinho, mas depois eles perceberam que gatinho era apenas um gatinho. o mundo de stray se passa num perodo onde os humanos criaram robs autossuficientes e capazes de os substiturem em todas as atividades. depois de uma possvel epidemia, provavelmente todos os humanos deixaram de existir na terra, deixando o mundo nas mos dos robs, que antes dos humanos perecerem, eram apenas seus assistentes, que estam presos dentro de uma cpula subterrnea de de segurana mxima. como os robs no sabiam nenhum jeito de sair dali, eles formaram nessa cpula, uma civilizao dentro dela. mas alguns robs no aceitaram aceitar e calarse diante desse mistrio que era o mundo exterior.  a que surgem os extramuros, formados por clementine, momo, zbaltazar e doc. eles tem o objetivo de abrir as portas dessa priso para trazer a luz de voltar para a cidade inferior. e em meio a tudo isso, gatinho e b12 tem que achar um jeito de ajudar eles e sair para fora desse muro. e  da onde esse jogo j virou o melhor de 2022. por toda a interao com os npcs, sidequests muito legais de fazer o que  algo muito difcil de ver e principalmente pelo visual. esse jogo traz grficos maravilhosos, no s na quantidade de polgonos ou coisa do tipo, mas em como tudo  colorido, cyberpunk e retr ao mesmo tempo. esse jogo esbanja personalidade em cima de qualquer triple a. prender o jogador ao seus visuais e fazer ele se interessar por a sua histria, criar vnculos com os personagem que voc conhece, fazer a pessoa que est jogando se sentir imerso na gameplay. esses so os pontos mais fortes de stray."
Adventure,Stray,2022-10-21,"this is one of the few games i would say is actually a 1010 while some people say it's too short, i think it ended at the right time because it never overstayed like so many games do nowadays, and it made me want more of the game and world which i think is the perfect way for a game to end"
Adventure,Stray,2022-10-15,"finished the game in 4 hours. the graphics are very nice, but the gameplay is too shallow. the game only requires player to press jump button without care too much about the environment because there's only one way to go through the path. you can't jump without the prompt, so you don't need to figure out the safe way to go to the destination since the game does it for you. it really ruins the gameplay if the game relies on jumping on different platforms. the game can be more fun if it allows player to jump freely and have some traps placed in different areas, so the players will die if they jump carelessly or go to the wrong path. the characters are forgettable because they don't have any unique traits that can represent themselves and they have no voice acting. the 6 points are all for the graphics."
Adventure,Stray,2022-10-11,"a really nice game, the story is good, the ambience and music is superb. the gameplay is also good, i've read some people saying it was just a walking sim, well its not. it doesn't have a super complex gameplay or anything but its far from being a walking sim. you can see the developers put some love into this game, the art, lighting, textures, it looks fantastic. on the other side i think it could use more verticallity, yes is there but in some parts of the game i feel it could have been better with some of that. other thing i think it could made it better is not using automatic jumps."

Adventure,Stray,2022-10-04,"i mean i respect the people who loved it because it has great graphics, okay gameplay, good story etc. but it just wasn't for me, too much riddles, gets slow sometimes and the story doesn't take you in until you've played 2 hours or more. after that it's story becomes pretty good but the first 2 3 hours feels like 10. for me, a mid game but definitely not bad."

Adventure,Stray,2022-09-16,"superbe, histoire magnifique, de beau graphismes dans l'ensemble surtout pour un jeu de ce calibre, la bande son est top, un super jeu d'aventure a faire absolument !"
Adventure,Stray,2022-09-16,"the story of the game is good but the gameplay is mediocre, once you lose a place it is impossible to find it again and there is nothing to show you where you are going"
Adventure,Stray,2022-09-16,"610 stray is based on an interesting concept which is not that easy to be stretched into a full game and that is exactly where this game becomes a boring shallow piece of game that hides itself behind good graphics and cat protagonists. the game is introduced to you by smooth controls and a gorgeous environment with beautiful lighting. the artists had a good understanding of colour pallets and were pretty successful with setting the most appropriate mood. at first you are lost in a beautiful city which appears to be mysterious and interesting. but when the game goes on a little more, dialogues are introduced which is to be honest a big slap in the face. the reading completely interrupts the pace of the game and really draws you out of that detailed world. the story again like the game itself carries a fresh idea, a unique take on post apocalyptic world that truly makes you think but when it comes to actually turning the idea into a full story, i think it wasnt good at all. stray wasnt able to get me interested in the story even a little bit. there are a good amount of characters but all of them are so hollow and soulless and they all struggle so hard with making the player care about them. there are a bunch of moments where you are supposed to get emotional but believe me you wont feel a thing. now is the time for the real stuff. i mean gameplay. well, theres none of that. about fifteen minutes of stealth and thats it, for the rest of the game just turn the camera a little, press the jump button, and the game will do the rest for you. overall stray manages to take you in an atmospheric, well made world with magnificent sound design and nice music and then  the illusion with glitches, stupid dialogues, boring gameplay, and so on."
Adventure,Stray,2022-09-11,"i honestly don't know what to say. this game is a masterpiece, by far. everything is perfect in this game. the story is immersive as it's sad at some moment and very satisfying at other moments."

Adventure,Stray,2022-08-13,"un juego unico protagonizado por un gato stray cuenta la historia de un gato que se separo de su manada tras caer en una alcantanilla de una ciudad abandonada llena de robots. el desenlace de esta es muy buena, super lineal con muy pocas misiones secundarias que te hagan perder el hilo, es muy interesante, me hubiera gustado que se conociera mas sobre la historia de los antiguos y del gato ya que ni siquiera sabemos su nombre. tiene una duracion de 6 u 8 horas aprox con respecto a los graficos es una obra de arte, le falta un poco de oclusion ambiental y refinado en el pelaje del gato, increible que se le haya pasado ese detalle, los escenarios estan excelentemente bien detallados, tanto que hasta te cuentan parte de la historia, dando vida al mundo y a los personajes robots. el diseo de arte de este juego es admirable por otras empresas, insolito que no tenga modo foto. algo que no me gusto es el recorte que tiene en los ultimos 40 minutos, en esa parte se presentan escenarios nuevos muy detallados importantes para la historia pero pasan super desapercibidos por el poco tiempo que estamos en el. lo mismo ocurre en parte con la jugabilidad, durante el juego se nos presentan mecanicas de disparo, de sigilo, de escapar, puzzles, pero son muy poco aprovechadas, las usamos 1030 minutos y listo, se me hizo un desperdicio. la jugabilidad es muy buena, imita muy bien las animaciones y gestos de un gato, es medio tosco en los saltos, incluso hay un boton exclusivo para maullar, que no aporta nada mas que para el sigilo, pero me la pase usandolo en momentos donde creeria que un gato maullaria en la vida real, dandole vida al personaje que es muy callado de por si. el juego es muy facil, super intuitivo, no aporta ningun desafio para el jugador, es un walking simulator, no hay para elegir una dificultad. un juego facil de recomendar para cualquier persona, super entretenido y sin desafios para que no te estreses jeje"
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-13,"absolute trash do not recommend this game at all if you value gameplay in any way whatsoever. game may have a good atmosphere and story but none of that matters when the gameplay is extremely tedious and boring. the entire gameplay loop is this jump, climb, talk, fetch quest, repeat. if you want fun gameplay go play something else that'll keep you occupied for more than a few hours. games are supposed to be fun to play. there's none of that over here. there's no fun in any of the game mechanics of which there are only 2 it's just not a fun game at all. use that 30 and save it for something else."

Adventure,Stray,2022-08-04,"beatuiful, beautiful visuals make this game a treat to play. the cat is also very fun to control and watch. the game is very short and sweet, but i feel like it loses a bit of focus on our cat protagonist, mainly making it a more humanrobot story game. it also resorts to more traditional storytelling with textboxes and such, instead of telling the story through a more enviromental way, like inside or journey. the ending is also ambiguous for not benefit at all."

Adventure,Stray,2022-08-03,"stray is a fairly short, but thoroughly entertaining action adventure about a cat lost in a mysterious city of robots. the game oozes charm and cozy atmosphere, while combining that with a spooky cybercity vibe. the game mechanics are wonderfully catlike and almost always engaging. there are some frustrating bits later on, but the game is short enough that most anyone could play through it eventually. add to this some excellent, poignant storytelling and stray is a real winner. it's a unique and charming game that doesn't over complicate its mechanics or overstay its welcome. i honestly wish there were more games like this."
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-02,"stray's game is very exciting, the gameplay is at a fairly good level, as is the plot, but in some places the game does not work, let's say there is no such button where you need to jump because of which you can die, the fact that the cat copes with all the difficulties suggests that that the game is not realistic, how much realism out of 10? smartest cat in the world as for the graphics, the graphics are soapy, its hard to watch not the level of 2022, the dialogues are meager, at some points its very boring to read them. the game has plot holes that distract from immersion in the world of cyberpunk."
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-02,"one of the greatest walking simulator games. graceful cat, nice story, great pacing. just purrfect"
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-02,"i was absolutely blown away by this game! it's like a perfect blend of the last of us and uncharted, two of my alltime favorites, but with a twist  you get to play as a cat, which is just purrfect! the difficulty level is spot on, with some parts being a breeze and others offering just the right amount of challenge. the only downside? it ends too soon! i'm crossing my fingers for a dlc because i need more! i breezed through this game in just 13 hours over two days, which is a rarity for me since i usually tire out after 30 minutes of gaming."
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-02,this game is clearly one of the best games ever created. i have played countless of excellent games since the 80s and this is one of the very few each decade that offers something original to some extend at least. the main reasons it doesn't get a perfect score is that a part of its gameplay is to some extend derivative because the quest design is relatively predictable and b a minority of the secret memoriesareas were placed in the game in a way that it was more tedious to find them than to enjoy the rest of the game but it wasn't too bad.

Adventure,Stray,2022-08-01,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-01,"i had a good time playing it. the controls feel responsive and you absolutely feel like a cat playing it. you can even scratch carpets and doors! and there's a meow button, that's important! i also liked the environments and characters. it felt very unique, which kept me interested in learning what it was all about. the graphics are great, even on the steam deck where i played it. and the audio and music fits well with the visual side. it's all very well designed. the game makes good use of the implemented mechanics. they did a very good job of revealing a mechanic, let you play with it for a while, and then expand that same mechanic, which made it feel new again. they do this several times, and it works well to avoid gameplay fatigue. my only, tiny, gripe, is with the ending. it was a decent ending, but it could have been expanded for a better emotional impact. it did feel a tiny bit rushed. if you like relatively chill gaming experiences, with puzzles, some action, an interesting world and mostly cozy characters, this is the game for you."
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-01,"even if you completely remove the story, the experience stray creates of being a cat is worth the price alone imo. the way each set is designed and the way you move through it oozes craftsmanship and a profound obsession for cats. dogs tend to get more love in games because they're more naturally aligned with the function of an npc companion, so cats aren't as common to begin with, but i'll be damned if this isn't the best darn video game cat ever made. oh, and the story's great, just sayin'."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-31,"an amazing game where you play a cat. story is incredible and touching. the atmosphere is beautiful, and the game had the right difficulty when it came to puzzle solving."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-30,"stray was a good game, but not one that fully embraced its concept. a cat simulator this is not while you might happen to be controlling a creature that looks like one, this is clearly a cat with human purpose and motivations. that's disappointing i had hoped for more cleverness in the puzzle solving, and more unique mechanics because of the character. however it becomes very clear early on that this is just a puzzleexploration game where you happen to have the ability to go where others can't reach easily. it's challenging to say more without spoilers, but it's a shame they didn't make the game more unique to the character. it was never going to be perfectyou are a human controlling a cat avatar after allbut this feels like it didn't even make an attempt. still on the good side of things the game plays well, is presented well, and is fun to play. the story it tells is good and engaging. the length is extremely appropriate for this type of game, and it never felt like a slog in any regard. i'd still recommend it, but certainly temper your expectations."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-28,the only gameplay this game has is you holding shift and spacebar and watching intentionally slow cutscenes
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-28,"game is beautiful in details, vibe is there, especially for love death robots fans, but it lacks a bit of bravery to make it even more a catgame. if you change the protagonist to any other creature that can climb around effortlessly lets say prince of persia you wouldn't miss anything, and that's a disappointment. also, collecting all the memories and badges without any reward, not giving any kind of multiple ending, not even finishing the game properly is a letdown that would bring game under 8 mark. but, i support the studio, support the idea and hopefully they will make a sequel or some dlc that could fix the things that are missing at this moment. physics is honestly a let down in 2022 and the cat... well... it does look like a cat, but i did expect a bunch more of freedom what it will do except for scratching here and there and stuck a head in a bag. however, i did enjoy the game. not as much as i would like to as i am a cat owner, but still, i would gladly recommend it to the others. nice experience"

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-28,"i was very interested in stray when it was first announced publicly. the idea of playing as a cat was very interesting, and i tried to avoid spoilers as much as possible about the game before playing it. unfortuately, i think that was a very bad mistake this game is honestly quite mediocre and honestly, boring. the problem is that the most basic idea  the idea of being a stray cat walking through a futuristic city  sounds really neat, but when you actually reflect on the question of sure, but whats the actual game like? you start to realize that, for all that that sounds like a really cool premise for a game, it doesnt actually seem to suggest much in the way of meaningful gameplay. what do you do in this game? not much of interest, honestly. the platforming, such as it is, is extremely simple you can only jump up and down a certain amount, and only to platforms  the cat does not jump independent of going to and from places, so the whole game is actually pretty rigidly controlled rather than open. you cant climb, you cant fight except for a brief, very simple minigame you actually get an achievement for skipping, and which consists of nothing more than shining a flashlight on enemies vulnerable to light in one chapter, and you cant really do anything sophisticated because, lets face it, you are a cat. the result, then, is a game with very limited gameplay  some fetchquests, some predesigned moving around in the environment, and like 1.5 chapters of mandatory stealth section which is quite basic. thats it. now, you might think that this is primarily a walking simulator but honestly, it is bad at the story as well, and the game itself is surprisingly ugly. the problem is that the city is in ruins and the only people you can communicate with are robots, which means that there is no dialogue where you move around and they are talking with you, you have to stop to talk every single time, as you have to read it. there is no voice acting, and the characters are all very flat and uninteresting  none of them have more than one or two personality traits, and so it is hard to really care when good things or bad things happen to them. the dialogue is limited, and most of the robots just say repetitive things. it doesn't even deliver on the futuristic bit  the city itself is very mundane in many respects, and doesn't feel very futuristic at all. theres no real spark of imagination here  its like they came up with the basic idea then executed it in the most boring way possible. this does not feel like a world that you are living in, but is very videogamey, and the core plot  getting back outside of the city  is very, very basic and is nothing interesting. the city itself has a very boring backstory  we only get a tiny amount of it, we dont get an explanation of what happened to the world, what we do see of it makes little to no sense, and theres just nothing to really latch onto. the world, too, is quite ugly, because it is all set in a dark city, and while the idea of being lit up by, say, futuristic neon lights and holograms seems cool, it actually mostly is just boring slumish and boring concrete and fence areas  nothing particularly interesting. they even stick in plants, with the explanation that somehow humans genetically engineered them so they didnt need sunlight anymore. but overall, this game is just bland. its not very long, which is a good thig because there isnt much game there, but it isnt very good, either. this is very much an experience you can skip. i thought the idea of playing as a cat would be cool, too, but theres just no substance here  the world is too boring to carry the bad gameplay, and the gameplay is too bad to carry the story."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"a very good game, but at the same time quite sad. i had a lot of fun playing it. went through it in a day."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"stray has been an amazing game the story is deep and can create an emotional connection to players. the connection and emotion between each character feel deep. the robots interacting and trying to mimic their ancestors humans are so to the pointfear, joy, and meow. there was the suspense of keeping the cat out of harm no matter what it was almost like i could feel this feline creature's skin when it was getting hurt. music can't be much better than this amazing sound design!"
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,this has been a pretty disappointing game due to the fact that the entire presentation and gameplay mechanics get boring really fast. after the first hour you get used to the boring and cheap mechanics such as jumping and meowing to open things. sadly in such games it would have been a way better choice to remove the robot entirely since it's very cheap to tell this type of story via text and now the surrounding environment. also you are a cat so why the hell are they making you into some sort of save the world protagonist which fits really badly into the story. it's a meh game.
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"no spoilers this game is quite short 48 hours, but it's very good. i hope they release dlc for it. i will same that quite a few puzzles aren't exactly user friendly. i had to look a few things up, but overall it's very well designed. i cried at the ending, but i won't say more and risk spoiling anything. i'm happy with it. i'd give it a 10 if it were longer, but a 9 is good considering it's not a full price game. the game is steam deck compatible. 80 resolution scale, all settings on high, vsync enabled resolution cannot be set on deck. it''s fixed"
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,short lived relatively easygoing cat fun that i needed more of. desperately needs a photo mode.

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"the best part about stray is the attention to detail regarding the main character. you play as a cat. not a superpowered cat or an anime cat or an alien cat or genetically enhanced cat. no, you play as a normal cat. you eventually team up with an ai drone that rides in a little adorable harness but you, the cat, never change. you hit a button to meow. you can rub up against legs, take naps, get your head stuck in a paper bag. all the things that make cats great. and all the animations look amazing. the amazing story unfolds around this everyday very normal cat and the resulting dynamics of this experience are really phenomenal. i would even go as far to say this could easily become a completely new genre. meow."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"one of the most overhyped games ever. the game basically gives you nothing and it's more a robot game where you play as a cat than being a cat game. graphics aren't even that great, gameplay is very boring, and story is just bad. what i liked was level design, but i could've been improved by giving us free jump. also the jumping button doesn't seem to work everytime and it doesn't even show up, thus making you go to wrong directions cuz you didn't know you could go there. i can't justify any more than 310 fur this."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-27,"could have been longer, but it's still game of the year so far. absolutely amazing."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"best game for a long time. beautiful graphics, interesting plot and incredible main character 3 passed in one breath."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"stray is just a wonderful game! its hallmark is simplicity and soulfulness. among all the latest aaa projects, you will not find one in which you will experience the same emotions as in stray."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"to give this game anything but a 10 would be a disgrace to game developers around the globe. it is a very fun game, with a unique twist about robots being trapped in a huge locked city, which i have not seen in any othere game. the ending is very touching but i wont spoil it. it had some decent puzzles, reletavly fun and it was pretty easy to figure out where you needed to go and why. the characters were...alright theyre robots dont expect much. the graphics were amazing. however i do wish they put a tad bit more detail into the cat but eh. the story? 1010 the graphics? 1010 the gameplay? 910 the ending? 1110. really fun and a semigreat game for children, although it might scare them cause some of the creatures are pretty spooky."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-26,"haters will call it a no depth cat walking simulator. it would already be a 1010 just for that, but it's not true at all. the story is good enough, you get exactly what you'd expect for a cat protagonist and then more, with a wellcrafted setting and premise. comparing stray to a triple a is just not fair at all. it's a very well executed project within its own niche."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"really a top game, the atmosphere and the cyberpunk aesthetics is extremely well retranscribed, much better than a certain other one that everyone knows... the animation of the characters and the writing is also a good point, it remains light but pleasant all the same. the soundtrack is superb, minimalist but soaring, by small touches, it corresponds well to the atmosphere and makes the whole coherent with the world of stray. optimization on pc is pretty good, despite the constant framerate drops between 26  30, in short! i run it in 40 fps with a small configuration 8gb of ram, gtx 750, it's good to take! the price is also respectable and very correct, they do not stuff themselves like many others around 20  30 ! the only small problem is the life span, but it is of good quality it's the right compromise. hats off to these french designers, thank you! to give example in term of creativity and imagination to other studios  thanks for the gem, surely my goty 2022!"

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"great gameplay mixed with poor physics and bad performance. it's okay, but there were places where my fps dropped sub 20 and im playing on fairly decent hardware. graphics are awesome, graphic really clicks in. another issue is that game is simply short, it lacks content, there could have been more. it has no potential to be replayed, there is nothing that would make me want to start over because collectibles are easy to be found, memories also aren't that tough. overall it's okay, but it's not great, and definitelly it doesn't deserve 1010 because cute cat cannot be a lever of whole show."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"ce jeu est intressant, amusant et carrment adorable. jouer en tant que chat est unique et j'aime vraiment l'exprience globale. et l'obtenir gratuitement avec la playstation plus est gnial."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"stray bukanlah game yang hanya sekedar menjadi kucing, melainkan game ini juga memberikan pengalaman yang menarik. dalam segi gameplay, game ini merupakan game platformer dengan diiringi dengan puzzle yang membuat gamenya tidak hanya jalan atau melompat atau mengeong saja. game ini juga memiliki latar cerita yang dikemas dengan baik yang membuat pemain merasa penasaran dalam setiap kelanjutan ceritanya. satu hal yang menurut saya menonjol dari stray adalah atmosfer yang diberikan game ini, tema apocalypse cyberpunk bekerja dengan sangat baik, ditambah dengan audio dan visual yang indah membuat stray sangat layak untuk dimainkan. 8.610"

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-24,"stray is a truly new game. not another remaster of a remaster, but a fullfledged, new game in 2022. stray is the kind of game in which you want to take a gamepad, relax and immerse yourself in a cyberpunk city. unfortunately, the game has the disadvantages of all modern games  optimization. even despite the fact that it is better than all modern games, it is not of the best quality. stray  adventure together with a cute cat. the game contains some elements of puzzles that dilute the gameplay. this gameplay is done at a fairly high level. also in stray you will find fascinating characters that are not similar to each other. in my opinion, stray is one of the best games that 2022 could give us."

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,el mejor juego que puedes jugar yo lo comore por que lo vi en un trailer y me encarie mucho xln el juego y su hermoso gato y el realismo que le dan
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"all flash, but zero substance. a very simple and dull game that has no depth to it at all. i'd go as far as to call it a walking simulator. only reason it's getting high ratings is because... cat."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,"it's a masterpiece. the game has everything  its atmosphere, level design, graphics and gameplay, as well as a lot of attention was paid to the main character, the cat here is very realistic and behaves the same as in real life. i also like the length of the game, i finished it in 8.5 hours, the developers don't add a lot of water to the game, but rather briefly tell a great story. the locations and the plot are great, you just feel like you live there yourself. 1010, the best quest i've ever played. i really hope that stray will be the game of the year 2022."
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-23,i would like to have a cat to play this game with him again 3 game of the year my friends
