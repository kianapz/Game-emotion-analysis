MichonaPlay,2025-01-08,100,Hermoso juego que no te vas a arrepentir de haberlo jugado de principio a fin. En especial si te gustan estos seres tan hermosos de 4 patas.
basic12345,2024-12-31,90,Stray was a very lovely game with nice graphics and good gameplay. The puzzles were confusing at some points and I didnt know what to do next.
Entity8238,2024-10-13,100,"""Stray"" offers a unique and immersive gaming experience that captivates players with its stunning visuals and engaging narrative. Set in a vibrant, dystopian city inhabited by robots, you play as a stray cat navigating the environment, solving puzzles, and uncovering secrets. The game excels in its attention to detail, from the fluid movements of the cat to the atmospheric design of the city, which feels alive and rich with history. The gameplay is a blend of exploration and light platforming, making it accessible yet rewarding. The interactions with the robotic inhabitants add a layer of depth to the story, exploring themes of loneliness and companionship. The companion drone, B12, enhances the experience by providing insights and assistance. Overall, ""Stray"" is a beautifully crafted game that not only entertains but also evokes a sense of wonder and emotional connection, making it a must-play for both cat lovers and adventure gamers"
CN_FurryGamer,2024-10-03,90,^百兽^ - 不客观评测：早在这款游戏刚上架steam的时候就开始关注了，也是第一时间写了鉴赏家推荐（第一个写的还是第几写的来着），在游戏发布时也是回家就入手了。整体来说是上乘的步行模拟器，在这样一个架空人类的末世废土、机械纪元，扮演赛博小猫探索世界的真相，回归大地眼前绿意盎然，没有人类的世界早已恢复了生机！光是想一想都的让人无比热血沸腾，那种重见天日的喜悦难以言表，内心压抑的情感也在这一刻迸发！让我回忆起了当年玩传送门，重见天日刺眼的光和麦田映入眼帘，视线一片朦胧，机器人也为我喝彩歌唱...扯远了，虽然游戏上乘，潜行、解密、探索、赛博朋克、猫一个不少，甚至还身披机炮爆浆鼠群，但是，我对于画面还是有一些小失望的，最高画质的毛发质感在动物模型中显得有些太次太掉价，即便把我的高刷屏换成2k屏也还是感到遗憾。
Vuduchuysenberg,2024-09-08,100,"As a cat owner, I highly recommend this game, love the cyber punk vibe, although the main storyline didnt dig deep but definately worth a try <3"
lvcazz,2024-08-28,90,"Un videojuego con una historia, personajes y arte preciosos, me encanto, la historia que se narra es intrigante ala vez que conmovedora, la estética del juego y su ambientación son muy bonitos, un juego para disfrutar"
vova22379,2022-07-22,0,"Despite its unique premise, the game suffers from shallow gameplay, dull puzzles, and a lackluster story."
NasiPadang,2024-07-19,100,"Game ini sangat menyenangkan untuk dimainkan. Dunianya yang begitu luas dan hal-hal yang interaktif membuat kita dapat mengeskplornya lebih dalam. Game yang menyentuh hati saya saat sudah selesai memainkannya. Bahkan saya tertarik untuk mengulangi permainan tersebut dikarenakan masih banyak yang belum saya eksplor dan dalami. Worth it bagi kalian mainkan dan habiskan waktu. Grafiknya tetap bagus walau tidak terlalu berat. Dalam penilaian saya; Genre:8/10 Kontrol dan sistem:8,6/10 Grafik:8,1/10 Cerita:10/10"

Khimares,2024-06-17,90,"The game is pretty good, all things considered. The story blew me away. It's a beautiful game, the levels are beautifully drawn out and made. The mechanics can get a little unintuitive at times, though."
Samvell,2024-06-14,40,"Probably a good game if you just wanna turn off your brain and vibe, but the game has nothing else to offer. There's close to no gameplay. You just **** around the environments the whole game. I'd say the game has a nice, relaxed atmosphere to it, but vibes can only carry the game so far. The graphics are definitely nice. Yes, it's 2015 level graphics, but the overall art direction is great. Except for the cats themselves, which often trigger that uncanny valley feeling in the cutscenes. The music is sparse and amorphous. For the most part it felt very unintrusive, and intentionally so. I'd say it fits the game well, although there's a slim chance I'll ever wanna hear it outside of the game. I have to note though that some musical cues felt off at times. For example, there was this one time when I was just walking down an alley and this really intense ""action"" music started playing for some reason, even though there was no action going on in the game at the moment whatsoever. The game design felt inconsistent. A lot of the objects are climbable, while others that look exactly the same aren't for some reason. I wasn't a fan of the scripted events either. There is one early on in the game where you have to run from zurks and I failed it like four times in a row. Why? Because the moment you have to jump off the ledge you can't press W+Space, you have to press just Space, unlike the rest of the game where W+Space works just fine. It's little inconsistencies like these that really ruin the enjoyment and leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Overall, this is a pretty great sci-fi cat simulator. If you like cats and don't like thinking, I'd say this game is definitely for you. Me though, I couldn't help but feel utterly bored."
G4MBL3R,2024-05-06,70,"Overrated for sure, game is simple but still it's very good looking with great atmosphere and what's the most important it's fun to play."
antonsalogvinov,2024-05-03,80,"Прекрасное приключение, балдел 2 вечера. Даже возникло желание впервые в жизни выбить платину в игре, благо делается это не трудно."
Kipperfaust,2024-03-26,90,"Short story, but incredible experience with a fantastic story and setting. Expectations were high after hearing good things, and it somehow managed to exceed them. This is my 2022 Game of the Year."
JiggilyMiggily,2024-03-07,90,"Even being centered around a cat, this game has some incredible moments. Some catch you off guard and turn the involvement and pressure up, while others deliver unique and incredible emotions."
paulopcoj,2024-02-16,100,"zerei 3 vezes ja, fantastico a historia,gameplay...tudo nesse jogo é incrivel"
RodrigoKosteski,2024-02-13,100,Jogo de gatinho fofo com robôs que sentem mais emoções que muitos humanos por ai.
Sepherim,2024-02-01,40,"Stray es un juego con un potencial que no alcanza. La base de todo es la fantasía de jugar como un gato, pero al final más que hacer eso lo que tienes es un walking simulator donde el personaje es un gato pero mucho de lo que haces no es lo que haría un gato. Añade al walking simulator algo de diálogo para crear una historia super básica y genérica, algunos puzzles tan sencillos que llamarlos puzzles es una exageración y algunas secciones un poco más ágiles y más o menos tienes el juego. Lo que quedaría es la parte de exploración para encontrar objetos ocultos y así pero esa parte en general es floja, siendo las zonas muy pequeñas en su mayoría.Gráficamente el juego está bastante bien ejecutado, especialmente el gato está fantástico, pero a mi a nivel estético me acabó cansando mucho. El sonido es más bien flojo, con unos efectos escasos y repetitivos, y una música poco presente y que en general mejor sin ella. Y el juego tiene importantes bugs, causando reinicios de ordenador e incluso llegué a un punto en que hay que hablar con un PNJ y no quería, siendo imposible avanzar en el juego y me dio demasiada pereza volver a empezarlo (probé a reempezar el capítulo y mismo problema) así que no pude acabarlo y eso que es un juego muy corto (tiene un logro para hacerlo en menos de 2 **** resultado, en mi opinión, es una oportunidad perdida. Un 4."

PocketWave,2024-01-30,100,"Beatiful graphic, it is the most beautiful game I have ever seen. Thats all. :)"

Kramer76,2024-01-03,80,"ero scettico su questo gioco ma ho voluto provarlo e sono rimasto sorpreso,gioco carino,semplice e rilassante con una storia che tutto sommato è molto carina,conisgliato anche per chi vuole giocare a qualcosa di leggero,"
bray34,2023-12-29,60,"I mean... The game is okay, I definitely can't call it bad, but the way everyone says how great it is... I don't have trouble with people having their own opinions, but when you call a game a masterpiece just because the main character is a cute cat is just... Meh. I really can't understand it. The game itself is actually not bad for an indie team, but I don't find it special in any way. Just a cool game."
phantomromano,2023-12-24,70,"Great game with an original concept and one of the most beautiful environments I have seen in quite some time. It´s also a beautiful story, beautifully told. However, I was able to comfortably finishing the game in about 7 hours, making it a bit short for my taste. The story would have offered room for a lot more content, and at the price point the game comes in / came in at release, it is just too short. Another criticism I should ad is the low difficulty. The game makes it very hard to fail, I would have loved to see some kind of proper platforming system here. All in all the game is definitely worth playing, just get it on sale so you get a good amount of entertainment for your money."

Piotrusalkee,2023-11-12,90,"Szczerze, gra mnie mega pozytyw nie zaskoczyła. Spodziewałem się że po 30 minutach mi się ona znudzi, ale wciągnęła mnie na kilka godzin nawet kilkanaście. Rozgrywka jest mega przyjemna, relaksująca, wciągająca. Rozgrywka jest po prostu rewelacja. Do fabuły nie ma miejsca gdzie można się przyczepić (no chyba że do tego, iż jest dość krótka. Jedynym minusem były moje własne oczekiwania wobec wyglądu grafiki. Spodziewałem się że gra będzie ładniejsza, ale i tak bardzo dobrze wygląda. Sam kot jest ładny ale podczas niektórych cut-scen, kociak wyglądał dziwnie. Szczerze polecam każdemu, gra warta swojej ceny."
Broyax,2023-11-09,20,"Oh qu’il est mignon le minou ! et rare en plus… parce qu’un rouquin tigré comme ça, j’en ai jamais vu… mais le voici perdu dans une ville abandonnée… mais qui peut devenir hostile, car elle n’est pas abandonnée par tout le monde ou plutôt par tous ces bidules ici et là !Lesquels vous sautent dessus… et là, c’est le drame ! et du coup, ils ont gâché leur gentil simulateur de promenade, c’est ballot quand même… ils l’ont gâché avec ces saloperies et en même temps des sortes d’énigmes pour s’en sortir, je **** qui somnolais gentiment devant ce truc assez dépaysant, ma foi -et fort joliment fait en plus. La patte artistique est là, servie par une technique pas mal du tout en fait. Moi qui somnolais à moitié donc, car le simulateur de promenade est propice à la somnolence, forcément. Et voilà qu’ils me font chier avec leurs peluches enragées qui sautent et tuent mon chat !!Et là, c’est le drame ! désinstallation immédiate et note-sanction en guise de punition (et inversement). Mais j’irai jusqu’à deux quand même, oui deux points, car il ne faut point être trop sévère non plus. Quand même. Ils ont tout gâché, la promenade est foutue, retour à la maison, mon chaton !"
mfdez57,2023-10-28,100,"It's a really fun, relaxing, simple game that, even though I have no interest in cats, really caught my attention and I enjoyed it. I don't remember any game where an animal is handled so well, it's also quite fun to explore and interact with the other robot characters."
D4,2023-10-19,80,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
totifoqs,2023-09-30,90,"Even when it was still known as the HK Project or Hong Kong Project, Stray caught my attention a lot. Not because I'm an unconditional animal lover, but because it was a feast for my gaming-loving side. In a saturated market, where the focus is increasingly on maximizing profits at any cost, often disregarding the consumer, indie games end up being the bastions of the art of game development. And Stray, without a doubt, easily stands out as one of the best games I've ever played."

sanchezmikel,2023-09-13,50,"I'm not sure what the idea was, I don't understand why this obsession with taking the player so much by the hand, Stray isn't that it's a bad game, the problem is that it doesn't do anything with its premise, it all boils down to making three actions throughout the game, the fact of being a cat harms the narrative and it feels as if being a cat had been thought of after starting the development of the game. What I want to say is that being a cat is wasted, specifically it does not fit with what the game proposes, nor with its world, nor with the missions. We are talking about a cat, it should not be able to understand the language or the orders or the motives of the characters. And to make matters worse, we find that absolutely all the missions are to act as a messenger, to go from one place to another to deliver I don't know what to I don't know **** is irrelevant who asks you for help, or what is supposed to be happening, it doesn't make much effort to tell an interesting story, but I think that for a certain type of audience it can still be a great game, the world is created with a lot of detail and the artistic direction is impeccable.I think expectations were raised too high and at least for me, it was not what I expected."
methodyy,2023-08-28,90,"The most fun i have ever had with adventure game. I sank into this game and forgot about real world. The music, the graphics, story, everything works like a charm here."
CoolBR,2023-08-23,80,"It was a great experience, super creative game. Story 8/10. The story is about a cat that falls by accident in a big hole and gets trapped in some type of futuristic robotic world that is sealed from the exterior world. In this world, robots live as people in a city that resembles a human city, with favelas (inequality), stores, robots singing, dancing, talking, drinking, and being oppressed by other robots. In that context, we find another robot that is actually, plot twist, the last human in the world, and with him, we communicate with other robots and discover little by little what happened in this world. In a nutshell, this is a dystopian world in which every human died from a plague but the robots that served them evolved to inherit the human's habits. The story isn't the best one but works very well, especially the mystery of discovering things slowly. The only thing it lacked was a longer duration since it took just 5h30 to finish it and maybe less disposable characters, since every character except the human-robot and the cat are disposable (even the human is disposable in the ending), and all of them are disposed of without a plausible reason. Gameplay 8/10 No doubt this is one of the most creative games I've played in my life. Playing as a cat is very interesting and creative but that is not the only thing that makes this game so creative, it is how he constantly introduces you of new mechanics and discards them, so they don't feel tiresome, for instance first you play just as a cat, then a cat + robot, then you have to flee from ""mini-kirby"" enemies type, then they give you a weapon that can kill them, then they remove this type of enemy and introduce a sentinel type of enemy. But the gameplay consists more of solving puzzles. The puzzles are mostly well done they aren't hard enough to search in the Google the solution but they aren't so easy that you don't feel good for solving them. Also, there are many situations you need the cat agility, speed and size to solve the puzzle/issue and that feels good. But, there are some parts with puzzles that aren't so well done IMO and although the gameplay mechanics aren't tiresome these parts can be. Overall, it was a great experience."
TarquiF,2023-08-21,80,"I was totally not expecting this game to be this good. It has amazing art style, great music and environment, really nice graphics and the cat and robots animations are just on point. In the other hand, I would have liked a little bit better to have another 5 hours of gameplay (I finished it in 7 hours). Maybe a little bit more side quests and finally some more exploration (The city was really big from the last mission view). But, the game is still really really good and makes you think. Its just beautiful."
cassaby,2023-08-19,100,"Stray boasts stunning life-like visuals, buttery-smooth gameplay, and dynamic characters. The storyline is rich and engaging. You do not need to be a cat-lover to enjoy this game. However, those familiar with enduring feline antics will undoubtedly give Stray a special place in their collection. It's worth playing more than once with lots of achievements to be earned, and one can only hope that a sequel is in the works for when all offerings have been exhausted. Overall, I would rate Stray as ""outstanding."" It’s truly a masterpiece."
apokalipto,2023-08-18,90,Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.
Oscardft,2023-08-08,100,El mejor juego de la última década bueno entra mínimo en top 5 Desde su historia gráficos animación y jugabilidad todo va bien todo combina muy bien Adoro este juego. Mi respetos la verdad y espero que salga la segúnda parte

heykiddo,2023-06-22,80,"Meow meow meow meow Love this game, but it's a bit monotonous in my opinion"
Art_Nazimov,2023-06-15,100,"Эта игра хоть и проходится за 5-6 часов,но дарит незабываемые эмоции, которые не смогла подарить не одна новая или старая игра AAA. А концовка разорвало моё сердце ДВАЖДЫ! Короче, не играл- поиграй."
nitorita,2023-05-23,70,"A fresh adventure game that puts you in the position of a stray cat exploring a post-apocalyptic world. Read on for a genuine, unbiased review from someone who does not raise any pets. The environment of Stray is designed beautifully, with some cyberpunk undertones and many aspects of the game that give the cat dynamic a realistic tune. The game necessitates self-guided exploration and puzzle solving, and spans across a few areas, which start from the bottom of the city, heading up. But despite the hype behind this game due to its main character being an adorable cat (which heavily panders to the feline-loving crowd), the game as a whole lacks content, and the extremely positive reviews are brought about by that hype and not a pragmatic analysis of the game. The ending was also anticlimactic, ending abruptly and leaving behind unresolved plot holes. There isn't much to do in the world besides blindly going around trying to figure out where to go next, which is where you spend the bulk of your time. The NPCs in the game are unironically robotic and all but the main ones give no more than two lines of speech each. You could count the total number of quests that you must go through on a hand or two. Overall, the aesthetic the developers were striving for was certainly achieved, but Stray remains an early access proof of concept at best. There were many gameplay features introduced that only saw use once or twice. In its current state, I find it highly difficult to recommend this game at MSRP. I'd advise waiting until it becomes $15 or less."
strangermoon,2023-05-23,80,game that many waiting for many systems. graphically par with trilbe aaa titles. gameplay wise not use cat potansial crazy but stil leveling cat game animations bar quaite high to beat. the future theme good but unsual to use this game bcouse we dont have good normal cat game even yet until this.
Ubagur,2023-05-13,20,"The parkour, walking and stealth simulator, it would seem, is a game about a cat, so many things can be implemented, but no, let's better add a rug to sharpen claws for each location."
Laranja3321,2023-05-12,80,"Ótimo jogo, é muito prazeroso jogar algo de boa qualidade que saia um pouco do campo de jogos triple A. Uma historia bem legal que é contada de um forma muito dinâmica e interessante, a gameplay é gostosa e tem uma boa trilha sonora. Quero pontuar a direção de arte e que é linda, andar pelos becos das cidades que tem uma pegada cyberpunk é muito legal. No mais, o jogo se revela uma grande surpresa demonstrando o claro amor com que foi concedido."
TripleBypast,2023-05-11,40,"I only played an hour or so of this game because although I do admit I’m fairly had to please these days, It just didn’t do much for me and became really quite boring very quickly. I’m glad I got it for free and got the chance to try it out but it just ain’t for me sorry. 4/10"
