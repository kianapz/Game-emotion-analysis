ShadowofZexa,2025-02-25,60,Good game but some really annoying levels and puzzles **** as an Indiana Jones fan I'm happy with it. Great story! Can't wait for the DLC
RGNS,2025-02-24,0,STEALTH STEALTH STEALTH!!!!!! Is it an adventure game or a fvkcin stealth game?????? Controls are not good. You get guns but cannot shoot!! SO WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING GUNS???????? DO NOT BUY.
Alexiswaldorf,2025-02-23,100,"An amazing game that keeps the old and so beloved atmosphere of the old Indiana Jones Games. My brain cant comprehend how did the developers success to maintain the same charisma and behavior of the original Indiana. It doesnt feel like a game, but like an original old movie with the great actor work of Harrison Ford."
Babutto,2025-02-20,90,"Absolutely great game. There are some minor bugs and graphic issues, but in general it follows the tropes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, fits the universe, and delivers the genuine experience and mood of the dawn of the franchise."
MrMurdock69,2025-02-19,0,They ruined Indiana Jones for the sake of DEI. Don't waste your time with this game. Play a weaken Indiana Jones so that other characters are lifted is frustrating.
ScaryFest,2025-02-16,70,"Gran juego, hace mucho no me reia con varias de sus escenas. No es un 10 ya que molesta como los desarrolladores dejaron de lado las tecnologias como FSR, frame gen para AMD. Haciendolas exclusivas para Nvidia."
Hack,2025-02-12,80,"Troy Baker does an amazing job as Indy, if I didn't know better I'd think it was Harrison Ford. For the most part the game runs and looks great, although it does have some issues. The cutscenes are locked to 60fps with improper frame pacing, character animation during cutscenes sometimes slows down and the game has some of the word LOD pop in I have ever experienced. Frame Generation is also broken on the Gamepass version of the game. My last complaint is the AI, they're so stupid that you can run up to them and bonk them on the head before their alert meter fills. Overall though I really enjoyed the game, the melee combat is especially fun, the story and characters were interesting, I loved Indy and the main villain and they hit the vibe of the movies."
scorp332211,2025-02-12,80,"I really wasn’t sure I wanted to play this game after some of the reviews. But I’m glad I did. It had a great story. It was almost like one of the movies. Great voice work by Troy Baker- really sounded like Indy/Harrison Ford. It was challenging at parts, but doable. However, it stayed too long in the main locations. A lot of going back & forth for missions. The guns were really useless. They caused an all-out attack by every **** around. They were also about impossible to control. My main complaint is that you can’t skip cut scenes. It was good in the end as they told the story, but I could have skipped many of them. Also, too many puzzles. But overall, I really liked it. I may buy it when it comes out on PS5. I’d give it a 8/10."
CyberAngel82,2025-02-10,90,An unexpectedly great first-person Indiana Jones adventure that absolutely nails the feeling and storytelling of the movies. A modern classic that we'll look back to for years to come.
VictorWeb,2025-02-09,70,"Я в недоумении от людей, которые говорят, что игра ""скучная""! Они просто не любят головоломки! Да игра не так насыщена екшеном как Анчартед, особенно в начале, но Боже мой, такого удовольствия от приключения и решения загадок, я не полу,ал уже лет 10. Всем любителям мира гробниц и тайн, РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!!!"
dune10,2025-02-08,90,"très bien, enfin un bon jeu Bethesda. Respectueux des films et réalisation de qualité"
Meluto,2025-02-01,90,"Game crafted with love and passion for details, story driven and with a miriad of winks to past movies, books and games from the serie. Technically has some quirks, but in general it is almost like the 4th. lost movie. A must play for sure."
Quoderson,2025-01-31,10,"Graphic is awful, like 20year old game (compare it even vs similar game Tomb Raider 2013year), combat is tragic, items/weapons are designed badly, movement of character is awful, like animations too, GUI / UI is so bad designed. I think ppl who rated this game positively never played any other action game like this, compraing to Tomb Raider it looks very very poorly and cheap in every way."
Nykncn,2025-01-29,0,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT READING!!!! This game is riddled with bugs and graphics issues that the developers are aware of but are reluctant to fix. I've seen so many forum discussions and articles about people being unable to finish the game because of the bugs yet the developers want to twiddle their thumbs and write acknowledgements of their bugs along with ways on how to fix them. If that isn't the most lazy thing a game developer can do then I dont know. Call of Duty would have had this patched in less than a week. It's as if they didn't pay anyone to find bugs in this game before releasing it. Currently I am in the 'Blessed Pearl's quest and the lady I am with called Gina is stuck half way through the boat and can't move. When I get out of the boat she full disappears and I cant interact with her although you can still hear her voice. As the part of the mission I am in involves me dragging her up a rock I can't progress. I've used fast travel, loaded up my oldest game state, left the area, killed myself, I've done literally everything to change the scene hoping it will get her out of that animation however nothing works. It really is lazy work from Bethesda especially telling your consumers to do certain things to fix the bug that's just unheard of. All games have bugs however people are paid to find them so they can get patched however Bethesda allow the public to find them and tell them to work around it which is laughable. It's like all the money they should have spent on finding and patching bugs they used on bots to write fake reviews because something isn't adding up. I've never seen a game with so many bugs and also reports of bugs online yet it have such a high review score something is very fishy to me if I'm being honest. I will send you the response from Bethesda when I submitted a report to them about said issues: Greetings, Thank you for contacting Bethesda Customer Support!

Bloz,2025-01-26,10,"!UN ROBO, UNA ESTAFA! GRACIAS POR ARRUINAR LA VIDA A LOS USUARIOS CON GTX CON TUS ASQUEROSOS REQUISITOS QUE REQUIERE UNA RTX COMO MINIMO, HAN PASADO MESES DESDE QUE LOS MODDERS NO SE PUSIERON LAS PILAS PARA QUE FUNCIONE CON LA GTX, TODO ES CULPA TUYA BETHESDA."
Voodoo123,2025-01-26,90,"Played on mix of PC and series x over a week or so. From time of writing the graphical performance was superb. Gameplay is varied with a combination of complex puzzles and basic loot and simpler open world tasks. The side quests are a high quality when compared to the main story missions. Sound is very well done here! Overall it comes across as a game made by fans of the franchise but never at the expense of gameplay or original story.*My PC specs are 5800x3d 3070ti nvme ssd win 10I ran on ultrawide (which I had to use a mod to correct sent issues in cutscenes displaying correctly). I used dlss performance mode and capped it at 70fps 3840x1080. It felt extremely smooth and responsive to play. Also it had cloud save sharing with my Xbox series x for when I felt like couchplay instead.**I did encounter a game progression bug in sukhothai where I was unable to progress in the last section (couldn't climb vines, squeeze through gaps). I had to switch to my PC install and use a teleport cheat mod to finish the level. Aside from this the game ran extremely well."
SewAwOw,2025-01-25,80,"Игра понравилась, в духе оригинальной трилогии, с отсылочками, классическое приключение как оно есть. Геймплей состоит из исследования локаций, драк с врагами и решения головоломок. Локации исследовать интересно, они разнообразные, таят в себе множество секретных мест с наградами. Боевая система состоит из стелса и боев в открытую. К сожалению, в игре сделан упор на стелс, который весьма примитивен и скучный, если попытаться вступить в схаъватку в открытую, велик шанс проиграть потому что врагов много, они крепкие, дальше становятся закованными в броню и стреляют больно, а стрельба в игре намеренно неудобная, корявая и с ограничениями. Поэтому приходится стелсить, изредка балуя себя рукопашными боями, которые сделаны хорошо, с импактом и тактикой. Загадки встречаются в сюжетке, побочках и при исследовании, не очень сложные, хорошо вписываются в окружающий мир. В игре есть прокачка, она сделана в виде книг, которые можно найти в мире или купив в лавках. Прокачиваются элементы выживания, борьба, вместительность сумки с расходниками. Геймплей понравился, он неспешный, но не душный. Сюжет по хорошему старомодный, будто смотришь фильм про индиану, всё на месте - гигант, немцы, харизматичный злодей, знойная попутчица, тайны и ловушки. Единственное, элементы мистики ну прям вообще мимо, нахер это вставили непонятно. Игра поначалу кажется про реализм, в плане механик, анимаций, а потом все эти телепорты, штормы, концовка прям разочаровала в этом плане. Однако игра классная, давно не было таких адвенчур без упора в экшон."
BobIAN,2025-01-23,90,"""Excuse me pal, I'm just a tourist"" he says before punching a guy out. Solid 10 for combat, 10 for graphics but only 8 because the story was weak. Also, RIP Tony Todd. You shall be missed..."
Warmuro,2025-01-23,90,"I'm not a fan of Indiana Jones even though i watched all the movies. This game captures the atmosphere, gives an amazing adventure. Writing is good, graphics and optimization gives hope for future of the gaming. You don't need fake frames to run it, it's already butter smooth. There are a few voice/dialogue bugs between main characters but it's not that bad and in acceptable levels. I haven't experienced game breaking bugs and able to beat the game. It could be a 10/10 if you could actually do headshots because even though you shoot the enemy in the head, they don't die as if it's a RPG FPS game. I know it's not an action FPS completely but it doesn't make sense and breaks the immersion. Also half-open world is unnecessary in this game because main story line is already amazing, they could have focused more on polishing the game mechanics and the world. Thank you the developers, that's what happens if you love your job and everything in it."
Narkamin,2025-01-23,90,"This is how you do a linear, story-driven game. The pacing was immaculate, no need to bloat each area and instead let some areas serve a more spectacle driven purpose which breaks up the more open areas. Not too long, not too short. Lots of extra stuff to find for people that like to 100%. The music, voice acting and overall vibe entirely captured the original movies to a surprising extent. I was really against the 1st person but they made it work. My only real critique of the game was that the puzzles were way too easy. Everything from decoding locked chests and safes, to the major plot point puzzles. I get that they wanted people to feel smart and not get hung up and frustrated, but it would have been awesome if the puzzles felt more like a legit deterrent and not like 12 year old could figure it out. At least some of the major puzzles should have been more sophisticated. There could easily have been a built in hint option where Indy talks the puzzle out to himself or a companion chimes in. If there is a second game I do hope they up the ante."
lDrakOz,2025-01-19,90,"O jogo é muito fiel aos clássicos filmes de Indiana Jones, tanto a personalidade do Indiana quanto o jogo em um todo são muito parecidos com os filmes. O que me desmotiva a dar nota máxima, são os problemas técnicos que o jogo tem, por exemplo, ele tem muitos bugs onde o personagem fica preso por exemplo. Consegui pegar todos os coletáveis mas falta 1 documento, o mapa diz que tem documentos em dois lugares do mapa, mas os documentos não estão lá! Acredito que os desenvolvedores resolverão esses problemas técnicos com o tempo mas por agora, não será 100."
IRagnar,2025-01-19,50,"Game could be better optimised, not the worst optimization I've seen, but still bad. Dialogs are lacking, cut scenes boring, animations of characters even worse than from ubisoft, they all feel stiff. Very repetitive gameplay, that after an hour gets boring. The level design is worse than in games from 20 years ago. And for the love of anything that is precious to you, why the hell you cannot change voice language in game? AI of enemies is horrible, enemies sometimes will stand in front of you, doing nothing, getting hit in a face. Remember to hide bodies! Oh wait, there is no hiding unconscious enemies mechanic, just leave them lying on the ground. Metal pipe is breaking after 3 hits, laughable. Shooting in this game? Just horrible experience. 4 Headshots enemy still standing, close up shotgun shot? Still standing. Didn't this studio release Wolfenstein? Puzzles are made for a 5 years old to handle. I know why this game get so many good ratings, but sadly it doesn't deserve it. This is not a Indiana Jones GAME it's just a movie with poor gameplay elements."
Britannia,2025-01-14,100,"""Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is hands down the most incredible game I’ve ever experienced since I began gaming on my ZX80 back in 1980. You’ll be captivated by every moment spent in this thrilling adventure, especially with its engaging puzzles. The charming alpha male protagonist, much like myself, embarks on a journey and finds romance. What’s more, you can play it for a very small monthly fee on Xbox PC Game Pass, which features hundreds of amazing games including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Thanks to Xbox PC Game Pass, I've decided never to purchase a game again—it’s just too convenient! You can even pause your subscription for a month or two if you’re away, making it the perfect choice for gamers."" The graphics look so real and life-like on the RTX4080 Super and 65"" Samsung QN90 Gaming TV while I play lying on my couch using an Xbox X controller for these and many beautiful games like MSFS 2024 Career mode"
VFE,2025-01-14,90,One of the best adventure game ever made. A masterpiece that respects the Indiana Jones franchise.
alexej_nko,2025-01-13,40,"Самая дибильная игра из всех, в которые я играл!! Диалоги двух даунов, катсцены дибильные, в которых дегенераты соревнуются в дибильности с дибилом Куколдом Джонсом (да, он на привязи у двух СЖП, как собачка)! Такое ощущение, что игру делали специально, чтобы затянуть прохождение этой игры: катсцены, ..ука, не проматываемые, диалоги бессодержательные и затянутые, допмиссии примитивные (хуже Ubisoft). Отдельный конченный привет той мрази, что делала собак в этой игре: чтоб тебе самому в подворотни с такими собаками постоянно встречаться! Единственный плюс: Ну красиво!"
Kankuun,2025-01-13,70,"En ce qui concerne ma notation, je me base toujours sur le rapport plaisir/prix. Les graphismes sont acceptables, et le gameplay, bien que très simple, présente plusieurs bugs rapidement perceptibles. Cela dit, l'histoire est vraiment captivante. Les amateurs des films ne seront pas déçus. Ce jeu ne promet pas un grand spectacle, mais il garantit tout de même de passer un bon moment."
KiruSSJ,2025-01-13,100,"Sometimes I get a feeling when playing a great game, like, ""Man, I hope this doesn't end too soon,"" because you know that once it's over, you'll feel like something's missing. The game captivated me from the very first minutes, but after the scene on the ship… I knew this was my Game of the Year—it barely made it onto the list, but it did. I highly recommend it; the humor, puzzles, and ""cinematic"" quality of this game are incredible. You truly immerse yourself in this world more and more with each passing minute. You want to uncover new secrets, and you enjoy listening to Indiana's commentary about the relics or artifacts you come across. Great addition to GamePass!"
808smatt,2025-01-13,90,"I had low expectations at the start of this game, but now I'm thoroughly impressed by what Bethesda has done here. I can tell they put a lot of time and effort into this game. I enjoy the different stages and environments. Every time I hop into a play session I'm fully immersed and feel like I'm Indiana Jones. They did a great job with the variation with linear levels and the open world which keeps things fresh. The game is quite polished and I haven't run into any issues at all which is an automatic +1 to my rating, especially given the state of the gaming industry these days and how products release half-baked. I'm roughly 30 hours into the game at the time of this review and will probably go for the 100%. It's also great how they didn't incorporate any modern ideologies and focused on giving us solid gameplay. Great job with this one, but by any means Hollywood please do not make any more Indiana Jones movies, I refuse to believe they can do anything to save the franchise at this point."
MrEko,2025-01-12,90,"As someone who grew up with the Indiana Jones movies, I loved this game. Great story, great side characters, a dangerous main villain, great historical elements, puzzles, sense of discovery. This game provides all of this in a great way. My only problems with the game were that I got bored in the open areas and the 3rd open area was long and slow. The duration of the game could have been a little shorter. Anyway, we are faced with a great game."
Maver05,2025-01-12,100,"A great game that keeps the essence of the Indiana Jones films, with good mechanics and spectacular graphics. Although it is true that it is a little tedious in some parts, it is still a game with an excellent story, better than the last two films. You will not regret playing it."
ErayTellezi,2025-01-12,70,"Oyununda başındaki mekanikler neyse sonunda da o aslında. Gizlice git, düşmanı arkasından indir ya da sıvışarak ilerle. Yumruk dövüşü veya silah pek keyifli değil. Silahla sıka sıka pek de fazla ilerleyemiyorsunuz ki Indiana karakteri için doğru yapmışlar. Platform keyifli değil. Yarı açık dünya tasarımı bence gereksiz olmuş. Keşfedilecek şeyler keşfetmeye değer değiller. God of War'a benziyor ama onda combat iyi olduğu için sağı solu gezmek sıkmıyordu. Bunda bunun için yeterli motivasyonu vermiyor. Bir kaç kritik geliştirme dışında bulacağınız pek bir şey yok. Neticede hikayesi sürükleyici olsa da wow diyemeyeceğimiz, sinematiği ve grafikleri pek de başarılı olmayan, mekanikleri kısıtlı ortalama bir oyun. Gamepass'te oynamak üzmez."
ultrasakont,2025-01-11,100,"Very excellent game, played the vatican section for hours then i'm on egypt, had an absolute blast I had no expectation coming into this game, and oh boy i'm impressed and surprised, machine games really managed to make a worthy contender to uncharted & tomb raider i highly recommend this game - minor issues: save game corruption when the game crashes sometimes, luckily i found a way to roll back my save"
yamaci17,2025-01-09,80,"This game caught me by surprise, I've definitely expected worse and instead got something incredible. I enjoyed the game a lot and despite never having watched an Indiana Jones movie before, this game managed to make me interested in them (now I will go and watch them).Being an FPS game definitely did wonders for this game. Being able to explore narrow caves and paths with the first person camera definitely adds to the immersion. Temporary switches to third person camera was also a great addition and it was used in a way that is **** is horrible, and stealth mechanics... eh. Devs didn't bother much about that, that much is clear. Instead it seems they focused their efforts on the world and level design and that definitely paid off. Being able to visit so many different locations with very different themes and cultures definitely makes the game a great experience. I've found myself just walking slowly and enjoy the ambiance a lot of times.Story was great, managed to pique my interest and the eventual culmination of the story ended decently and I have nothing to complain about that."
conigliocattivo,2025-01-09,60,"Graphic is really good and they perfectly got the Indiana Jones old movies vibes. Unfortunately the gameplay is awful and tedious, dumb combat encounters, boring puzzles. Vatican map is nice but then it's just going down from there."
RogCast,2025-01-07,100,"Não esperava nada e fui surpeendido positivamente. Lindo, gameplay fluido, experiencia de exploração impecável, enredo cativante e no final de cada ato um lugar mais interessante que o outro para descobrir."
jsoileau14,2025-01-07,80,Man was this game jam packed from the opening scene until the end!! I loved the sound effects from the movies that they incorporated in the **** Whip and punching effects are THE BEST! The story was amazing...kept me wanting more!! I recommend this game to someone who loves adventure games and a good story!
Avenrise,2025-01-06,60,"The best compliment I can give it is it's Indiana Jones through and through. It's like they released another movie staring Harrison Ford and to me that is crazy. HOWEVER I feel that in trying to be more **** it struggled a little. The insistence on having collectables in the game actively took you out of the main attraction, the story and it felt very much like filler. The side quests were weak and/or repetitive and I never really felt like I was actually exploring somewhere. It is all very linear. It's a very pretty game though and I really did enjoy my time playing. I just feel I would have had more fun if either a) it was an interactive story game, b) there was more freedom in exploration or c) I was more of an Indi fan."
oleksey,2025-01-06,90,"It is not perfect in a graphical sense. But in general we need more games like this. Pure adventure, real Indiana Jones spirit. If you haven't played - please do. It's a great game."
Silverus,2025-01-05,90,"A breath of fresh air ! Simple and classic action story , it's like watching an old Indiana jones movie. Not memorable but i loved it! :)"
parallax_84,2025-01-04,100,"What a great game! The story is worthy of a movie and better than the last 2. It has great characters and main villain also superb voice acting and awesome cutscenes. The decision of making it a brawler instead of a shooter was such a good idea not only because it suits Indiana Jones character but also because the fist fights are great, the first person perspective makes this even better. There's a ton of puzzles with different difficulties, most of these are very good and rewarding. I found some bugs but nothing game breaking, at least for me. This is by far the best Indiana Jones game since The Fate of Atlantis."
fps_,2025-01-04,70,"It's a bit of a mixed bag. Overall the game is well made and I didn't encounter any bugs apart from some issues with DLSS frame generation. The graphics are beautiful, especially with the RTX settings dialled up. Lots of detail in each of the diverse environments encountered. The game has a cinematic feel that made me feel like I was inside an Indiana Jones film. Unfortunately the game is let down by repetitive mechanics. You will spend most of the game bashing **** over the head with various objects, which is fun at first but gets old fast as there are a limited number of animations used. Some of the puzzles are great, but many of the smaller ones like the lockboxes are repeated throughout the game. The AI is also pretty poor - sneaking around and knocking them over the head feels more like a low skill puzzle than a combat situation. Maybe that's what they intended? I enjoyed the story and cinematic cutscene's. If the game had some more interesting mechanics I would gladly score it higher, but it kinda felt like I was just pushing buttons to advance to the next scripted scene, rather than roaming around at my free will."
HeavyBlues,2025-01-04,50,"Gameplay-wise it's just watered-down Wolfenstein: The New Order. You stealth around until you get caught, then punch and/or shoot everyone to death until there's no one left to detect you. Rinse and repeat. Got that done? Great. Now pick up another Magical Ancient Phallic Object so you can spend your Phallis Points on generic upgrades you'll forget you unlocked. Too many Phallis Points piling up? Fear not, Indiana Jones fans, you find more upgrade books by sticking Harrison Ford's meticulously face-mapped nose into every corner of the current map. Not a fan of spending 80% of your gameplay time hunting for lame upgrades and pointless tchotchkes? Not to worry! They don't matter lmao Critiques aside, the voice acting is exceedingly well done, the locales are gorgeous and detailed, and the dialogues are well-written. From a cinematic standpoint, this game is a success. From a gameplay standpoint, you're spending $70 for a movie from a dated franchise you have to constantly hold down the play button to watch. In conclusion, this game belongs in a museum. Get it on the cheap if you like the source material. Or at full price if you lack basic impulse control. I'm not your mother."
vova22379,2025-01-03,30,"gets a 3/10. Clunky controls, outdated graphics, weak story, and repetitive gameplay ruin its potential. Fans deserve better."
Kaczorro28,2025-01-02,100,My godness. This game is just my dream come true from my childhood. I've played lego indiana jones 1 many many times and I fell in love with Indiana Jones franchise. I highly advise this game for every one. Just one thing was a little bit concerning. This game is really rough on 6GB vram cards:// I hope that one day this will be fixed tho.
benjamin7702,2025-01-02,80,"Great game, gives the feel of the Indiana Jones movies. Best game currently available on the Gamepass."
rolion_ua,2025-01-02,90,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a thrilling adventure with a compelling story and impeccably designed puzzles. Its stylish execution and engaging gameplay make it stand out as one of the finest games of 2024. A must-play for fans of action-adventure games!
meediocre,2025-01-01,90,"Fantastic exploration, action-adventure game, highly immersive and faithful to the original Indiana Jones trilogy of movies. Tons to discover, the environments and objects are stunning. The story is compelling with top-notch voice acting. Gameplay is mostly a fun mix of stealth and melee/shooting combat, but nothing exceptional. The only problem is the PC performance, you'll need a beefy rig."
BrReviewer,2024-12-30,80,"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Introduction Before diving into the game itself, I’d like to share my passion for the Indiana Jones movie series. I used to watch them with my late mother, and when Kingdom of the Crystal Skull hit theaters, I had my first opportunity to see this iconic character on the big screen. With that said, I can honestly say it was a very pleasant surprise to hear that an Indiana Jones game was being developed by MachineGames. Although I’m not particularly familiar with the Wolfenstein franchise, I’m well aware of how competent the studio is at creating action-adventure games. Story The game’s plot takes place during World War II, where Indiana Jones finds himself in a race against time to stop the antagonist from gaining access to the sacred stones of Noah’s Ark. I won’t go into too many details to avoid spoilers, but I’ll highlight that the story plays with Christian concepts to add a mystical touch to the narrative. Characters Indiana Jones’ supporting cast is extremely charismatic. During the game’s first arc, we meet Father Antonio from the Vatican, an American music enthusiast who often bends the rules to help the protagonist. By the second arc, the main characters really shine. Gina, the game’s primary companion, deserves special mention. She’s funny without overdoing it, providing balance and lightness to the story. It’s also worth mentioning Voss, the antagonist, who embodies the classic villain archetype. Although he maintains a serious demeanor, he stars in one of the game’s funniest scenes. The rest of the characters fulfill their roles efficiently, and none of them feel out of place in the story. Gameplay The gameplay is extremely well-balanced, blending action, stealth, and puzzles in just the right measure. As expected, the protagonist isn’t a superhero like in Call of Duty or Halo. This means that large groups of enemies pose a real challenge, forcing the player to adopt stealth approaches in certain areas. Regarding puzzles, I must admit that I’m not particularly fond of this mechanic in adventure games. I prefer to play puzzle-focused titles when I want to dedicate myself entirely to solving them. However, I must say that Indiana’s puzzles are reasonably challenging and well-balanced, without slowing down the game’s pace. Additionally, for those who enjoy exploration, the game features various collectibles and achievements for completionists aiming for 1000g.However, not everything is perfect. The game struggles with enemy AI, which is extremely accurate when shooting but easily forgets they’ve just found a corpse. Graphics The game’s graphics evoke mixed feelings. While not a negative aspect, the minimum PC requirements surprised many in the community by demanding ray tracing acceleration. Aside from this detail, the game is visually stunning, making exceptional use of global illumination effects.That said, I did experience occasional stuttering during scene transitions. While these issues didn’t ruin my experience, they are areas that deserve optimization. Conclusion Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent game that offers a good story, captivating characters, and extremely balanced gameplay. On top of that, it’s a heartfelt tribute to this beloved character. My final score for the game is 8.5/10. All the hours I spent in Indiana’s shoes were unforgettable, but MachineGames has room for improvement, particularly in enemy AI and performance optimization—especially during scene transitions, which sometimes caused slight stuttering."
