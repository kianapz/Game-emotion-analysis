I‚Äôve been putting off buying a ps5, since no doubt they‚Äôll put out a new one in the next few years, but I might just have to get one for the hell of it. I want to play the last of us, days gone, and kingdom come: deliverance 2 anyway, (and gta6, if it ever comes out), so I reckon I might as well just buy one. I‚Äôve been playing all old Xbox one games lately, after not playing video games at all really for a while. The graphics look pretty good, compared to most of the games I‚Äôve been playing lately.",0

You never seem to be able to advance by building a special weapon that you prefer, no silenced weapons, sniper etc. Being forced to creep around in fear that anyone will hear you is kind of annoying.

For real. I wasn't frustrated ONE SINGLE time in this game. 

I mean frustration over dumb lazy stuff, in a game that is good, but where shortcuts obviously was made,
and it ruins the feel of a good game. 

 So is Indiana Jones the best game ever? No.

CqCKbNrKimo,@SilverMiraii,2025-02-16T19:07:28Z,"I finished the game, it's really fun.
It has 3 types of gameplay:
1. Open world where you explore and find secrets and missions, do quests and such, it's the bulk of the game, #1 in terms of time spent doing this type of thing, and #3 in terms of fun out of the 3 types. It's fun to explore, I would set the game to lowest difficulty for combat, so you don't bother with the combat and stealth system, it's the least fun part of the game, no need to prologue it. 
2. Dungeon-like instances where you explore a dungeon, fight enemies, solve puzzles, it's more linear but very fun, it's #2 in terms of time spent and #2 in terms of fun, and it fits the theme of the game.
3. Scripted linear sequences, #1 in terms of fun, #3 in terms of duration, they're short, condensed scripted experiences, it feels like you're in an action movie, a good one.",4

Z1yKh87UW8A,@Soron661,2024-12-08T04:02:42Z,"Comment 1) 7:13 I do wish that this game reused some of the music from the first Indiana Jones film since its literally reusing the same prologue. Would've both added to the nostalgia and maintained the spookiness of seeing a load of tarrantulas crawling all over Sapito. Fun fact, those arachnids were completely real in the OG film and the only way the got them to move as the did is is by adding a female tarrantula to the mix.
Comment 2) Troy Baker does sound a lot like Harrison did early on in the first film. I don't know how similar to Ford Baker sounds as the story goes on, but I am eager to find out because I'm a massive Indiana Jones fan. Watched all the movies, the subpar tv series, and have a LOT of Indiana Jones novels. I also have the fedora. An actual fedora rather than a imitation piece made by a costume company.
Comment 3: 12:13 R.I.P Marcus. I loved the guy in the films. He was incredibly loyal and hilariously incompetent in the third film. The guy they got to voice Marcus in this game sounds similar to Denholm Elliot, assuming they didn't just recreate his voice with A.I. If Marcus only has this scene, then having a recreation via A.I makes sense from a business/production end of things. Otherwise, they likely should've recast Marcus with someone who can do a decent enough impression like they did for Indy.
Comment 4) 15:49 R.I.P Tony Todd. you were just as iconic a voice actor as Kevin Conroy for a great many, I'm sure. You voiced Zoom in CW's The Flash, which was easily the best variant of hunter Zoloman to have ever been concieved, and Venom in Insomniac's Spider-Man 2. Those are the only two characters I remember Tony voiceing, aside Locus in this game, but I'm sure he's responsible for MANY beloved characters over the years.
Comment 5) 17:16 okay, nvmd. Marcus sounds different from Denholm. Not too different, but different enough its noticable. Tis quite the shame.
Comment 6) 26:48 I think I just realized why the music wasn't there for the prologue dream sequence. Damned YouTube and its addictiing to copywright striking practically everything. If I had this game myself, I likely would be hearing the iconic music soundtracks. Sadly, my computer is too primative for this game and I don't have a Series X. Grrr Arrgh.
Comment 7) 36:22 really do wish I had this game for myself. Why? Well, like I said, I'm a massive Indiana Jones fan. Another reason... is MK is bypassing a LOT just to stick to the critical path. Yes, this game is linear. However, like any adventure-oriented game... exploration is highly advisable despite being optional for the most part.
Comment 8) 1:40:25 You really should've gotten that camera first thing...
Comment 9) 3:26:43 You don't need to have the disguise on ALL THE TIME. Just in areas you'd otherwise be restricted or for missions that require it. It's almost as if you dislike Indy's adventurer/archeologist outfit. As a massive Indiana Jones fan... the fact you avoid using the outfit in favor of disguises irks me.
Comment 10) 3:32:53 I can't watch you play this game anymore. The way you do things... it just rubs me the wrong way.",4

This lack of optimization should be criminal. It's leading to untold amounts of e-waste and planned obsolescence. The whole point of a gaming GPU is to take a well made game, and take it to it's absolute limits over consoles. Now, they only optimize console games and just do shitty ports for pc. Why would i buy another gpu when I can just buy BOTH an Xbox and PlayStation and get better value for the price?",0

sq97d1RkdRM,@licantropus1,2025-01-28T14:11:34Z,"RAZZLE DAZZLE. Habiendo jugado el juego y luego de pasar la introducci√≥n y las primera parte ""infiltrarte en el vaticano"" puedo decir lo siguiente es un juego de stealth y puzzles que se apoya fuertemente en aunar las diferente pelis de Indy. Ahora tiene detalles que hablan de un desinter√©s o dejadez que son inexplicables. 
""No puedes cerrar las puertas que abres"" raz√≥n?, causa? no lo sabemos deja la puerta abierta total los enemigos no parecen notarla
Nota aparte la inteligencia de los enemigos?? por ahora me enfrente en la m√°xima dificultad y son pasmas ""muertos""  que est√°n parados mirando la pared tiene una peque√±a interacci√≥n cuando tu entras en zona y luego se transforman en lentos zombies que se ponen a estorbar o a ponerse en posici√≥n de ""pegame aca"" lejos de la inteligencia de otros. Le pegas a uno cae desmayado y en el camino rompe UNA MESA y botellas de vidrio su amigo a metros sigue caminado sin decir nada..(como me la baja eso!) juegos como Thief, Dishonored o splinter cell tenian una mejor inteligencia los enemigos tenian se√±ales de alerte.. Esta Ai? es mas parecido a los enemigos de ese que se escond√≠a en una caja que no me acuerdo el nombre halla hace buenos 20 a√±os atr√°s. Menci√≥n aparte los perros que Machine Games hizo tan bien en Wolfenstein y aqu√≠ son imposibles. 
No les puedes pegar desde abajo porque el personaje SE PARA para pegar, el l√°tigo los calma pero no los espanta y te persiguen como una maldici√≥n a menos que salgas del nivel o zona. 
""Ocultar cuerpos"" tomo el primer desmayado y ""atravieso la pared"" cuando lo levanto eso en un juego AAA es imperdonable y solo me lleva a presagiar que los speed runner se van a hacer una panzada de bugs en este pesad√≠simo y car√≠simo pastiche de pelis atadas con alambre. 
Las voces y actuaciones son muy buenas y tambi√©n los gr√°ficos pero atravesar paredes CADA vez que levanto un zombie que se desmayo en la pared la baja much√≠simo. Y una Ai inexistente tambi√©n es como ir a un tren fantasma viejo donde ya conoces todo pero se nota la dejadez el paso del tiempo y el desinter√©s en realizar algo que tengo un viso de respeto al comprador.",0

An incredible journey from start to finish. Excellent adventure story, incredible acting, well directed cutscenes, very interesting and unique blend of gameplay, nostalgic music accurate to the films and some of the best Graphics makes this game an all rounder and a must-play game for anyone who loves playing Single Player action adventure games. The Side Quests, called FIELDWORK missions in this game deserve a special mention as they fully motion captured cinematic missions on par with the main missions and nicely tying everything back to the main story.

After a long time, a game gave me that feeling of pure joy, the kind of feeling we used to get back in the day. Making a 32 year old man feel like a kid again, is not an easy task !

The PC Performance was very satisfactory with no major hiccups like shader compilation stutters or crashes. I played on an RTX 4070 Super at Max Settings (Only Textures at Ultra) at 4K DLSS Balanced, and the framerate did not drop below 60 a single time, even without DLSS Frame generation. I did not used Full RT. ID-Tech is a great engine for super smooth PC Performance.

I sincerely hope this is the start of a new franchise and they continue to give us great Indy games like this.

There's not much to criticize but if I had to nitpick, I wish there was some more variations in Gameplay and the gun had more impact. The length was on the shorter side too if you choose to do only the main quest, but that will be a huge disservice to the game. Other than that no complains whatsoever !

DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.",36

l7TkIms06z0,@NenadMiodrag,2024-12-16T12:19:47Z,"@Hollow I figured out what exactly is the issue I'm having with the game: the insistence on minimalist HUD to keep the cinematic feel is what ruins the game for me. I like my damage meters, health bars, minimap with clear objectives marked, telegraphs in fight. I want a game to feel like a game, not like a movie all the time. Cinematic cutscenes are great to see, but I don't like this all the time. As visually stunning as it is we are not out of the uncanny valley. I mean having to take out the map and look down and zoom - this is cumbersome: I want my minimap with clear path and objective. That doesn't stop me from exploring and enjoying the environment but I don't want to be forced to search for my way in a maze all the time. In summary: I respect the effort and I see how this can be a great game for some but it's not for me. Watching the playthrough on YouTube was a BLAST.",0

I noticed you favored spamming the right hand so you kept pushing them away. You also can grab using r1 after you counter to land a few free hits.

N-PL7XRXsRY,@thekings_hand,2024-12-04T11:53:20Z,Xbox has to make first person games moving forward because they still require them to run on series S! Not making this third person was a huge mistake especially for an iconic character like Indiana Jones. I don't understand how people think this is going to be good? IMO this is not my kind of game. I get the first person for stalker too something using a lot of resources and assets and open worlds but not for this. This does not look fun it looks like punching simulator with a whip. And if you're here for the story then just watch any of the first two or three Indiana Jones movies and you will get a more compelling exciting adventure than this.üòÇ,0

nX8bptIt750,@pokeballdkdenmark8464,2024-12-30T00:00:51Z,"I also loved the game! Mostly the story and the beautiful graphics - in fact the best looking adventure game I've ever played - but also the good and logic puzzles. However, I'm an oldschool point & click adventure gamer who haven't played many adventure games for many years because the high standard games are all action adventures these days where the action part is too difficult for me. The things I like about adventure games are the stories, solving puzzles and the interaction with the other characters in the game - not to fight or react quickly to progress. Also I didn't realize until I've played over half of the game that you could make the action part much easier by buying more skills for adventure points - I thought you got the enhanced skills automatically by simply picking up the books which is as you know not enough. So for instance I found it really hard to knock out the giant in Rome and had to hit him around 100 times before he fainted because I hadn't bought any hard hitting skills. So I only got that far by doing a lot of ""stealth"" which was a little annoying because I was often killed anyway having to restart from last autosave. So I was really happy to find a cheat app that made me invisible and as strong as possible so I could concentrate 100% on the puzzles. From that moment I enjoyed the game a lot more free from the constant stress of fighting the many Nazis. I might have graded the game 10 out of 10 was it not for the constant threats of Nazis which make me downgrade the game to 8 out of 10 because the action ruined too much of the game for me in the beginning until I started cheating in the fights. The game should have had an option to make the action a lot easier from the beginning.",0

It totally goes for a the back to basics approach to actual enjoyment and gameplay fun.  Will you laugh your head off at the 'stealth' and combat , yes relentlessly. But it perfectly encapsulates the over the top slapstick style of the movies (the good ones ....)

The exploration comes alive in first person , far more engaged than I have been before. Puzzles are not going to tax most but do feel ""right"" - being fun to complete even when obvious and as stated not monsters that destroy the pacing of your adventures!
It looks gorgeous and uses RTX so effectively without any frustrating overly dark areas.

The story is wonderful (so far) and the lack of unnecessary gore and guts meant one of my sons is eagerly awaiting dad's next relaxing hour !!

It feels so much better this dropped now , at a moment where AAA is just depressing on the most part.

But its been such a long time since we had a good Indy game (I would say Fate of Atlantis was the last really good one) I kind of tempered my expectations. I think it might surprise people with how different it is from what they might expect from the lead up. Its quite slow paced but in a good way. Lots of exploration and investigation as you poke around and put clues together and I like that. It took me 16 hours just to get out of the Vatican area because I wanted to savour it. Just in Gizeh now and having just as much fun. The price is a sticking point as it really is quite expensive ($120 here in Australia, so about $40 more than your usual $80 AAA game). If you love Indy as much as I do, its worth the price of admission right now, but if you are on the fence and don't have the nostalgia I do for the character, wait for a sale.",0

Collectables had no place being in the game, they truly felt like filler (not to mention the final... wall (trying not to spoil) not telling you how many you needed causing me to spent 30mins in there before googling). The side quests were pretty weak and/or repetitive and the game in my opinion couldn't decide whether it wanted to be an exploration game or a linear on rails one, doing a poor job at both.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing and it did feel like I was playing a movie which was a unique experience so props to the devs on that. It's also gorgeous to look at, I was pretty stunned to be honest. I'm glad others had more fun with it but I think there's some Indi tinted glasses being worn here.",0

HtbtcLxJTtY,@dudimis,2024-12-31T03:14:40Z,"Played the game and came back to say... this game is a 6 out of 10. It is not bad. But Skill Up REALLY is overplaying this. If you take out the visuals and look at the game play alone, I would bump it down to 5. Enemy AI is quite stupid. Gun play is lame. Movement is way too slow. Narrative pacing is kind of all over the place, especially at the end. Indiana is CONSTANTLY getting captured just to escape again. The story loses a LOT of steam in the last chapter. Side characters are all rather bland. The finale ""twist"" has no clues given to the player to be surprised by it. There are some cool set pieces at times, but let's just say that Uncharted did all of this much better.",0

HOWEVER....it has gotten to the point where I cannot watch his reviews before I play a game anymore.  I have to wait til after.  Clearly he doesn't consider anything other than the main storyline outcomes a spoiler.  Dude just straight up shows you every environment you'll come across, spoils multiple clever cutscenes that aren't going to be funny anymore because hes already shown you them, etc.  Seriously, if you haven't played the game yet, my advice is to not watch ANY Skillup review.  That is, of course, unless you really couldn't care less whether or not you discover every aspect of the game through Skillup, or through playing it yourself.

Again, Skillup does great reviews. If discovery is something you like to do on your own, wait til after the game to watch.",3

When we hit the section in the game when shit goes bananas for two missions, that might have been peak Indiana Jones. The ending third I think falls a little short for me. I also think the mo-cap and slightly off performance of Troy Baker were just a little distracting. Don't get me wrong, he nails it 95% of the time, it's just I hear the differences every once in a while and it pulls me out of it from time to time. To me the best part of this game was the gameplay, it has slight jank but they just nailed the balance between stealth and that Indiana Jones beat 'em up combat. I was forced into enough stealth that I didn't feel like a god but could beat and shoot my way through enough encounters that it felt like the perfect Indiana Jones simulator. I loved the gameplay. This is either an 8 or 8.5 out of 10 game and it's a great time.",1

Needles to say, I had an absolute blast, first with the movies, then with The Great Circle. 
I'm also a fan of Uncharted and the Tomb Raider reboot series, from that perspective this game also filled my ever growing void for a tomb raiding experience.",1

It‚Äôs almost as if NPCs and pathing are massively demanding.

Not saying Machine game didn‚Äôt optimize their game‚Ä¶ but also definitely saying part of the reason it‚Äôs so light on performance despite the impressive graphical fidelity is the lack of NPC density.

Beyond that‚Ä¶ skipping this one in part because Troy Baker is just another video games guy that was prepared to scam his fans with a shit coin NFT project until the market called him out.

HtbtcLxJTtY,@acpolax,2024-12-22T16:00:36Z,"Oh realy you recommend this, and you said AC valhalla is bad cause you get playtime for your money. I didnt play Indiana Jones (btw it is ridiculous how racist this title is and absolutely noone cares) myself but I saw that it has the worst enemy ai since 1997 and water lily leaves are clipping through the boat, they are not just clipping through the boat Bethesda straight up just didnt care that they are there and Bethesda keeps doing this ridiculous third person action cam bs but unlike Skyrim where it was absolutely disgustingly bad they kind of improved on it by not using it in combat. Instead now they use it each time you use a zipline or swing on your leash and while climbing and the absolute worst about it is it even switches between perspective when you traverse from climbing upwards to climbing sideways just to break the immersion even more!
Then comes the gunplay and yeah its machine Games so there should be gunplay but come on its 2024 even roleplay games have better aim down sights these days!

Actually I didnt watch your video so maybe you said its so bad its good but you should mention that in the thombnail If thats the case.
Honestly I dont understand why you want to make this game successfull? Its way more profitable for you If you let it tank at least then you can make a video about how they killed another decent Bethesda studio under the bad influence of Microsoft and Todd Howard and since I already told you everything of importance it wont even take you a fraction of the time it takes to upload a AC valhalla review.",0
HtbtcLxJTtY,@SatanicWampa,2024-12-22T08:19:44Z,I finished veilguard and started this and goddamn what a contrast. This game is breezy and fun where veilguard felt like a slog. I wanted to see the end of this story not out of some sense of begrudging obligation but because I‚Äôm genuinely invested in the narrative. Gameplay feels open and flexible whereas veilguard felt very limited and almost too same-y throughout the game. Sense of discovery through exploration in this felt awesome and it veilguard it just felt like a checklist. There‚Äôs so many things I could compare but the point is that one was an extremely mediocre game and one is this. Just weird going from something like veilguard and following it with this.,0

qJ7AF4K6kKY,@discoveryofreality,2025-01-08T05:48:23Z,"Friends who are curious about the 5000 series and hope that the new series will use less vram because of the vram type and Dlss 4, even though the amount of vram in the new series is still low in GB (12 and 16 gb, 5070 and 5080). Pay attention to this test.

The claim that the 5070 is twice the performance of the 3090 and the same as the 4090 is in my opinion a big deception and a lie, because unusable power means nothing. How can the 5070 with its 12gb of vram beat these cards with 24gb of vram! The point to note is that the 5080 and below are completely insufficient for 4K highest settings due to the low vram in the lower series except for the 90 series in the 5000 series cards. But very misleadingly, 5070, 3090 and 4090 are used as more performance. Let's see you try to use that performance in a game using 4k ultra and 18 gb vram, then the trick will be revealed.

Please see below the comparison of the 5000 series with the previous series, which nvidia supposedly praised with the phrases ‚Äúhigher performance and lower vram usage‚Äù. The test used Cyberpunk, which in the old case used 9 GB vram and could be run at 124 fps. With the 5000 series card and Dlss 4 and the new type of vram, the final situation is as follows: 8.6 vram and 137 fps. That's a one-tenth increase in fps and not even a one-tenth decrease in vram usage.

9 gb is good, let's simply multiply them by two: So in a game like Indiana Jones which uses 18 gb, the 5000 series is 8.6*2=17.2 GB

Yes, friends, if you are going to use 4K and you are going to do it at the highest settings, it is already clear that the 5000 series (including 5080), except for the 5090, will be insufficient for 4K and for such games. So there are two possibilities, either you will buy 5090 or you will buy and use the ..90 series of one of the old series. 3090 and 4090 24 GB.",0

qJ7AF4K6kKY,@discoveryofreality,2024-12-11T19:40:27Z,"FOR NVIDIA GRAPHICS CARDS THE ANSWER IS CLEAR, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT IT IS THE TOP VERSION (..90), NOT THE NEW SERIES (4000, 5000)!

Note: This important observation is especially true for those with top-of-the-line PC hardware.

There is no in-between in this regard. I can't tell you how glad I am that I didn't make the grave mistake of leaving the 3090 and buying the 4080. I've been playing with Dlss turned off a lot lately anyway, the picture quality is much better. Anyone who reads and understands the article below understands very well that there is nothing in between. There is no need for that new generation in terms of performance for someone with a 3090 and good pc hardware. Look, I did not experience the slightest stuttering in stalker 2. The difference in image quality is very little difference between 3090-4090. A friend said 20 percent, but he is also unknown. Will these new low-quality games give us that 20% difference in image quality, let me laugh so that it is not wasted. The important thing for the 3090 owner is that the other components are top notch. And the screen too.

To make it more concrete in the mind: These guys are saying that you won't have performance problems with Dlss and your cards will last longer, right? But that's only partially true for those with relatively low PC hardware. And they confuse you with fancy presentations as if it improves the image quality. For example, for a long time, until I understood the business (and I'm so curious that I read and research, despite that), I envisioned Dlss as something that improves image quality. Then I realized that only ray tracing and a more powerful card improve the image quality. Never Dlss and Frame Generation.

1- Well, those with good PC hardware and powerful graphics cards don't need Dlss and Frame Generation anyway!

2- Those with low PC hardware or those with ..50, ..60, ..70 or even ..80 series, except for the ..90 series, will not be able to take full advantage of those image quality enhancing features because they will open Dlss in performance mode (dlss performance mode runs the game at 720p, like a joke) and will have to lower the game settings and turn off ray tracing! What do we understand now!

3- Let's talk about cards lasting longer. This is also a complete lie and something that will not happen for a significant part of the time, because you will not be able to use those new series cards comfortably for that long due to the lack of Vram. There is only one exception, because of the high Vram and power, and that is the ..90 series.

So the smartest investment for someone with a 3090 video card is to invest in PC hardware. For example, if the PC Ram is 16 GB, you should buy 32 or 64 GB Dual ram. Buy a PCIe 4.0 M2 SSD. Like upgrading the processor. These can be done easily with the money to be given to the card. The most obvious example of this happened in Stalker 2. Those with relatively low hardware and those without 32 ram could not play fluently. And this is the reason. PC ram scarcity. So the friend went and bought a 4060 or 4070 because it was the new series, the latest and most advanced technology. But this is the problem.

They deceive us so badly and they are so cunning that it is natural to be confused and deceived. I couldn't see the issue clearly for a long time. Then these points became clearer and clearer in my mind over time by thinking, researching, reading and comparing people's experiences and complaints.

The answer we wrote to a friend who has 4080 in his system and stated that he would save money for 5080:

‚ÄúI wrote and write these things because I am not willing that anyone should pay a lot of money and not get what they pay for. Many people have accepted and confirmed this opinion and determination. Even those who had negative experiences in this direction shared them in detail. (Someone shared his regret in selling 3090 and buying 4080.) The essence of the issue is that we have determined that it is not appropriate to pay a ton of money to buy these cards, as the vram is insufficient in the current table (only 16 GB for 4080 and 5080), except for the latest top versions (..90). ...80 version cards are powerful, but they will not be able to use their power with 12, 16 GB vram, you will have to lower the settings in the face of games that consume 18-19 vram (Star Wars Outlaws for example). Unused power has no value. Dlss increases fps, lowers image resolution. But there is no solution to the lack of vram in 4000 series Dlss. Pay attention to this. Ray tracing also improves the image but decreases the fps. Therefore, with neither 4080 nor 5080 with 12 GB vram, you will not be able to play smoothly with maximum image quality at 4K ultra settings in many next generation games.

Yes, we accept that the new generation (4000, 5000) series cards are more powerful and can provide slightly better image quality, but using that power is only possible when the vram is high. Since this is not possible with vram, you will open Dlss, resolution will drop, you will open ray tracing, fps will drop.

So I mean, you will only be able to reach an image quality that the 3090 already provides more than enough (provided that you do not compromise on the fluent playing experience). So why would you pay for this stuff!

In this case, since the 3090 is 24 GB, it is inappropriate to drop it and pay a lot of money and buy 4080 or 5080 16 GB. In the current situation, I can easily say that if you can afford the 5090, buy it. If not, buy 4090. If you can't buy it either, buy 3090. But definitely do not buy 4080-5080 or lower versions. Of course, this applies to those who want 4K, smooth and high image quality gaming experience and those who already have a high-end PC hardware. But it also applies to those who settle for lesser image quality and lower settings. If you're playing 2K, why do you need a 4080, 5080? A more affordable card for that resolution will do the job. Since the need for vram will drop significantly there, there is no need to pay for power and technology that will not be used with the same logic.‚Äù

Does DLSS Increase FPS? Yes, DLSS can increase FPS (frames per second). By using AI-assisted sampling, the graphics card is enabled to render at a lower resolution and render the image at a higher resolution. This results in a smoother gaming experience with higher FPS.

Does DLSS Degrade the Image? DLSS is designed to improve image quality in general. However, in some cases, especially at low DLSS settings, blurs or other graphical anomalies may occur in the image. High DLSS modes minimize these problems.

Does DLSS Reduce VRAM? DLSS does not directly reduce VRAM usage, but it can help the graphics card use VRAM more efficiently. Because it starts by rendering at a lower resolution, the stress on VRAM is reduced, which can indirectly optimize VRAM usage.",0
qJ7AF4K6kKY,@discoveryofreality,2024-12-11T19:37:17Z,"‚ÄúBy keeping graphics memory low, which is actually extremely cost-effective, Nvidia ensures that graphics cards die early (planned obsolescence) and that lower-end cards are not used at high resolutions even though they can afford them. 

In other words, Nvidia is forcing its customers to buy high-end cards from which it makes insane profits. It does this by deliberately crippling the lower level via Vram. ‚Äù",0

Well, as I said in my previous message, let those who have the means buy the latest ..90 series, since most of us do not have the means, it is most reasonable to buy two generations or the previous generation zero or second hand ..90 series. 

Look, if the card is powerful and the vram is enough (i.e. ..90 series), there is no problem. You know what the only issue is? I mean, the only reason to buy the latest version ..90 series is RTX-Ray Tracing, which is what you really need. (I don't think that's a good reason to pay that much money either, but we've covered that below).

I mean, believe me, even in Full Ray Tracing, it doesn't affect the visual quality that much in most games, it doesn't make that much of a difference, but since it degrades performance and causes serious stuttering, that's where the 4090 is needed. For example, in the Indiana Jones game, which requires 4090 at ultra 4K settings, I only need it if ray tracing is full on, otherwise I can play with 3090 at ultra 4K with very good quality and full smoothness. 

And you know what I did, of course it's not the same as trying with 4090, but I overlocked the ram and processor and this time I tried again with 3090 at 4K ultra and full ray tracing at the highest settings. Dlss off or on, but quality or automatic, I tried them all one by one. Normally, the game was getting sluggish with the 3090 when I turned on ray tracing before overclocking. So I agreed that it really needed 4090, but after overlocking, it didn't stutter at all, but with ray tracing, the ray tracing visuals were not so ‚ÄúOh my! This has become a wonderful and indispensable visual feast! I should definitely get a 4090 or 5090!‚Äù there was no difference. In fact, the difference is almost non-existent in this game. Obviously, that new update for that rtx came for nothing, what difference did it make. Of course, these may vary according to the game, but this is my observation. There were already those who said that the visual quality was only 20% difference compared to 3090, but according to what and according to whom. Think about it, while it was only possible to play with full ray tracing with the 4090, I achieved the same possibility by safely and automatically overlocking the ram and processor in 5 minutes (with the Asus motherboard bios feature). So you really need to think about how necessary it really is. I mean, if there was a huge difference and all new games came out as a wonderful visual feast, but there is not. Therefore, this is the situation.",0
qJ7AF4K6kKY,@discoveryofreality,2024-12-11T19:33:22Z,"Friends, let's sit down and talk straight now, okay, Indiana game is beautiful in many ways, but it has many shortcomings and weaknesses, but I can say this clearly, it is definitely not the AAA game of 2024, and it does not offer a visual feast that deserves 4090 at 4K ultra settings, so I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying it's not as good and top-notch in every aspect as it is exaggerated in the promotions. The real AAA games that came out years ago look much, much better and smoother than these new releases and Indiana in every aspect. The gameplay is clunky, the pace isn't high enough, the graphics aren't that top-notch, and the artificial intelligence is nowhere to be seen. Now it's impossible to understand why some people give it 9-10.

I think 9-10 is very inaccurate and too high. When we take into account the good, bad and average things, it can only be 7. The gameplay is very clunky. The story and sense of adventure is not very paced. So a 7 is appropriate. I mean, it's so strange that the game is given a 9-10. And you're going to give 13-15 to much better games than this! This is ridiculous. Stalker 2 getting a 7 is another absurdity. It deserves a score like 4-5.

Please try to understand my logic, it's wrong to give 9-10 points out of the blue just because something is nice and you like it, because something is done well. There are many flaws and weaknesses in this game, yes there are some very good things, but they cannot be a justification for giving 9-10 points. Maybe the best thing to do is to list the pros and cons and score it separately from various angles, as some people do, and when this is done and averaged, it becomes clear that this is a game that can only get a 7. The gameplay is clunky, the story pace is low, it feels like an adventure, but it doesn't have a meaningful story, and the picture quality is barely close to AAA productions from years ago, Days Gone for example is much better and smoother than this. Otherwise, it dragged me for hours and I played it, but that doesn't mean it's so great, flawless, complete that I would give it a 9, you can, but it would be a feeling grade.

This game is available globally for $70 for the base game and $100 for the Premium Edition. It's a joke. That's slang for ‚Äúripping people off‚Äù. In other words, this game is not a top AAA production that will never fully justify this high price, no matter what anyone says and no matter how many 9-10 points they give it, this is the truth. If it met your expectations and you liked it very much, that's another matter. That's not the point we emphasize and draw attention to.

The most beautiful and quality content of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the cinematics...",1

Some people said that ranged is far more important on higher difficulty. Wonder if the enemy take shots less well there are of it's only you who gets shot up.
Russian Stealth successful.
The hole isn't even large enough to get something like that diesel generator set through.
So the Italians preserve the outer wall despite having bulldozers but the first thing Indy does upon entering is smashing a wall in. Riiight. So somehow the only thing the Italians actually dug up and investigated is that small antechamber?
Interesting that Voss was speaking English instead of German. Then again, it's Indy's hallucination.
I hate it when you have to stand in the excact spot even though others would make sense just as well.
I don't think the game could decide whether you were up or down as well, but hey doesn't have to make sense and actually helps the confusion.
The game calls the thing a Rebreather as well. So... I don't know.
""If there's no door number eleven, we just have to make one."" Perfect dream logic.
Hate it that Brody spelled out the solution without you needing his help. They really should have used the ""take a picture if you want a hint"" more with some of the NPCs.

A prototype rebreather was built in 1849 by Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard.
In 1853 Professor T. Schwann presented a rebreather at the Belgian Academy of Science.

No, the Watchers were fallen angels, or rather they were angels who came to Earth to share knowledge with humanity and then ""fell"" because they took human wives and had half-angel children.
Those children were the giants called Nephilim. In this telling of the story, the Biblical Flood is heavily implied to in part having been done to drown the remaining Nephilim, although there are tales of some that were loyal to God and therefore were allowed to survive, by standing on top of the tallest mountains until the water receded.

Also, them having predated the Christian church would be easily explained, the Old Testament predated the Christian church by quite a bit, obviously, and it takes heavy inspiration (IE: shamelessly plagiarizes with a few changed names) earlier flood myths, among other things. Since the Nephilim are connected to the Flood in apocrypha, it would stand to reason that any actual people that those tales refer to must be even older.",3

xF8huW3imyk,@rickamsler3088,2025-01-15T19:48:40Z,"there were some things that bothered me on my playthrough of the great circle. 

One rather playfully being my wife who was essentially watching me play for the movie esq experience. (she didn't like me trying to push/punch/bash my way though most problems/bad guys)

there were a few times where Jones ends up as the butt of a joke that just didn't land with me. and a few times that either Gina (our journalist) suddenly steps into the spotlight at the expense of jones when she isn't the experienced person in the scenario. 

There were a couple times my wife literally screamed at the TV because a character did/had/used something incorrectly or out of place for the time period. (she is very intense on historical fashion and traditions in media)

And there was genuinely only one time that I became hopelessly stuck for nearly an hour. which was the unfortunate result of an AI bug that I was thankfully able to correct with a save reversion.

Finally the ending comes rather abruptly (though not in a way that is unlike other Indiana jones films) and the time period that the game is set in left me feeling rather lost as to what should be next. I am hoping that the studio is able to greenlight a sequel (or even a film replication tie in) that can bridge the gap some more from the ending of this game into temple of doom. or to place between temple and last crusade. 

It was an enjoyable experience and I am actually planning on revisiting the game in a new playthrough for an 80% or better completion. I only completed about 50-60% of the games total content on my first playthrough.",0

1-Install Nvidia driver version 460.89
This driver supports the VK_KHR_ray_query extension at the software level. 

2-in the game shortcut properties add these lines
""C:\Games\IndianaJones\IndianaJones.exe"" +r_raytracing 0 +r_renderAPI 1 +r_forceMinimalVulkanFeatures 1

3-Go to the folder where the game settings files are stored.

There are a few cons however, like the map not showing all the ancient relics unless you're in the tombs or some of the ""unlock"" puzzles (I'm thinking the safe and box locks mostly) I thought weren't clear.

Arcade games: Raiders & Temple of Doom are great. 

All of the NES and SNES games are terrible 

But The fate of Atlantis adventure game, the last crusade adventure game, Lego Indiana jones 1/2, and the great circle are good/great Indiana jones games.

Like when I say the majority of games are bad I mean they‚Äôre REALLY bad, Indiana was getting passed around to every untested dev team that either had only one or no games under their belt, or made only religious games prior (for this example they closed their doors when the Indiana jones game failed.)",0

The puzzles and tomb like ruins showed puzzles i thought i could do and then had no clues or way to solve them and then the place was done and avoided the puzzles. It's been really underwhelming. Troy Baker is carrying this game 1000% with his great imitation of Prime Indy. I want to see more of the game. I just wish keep waiting for the gane to be fun exciting or have puzzles that it will allow me to solve. The reloading animation is infinite and the game has just 6 bullets in it. The stamina bar allows you to punch 4 times and then become unable to defend yourself for what feel like an eternity. Frustrating and cranky gameplay with a mind boggling first person view that feel like it just doesn't belong. Enemies cant ever see you and when they miraculously do they lose you outnof nowhere. 5 out of 10 so far.,1

7vtJgVglmNI,@paul28177,2024-12-15T11:03:52Z,"I really want to love this game but there are a lot of issues with it. I grew up with tomb raider and fell in love with uncharted - both which are arguably inspired by indiana jones. The game does look beautiful - i've only just started egypt...there's plenty to explore and it's very detailed but theres a lot of compromise. The NPCs are what ruin the game - they feel like souless robots set on a loop. With advancements in gaming we should be able to interact, such as bumping into them, squeezing through a crowd, etc - they should also be able to react to whats happening around them... at best this game as select dialogue (often just a greeting) as you get close to someone. You can have a bunch of soldiers after you and the locals just don't notice. You can also have soldiers on high alert and all you have to do is go through a doorway and be fine. In the vatican city on the stair cases to the library there are two priests which spend hours upon hours adjusting a painting and also two nuns having the same conversation over and over again. When in the college i had the other professor following me, but i'd go through one door way and he enter on the opposite side even though he was literally just behind me. I've had NPCs walk into a room, pause and vanish...even had them walk through a solid door. What is extremely laughable is you can have a hammer, you literally smash it against the soldiers head and somehow he's still standing and ready to fight.
Sadly it doesn't feel finished (like many games nowadays they release them and then gradually patch it up over time).
Personally I don't like the first person style. I know they want us to feel like we are indy but this immersion is constantly broken when you need to swing or climb etc so whats the point. One on one swinging punches is fine but have more soldiers join the fight and it becomes a hot mess. The first person mode can make it difficult to view the map...and the crawling in stelth mode is laughable with the limp hands - kinda makes me think indy with doing an impression of T-rex.

It is a decent game. I just wish they'd have given us the option of 1st or 3rd person. I also wish there was more treasure to be found laying around the place. At the moment I am finding eygpt a bit repetative... it just feels like i'm doing what i did in the vatican city but now in a new location - it's not really advancing forward - you have similar side quests (you even have another secret boxing club)... each level should be something new that advances the story (up until egypt this is how the game is... the opening, the college, the vatican - all different and progressing the story... but egypt just feels like a clone of the vatican)

I know theres more location so i will contue and just hope the game picks up its pace",0

True next level graphics, lighting, artistry that makes the real-time game look just like pre-rendered cutscene level quality and a Story that is only matched by the first Raiders Movie. The voice acting is Emy Award level good.  The voice actor for Indiana sounds 100% like young Harrison Ford that is so uncany you'll think it's a voice deepfake.   The attention to environment and object detail is astounding and this game is far more immersive than I was expecting.  The full breadth of physics of the fighting and movement is freakishly next level  good.  Imagine the fighting-physics  of  RD2  in FPV but fleshed out and expanded into a 1:1 accurate simulator of the Indiana Jones movies.. and that's what this feels like.  fantastic.

Really gotta five Todd credit for pulling this out. And Machine knocked it out of the park. For me one of the best gaming experiences of all time. The artwork of the books alone is top notch. Its also kinda insane how well designed the vatican is and how much there is to do in general. Every side Quest seems meaningful , great Progression. Fantastic open design. Unholy amount of secrets and passages etc. So many little details everywhere. If you enjoy history its even better. Its filled with love for Indiana Jones. Its so detailed , that must have been a ton of work.I could go on and on. I hope we get more of it. Thanks a lot. I love it",0

There‚Äôs so much jam packed into each environment, so many subtle nods to classic Indiana moments. This game easily felt at home with the 3 OG classics right down to the graininess, the film score and the little sound cues when certain things happen. Is this a perfect game? Absolutely not, it has some bugginess that sort of broke the game early on, however, I was able to correct it by rolling back to an earlier save file.

I'm not saying that type of relationship didn't happen in the 30s. I'm saying they would not talk about it to a person they just met during that time period. It was a serious thing because, especially in Egypt, where it was done, it was the death penalty for being gay.

I personally enjoy the switch to third person for the cinematics, because then it feels more, you know, cinematic. Like I'm getting to watch new Indy vignettes as a reward for my hard work. I also love the initial transition from third to first person when loading a save. Like the game is saying ""Hey, look, it's Indy. OK, you're Indy now.""",0

- you can't close doors behind you, or go under tables, turn off the lights (that was years ago in games)
- downed enemies respawn constantly and greet you with a smile even though you punched them in the face 3 minutes ago
- they're as stupid as a brick, you can run past any blockade and after a while they're not looking for you anymore
- moving bodies doesn't make sense, because enemies often 'see' where your friends fell even if you move the body (lol)
- enemies fall like rag dolls
- our hero screams so loud after punching someone in the face that it echoes, and guy 5 meters away doesn't even turn his head
- cutscenes are detached from the gameplay (there may be a pile of bodies in the room that disappear into the cutscene)
- the game is unfinished in many places, made without passion and linear to the point of pain

This game today looks graphically dated and doesn't deserve to be tarnished even more by default turned on rtx crap.
Otherwise the game scenery and gameplay are awesome....but it should have been created on at least Unreal Engine 4 from 2013 if not UT 5.

rN5BrUQ9CrA,@Benjj99413,2024-12-09T18:16:04Z,"I enjoyed Veilguard. Indy is kind of meh so far.  Go figure.  Youtube is advertising as much as anyone even if ACG is one of the good guys.  I think it's Nolan North who voices Indy and he sounds Harrison Ford ish but is lacking the sarcasm and bite and the controls aren't too good either.  Like acg pointed out how it switches from 3rd person to 1st person feels clunky.  Uncharted is a better game honestly but it's ok minus the internet drama and sheeple.  Cinematically the game is good.  It still feels off though the writing is typical of newer games.   It might pick up.  I'm not that far in.  Machinegames first person shooters is their thing.  This more has the clunkyness and blandness of a Bethesda game so far.  Weird how people said Veilguard felt safe when it's more like a pixar movie/god of war/assassins creed collectathon clone even with it's flaws and streamlining of rpg elements and gamey puzzles. I think it pushed boundaries too even if neither game is what I would do while still maintaining remnants of the old bioware.   I honestly enjoyed it more than God of War which got 10's..  There also isn't a lot of filler like ubisoft games.  This feels safe to me.  I honestly wouldn't trust youtubers with their agendas as much as these corporations.  Acg is at least consistant and keeps it within his scope of what makes a good game. Even if he isn't the end all be all  Then you have reviewers that give every game a 7. and listen to the hype/hate too much  This game I probably would.  Just because that's probably what it deserves.  It has more a story and streamlined approach and is Indiana Jones which gives it personalityy but also feels safe and bland in areas.  Which is pretty much what I expected from bethesda and machine games.  The environments are well crafted in both games and immersive and pretty to look at and lack of bugs.  Still all these games are lacking something, even if they are becoming more streamlined, and the youtube drama is equally soulless as far as game design.  They are all sellouts and not the brightest tacks and guilty themselves of political posturing and garbage.",0

I have a feeling that the ""open areas"" are smaller than they want to show you in this trailer, and ""freedom"" of movement and choices are going to be closer to the last Tomb Raiders, if not even less, rather than a proper open world game.

- They mention a lesbian relationship at some point (I didn't even catch this)
- Indiana Jones personality is nerfed
- She has a short hair cut
- Can be a bit of a girl boss
- They don't sexualize Gina
- Cultural appropriation is mentioned at some point

ujQvnt1IdBk,@Zerinth,2025-02-18T16:49:35Z,i would say slight wokeness so far.  Gina constantly belittles dr jones (for no reason just coz) and purposefully tries to ditch him when they leave for the airship.  They also have Voss make a bizarre comment about how easy it is to manipulate insecure men so bit sexist that comment.  When they meet Nawal the camera shifts in the various cutscenes focusing on her to present her as main character. e.g. Nawal and Gina discuss what to do ie main plot whilst Dr Jones is offscreen with his comedy superfluous feeding snake moment.  They just sit there and laugh.  Whole situation felt forced.  And i am only at Cairo...so will see how things go from here...  You need to look at how the game director is presenting these scenes.  Hopefully will be able to ditch Gina from now (i did notice she was the one finding all the clues to the puzzles ahh lol),0

In the original movies he‚Äôs very athletic (e.g. chasing down and fighting trucks full of Nazis) and he certainly doesn‚Äôt get gassed after two punches. He clumsy and he does he get his ass kicked but the guy is athletic. 2) I don‚Äôt get why he can‚Äôt aim down sights. Indy has military training and he willingly carries a gun because he knows how to use it and knows he might need it. They‚Äôre acting like he‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs never shot a gun before like again‚Ä¶Alan Wake. Otherwise I love how in keeping with the character this game is!!

iorN8RRB2Yk,@hnglbanana,2024-12-23T20:14:22Z,"as is tradition, to the joy and anticipation of exactly nobody, i'm going to post my best/worst/blandest 5 guesses again. here we go

best: -
1: pacific drive
2: yellow taxi goes vroom
3: cryptmaster
4: nine sols
5: prince of persia: the lost crown

worst: -
1: suicide squad: kill the justice league
2: skull and bones
3: dragon's dogma 2
4: south park: snow day
5: helldivers 2

blandest: -
1: alone in the dark
2: stellar blade
3: wuthering waves
4: banishers: ghosts of new eden

for 5th blandest, i have 3 different ideas that i can't decide between. my actual pick would be star wars outlaws, but considering the profile the game has, i can't tell if it will make the blandest list at all. it might be on the worst games list, or it might be so obvious that it doesn't make any of the lists. my second pick would be black myth: wukong; i don't actually think it would place that highly as a bland game, BUT i could see yahtzee using it to set up a joke about 'animal themed soulslikes' so that it can immediately be followed by nine sols taking 4th best. failing that, my actual next pick for 5th blandest would be phantom fury",0

iorN8RRB2Yk,@Vareon-r1h,2024-12-19T10:53:04Z,"3:25 The reason screwing up in games is a problem but not in movies is not just because in movies it's written to happen and written to turn out fine in the end but also because further gameplay is often directly affected by how well you perform and only rarely not considerably worse if you screw up, even if screwing up is an option in the first place and not just game over.

In games it usually means having to fight 5+ zombies in a monitor's closer with your knife while getting bitten every other second and running out of healing items by the 2nd zombie vs having a grenade launcher and blowing up the zombies in one hit and not the way it works in movies which would translate into gameplay like failing to get the grenade launcher but still having an Uzi with plenty ammo so it's still fun to kill the zombies and not a chore or even borderline impossible. 

Not to mention how the vast majority of games make a big deal about performing well and giving more rewards the better you do so screwing up a few times means you are now using LVL 20 year in a LVL 45 area because you got worse rewards, meaning no good gear drops or even enough gold to buy upgrades from the shop, again directly translating to the game being a lot less fun.",0
iorN8RRB2Yk,@Vareon-r1h,2024-12-19T10:42:09Z,"2:25 Yeah, No, that's insane.
That's like saying The Force Awakens was good because you didn't like the prequel trilogy and not because of Force Awakens actually having merit.

The point is that everyone is on board with the story sticking to formula BUT that doesn't mean just recycling most of the plot of popular previous instalments is good.

If Force Awakens or this weren't made by the original IP owners it would be called plagiarism, it's like saying PoE is as much a Diablo style game as Diablo Hellfire is (""action rpg"" is a terrible term to use because aside from Diablo style games it also applies to e.g. FFXV or PSO2 which are totally different so The term loses all meaning if used for Diablo like games).

Recycling most of the story is just lazy and boring and there are countless cases where sequels stuck close to the popular formula without just using search and replace but barely changing the story in any other way.

The only reason it is done is the same reason most Hollywood movies are adaptations of existing IPs, -quels or remakes if older movies"" it's a hell lot cheaper if do only the bare minimum of effort required to turn a profit and for popular IPs like this the bar is low indeed in terms of story.",2
