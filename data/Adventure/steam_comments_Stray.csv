"It's rare but every now and then you find one of those special games that you know will stay with you, and Stray was one of them for me. Man, I don't even know where to start. The game is truly beautiful, I had to keep stopping just to snap screenshots. The story is emotionally beautiful (I might say beautiful a lot but oh well, describes the game perfectly  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and it was just an enjoyable and beautiful experience from start to finish. 

No bugs or stutters, played perfectly on a middle of the road PC and you can tell there was so much love and care put into making this game. I'm not usually a fan of stealth but actually had fun with it in Stray when it came to those little stealth sections. This review is all over the place because I'm still emotional after finishing this BEAUTIFUL game.

"A great game to play in the face of societal collapse. Sometimes very sad, but somehow very optimistic, too.",True,9,0,2025-02-13 22:18:46
"If you enjoy immersive worlds, exploration, problem solving, a little sci-fi dystopia, and cats, then this is everything you could want. Stray is a touching story wrapped in a beautiful world experienced though a novel character. Take it from another feline, this is an excellent game for fellow feline aficionados out there.",True,3,1,2025-02-15 06:01:43
"In [i]Stray[/i], you control an adorable ginger cat who strays from its herd and stumbles into an underground city. Originally built by humans to survive a post-apocalyptic future, the city now feels abandoned—populated only by quirky robots and mutant bacteria. Your mission is to navigate this eerie world and find your way back to the surface with the help of an insomniac robot companion.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

[i]Stray[/i] is a cinematic third-person adventure that blends exploration, stealth, action, and horror.

The standout feature is its feline protagonist, whose natural limitations shape every aspect of the gameplay. As a cat, you can’t reach wall-mounted controls, carry most items, or engage in combat. Instead, interactions rely on your versatile robot companion, who picks up objects, opens doors and containers, and translates signs and speech. Although switching between the cat and the robot is seamless, moments when the robot is unavailable emphasize just how helpless the cat can be without its companion.

[h3]Presentation[/h3]

Powered by Unreal Engine 4, [i]Stray[/i] looks nice and runs well—even on a Steam Deck. The game presents a clear contrast: on one hand, cute, exaggerated character designs, and on the other, a bleak, dystopian environment with aspects of cosmic horror. Separately, the crisp lighting and vibrant colors set the mood and guide you effectively through the world.

[h3]Story[/h3]

[i]Stray[/i] weaves together several narratives: a dystopian tale of humanity’s self-destruction, an existential journey of robot slaves in a post-human world, and the personal quest of a robot regaining lost memories. The cat serves primarily as the player vehicle, while the story focuses on the robot companion and the city.

In my experience, the narrative is easy to follow and well-paced, with the most compelling moments emerging from subtle insights into the everyday lives of the robots and the environmental storytelling. However, I felt that the broader human downfall and the robot’s personal journey sometimes came across as underdeveloped and emotionally distant.

[h3]Replay Value[/h3]

At a premium price of $30, [i]Stray[/i] is a relatively short experience that can be completed over the course of an evening. While the cat’s size and vertical movement options create an illusion of a vast world, most areas are small and offer next to no optional content. Although some action sequences allow you to spare enemies, these choices have no impact on the overall story or game world. Ultimately, despite its unique charm, the game offers little reason to replay it beyond revisiting its distinctive world.",True,22,0,2025-02-20 13:21:10
Easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time simply for its relaxing features. Being able to just hop on and run around solving things as you go. The story feels ALOT like nier automata to me. Its mind twisting storytelling without having a direct storyline. It tells its story through the environment and some npc encounters. But mostly through its environments. Its beautiful and the end of the game will have you wishing it had another 40 hours in it. I recommend this game for absolutely anyone to try and i encourage you to get it. And i dont do that often!,True,1,0,2025-02-23 23:01:43
"a very chill and relaxing game. it's a linear, platform, puzzle solving game with a great story. its the type of game you can play after beating a souls-like game",True,1,0,2025-02-27 15:33:57
"I really enjoyed it.
Got hooked by the story, that game succeed to create a very special ambiance that touched me.
Not a difficult game, neither it is very long. I spent about 21 hours. One can probably finish it faster, but I played part of it with my son. But it's pleasant and relaxing.
I dunno how to describe. It is quite a unique game.

Looks amazing on a OLED screen even though it doesn't have an HDR mode.
Runs like a charm on Arch/linux.

I highly recommend it :)",True,1,0,2025-02-27 15:18:49
"I don't really write review about games, but this one deserves it. Played through it and had so much fun. For those wanting to experience how to be a cat, this game is for you.

"Amazing atmosphere, World building and attention to detail. By the end, i really didn't want the game to end. First play through took me around 3.5 hours and the length is it's only real downside for me. Loved it so much, i needed to 100% it.",True,1,0,2025-02-26 11:11:25
To really get everything out of this game I'd suggest doing all the side content. A lot of the deeper parts of the story are there. Its really good. Also something you can buy for your kids/sisters kids and not be worried about anything. Fun puzzles and exploration. Really a highlight if you're into story driven games.,True,2,0,2025-02-25 08:12:40
"[h3] what a game! one of the most visually pleasant game that i have played. [/h3]

It's so pretty that, I spent most of my time finding good spots for screenshot and it essentially become a walking simulator to me. (check out my screenshots) :)

Story is straight-forward, nothing special but well-executed, it progresses chapter by chapter as you are doing the missions. The theme also changes by chapter so I feel like getting into another film set for screenshots. 
I want to praise the movement mechanics being well-designed and pleasant to play with, swift and agile, it might not be fully accurate described but you do feel like a cat. Instead of having only fixed spots which will actually progress your game, the amount of spots that you can jump on is also more than expected. Puzzles are reasonable, adding some interactions for gameplay. Most of them are based on hints where you have to explore without much guidance, [spoiler] I got really lost in that part where you have to distract the shopkeeper in order to take the worker vest and helmet, ended up having to look up guide. [/spoiler], but I think it's cleverly designed to force players to actively explore the area. Details are magnificent and need no my further elaboration. 

I deliberately played with controller and I do think it gives better experience than kb and mouse. You got to lay back and sprint and jump with your joystick which makes the whole gameplay smoother. Same with camera movement where you can move in a more constant speed hence giving it a cinematic feeling. However, I'm getting slight motion-sickness which I don't get too often, but I managed to get through til the end.

Recommend! Turn yourself into a cat and save the world!",True,1,1,2025-02-21 13:26:34
"Beautiful game where you get to be a silly cat who helps some cool looking robots :) The soundtrack is amazing, same with the visuals. The story is great with puzzles that aren't too hard but enough to get a decent amount of time from the game. Really hoping we get a second game! 10/10 would recommend :)",True,1,0,2025-02-06 20:04:36
"Awesome game to play, really enjoyed it and will definitely go through again sometime. Great visual design and graphics, and the dystopian theming is conveyed well through both creative and engaging visual storytelling.",True,2,0,2025-02-05 13:45:41
"Overall, 4.23/5.00 stars.

Such a unique, exploration game that is a true hidden gem. I absolutely loved every key aspect to this game from the colors, symbols, characters, enemies, interface, plot, story, etc. My favorite part of the game is all of the small features that relate to cats and how they interact with the world. I recommend this game to any person who loves single-player, open-world games. As for my trophy hunters out there, this game some difficult trophies, but they can be obtained in about 8-10 hours of gameplay. My only real concern is the subpar ending, in which I felt empty and sad. No answers, no visuals to my imagination of what the outside looks like, just a short cliffhanger-like cutscene. Be WARNED: The game starts sad and ends sad.

Issues: There is an issue that has been unsolved for years where when you break down one of the paintings in Momo's house, it will glitch you outside the map. There is also a glitch where one of the memories in ""The Sewers"" chapter is unobtainable if your fps is ""Uncapped."" It essentially won't let you walk pass an invisible barrier inside of the tube/tunnel. The achievement ""Can't Cat-ch me"" is by far the most difficult and many players will struggle with its' RNG like outcome. 

Fix: Set your frames to 60 fps or lower to fix the wall glitch and ""The Sewers"" glitch. To maximize the ease of getting the achievement, simply lower your frames to 30 fps and zigzag your way through the Zurks. (There are a couple YouTube videos on common glitches inside of the game)

"This is one of the most unique, visually pleasing, and heartwarming games I've played in a long time. Though it doesn't delve to deeply into lore or philosophy, it manages to tell a compelling story that asks surprisingly profound questions about the nature of identity, hope, and friendship---all while centering on a feline protagonist who can't communicate except by meowing and clawing things. It's made me reflect on my own friendships, including with my cats, who don't seem to understand what exactly made me so emotional when the game's credits rolled but were right there to comfort me anyway.

I would recommend this game to just about anyone, not just people with a softspot for cats or an interest in sci-fi dystopias. It's a brilliant work of art that provides a meaningful experience, and it's well worth the cost despite its short length. Even after just finishing it I'm eager to dive back in and find more sheet music for Morusque to play on his jerry can guitar and to curl up among the cushions in Clementine's loft for a little longer. It's these small moments that really make it special, the moments of rest and meditation that are an essential complement to the game's story elements and action sequences. 

As I finished the game I was reminded of a quote from John Gray's book Feline Philosophy: ""Humans cannot become cats. Yet if they set aside any notion of being superior beings, they may come to understand how cats can thrive without anxiously inquiring how to live."" This game, which puts the player in control of a small feline amidst the ruins of a man-made world still rife with humanity's troubles even in the absence of human beings, offers an opportunity to seek the understanding Gray suggests.

There is a lot we can learn from cats that is easy for us to lose sight of, has hectic and stressful as human life can be. The quiet hours spent in relaxation, play, and curiosity are just as important as the time we spend working towards a paycheck or some other goal. Can you imagine a cat ""on the grind?"" Of course not. Because cats understand innately that you don't need wealth or achievement to get what matters out of life. Sometimes all you need is an inquisitive mind, a friend to play with, or just a soft pillow to curl up on for a nice, long nap.",True,3,0,2025-02-16 01:23:33

"This is one of my most favourite gaming experiences.  The way in which you discover the story and the characters along the way is a real treat.  The Puzzle sequences while never being truly frustratingly difficult still give you a good feeling of accomplishment.  While I won't give anything away, the story must be experienced.  it's not overly long, my first play through clocked in at 7.5 hours. If you like cyberpunk and love cats this game is for you. 10/10 Would cuddle Cyber Woolly Bully again.  Also if you pick it up on a sale like March 3rd 2025 Midweek deal (-40%)  It's a really great value for the money.",True,0,0,2025-02-27 18:18:03

For example, it would have been cool to be able to take a stealthy rooftop route to avoid danger. As it is, you really have to do the mission in the way intended.

"What an incredible experience this story-based adventure puzzle game was. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, and at times, I even raged a bit. In Stray, you play as a cat who gets separated from his other cat friends with an end goal of making it back to the outside. You will wander through a dilapidated dystopian society, making friends with the inhabitants and even helping them out along the way. As you walk through the neighborhoods, city, and ""Zurk zones"", you will learn about how society got this way, where the humans went, and about the lives of those around you. The puzzles in this game are fairly intuitive and I never really found myself getting turned around a lot despite the slightly open-world element of some areas of the game. The story is definitely the focus of this game and I would also like to highlight how incredibly beautiful the design of this game is. The art style, the environment, the graphics, how you can interact with your surroundings, and the connections you make throughout this game is really just a nice cherry on top of an overall excellent experience. I truly do feel like this is something everyone should try to play, even if just for the story and art style alone.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 20:30:54

Stray was a unique and emotional experience, a game I’d give anything to play for the first time again and again.

Stray really hit me in a certain emotional way that's hard to describe. Some moments in the game are cute and funny, some moments feel numb and melancholic, and other moments yet are hopeful and heart-warming.

The whole atmosphere is astounding, with really a really unique visual fingerprint that I enjoyed. Beautiful in its own post-humanity dystopian way. There's a wide variety of characters to meet and interact with, an each responds to this unexpected kitty in their own way.

Gameplay is smooth and controls pretty intuitive. I did turn off the visual prompt that shows you when you can jump, since I thought it was a bit distracting and movement is so natural anyway.
Total story playtime can be just a few hours if you're rushing it, but exploration along the way is definitely rewarded.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 08:36:03

"Game is okay. Graphics and music are great. Sound effects are also on point, which is important since as a cat you make a lot of cat-like sounds. Story is alright, although like most story-based games I play, I wish there was more lore at the end of the game talking about or showing what happens to everyone. 

Gameplay is being a cat and exploring the world, as well as a few chase sequences. The cat things you do, like meowing and scratching and running in front of other people, is very funny but mostly does nothing for advancing the story. The big thing that being a cat enables is jumping on different platforms to reach a destination. The jumpable places are not immediately obvious, but once you develop an eye for which environmental objects are jumpable then navigating the world is easier. There's also some collectables and sidequests if you like the worldbuilding and exploration.

Also, I got into this game expecting a comfy cat game, and for 80% of the game that's true. For the other 20% that's more intense, I was thrown off by them, with one place in particular stopping me in my tracks. ""Why am I here in this place, doing this thing? Where's my cute cat game about doing cute cat things?""

In the end, I still had fun with this game. But in the end, I wouldn't call this game a cat game where you do cat things. I'd say this is a game about exploring a sci-fi-ish, cyberpunky world from the perspective of a cat. I do recommend it though.

"When I saw Stray trending shortly after its release, I knew that I was inevitably going to end up picking it up. I love games that take me on a journey and tell a story, and Stray does just that. It's even less of a game, and more of a work of art. This adorable little orange kitty, which my fiance affectionately named Carrot, takes the player on an emotional journey after being separated from its siblings. You explore a mysterious civilization consisting of robots as you try to find your way back home. This game evokes a lot of different emotions and feelings, all culminating in a beautiful experience.

"Stray is one of those games that just gets what it wants to be. You’re a cat in a cyberpunk world, and somehow, that’s all it needs to be absolutely brilliant. The movement feels natural, the world is beautifully designed, and the little details—like knocking stuff over or curling up for a nap—make it feel so immersive.

The story is surprisingly emotional, the robot characters are charming, and the whole game is just a joy to explore. It’s not the longest game out there, but every moment is well worth it. If you love cats, great worldbuilding, or just chill games with heart, this one’s a must-play.

"Stray is not a long game, or a mechanically deep one. That's not an oversight - the game is focused entirely on your experience, being a cat. The atmosphere and quiet world-building in this game are phenomenal, and every little corner of the world feels like it's been cared for.

The visuals are amazing, not in the sense of glitzy ray tracing, but in that it's beautifully designed, quietly telling it's own story as you plod, jump, run and climb through the world. Just as importantly, your character moves very realistically, and the controls only support that feeling of effortless agility as a cat.

I can't really fault this game, except perhaps that the price is a little high for the number of hours you'll likely get out of it. On the other hand, it won't be one of those titles you could theoretically sink hundreds of hours into, but never get past the 10-hour mark.

I had my doubts before attempting the game because the concept felt odd. However, I'm now so glad I gave it a try! ""Stray"" has an engaging story and well-written characters that cause sympathy. The atmosphere of an abandoned cyberpunk city couldn't be delivered any better. You feel its vibes and stay motivated to explore. The gameplay and controls are simple and neat. I enjoyed. From the technical side, the game is well-made. It looks pretty, and I haven't encountered any bugs throughout my playthrough. I played on a Steam Deck. ""Stray"" is well-optimised for it and works flawlessly in medium-high settings. With 100% resolution scaling, I got a consistent 30 FPS, which is just right for this type of game.

There's something so unique and different about stray from the fact that you'll interact with every npc just out of curiosity or the fact that you can get lost just looking around at things.

"This game didn't click for me at first. I couldn't tell you why.

I've returned a couple years later and started a fresh play through, to be absolutely blown away by this game. The environment is amazing, the characters are, ironically, full of life and the gameplay is completely unique. 
Beautifully crafted level design is probably the stand out feature in this game to me. I really enjoyed the lowkey tutorial, lack of HUD and environmental ques throughout the game. The tutorial sequence is probably the best show case of this, in that you don't receive quest markers but a mysterious character is guiding you through via the electronics littered throughout the area. Great touch. 

The game is quite easy, but this doesn't detract from the fact that it does such a damn good job of making you feel like a cat as you progress through the story. Frequently found myself meowing at characters, trying to find things to knock off of tables, walls, etc.

"For context I played this game to take a break from World of Warcraft classic. And it delivered; I loved Stray, its a really chill game, you play as a cat, the graphics are stunning, what more could you want? Apart from more that is, this game has great quality but is quite short and left me wanting more to explore. Read on:
P.S: I missed the detail before playing it’s post-apocalyptic and some viewers may find the game terrifying in parts!

Pros: 
Engrossing, easy to follow storyline.
Engaging puzzles, problem solving and friendly npcs.
Beautiful atmosphere and environment design.
Really nice backing soundtracks.
Smooth gameplay, easy to control, user friendly.
Freedom to explore, smash pots, push things off tables and ledges, find secrets and uncover hidden memories.
You’re a cat.
Your lil guide is lovable, helpful, has its own lore and doesn't yell “hey!” 

Cons:
No camera distance option.
No zone or world map.
Not a lot of combat, more fleeing from danger (not a lot of that either relative to play-time).
The one weapon you get is short-lived. 
Limited cat movement (no jumping without a prompt somewhere).
Would like to find more secrets, easter eggs, achievements and overall more content for players like me turning it upside down in curiosity.

Story line:
I find it hard to stay focused on complex lore and story but found this really interesting and easy to follow. You get the story from your guide and npcs in speech bubbles, each giving some background / clue / objective all in one, well worded to keep you on track without reading paragraphs so you can play the game.

Gameplay:
Controlling the character is easy to grasp (not many controls). Would have liked more, like the ability to jump without a prompt to jump somewhere in the environment. You can meow with button which is a fun perk, but for tactical use its only used for one or two puzzles. 
Joystick and camera pivot work really well, camera sensitivity can be adjusted. One nitpick I have is you can’t change the POV distance - coming from a 3rd person MMO I found myself impulsively trying to scroll out. Also, when I used the 1st person look button it didn't always focus on what I was trying to zoom in on. But by default, the POV works well for the gameplay.
A minimap (or any map) would have been really useful. I confess to being bad at navigation and found myself running in circles or down the same streets over again trying to remember where I was trying to get to. 
I love that you can interact by pushing objects in the environment, I got into trying to smash every plant pot hoping there might be an achievement (either I didn't smash enough or there isn’t one). Again, there isn’t really an interact action when not prompted - it would be fun to be able to pick up or paw random objects.
The graphics and projected textures are really good. The world seems full of clues and remnants of what happened, drawing the player deeper into the story and wanting to find out more. The gradient and atmosphere are designed so thoughtfully that you get a sense of either tension, calm or imminent danger just from the tone, subtle colour and light change, as well as the backing sound. 
The audio also is really well thought out, not too loud and overbearing, and suiting the various moods perfectly throughout the game.
Combat: There isn't a lot of this. Much of the game is based around the story and fleeing or dodging danger. You do get one weapon in the game, but this is short lived and seems hardly worth to effort your little cat went through to acquire. And when you get it, it has a limit to how long you can use it until it overheats. Then it breaks for good. Once gotten, I thought “this would of been real useful back there” followed by “I could really use that right now!”.
This game would benefit from having more combat, more puzzle solving levels in general, and more means of self defense - whether that be a more permanent weapon or cat physics (bite and claw). Majority of the time it spent feeling pretty helpless before your foes. 

Verdict:
I absolutely loved playing this game. It’s beautifully designed and well-thought out for the player. The story is easy and really engaging to follow. There’s scope to explore and stray from the main path, however the game would benefit from more secrets and easter eggs, side-quests and hidden achievements. All in all it’s a really good quality game, for me it took roughly 10-12 hours to finish (I’m not a speed gamer and like to explore). Where it’s lacking is not in quality, but in quantity, which isn’t the worst thing a game can offer! What you get to play is a fun, casual, engaging game where you play as a cat on a mission. Highly recommend this to anyone thinking of playing it.

It's a nice little adventure if you want a relatively quick and wholesome experience, but I think there's also a lot of wasted potential if it comes to being a cat. They are extremely agile and mobile, unfortunately the game does not reflect that much. I know it's more of a casual experience, but I would be happier if they introduced more nuanced parkour, and faster/more advanced movement. The current controls feel a bit janky, unfortunately.

I honestly played the game and said out loud ""Thank god, finally a game that doesn't spew random stupid collectibles to find across the area. How refreshing."" Only to then find the Memory system shortly after... which worked well, but annoyed me cause I really didn't want to have to collect anything. I guess it adds replay-ability, but meh... the game is too linear to really want to play it again (this is alleviated a bit with chapter select). However, the ending felt... rushed. Like there was supposed to be something else; hopefully there is an additional change to the ending if you have all the memories.

"10/10!!! Whether you like cats or not, I would STRONGLY recommend you to get this game ASAP.
I haven't felt like this while playing a game for a long time. If I would compare my feelings to anything, it is similar to playing ""The Portal"" for the first time, but still quite different. 

Stray is quite relaxing game, but you need to use your brain a little bit while you play it, but not too much to get discouraged. It does absolutely incredible job with giving you the opportunity to feel like a little outsider in an unknown world in the future. There is ton of joy to be had from discovering new area around every corner, from uncovering the story and from all the fun interactions you can have. 

In my eyes Stray does perfect job with everything you can think of:
- Gorgeous graphics with amazing atmosphere
- Perfect optimization (runs great on weak CPU and RTX 3090)
- Masterful level design (lot of horizontal and also vertical exploration)
- Perfect controls and gameplay - I was very surprised how easy the developers made to controls of the cat and how beautifully animated and fluent everything is.
- Fun and interesting pace of the story and occasional puzzles

"[h1]Die 999 times[/h1]

I'm an explorer-type player. I like to immerse myself in a game's atmosphere and feel like part of the story. And I love cats!

Reading Stray's reviews, I thought it would be the perfect game for me. Described as a short, immersive adventure with beautifully detailed graphics and simple gameplay, it seemed like the ideal way to relax and unwind.

Nothing could have been more misleading.

The game starts as promised—you roam a dystopian world as a cat, jumping, scratching, knocking things over, and it's beautiful. That is, until you encounter your first real challenge: the Zurk chase in the second chapter. It's simply [b]unplayable and extremely frustrating[/b]. After dozens of attempts and dying every 20 seconds, I gave up. I read several guides, but nothing helped. And without completing this section, you can't progress any further in the game.

the small details and easter eggs- i enjoy collecting the music sheets and the little things that you can find in the game and have some small moments or relaxation and peace with the guitarist, it definitely goes along way. 
the game play, as the cover shows you're a cat- like an actual cat, you are one in the game every step and its such a unique refresher to have. you can jump on just about anything and knock stuff over, its so fun and never gets old.

"There’s something about Stray that hits differently. It’s not just a game. It’s an experience. You step into the paws of a small, lost cat, wandering through a city that simultaneously feels alive and wholly abandoned. It’s eerie yet beautiful. Quiet yet filled with stories waiting to be found.
At first, you’re just trying to find your way back home. But as you explore, you realise you’re not just a stray cat but part of something bigger. You meet robots who long for a world they never got to see, a little drone companion who becomes your only friend, and remnants of a past that feels distant but strangely familiar.
There were moments when I just stopped. I sat on rooftops, watching neon signs flicker in the distance. I curled up next to a lonely musician, letting the soft sound of their guitar fill the air. I knocked over bottles and scratched at rugs because why not? Every detail made the world feel real, like I was there.
But what surprised me the most was how human this story felt. Even without words, Stray tells a tale of loss, companionship, and hope. It reminded me there’s always a reason to keep going, even in the loneliest places.
And then the credits rolled. And I just sat there, not ready to leave, not ready to say goodbye. Because sometimes, a game isn’t just pixels and mechanics; it’s a feeling, a memory, a story that becomes part of you.
And Stray? I’ll carry it with me for a long, long time.",True,0,0,2025-02-01 00:07:45

I used to think my cat was just a cute, clueless ball of fur. Then I played Stray. Now I sleep with one eye open, fearing the day he hacks my Wi-Fi and leads a robot uprising. This game turns you into a tiny feline parkour master in a cyberpunk world, solving puzzles, outsmarting machines, and knocking over perfectly placed bottles—just because you can. It’s gorgeous, emotional, and a little too convincing.

Verdict: 10/10, my cat is plotting something, and I’m scared. 🐱🤖",True,1,0,2025-02-01 06:08:12
"Stray is a game that captured my attention from start to finish, offering a unique and heartfelt experience that stands out in the gaming landscape. Without diving into spoilers, I can say the story is one of the game’s strongest elements. It’s thoughtfully crafted, drawing you in with its emotional beats and leaving you pondering long after the credits roll. The environments are equally captivating, with every corner of the neon-lit city brimming with detail and atmosphere. It’s a world that feels alive, even in its decay, and I loved every moment spent exploring it.

Playing as a cat in Stray is an experience that feels both refreshing and endearing. The design of the cat itself is fantastic, and while some animations felt a little off at times, it didn’t take away from the gameplay. In fact, these quirks occasionally made me laugh, adding charm to the experience. One feature I absolutely loved was the ability to meow freely—even during cutscenes! It’s such a small detail, but it added so much personality and lighthearted fun to the game.

The gameplay is another highlight, especially the “parkour”-style movement system. As a cat, you can leap to countless places, climb rooftops, and traverse areas in ways that feel uniquely feline. However, I did find it a bit restrictive that you couldn’t jump freely unless there was a designated surface to jump to. A regular jump mechanic, like in many other games, would have added an extra layer of freedom to the experience. That said, it’s a small minus in an otherwise fluid and enjoyable system.

The interactions with the game’s other characters were another element I appreciated. Every character you encounter feels meaningful, with their own purpose and personality. While the protagonist doesn’t speak, the depth given to the friendly characters really stands out, adding emotional weight and connection to the story.

The puzzles struck a great balance for me. They were challenging enough to make me think but not so hard that they became frustrating. The variety of difficulty—from easier puzzles to trickier ones—kept the game engaging throughout, especially if, like me, you enjoy completing 100% of a game.


Overall, Stray was an enjoyable journey that left me wanting more. I couldn’t help but wish for a longer game or even major side stories separate from the main plot—something with its own depth and challenges to expand on this beautifully built world. That said, the game excels at what it sets out to do: delivering a memorable, heartfelt experience in a way that only a cat’s perspective could.",True,1,0,2025-01-28 09:02:36

- You play as a cat - a somewhat unique and interesting concept

- Interaction / Immersion: you can drink water a few times, but it would have been nice to need to drink and eat (scavenge) about...

"[h1] A Small Yet Unforgettable Adventure – Stray is a Masterpiece! [/h1]

[b] ⭐Rating:10/10⭐ [/b]

[i]Stray is an experience that goes far beyond simply ""playing as a cat."" It is an emotional, artistic, and engaging journey that leaves a lasting mark on anyone who plays it.[/i]

[h3] Graphics and Atmosphere [/h3]
Visually, Stray is breathtaking. The developers at BlueTwelve Studio have created a decayed yet fascinating cyberpunk world, where neon lights blend with dark alleys and abandoned streets. Every corner of the city tells a story, and the attention to detail is impressive—from the way the cat moves and grooms itself to the reactions of robotic NPCs to its interactions.

[h3] Immersive Gameplay [/h3]
The gameplay experience is incredibly smooth and realistic. The feline protagonist’s movements are strikingly authentic: jumping between platforms, rubbing against robots, scratching carpets, and meowing at will are all elements that make the immersion total. The balance between exploration, environmental puzzles, and stealth sections creates the perfect mix of relaxation and tension.

[h3] Story and Narrative [/h3]
Despite the protagonist being a cat and unable to speak, Stray manages to tell a deep and emotional story. The bond with B-12, the small drone accompanying the player, develops naturally and touchingly. The mystery behind the city and its inhabitants gradually unfolds, allowing for moments that are both sweet and melancholic.

[h3]Soundtrack and Sound Design[/h3]
The soundtrack is perfect for the game’s atmosphere—delicate, engaging electronic melodies accompany the exploration, enhancing the most emotional moments. The sound design is also exceptional, with realistic effects that bring the world and protagonist to life: the sound of paws on different surfaces, the meows, and even the purring all contribute to making everything feel even more authentic.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Stray is more than just a game; it is an artistic and narrative experience that deserves to be played. Perfect for cat lovers, but also for anyone looking for a unique, touching, and visually stunning adventure.

"I just finished my second playthrough of Stray, and I’m already itching to dive back in. This game is an absolute gem—a beautifully crafted experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. From the moment I stepped into the paws of that adorable, curious cat, I was completely immersed in a world that felt so alive, so loved.
The visuals are breathtaking. Every neon-lit alley, every sun-drenched rooftop, and every shadowy corner of the cybercity is a work of art. The attention to detail is staggering, and it’s clear that the developers poured their hearts into creating this world. It’s not just a game; it’s a vibe.
And the story? Oh, the story! It’s heartfelt, mysterious, and deeply emotional. The characters—both human and robotic—are so well-written and memorable. I found myself genuinely caring about their fates, and the connections you build along the way are incredibly touching. The narrative is perfectly paced, with just the right balance of exploration, puzzle-solving, and emotional beats.
What really sets Stray apart is how it makes you feel. It’s not just about being a cat in a futuristic world; it’s about curiosity, resilience, and the bonds we form. It’s a game that makes you stop and appreciate the little things—whether it’s knocking over paint cans, curling up for a nap, or just meowing at the right moment to make someone smile.
I truly hope the developers create another game because I would be first in line to play it. Stray is a rare masterpiece—a game that’s not only fun to play but also leaves a lasting impression. If you haven’t experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in. And if you’ve already played it, well… it’s always a good time to revisit this stunning world.
10/10, would meow again.",True,1,0,2025-02-13 00:28:26
"Nah, because I can't be finishing a game in one sitting lmao!

That aside though, this game is really great! It's a bit of a quick game but considering the price you pay for it, I'd say it's worth it. Maybe try and get it during a sale to save even more!

One thing I would say though is if you're like me and you get upset seeing cats or animals in general get hurt, there is a setting in the game where you can turn off the animation of the kitty collapsing. Or just be a really good gamer and not get caught by enemies at all!

Also sometimes, the camera gets a bit weird especially in certain areas in the game which could be a bit annoying but not game breaking for sure.

Replaying it to get 100% achievements asap! 

All in all, a very good game! 8.5/10 for me!",True,1,0,2025-02-13 00:08:59

"Stray! My boy! 

Dag, this game is good. I bought a fancy laptop with the beastly graphics card. I plugged it into my 4k OLED TV and Stray let me simultaneous know the following things: My laptop is sweet. Stray is sweet. My TV is sweet. I am sweet for coalescing these things. 

The gameplay is not deep. I knew that going in and so should you. It’s not possible to die and lose. All challenges can be retried until you complete them.  The plot moves itself along, you don’t really make choices. I’m good with all of that when it comes to Stray. 

The mechanic and visuals of Stray jumping around and catwalking everything is satisfying. You won’t ever misjudge a jump and miss. You will never attempt to traverse a long pipe and fall off. Stray’s animations as he traverses the dystopian hellscape are very catlike and dynamic. 

Artistically I love the game. Lighting effects, level and character design, writing, vibe, believeabilty - it not only checks those boxes but ticks them too. 

Stray is definitely a cat and solves things in the manner a cat would. I love the idea that he’s walking up to random robots and showing them a photo to see what they’ll say. Strapping a robot onto his back certainly helps him get things done. Great idea and execution. 

Music is whimsical, visionary, and dark. 

Magnificent experience! Somewhat shallow gameplay doesn’t hurt this game at all. Honestly many games with “deep” mechanics are often just busywork and fetch quests anyways. In stray I was always eager to see what’s next and never was bored. The top tier audiovisual presentation is what made this game nearly perfect.",True,1,0,2025-02-11 17:25:04

"A game about a cat lost in a cyberpunk city of the future, where humans have been exctinct for many years and therefore populated just by sentient robots? Sign me in, I love cats and the premise is also quite interesting!

Stray is a simple, linear game that will not ask you more than 10-12 hours to tell you its story, and if you want, all its secrets. The gameplay is centered around the exploration of different biomes, while you try to find a way out of the city and back to your pack. There are some basic puzzles and some chase sequences, but nothing that will stop you for more than some minutes. I particularly loved how incredibly detailed and well built the locations are, with a nice atmosphere and inspired music. It is a pleasure to explore every nook and cranny and being a curious and, sometimes, naughty cat.

I enjoyed my time with Stray, I think it is a well paced and relaxing narrative game, played from the original point of view of a cat, which opens up to different and novel ways to traverse the game world. The ending was a bit abrupt and not what I was hoping for, but apart from that, I would rate Stray a solid 8/10! Recommended!",True,2,0,2025-01-28 12:31:41
