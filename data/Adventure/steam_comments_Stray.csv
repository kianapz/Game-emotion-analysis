Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"if you discover this game presuming it's all about exploring a mesmerizing open world as a meowing, purring, ginger cat that can vertically climb and scratch surfaces, like it's some sort of simple cat simulator game, then i'm afraid to tell you that it's far from the truth! b stray is so much more.b stray also features equally as much gross areas to explore, areas infested with enemies which will require you to be stealthy, and ultimately a compelling story! all those beautiful screenshots you'll encounter of stray online are generally from the very beginning, the very end and most commonly, from an area near the end of the game called midtown! they're just snippets of 3 chapters part of a larger 12 chapter game! this raises the question of what exactly iisi stray then. let me explain. h1 about stray h1 stray is a gripping, short adventure game where you'll be playing in third person as an unnamed, stray, ginger cat who becomes separated from their cluster as a result of falling from a loosened pipe, deep down to an unfamiliar world. in this new world, roam different types of robots. you'll first meet bcompanion robotsb, which are highlyintelligent, bipedal robots with different personalities and their own respected language. they are notably slow and weak at defending themselves from predators such as bzurksb which are enemies you'll often encounter and have to evade throughout the game. because of their limitations, companion robots have confined themselves to a small safe zone in which imosti of them refuse to leave. within the safe zone are a few boutsiderb companion robots who wish to reach where the cat came from  which is the surface, but the companions refer to it as the ioutside i. however, all but one outsider companion robot is inside of the safe zone when you initially arrive to the safe zone so you must track the rest of the outsiders down and follow their leads to possibly get back to the outside. will the ginger cat survive and make it back to the surface and reunite with their cluster? play to find out! h1 my review of stray h1 i have to say, this game exceeded my expectations. for starters, i wasn't expecting chases and having to hide from enemies. in fact, i blindly got into this game expecting no enemies at all. so, these elements really caught me offguard but in the end i had fun getting past the zurks and sentinels, it made the gameplay experience all more thrilling and intense, fueling my eager desire to get back to the surface. in the about section, i just scratched the surface of the plot  what i shared was just the tip of the iceberg. the plot is what really intrigued and left a profound impression on me other than the outstanding visuals of this game. it's such a deep rabbit hole that i didn't see coming. the plot really deserves as much as credit as the graphics. learning that  the entire map was spoiler a closed cylindrical space called walled city 99 spoiler,  humans spoiler died out from a plague breakout and that the last humans lived within this confined space along with the companions spoiler,  there is a spoilersort of caste system in which inhabitants live in an elevated level with respect to their hierarchy spoiler,  spoiler some of the last remaining humans became companions or entered themselves into the networkspoiler,  spoiler b12 was initially the scientist's assistant and then the consciousness of the scientist spoiler, were details that all shook me. i was not expecting such a rich story. if you're as fascinated by the story as i am, then i encourage you to collect all of b12's memories or to alternatively learn more about the plot from the urlhttpsstray.fandom.comwikitimelinestray wiki. url and of course, i can't finish this section without mentioning the graphics, the visuals  the things that truly carry this game. the game is full of many areas with colorful lighting  which is very admirable, but if i have to be honest, while the game has an abundance of orange, red, blue and other colored lights, there aren't many areas containing beautiful scenery  the perfect places to use as background footage for your screenshots. i was a bit disappointed in this aspect. as a result of this, my number one destination for photography was naturally the midtown. so, i wish there were more beautiful areas on the map to explore. nonetheless, the overall aesthetic of the game is stunning, even if all areas can't be used for pictureperfect moments. h1 my pain point about stray h1 there's only one thing that i'm dissatisfied about stray which is how we aren't able to go into first person. the feature to zoom in your camera felt really pointless to me because part of the cat's body would appear in the shot and kind of ruin it so i don't think i took any shots by zooming in. if we were able to enter first person, i would've taken so much more screenshots and would have put the zooming in feature into use. so, the ability to enter first person should really be introduced. h1 overall rating 910 h1"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-13,"a great game to play in the face of societal collapse. sometimes very sad, but somehow very optimistic, too."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-15,"if you enjoy immersive worlds, exploration, problem solving, a little scifi dystopia, and cats, then this is everything you could want. stray is a touching story wrapped in a beautiful world experienced though a novel character. take it from another feline, this is an excellent game for fellow feline aficionados out there."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-09,wandering through a desolate city with an orange furball and a tiny drone felt more personal and memorable than my entire high school and college years combined. a beautiful game with a dreamy atmosphere and tiny hits of melancholia. no regrets.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-23,easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time simply for its relaxing features. being able to just hop on and run around solving things as you go. the story feels alot like nier automata to me. its mind twisting storytelling without having a direct storyline. it tells its story through the environment and some npc encounters. but mostly through its environments. its beautiful and the end of the game will have you wishing it had another 40 hours in it. i recommend this game for absolutely anyone to try and i encourage you to get it. and i dont do that often!
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"this game is absolutely gorgeous! it's just long enough to keep you excited and not get bored. all locations are filled with details and climbable objects, so there is a lot of vertical space, which for some reason brought mirror's edge to mind. i scoured every area on my first playthrough but still could not find all the hidden locations, so on my second playthrough i found everything and was pleasantly surprised how well hidden some of them are. i enjoyed the music to the point where i shazamed some of the tracks, especially the ones with beats that i found myself vibing to while playing. as for the story, the premise feels fresh, and i can't recall watching a movie or reading a book about anything of the sort. overall, it's a pretty much perfect game all around. and welloptimized, too!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"great game, great story, great cats and great graphics would recommend!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"cute game, but not a fan. i felt the free roam sections dragged a lot with nothing interesting to hold my attention."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"a very chill and relaxing game. it's a linear, platform, puzzle solving game with a great story. its the type of game you can play after beating a soulslike game"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"i really enjoyed it. got hooked by the story, that game succeed to create a very special ambiance that touched me. not a difficult game, neither it is very long. i spent about 21 hours. one can probably finish it faster, but i played part of it with my son. but it's pleasant and relaxing. i dunno how to describe. it is quite a unique game. looks amazing on a oled screen even though it doesn't have an hdr mode. runs like a charm on archlinux. i highly recommend it"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"i don't really write review about games, but this one deserves it. played through it and had so much fun. for those wanting to experience how to be a cat, this game is for you. p.s. orange car be drifting when you sprint. lol"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,"amazing atmosphere, world building and attention to detail. by the end, i really didn't want the game to end. first play through took me around 3.5 hours and the length is it's only real downside for me. loved it so much, i needed to 100 it."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-25,to really get everything out of this game i'd suggest doing all the side content. a lot of the deeper parts of the story are there. its really good. also something you can buy for your kidssisters kids and not be worried about anything. fun puzzles and exploration. really a highlight if you're into story driven games.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-21,"h3 what a game! one of the most visually pleasant game that i have played. h3 it's so pretty that, i spent most of my time finding good spots for screenshot and it essentially become a walking simulator to me. check out my screenshots  story is straightforward, nothing special but wellexecuted, it progresses chapter by chapter as you are doing the missions. the theme also changes by chapter so i feel like getting into another film set for screenshots. i want to praise the movement mechanics being welldesigned and pleasant to play with, swift and agile, it might not be fully accurate described but you do feel like a cat. instead of having only fixed spots which will actually progress your game, the amount of spots that you can jump on is also more than expected. puzzles are reasonable, adding some interactions for gameplay. most of them are based on hints where you have to explore without much guidance, spoiler i got really lost in that part where you have to distract the shopkeeper in order to take the worker vest and helmet, ended up having to look up guide. spoiler, but i think it's cleverly designed to force players to actively explore the area. details are magnificent and need no my further elaboration. i deliberately played with controller and i do think it gives better experience than kb and mouse. you got to lay back and sprint and jump with your joystick which makes the whole gameplay smoother. same with camera movement where you can move in a more constant speed hence giving it a cinematic feeling. however, i'm getting slight motionsickness which i don't get too often, but i managed to get through til the end. recommend! turn yourself into a cat and save the world!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-03,"what a sleeper of a game!!!! outstanding. incredibly well done, relaxing yet just enough difficulty to keep you immersed. very great story, unraveling of a multiple centuries old mystery of a derelict indoor city. real senses of waste, loss, and hopelessness come across as you explore certain parts of the map.... the city is manned only by quirky and somewhatunaware relic bots in some cases who's creators failed them. i presume they reflect their makers in a subtle way and definitely seem to feel left behind. really great art and not to many cut scenes but just enough. simple puzzles and a few less obvious ones here and there. by far the best short adventure game i've ever had the pleasure of playing."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-16,"overall, 4.235.00 stars. such a unique, exploration game that is a true hidden gem. i absolutely loved every key aspect to this game from the colors, symbols, characters, enemies, interface, plot, story, etc. my favorite part of the game is all of the small features that relate to cats and how they interact with the world. i recommend this game to any person who loves singleplayer, openworld games. as for my trophy hunters out there, this game some difficult trophies, but they can be obtained in about 810 hours of gameplay. my only real concern is the subpar ending, in which i felt empty and sad. no answers, no visuals to my imagination of what the outside looks like, just a short cliffhangerlike cutscene. be warned the game starts sad and ends sad. issues there is an issue that has been unsolved for years where when you break down one of the paintings in momo's house, it will glitch you outside the map. there is also a glitch where one of the memories in the sewers chapter is unobtainable if your fps is uncapped. it essentially won't let you walk pass an invisible barrier inside of the tubetunnel. the achievement can't catch me is by far the most difficult and many players will struggle with its' rng like outcome. fix set your frames to 60 fps or lower to fix the wall glitch and the sewers glitch. to maximize the ease of getting the achievement, simply lower your frames to 30 fps and zigzag your way through the zurks. there are a couple youtube videos on common glitches inside of the game"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-07,great game. i have been playing it on my steam deck and it's quite a bit of fun. just going around meowing and pushing paint cans.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"it's hard to find a negative thing to say about this game. it's purrfect on the steam deck, especially for a day when you can't be bothered to get out of bed."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-09,"i really liked the idea and the concept, however to be honest it was quite boring and short. the game idea had a lot of potential but i can't really understand how this game has so many good reviews. after 8 hours i finished the game, and after 4 hours it already became repetitive. very linear, the story wasn't really good, movement was very restricted and the 'puzzles' weren't difficult. there was nothing the game did really well despite its good idea of being able to play as a cat and maybe the atmosphere."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-16,"this is one of the most unique, visually pleasing, and heartwarming games i've played in a long time. though it doesn't delve to deeply into lore or philosophy, it manages to tell a compelling story that asks surprisingly profound questions about the nature of identity, hope, and friendshipall while centering on a feline protagonist who can't communicate except by meowing and clawing things. it's made me reflect on my own friendships, including with my cats, who don't seem to understand what exactly made me so emotional when the game's credits rolled but were right there to comfort me anyway. i would recommend this game to just about anyone, not just people with a softspot for cats or an interest in scifi dystopias. it's a brilliant work of art that provides a meaningful experience, and it's well worth the cost despite its short length. even after just finishing it i'm eager to dive back in and find more sheet music for morusque to play on his jerry can guitar and to curl up among the cushions in clementine's loft for a little longer. it's these small moments that really make it special, the moments of rest and meditation that are an essential complement to the game's story elements and action sequences. as i finished the game i was reminded of a quote from john gray's book feline philosophy humans cannot become cats. yet if they set aside any notion of being superior beings, they may come to understand how cats can thrive without anxiously inquiring how to live. this game, which puts the player in control of a small feline amidst the ruins of a manmade world still rife with humanity's troubles even in the absence of human beings, offers an opportunity to seek the understanding gray suggests. there is a lot we can learn from cats that is easy for us to lose sight of, has hectic and stressful as human life can be. the quiet hours spent in relaxation, play, and curiosity are just as important as the time we spend working towards a paycheck or some other goal. can you imagine a cat on the grind? of course not. because cats understand innately that you don't need wealth or achievement to get what matters out of life. sometimes all you need is an inquisitive mind, a friend to play with, or just a soft pillow to curl up on for a nice, long nap."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-10,"fun to play, fun to explore in the chapters you can, but frustrating in parts where you have to clear an area several times to get to room after it that is hard. very appealing to cat lvoers as you get many opportunities to knock things off things, knock over things, and even nap! replayable in that you will want to get all the memories and badges you didn't know you missed until you read a walkthrough. played it so much i stated to know my way around the slums and midtown easy enough. i did have a soft spot for the cat as i had an orange cat."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-09,"great game, especially if you like cats. the gameplay is decent but some might find it a little slow. the atmosphere is beautiful and haunting while also having cute and endearing moments."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-09,"i didn't find the gameplay engaging or challenging enough, but the settings and animation are beautiful and the music is wonderful. if it seems like it appeals, definitely give it a try."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-09,"waited until i got my deck to buy this, it was the perfect wind down game before bed. characters are charming, setting is gritty yet enjoyable and the story is fantastic. gameplay is great on deck as are the visuals, the art style really shines. wish i could experience this for the first time again. what a wholesome and enjoyable game."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-08,"this starts out as a pretty reasonable adventure game, but quickly in part 2 the zerks have worn me out. ive watched several walkthroughs to help me, but no. there are no areas in settings to change it to easy mode so i can make it through this part. frustrating and no fun when youve tried 100 times to complete this part without success. im done......."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-08,"this is good game with some absolutely terrible camera controls. once you get the defulxor, if it overheats, your drone whacks out and your camera goes with. this makes certain rushed times during the game where you will die over and over and over and over again, just trying to focus the camera on the enemies. whoever was responsible for the camera programming, i hope they were transferred to a pointnclick game. also, the button controls are opposite for an xbox controller. i had to reassign the buttons to the one next to it, to match the prompts on the screen. now the story. graphics, music and atmosphere are wonderful! i do recommend this game, just watch out for the terrible camera controls and for your character to move and jump when you aren't even touching the controller. also, steam isnt showing numerous achievements that were gained throughout the game."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-08,"great graphics, cool world, nice characters, awesome music and most importantly, cat. 1010"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-08,i love this game's cyberpunk aesthetic and this is the most realistic cat that i've seen in my entire life!
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-06,"i adored this game, it gave me similar feelings as to when i played the nier games, i only wish it was a longer game as i completed the game and then all achievements within 2 days, absolutely brilliant game i was absolutely glued to it, very excited to see what else the studio releases"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-06,"cute game, wonderful design, nice story even though it's a bit sad and definitly too short. nevertheless it's a great story telling experience and you'll probably really like playing it"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-06,"fun game, story line is nice, the puzzles within the game are great too. overall for the type of game it is, it is wonderfully made."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-06,"it is just a comfortable and detailed game. the puzzles, zurks, and sentinels weren't too hard to deal with, which i love because i hate stressing."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,"in mad that b12 died but it is so fun and the story is good, i enjoyed it alot and idk buy it and play it cause its good also cats, 5 of them in the begining but only the short intro sadly wish he met up with them again but nono the game needs to have angst"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,"1010 if you want to play for a few hours and are not tired of playing, i 100 recommend this game. thank you for this short, beautiful and comfortable game. and thank you for my broken heart in the finale."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,this game was really fun. the art is beautiful. i explored a decent amount throughout the game and got around 6.5 hrs of play time. overall i recommend this to anyone that likes adventure with a good plot.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,"it s insanely good , i love the realistic movements of the cat and the graphics , stunning game"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,"wish there were a few more ways to interact with the world than just scratching and pushing things, but i think this is a really nice little journey! its relatively short, but that helps it to feel relatively fresh rather than overstaying its welcome the world of stray is visually beautiful, and its really fun getting to explore as a cat  didn't realise how much different it would feel playing a less traditional character type, but it creates a new way of engaging with and exploring the world which was pretty refreshing!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-05,"you play as a cat, simple as that. good graphics, interesting story and good puzzles."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-04,stray is a fantastic game with a surprisingly great story and beautiful graphics. if i had to say one thing bad about the game it would definitely be the length. i may go back through the chapters to collect some more achievements but i just wish the story would continue a bit longer. still an exceptional game nonetheless 910
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-04,"man, what a game stray is, i enjoyed it so much. if you like scifi books or just want to experience great story, just play it"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-04,"absolutely love this game! dived back in after playing it when it got released years ago and i still felt all the feels. the way the game makes you care so deeply about the cat and b12, incredible. love the easy game play and how it has you hooked till the very end. watch me replay this every few years!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-04,"this is a very fun game, short and sweet. the sense of scale is fun and intriguing as you're playing as the cat, and platforming is simple, yet satisfying. the game has a good sense of pacing and none of the areas dragged on for too long for felt too short. the graphics are very pretty, and help immerse yourself into the world even more, and the sound design is flawless and so so so perfect. my only gripe with this game is that most of the story is told through dialogue versus showing the player what's happening through visual clues like the game inside, but that is more of a personal preference."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-04,"a compact but beautifully told storyline paired with awesome gameplay makes stray my standout favorite game that i've wanted to play for a long time. the artwork is impeccable, the worldbuilding very well done, and it's amazing how in a game that you can easily finish in 25 hours of play, the studio achieves to create a bond between not only the player and his furry feline character, but also with a delightful little companion robot. play this game. let your friends play this game. it's fantastic. can't wait for any dlc's, sequels or similar game from this talented indie studio. what a joyful thing."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-03,"i love the game, it very fun to play and hard to put once you start. if you are a fan of cat and simpel gameplay it the game for you. i like the way it look and the the way you move around and the small cat like things you can do and ofc the miavvvs."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-03,"this is more of a walking simulatorvisual novel with mario partyesq minigames, rather than an actual game that you might have been led to believe it was i was under the impression it was a platformer. the story isn't anything unique or ground breaking, it's very familiar to scifi, but it was pretty entertaining for as a short as it was. i recommend if you can get it for 50 off or better and you enjoy walking simulators. i paid 18 and am on the fence about whether the content and experience was worth it."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"i love this game so much  before i bought it i knew i got to travel city scapes as a cat and that was enough for me, but this game's storytelling is so unbelievably beautiful it's an absolute gem. my only downside to this is playing on mac i have to be very careful about programs open besides steam for more than a few minutes otherwise my laptop starts get very very hot and the graphics really lag, but it's so so worth it"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,best game so far was a bit confused but really good game so far 1010
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"so good, couldn't stop playing until i finished it. great gameplay, story line, game design, music, everything was just top. highly recommend. i really missed playing such games, enjoyed it throughout. thanks to those who made this."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"this game was truly amazing. well polished, nice story, good interactions, very immersive. 1010"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"great game, great atmosphere. relaxing and different than the usual hack  shoot."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,this is what you are looking for if you basically want to be a car with a bunch of cute puzzles and adorable environment. i would have wanted it to be longer though.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"this is a utterly fantastic game, i picked it up on sale but i believe it is worth full price. the style is amazing, the game play is fun, and the characters are interesting. the only complaint i can think of is i really wish the ending spoiler wasn't openended. spoiler otherwise great game, i hope someday there is a sequel but if not this stands on its own."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,its a beautiful story that is the simplest way to put it.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"this game has so much potential but i have a hard time beleving that anything new will be added. the game is very well made and is exciting, cozy, fun and had a very good story, but the only downside is that the game is so short. when you get to the end, its over. if you miss something along the way, you cant go back. you have to replay the whole game. i dont think the game is worth the money at all, buy it when its on sale!! or if you have extra money to spend."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"stray is an incredible experienceit's a perfect blend of immersive worldbuilding, stunning graphics, and a compelling story. the atmosphere is captivating, with every detail pulling you deeper into the world. the feline protagonist adds a unique twist to the gameplay, offering a fresh perspective that sets it apart from many other titles. while navigating the world can be challenging at times, it's all part of the fun, and once you get the hang of it, the places become second nature. if you take your time to explore, the game can be completed in around 56 hours, making it a short yet unforgettable adventure. overall, its a 1010 game that leaves a lasting impression with its emotional depth and beautiful design."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,fantastic aptmospheric storytelling with the perfect blend of free roam and being a linear storyline with tasteful easter eggs and a satisfying ending.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,such a great game that doesn't take too long to get through. the graphics and story line were really good. the game also got me right in the feels too.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,what a storyline. gameplay is unique. truly a masterpiece.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"finally, a studio that knows you can make an amazing game that's not 80 hours long with convoluted lore and crammed with mechanics that requires hours of tutorial. this is a phenomenal 7 hour game with simple controls, easy to follow story and lush jawdropping dystopiancyberpunk environments. if you want an extremely high quality casual game, you can't miss this. whatever it's selling for right now on steam, it's worth it."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"amazing soundtrack, an engaging story, and tons of interesting things to discover. even though the playable areas are small they feel huge with all the things there are to explore. will definitely be replaying this."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,good game but have not played it a good min. still a good game to play at night.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"very fun and cool walking around as a cat in a robot world, i enjoyed the 100 very much but it was a little repetitive and boring sometimes 910"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"this is a deeply lovely game that has really stuck with me after finishing it, like a fantastic movie or novel that has made your life richer for the time you've spent with it. a relatively quick playthrough  you'll spend most of your time exploring, with some highadrenaline chase sequences built in. the care with which both the cat and the world it lives in are rendered are exceptional. storytelling and worldbuilding are words that get thrown around a lot in describing games, but this is the real deal."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"the perfect game for cat lovers who also like scifi. and of course the cat is orange, because what other breed would try to free a whole entire city on its own? but seriously, the detail in this game is astounding and i haven't even gotten all of the achievements yet though the ones i do have are very cleverly named. you find something new every time you replay a chapter. it's a game that encourages you to explore, even if it's not exactly what one would call open world. well worth the money spent."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-02,"cute cat game, no humans so that's good and it really emphasizes the idea of robots taking over the world. i like that you can meow on command, even in cutscenes. i love that you can use the purple laser weapon to vaporize the sentient beans."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,what can i say just was fairly solid game where you play as a cat. it is a fairly short game but i have not played much like it. give it a try.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"great game, the sound track is awesome. the story is really good and well made despite the game being 4ish hours. 1010"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,insanely good game. really nice story
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,relaxing game with very simple puzzles and nice visuals. the story is a bit cheesy but thats okay for a 5hr long game about a cat making its way to the outside again. i encountered one bug where i got teleported back after i jumped on a balcony right at the beginning but reloading my last checkpoint fixed that and i haven't encountered any other bugs. would recommend getting this game on sale and have a few hours of some catventures.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,great game! really fun to get all the achievements too. 810
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"the concept of the game is very interesting, a cat for the main character is pretty cool, and obviously cats are really agile so the movement is cool too. honestly i just love this genre of more chill story based games, and shorter stories, because its something that you will remember for many years and even replay it from time to time, unlike longer games with less memorable stories. overall great game, recommended."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"good game but omg if its going to be that easy to die at least make the loading screen go faster, no more lives was the easiest achievement ive ever completed."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,a really well made indie game. great story with visually impressive world.
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"this game has very stunning graphics. the neon lights give me cyberpunk vibes, which i personally love it, basically the environment in almost every area. well, except for disgusting tunnels of course, which it is meant to be that way. i would probably recommend this, it was a great experience with a sad story, the cat meeting up with new people, first it was a robot which was once human, and then clementine. they kinda bonded along their journey of escaping the underworld to see the outside, which i think only the cat got to see. however, others still get to see the light for the first time in a while. the saddest part is the little robot sacrificing for the cat to leave to get to the outside. anyways, very good experience, though i feel like i wanted to see more of the outside, it could've been longer!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"i can't be surprised that a game involving cyperpunk and solarpunk well as cats would be completely in my ballpark, but in addition to this the environmental storytelling was absolutely on another level, the graphic design and miniquests were captivating and compelling to solve because the character interactions that would follow were absolutely to die for. i wish i could play again for the first time, and even more so wish that i had the attention span to go back and get all the achievements. maybe one day, when i'm present enough and have the time to. i did be getting all those memories though hehe. worth the shiny vest"
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"a really good enviromental and puzzlesolving game, and the best part is you're a cat that does cat things. but if you have issues with paranoia and anxiety for even the smallest eerie details, scenery and creatures, then try to step away. i say this because although i enjoyed it, i don't do well with that stuff so i had to back out. but if you are the opposite then it is an overall a good game you should definitely give a try if it is something you look forward to."
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-01,"great game mechanics, beautiful visuals, good story, and most importantly kitty."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"best experience of gaming thanks to the amazing story, great graphics and details in the game. i really enjoyed running through an open world as a cat unique journey"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"i wasn't able to play this game until 2025, but this is one of the best games i have played and i'm halflife old. it's not a very difficult game and it's not very long. but the ride is unforgettable. the environments are great. compared to some newer shooter games made for modern audiences, this game it a welcome change. a beautifull singleplayer experience that you shouldn't miss."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,beautiful and unique game! hope there's a sequel being produced because i need more. only negative is that it's too short!
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,a purrfect and cozy game! the characters are adorable and the story is well put together very tearjerking highly recommend if you ever want to live out the fantasy of being a cat with a lil robot companion
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"i enjoyed the exploration aspect and the search for puzzles to complete. it wasn't particularly difficult, but some things are definitely a bit obscure."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,good game but bad ending. didn't leave a bittersweet taste but bitter only. it felt like they ran out of budget by the end of it so things had to be rushed to finish.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"what a pleasant experience, i absolutely loved this game. on the short side but man did this game just burst with character. cat lovers especially would just fall in love with this one and the way the developers included the cat mannerisms with the puzzle solving and game play was very enjoyable. 8.510"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,gameplay and story was ok. great visuals and atmosphere though. a little bit overhyped.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-28,"might be biased because i have a cat, but this is a must have. kitty is so cute, the story is great, all around a goty."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"beautiful game, story wise and graphic wise. overal def a game to recommend it has some parkour platform puzzle's and dodging. you'l get about 6 six hour's of gameplay but its such a beautiful game you can replay it again and again and if yah go for achievements its endless. a truly heartfelt game"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"stray is a beautiful game, interesing plot, its not boring considering all dialogue are read only. catagonists is sooo cute . i have only one problem with this game price and short gameplay. i finished the game without rushing in about 6hours, the price is too high for such a short game. or maybe i am such a miser..."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"this is one of my most favourite gaming experiences. the way in which you discover the story and the characters along the way is a real treat. the puzzle sequences while never being truly frustratingly difficult still give you a good feeling of accomplishment. while i won't give anything away, the story must be experienced. it's not overly long, my first play through clocked in at 7.5 hours. if you like cyberpunk and love cats this game is for you. 1010 would cuddle cyber woolly bully again. also if you pick it up on a sale like march 3rd 2025 midweek deal 40 it's a really great value for the money."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-27,"everything about stray is great. it is the perfect game for the days that i just needed something chill to play. the atmosphere, environments and sound design all were fantastic, drawing me further into the game. definitely a game i will revisit, as every corner of the explorable world contains so much detail and depth. one of the best games i have played in a while."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,"the best game ever. the story, the atmosphere, the cat  everything is absolutely perfect."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,"ive grown really tired of the excessive push for hyperrealism in games. it feels like companies are so focused on competing for the most realistic graphics that theyve started forgetting what games are truly about. these days, most games revolve around humanskilling, competing, and other meaningless things. h1 orange car simulator h1 thats why stray was such a breath of fresh air. it fills your mind with curiosity, pulling you into a beautifully creative world with a short yet mysterious story. it was one of the best experiences ive had. i genuinely enjoyed thinking like an orange cat, solving mysteries, and uncovering lost memories. the world was mesmerizing, drawing me in to explore and admire every detail. but it felt like it needed just a bit more atmosphere. im not saying it wasnt fantasticit wasbut i couldnt shake the feeling that it was missing something to make it truly complete."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,this game was fantastic from the graphics to the gameplay and the story especially the ending where i cried
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,absolutely loved this game. the puzzles were purrrfectly set and made a bunch of sense. loved seeing the responses to the meows and the leg rubs. the story was pretty good and it was engaging for the most part. the ending though...
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,"amazing game, cool story, love the style, very atmospheric. so much fun just climbing around as a cat, solving puzzles. only downside is that it's too short! and it would've been sick if the cat could attack the zurksdrones with their claw. need a pt. 2 !!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-26,this is one of the best games i've played in a long time and its also a tear jerker as well i absolutely loved the game.
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-25,"great game. storyrich and the graphics are so gorgeous, i spent time just wandering the maps taking them in. i wish this was a bit more openworld with different ways to handle situations. for example, it would have been cool to be able to take a stealthy rooftop route to avoid danger. as it is, you really have to do the mission in the way intended. still a great game and i hope they come out with a sequel!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-25,"what an incredible experience this storybased adventure puzzle game was. i laughed, i cried, i smiled, and at times, i even raged a bit. in stray, you play as a cat who gets separated from his other cat friends with an end goal of making it back to the outside. you will wander through a dilapidated dystopian society, making friends with the inhabitants and even helping them out along the way. as you walk through the neighborhoods, city, and zurk zones, you will learn about how society got this way, where the humans went, and about the lives of those around you. the puzzles in this game are fairly intuitive and i never really found myself getting turned around a lot despite the slightly openworld element of some areas of the game. the story is definitely the focus of this game and i would also like to highlight how incredibly beautiful the design of this game is. the art style, the environment, the graphics, how you can interact with your surroundings, and the connections you make throughout this game is really just a nice cherry on top of an overall excellent experience. i truly do feel like this is something everyone should try to play, even if just for the story and art style alone."
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-25,"what a game, i finished the whole game in 5 hours, we need a part 2, the game can not end on a cliff hanger! recommend this game to everyone. now after completing i can go collect more memories and stuff!!!"
Adventure,Stray,2025-02-24,"you do need a game controller to play this game, don't try to play it with a keyboard. beautifully written and animated game, with lots of puzzles. so fun to play that i burned through it in like 3 days. i do wish it was a little longer, and also that the ending had a little more resolution, maybe an additional scene to leave the player feeling more hopeful."
