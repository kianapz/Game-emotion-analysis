@Red-wb5jj,"Is there an expert that can fix my AGe 4 graphics? I have a 3060 and all my grass and fields etc. look really grainy, which is very distracting from the gameplay and even hurts my eyes. I would love to play Age 4, but with this grainy grass and fields, it's almost unplayable. I have all settings set to maximum. Does anyone have any tips on how I can make the graphics look as good as they do in most YouTube videos?",0

@upcomingvillain,"When I click on the trade button with a trader, and then try to click on an allies market, it says ""cannot use this ability on this target""  Right clicking on the market doesn't work either.  My trader will just walk to the market and then go idle.  How do you actually make them collect gold and return home?",0
