Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,what i like the most about this update is buildings can now be placed even if they overlap with a pal. it was rather annoying that a pal walking through somehow meant i couldn't place a building for construction.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"love the cosmetic armour system addition, cloth outfit is my favourite outfit in the game, so being able to wear it while having the defence of the best armour is just brilliant."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i'm glad that now you can collect blueprints and upgrade them to a higher tier. too bad i've pretty much sold most of my extra blueprints in my main save.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,the drafting table giving us inevitability is the best kind of balance between rarity and determination. i love it.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"welp, i just made all my legendary gear with the draft table. it doesn't feel earned, but i'm just so glad that i no longer have to harass the oils rigs and yoink supply drops for hours on end. now i can focus on optimizing my bases and supercharging my pals."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,the drafting table is the best thing that's happened in this update. since the time i was struggling to get the blue print of the lightweight legendary hexolite armore ... i had 6 epic blue prints in a chest ... now i have my legendary armor !!! unfortunately on ps5 the new trophies are bugged
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"ugh, guess who sold all my 'useless' schematics yesterday...? thanks for this, and for being so quick. my download's only just finished!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,awesome i wanted a pal storge and transmog system for a very long time.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"finally, i can stop searching for my indentured merchant to sell my piles of blue and green schematics"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"great add of the box so if a world gets deleted, you don't have to lose that pal."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i really didn't know about these things, thanks for the vid....now i know lol. you have a great channel here and i used to watch your destiny 2 vids a lot"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"that blueprint combined table makes legendaries easier for me because my luck is ridiculous. i got all legendary blueprints from all legendary pals first fight. but never got multi rocket, hexolite, or advanced bow legendary blueprints and i have been grinding for months."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"noticed a great thing youve done,advanced storage with sign boards ,never thought of that ,brilliant tip"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"751 the way you set up your bases, does that mean if you start a raid with xenolord ultra in one base with 20 base pals, then the left base and the right base will have another 20  20, meaning a total of 60 pals to fight that xenolord ultra? i think all it takes is, one shot from the boss to the other base to trigger the attack mode of the other bases"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,dpjj i love youre content ! ive been watching your content since black ops two emblem days !!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"the drafting table is probably their best idea by far imo,like in pokmon you can't make a pokball table to make a master ball by using like 50 or 100 ultra balls or any apri balls as well,so this makes palworld even better by a massive mile over pokmon,don't get me wrong i love pokmon but that idea is something that pokmon should be doing,game freak seriously needs to step it tf up in future pokmon games cause palworld is getting better and better after each update,hopefully they announce a new expansion update for more pals a new location weapons and more soon,these devs are killing imo"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,this update is amazing! i was just about to close my eyes too
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,o i did start playing palword abot 2 weeks ago after almost a year pause ....and i was going wild trying to get legendaries on end game and i got nothing ...but my hoarding made me keep all the recipes i dropped ...... even on some i have 15 best ...update ....ever
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i wish i knew about the draft table ive been getting rid of all my extra schematics. great addition though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"apparently, crafting pals using the global pal box doesnt count as catching the pals thus dont unlock the saddle."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,thanks for showing all this very helpful
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i was curious to know if they gave dumud the water type, it's worded a little funny in the patch notes"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"the game keeps getting better and better with each update, it's a shame that it has lost the original hype as before"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"love this guide dpj ,explains some items perfectly"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,palworld black marketeer now will spawn pidf guard guys... be careful if want to farm early
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,hi love the your videos they are very helpfull .question what happens to the pals in the global box if i creat hc world and they die?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"good lord, the souls of the xenolords will haunt your grandchildren's grandchildren with the amount you turned into sippyjuice!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"frick,, i sold all my low tier bp's , keeping only one. damn."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"519 so here, you mean the xenolord mask is not very effective, so you can actually change the best mask in the game to look like the xenolord mask, so that you get the look, and the effectiveness of something else?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i have been wondering where do you build your base you have so much space
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i truly believe that the developer are buying these feature xdd cuzz we have better palsphere upgrade where you take 3 sphere to get 1 of the next level.. i love palworld devs for these balance !!! i really love the blueprint upgrade if you have to many of them for a better version, like i have to many blue one xdd"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i wanted more and better furniture and to be able to put all base together better without saying it closed to each other.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,still waiting for you to do hard boss fight without buffed settings
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"dude, what the hell? this game looks so different from when it was released. i can't believe it's the same game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"how did you get your base to be that large? beautiful design as well, very impressive and well thought out"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i'm baffled and quite curious where the accent is from! intriguing.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,can you still do two oil extracts?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,destiny music goin hard
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"maaannn, i literally sorted my boxes out yesterday and deleted all my duplicate schematics"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,did the global palbox make breeding redundant on servers since you can just infinitely port your best pals?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,does global palbox allow server transfer?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,does transferring pals work in randomizer mode?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,do you know how many purple blueprints i have sold?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,anyone know if you can pull from the new pal box for condensing?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,palworld needs to upgrade the enemy npc ai cause it is a bit dumb not gonna lie
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,for a moment was about to ask how do you build def walls on structures and those are just gates. that was a downgrade...
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i still believe you unlock drafting table way to late imo 30 would be a good level requirement
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"drafting table isn't really all that useful. you might get 5 of the same schematic at tier 1 or 2 ...in a normal playthrough. might. more likely you'll get 3 t1's, 4 t2's, 2 t3's, 2 t4's, by the time you get 1 t5. so, in this scenario, you'd be one schematic away from crafting a t3 schematic, even though you already have 2 of those, and a several schematics beyond that as well. so at best, it is only useful as a very weak fix for rng which is rolling the bottom 12 of terrible looting luck. and it would rarely be useful even for that. if the cost was say 3 schematics, it would be semiuseful. 2 schematics as a cost would be very useful. 4 or more is pointless and it costs 5. at a cost of 5, i could easily see building a schematic workbench, and then never finding an opportunity to use it, for any schematic, ever. in fact, that seems very likely. that said, it probably creates an easy path for someone to make a mod, which is closer to the realism of looting in palworld than the dev's are. at 5 schematics as a cost, it's purely a decoration item for 99.9 of playthroughs."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,mimsy!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,hola suelo ver mucho tu vdeo me gustara si puedes poner los audios en espaol
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,let me rename my pal box tabs.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,w for everyone who stockpiled schematic
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,what about any new pals???
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,sold my duplicate patterns recently. now they add an upgrade pattern option. ffs..
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,honig of online multipler at my ps5...
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,now all we need is a way to transfer our characters and inventories to different saves and the game would be perfect!... id love to be able to start from the beginning but with all my tech unlocked and all my equiptment i have... like a new game plus... and be able to transfer stuff back and forth like one can do on ark... when one beats the final boss of the island you take everything non element based with you meaning everything apart from the element resource is taken and you can use it when you start scorched earth etc. just a thought of course...
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,one thing the palboxes dont do is work between solo worlds and dedicated servers
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,nice work. i 'm learning a lot from you. keep going

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"one really useful thing i found.. if playing with a controller on pc when you select sort it now has the shortcut key for the sort button, so instead of having to move the cursor down to the sort button i can just hit the y button on the controller.. such a small thing, but considering i generally sort the palbox every time i move any pals, or had caught new ones.... it's a great thing."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"the human work skills are not random, from what i have seen. all the humans have mining, handiness, and lumbering. from there, each specific type of human has a set extra skill point. syndicate grenadiers, for example all have a point in transporting. the exceptions are the larger humans, who have extra points. the syndicate crusher has 3 transporting, and the fpa judicator has 3 gathering."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,bud. your guides are the best i've seen for palworld. hope you keep doing these. it keeps me wanting to play the game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,onions have models now not just in random bags also the bug when you add a weapon to your player. he will no longer do the t pose always do.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"now if they could make it so pals actually take breaks instead of working themselves to stress, i would be one happy girl. it mainly happens for mining or lumbering pals. it gets annoying because they keep going even when their sanity is low, then they get sick."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"i noticed the work suitability on humans right after the update releases. i captured a few wonderfully merchants, and up until now, all they did was stand around. all of a sudden, i didn't see them right away because in one base, my merchant was watering food plantations and in the other base, my merchant was mining ore. i think it's cool that they added this."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"if it hasn't been mentioned already, in the patch notes it said that the elemental chests that you have spawned in on patch so old chests still run off of the old loot table, you will need to open and reset them to get the new loot tables."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,the raid boss slabs are whole now instead of pieces. this means no need to collect 4 to craft together to assemble into one raid boss slab for the altar. so far i've noticed it from expeditions and drops from some chests.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"the global pal transfer is completely bugged. the saves are separate from your local save so you can absolutely abuse the system by quitting without saving after uploading pals to duplicate resources. people are finding ways to duplicate pals, reuse iv fruit, and most importantly reuse suitability books. also if you haven't already don't interact with the friendly tamer for your book. you can savescum it for the book you want as it rolls it randomly some of the books are way more valuable than others."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"they changed the circle on the palbox base range, it is no longer a perfect circle but more of an octagon shaped is how i can best describe it...."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"dear god, that's an incredible base set up you got"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"222 i wonder how often you can come back for another applied technique book... i got one like 5am, and now it is 8pm... and i set the day and night speed to fastest, so 1 game day to me is 6 minutes... 1 hour is 10 game days... so... now it is 15 x 10  150 game days, but that npc is not giving me another one yet"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,the chest still stack for me. just did it last night and i did it a little 5 times and it still works.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"the notes indicated that players would need to start a new world to experience the changes to the elemental chests. however, i am currently receiving dog coins and other items from the elemental chests without having to create a new world. i haven't obtained any pal suitability books yet, so they may still be missing from the loot table. additionally, i have not received any pal suitability books from the chest on the oil rig either. has anyone else had a similar experience? thanks for the great videos dpj!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"didn't even know it was a thing, i always miss the exploits lol"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,there wasn't a chromite nerf. there was a bug where most of the nodes were spawning under the map.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i've been using the glitch to stack dungeon loot the last couple weeks because of your video gg's
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"my friend and i had beat the chopper before the update and have beat it since, but that achievement and all the new ones are not popping for us. also, what is the little dna looking thing in the sort options now?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,excellent video. the rhotacism made it better. sigh.. still no corner roof pieces? i tried building when the game came out and just couldn't get into it without corner roof pieces.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i hope they sort the passive skills list in the pal box filter
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,great vid dpj one thing would want to mention is the achievements aren't retroactive yet or at least not for everyone i say this since the world i have the most time in on xbox at this point finished the lab before this update by over a week  and i have 0 of the lab achievements
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,did you know on a regular fire food cooks by itself
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i have no idea if this is something that was already in and i never noticed it before or something that is new, but pals will transport your cakes into an available breeding pen"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,did they fix going back into the dungeon after completing it and getting all the loot spawn again?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,do i have to demolish the expedition station and rebuild to make it smaller?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,ive found the elemental chests all over? are you talking about like specific chests with specific items in them? or just elemental chests? cuz ive found them before this new patch in the desert and just today i found one in the mushroom wastelands.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,the patch notes said that new npcs were added... but i have been looking and havent found any npcs that are newer than dr brawn...
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,did they increase the amount given at least because that dungeon in out was dope af
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i encountered a weird ingame bug where i make cakes, but when i go to collect them, they just disappear. sometimes i'll make 100, and then after it makes 2, it resets to 1 and continues doing that without producing any cakes. dunno if this is a new or old bug, but its new for me after playing for about 40 days on ps5. never saw it happen before yesterday."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,you can rotate when replacingupgrading roofs now
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,anyone else always try to get a shiny lamball?

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,npc help during a raid would be amazing.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"imagine this, you have to shield zoe and grizzbolt from the rayne syndicate because she betrayed them by wanting to travel free of restrictions, could a new tower boss for rayne syndicate be a possible path for a story? its what comes to mind when they say zoe becoming an ally"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"you dismantled your pyramid to make a big man? you're silly, and i respect that."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"it's obvious why katress is higher then shadowbeak, it's humanoid and a goth cat. no need to beat around the bush, furries want to bang katress more then shadowbeak. it's par for the course in games like this, especially since palworld confirms in universe interbreeding with humans and pals happen."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"xenolord, orserk, bastigor, and shadowbeak. thats who i think should be getting skins"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"katress is awesome. i do hope for anubis they draw from ancient egyptology and make wepwawet his skin. wepwawet was the precursor opener of ways before anubis took the title, and he was a major god in lycanopolis. where anubis is a jackal, wepwawet is a wolf and grey to white in color."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"chillet, jetragon and quivern were my pick in the poll, so i'm happy 2 out of 3 will be getting a new skin. i understand chillet winning though it's pretty much the face of the game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"well yeah, they asked us to vote for our favorites, not to vote for which one we wanted a new skin for"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,can't believe we're not getting kikit and arrogant pal critic skins
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"i hope they do something similar to other games for voting events like this, just hard bar the previous winners from getting skins if they win again or something so other units or pals in this case get a chance to shine with new skins. otherwise chillet might just have like ten skins it really doesn't need."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,is chillit the charazard of palworld?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"323 four skins for chillet., chillet hunting forskins needs to be lore. xd"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"could be able to capture her or even better, in a story sense. maybe there will be a friendship system where you can grow her affection and recruit her that way?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"oh yeah. first zoe, then saya. then the world"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,if you go into your pal condenser they have a new sort option in there now thanks to last update
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,yes! my pals turn grey from time to time lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,astagon would look cool with a new skin
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,sounds like an option to maybe have zoe ane grizzbolt summinable for raid pal encounters. or oil rig encounters.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"love chillet, but cmon give someone else a skin. would love to see one for orserk"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,chillet gang rise up!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,yea chillet has way too many skins i love anubis though great all around pal and love his design since im a huge ancient egypt history buff
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,yes zoe my 1st baby girl as your ally let's go!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i'm hyped for this.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"my favorite pals are kitsune, omascul, anubis and smokie"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,fr chillet is overrated af.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,they should have a randomly selected pal for skins every now and then
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i wish we xan do zoe
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i want a katress ignis skin.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,can i capture her and breed her with another tower boss? haha. create more humans! have babies!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,still means nothing to playstation players. we need servers
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,a lot of the story is told in the in journals
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,they already have our money why can't do they keep beating so with epicness
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"look, i know how zoe's name is spelled, but proper pronunciation rhymes with joey not with toe"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,who are you to assume that everyone has to like the pals you do? spoiler i don't like shadowbeak
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,glitched patched
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,no love for lovander
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,how is this update major
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,so when are you going to do videos on assassins creed?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,shadowbeak is cool af. they like kinda lame ones. i didnt even know there was a vote. it looks like it was only seen by little kids or something.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"i think zoe is going to be the first, and theyre just testing the mechanic to make sure it works. since she won the popularity contest, shes the first one we are going to be able to recruit. if saya or lily won, it wouldve been them instead. that said, i hope there are story beats to recruiting tower bosses somehow."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"my boyfriend said i watch too much youtube. after this video, he became a fan too"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"if laughter was currency, i'd be a millionaire after this video. does anyone know how to monetize laughter"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"the text size is great to see as well! means they are keeping an eye out for accessibility. i would like to see more crosshair options for those like myself who struggle with vision, so to see a change like this is refreshing and encouraging!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i believe what it's trying to say 341 is for example if you launch a rocket at a dense forest, the game will now assume that you do not actually want the woodfiber, you simply want the area clear for other purposes, therefore it will not explode loots and tank your fps."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,make the circle base bigger
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i'm so glad they fixed the glitch that randomly launched you when climbing , i kept getting launched all the way to the ocean and hitting the barriers  lol it was mad annoying when trying to do something"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,cosmetics? now i'm gonna have to get all those cool hats.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i just want more structure options. like roof corners and curved structures. want to get my castle on without it looking like its from minecraft.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,we are so back and we never even left
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,the high damage to trees is dope lmaoo my multiplayer games lag when my friends use jet dragons to farm frosted areas its a bit annoying
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i think the tree fix was to help with rockets hitting too many trees and causing too many drops at once to crash servers. it got really bad on ps5 with mossandas launcher
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"353 some weapons that deal super high damage to things like trees will no longer drop things like wood. think of it vaporizeing the tree instead of chopping it down. i don't use a wood axe, i just use whatever gun, it's so much faster. this may make me change my direction though. it took me rereading it 4 times to understand what it was meaning."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"the games on sale rn on ps store, is this game still worth it?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,how to build this base. it's look cool.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,are they gonna fix the blacked out map glitch??
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,bruh this global paleos is kind of op. started a new world with instant 5 star pals and just feelseasy
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,they're half way done with development!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,this base is beautiful
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"nice guide mate,makes it easy to understand it all properly when having commentary,looking forward to your views after youve played the new updates,i noticed the schematics have the actual weapons showing on the schematic,love the idea of combining schematics to get better weapons,thanks again dpj"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,this is a huge update i thought it was gonna be just cross play
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,the drafting table and transmog was all i wanted. i'm sick of bombing the oil rigs and never getting that legendary multi missile launcher. and i can wear any of the silly hats without compromising my stats
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"crafting new blueprints is amazing, not to mention the new pal storage i just hope pocketpair is able to best those spergs at nintendo not sure i like the tree patch...and i'm still getting the boot up glitchquick resume on xbox s where i have to reload my saves game multiple times stupid world data could not be loaded bug"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,at 504 what do you mean 7 in 1 base?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,aaalllllll i wanna kno is can i move my pals from my xbox world to my ps5 world?!?!?!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,they dont miss
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,did they add the datamined feybreak wandering merchant with the rocketmissle ammo?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,have they fixed the dungeon glitch on feybreak island yet cos mines not doing it anymore
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,voice crack lol xd 754
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,wish there was a new better dublication glitch
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,does that mean youll see other players?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i was excited for cross play. until i found out console still demands a monthly fee to play multiplayer. i don't feel like shilling out the price of a full game a year, for a feature i'd barely get to make use off since i only have 1 friend to even play with and rarely do so. once again, console greed is making me wish i had a better computer"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,help me my character got reset on my dedicated server... how do i get all my stuff back
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,finally another reason to boot up
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"damn, i just discarded a ton of lower level blueprints.....!!....."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,guys when will they do palworld mobile
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"they fixed mini bugs!!!! my palworld crashes almost every time when i go into a chest to put things away! and it crashes when i open my inventory! when i am in a dungeon  want to change the weapon for fighting  i forget that i cannot open inventory  open it, the game craaashes  i am standing outside of the dungeon again! the game also crashes when i open supply drop boxes  the guild chest! it's almost unplayable for me now!!!! since they changed it all with the guild chest, it chrashes whhen i open boxes  not long after that, it crashes now when i open my inventory! they update  update but do not fix suuuch maaajor problems! i'm highly frustrated cause i like the game soooo much  i love my pal animals! they are so sweet  lot of work to breed  i put a lot of work into that  now the game crashes all of a sudden since some weeks aaaaall the time! love your videos  especiallybuilding videos, all thumbs up for your videos! greetings from austria"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,imo drafting table unlocks way too late i would unlock it at 30 45 seems too late to me
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,again cross play is useless make dedicated servers make it that ur able to play without the host needing to be online and open their world
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,love how lamball tries to run but is still stuck on the wheel
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i just have to say... the palworld music is always on point.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"nice touch with green, blue, and gold beams for xbox, ps, and pc, respectively."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i love how astegon is hit with a yellow, green and blue laser, which i assume represents the 3 different platforms we can play palworld on."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,able to bring my pal to friend's world is a masterpiece works
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"not mentioned here in the trailer, but thank you for finally adding the option to overlay armor sets! hoping this is a sign that more cosmetic outfits will get added at some point down the line, would love to be able to wear the merchant costume for example.  looking forward to what the rest of this year will bring!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,ps5
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,...at least my boi astegon is in the trailer.... but all he wanted was to mine. xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,astegon really rocking the space kaiju vibes he always had.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,been craving some palworld and finally i can play with my friends on playstation

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i fully plan on playing it, but i bought palworld just to show my support! major love to y'all, and may the future be pal colored!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"beautiful trailer, can't wait to see how to make the servers work now"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"finally! 500 hours played solo, time to get 1k played with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"keep it up pocketpair, other developers should take a leaf out of your book. you have so much love for your product, with tons of free updates and countless improvements. respec"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,nintendo can cry about it!! didn't know yall would argue. not changing it tho.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,they do trailers better than pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i played on release but haven't played since. i'm gonna get back into it after watching this!

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,pokemon wishes that there game could be this awesome
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,that this happened the same day ark had an enormous blow up is absolutely hilarious to me
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i love palworld!!!!!!! keep making amazing pals!! and if taking ideas a scythe pal would be awsome!! splatterina being one of my favorite but my main is tarantriss the destroyer!!!

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i love palworld. even though it sounds like the updates to this phenomenon might slow down after this update, i will still support you, your games and your company. also, what's the official merchandise site to purchase your palworld merch?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"thank you, me and my friends have been waiting for this forever 3"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"amazing crossplay, i hope lamball is ok"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,oh see now that at the ending! we need some sort of limit break gauge to do a combo attack with our pals! or something! combat just needs a bit more something
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,lets gooooooo!!!!!!! i've been waiting for this also amazing music as always keep up the amazing work pocketpair.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,are we getting corn
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i wish this was for the ps4
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"huh, odd, this didn't show up in my subscription feed when it came out"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,yes palworld! no pookemon!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,that is crazy ball
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"yay my favorite,. palworld"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"nice, can't wait to play by myself on multiple consoles. also are they tweaking the difficulty in the new update? cuz i'm pretty sure a single rocket can kill one of those guys and yet it tanked that and multiple other attacks"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i too would love a astergon suddenly appear and attack my base randomly.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,cosmetic armour! finally!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i'll be honest. i've been waiting for this update basically since i found out that there wasn't crossplay. don't get me wrong, i've wanted to play this since it blew up. i've watched as this game grew bigger and larger."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,this is what it feels when a time traveller from the future came to me who are still stuck in wood age d
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,friends and i were talking about looking for a crossplay game we can play to catch a break from helldivers and this just came out a few days after talking about it! we then set up our own server and had it all ready just in time for this and the game got a whole lot fun again! hype!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,niceeeee
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,fun for the howl family... lets get it on swtich
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"we're back, guys."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,awesome!!

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,thank you so much for the update!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i love to see this!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,need this game so bad
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,cool cinematic!  poor base pals though
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,almost thought it was a helldiver 2 gameplay by the sheer amount of things going on screen lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,notice how nobody used the beam sword?  also did the moon get larger since the update? it looks like it got a little closer to us than before...
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"are we getting corn, or is that just an asset used for the video? my boys got a hankering for some cornbread."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"here im writing in hopes of erasing hidden stats, they are making breeding into absolute torture"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,let's gooo
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i mostly play solo but crossplay is a nice feature to have with friends
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,that astegon was built different
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,another palworld w 3
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,here is a thought if you ever decide to make a palworld spin off where map is literally map of earthnot miniaturised the actual earth dont make us go around irl in order to move ingame like pickmeon go. give us a freaking joystick and make teleport points so we can rome around the world. . . but this is something that i won't expect to see for next 510 years at least. even by your amezing dev speed
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,that's really great news!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"practice makes perfect! palmon is a perfectionist, together, we are, the power of friendship!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,great trailer for sure!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,when ya'll gonna release like 3040 new pals at once and spread them throughout existing areas? that's one of the only things that'll bring me back. gen 2 please!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,in soviet russia raid boss raids you.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"pocketpaiiirrr, can we get picture frames so the pics we take can be put in our base? that would be soooo cool!  o"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,twin peaks but laura's theme becomes a real banger.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,palworld
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"ah, another step for greatness."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,they hit him with the power rangers special
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,les goooooo
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,absolute cinema
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"nintendo. you cannot stop palworld. and to all of you hard core fans of pokemon, deal with it"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,you guys are freaking awesome!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"1. i'm assuming this is just for these types of raids, but if players can fully explore other players world, i would like for this to be a world setting 2. i would also like there to be a pvp world setting that works very similar to randomization where you just click off and everything pvp related turn off, but unlike randomization it's not permanent you can switch it back anytime 3. i would also like a way to allow pillars to expand, mainly for building water bases aka, bases above the ocean like your own custom not legit oil rig for example love this game, i have a thousand plus hours, and i hope nintendo loses, and have a great day edit didn't realize it was already out so next update please? note i have not played it yet"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,we need servers that everyone can play on for console!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"yeeeessss, pal storage box. thanks so much."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,finally!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"we all saw it here, 1 pc player without gear equals to 3 console players with bis every slot. ggwp accurate"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,palworld does what nintendont
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"razehost, a melhor host de palworld do brasil!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,well see how this crossplay works out.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"during the steam sale? just to top things off, they've got slick timing."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,does this mean offical servers for playstation?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,lets goooooo
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,we beat him with the power of palship and heavy machine guns
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i guess i will ain't gonna live with my base.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,thor! let me see what you have! a gun! no!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"i love the steam comments for this game wake up stranded, punch a sheep, this is pokemon black and blue"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,see how it looks like a pokemon? bang see how it no longer looks like a pokemon? palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,thor has no chill... but he has a gun.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"pokmon red, white, and blue"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,this game is seriously probably one of my favorite games to come out over the past few years
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"heres my favorite paldex entry long ago, this pal used long objects like tree branches as weapons. after coming into contact with humans, however, it found something slightly more effective guns."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,just as the founding fathers intended
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,i still start wheezing histerically when i see the lvl 4 syndicate thug at my base get the happy flower sparkles like pals after finishing a task
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,and peta was up in arms just on normal pokmon lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,when the u.s. found out that the pokmon islands had oil
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,"months later, this is still my favorite palworld clip. this is the clip that convinced me to buy the game. zero regrets. this game is so much fun!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,i love how the name implies its the friendliest experience ever. a world of pals? how fun. nothing but friends. joy!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"lamball might just be a ballsheepcreature, but that ballshape makes them the funniest ragdolls to see tumble down hills."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,lamb casually attacking a human in the background
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,so anyway i started blastin
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,oh shit they actually correctly animated the musket reload for once
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-21,"the deadpan, that's palworld. that's how it works. sent me into a fit  the comedic timing was too good. the bleeting of the sheep is killing me  i want this as a ringtone"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"its so fluffy im gonna die chickchick yes, yes you are"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,'cool a shiny gyarados' boom headshot! boooooom!
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-16,"simple, elegant, and concise. thor never wastes his words"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,can we talk about how smooth that musket animation is tho
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"my favorite part of the game is that the game has it own version of peta which can raid you for having pal slave camps, and those slave camps can be defended by hordes of sheep with machine guns."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-19,crazy that nintendo just filed a lawsuit against them. wasting resources when the most recent pokmon games released in such a messy state.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,you see that? fires now you don't.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,i own a musket for home defense
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,that pretty much explains it
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,that's the cutest thing i've ever seen   dies
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,lamball oh hi there! thorancient reload
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,a wild rattata appeared. click click boom!  rattata disappeared
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,i'll explain to you what palworld is commits war crimes
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"this is the most palworld short i've seen shooting a lamball with a musket as it rolls into the distance, meanwhile his partner is a syndicate thug named beans"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,me on my daily walk with my lamball me chilling the lamball  shot me my lamball
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,if you look at the pals eyes after shooting or stabbing them they look like incapacitated pokemon but if you butcher them with a knife that is a different story
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,the first npc talks about over a hundred people being eaten by pals... lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-01,my evolution stone is a gun. i'm evolving this pokemon into dinner
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,do you see that ? you see how that look like your childhood dream ? shotgun sound
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"short, sweet, straight to the point. 1010"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,"for everyone saying it looks like a generic asset flip i feel that some cell shading like early fortnite is the graphical niche this game is missing. however, that approach would interfere with alot of the asset designs..."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,i like how the clip cuts perfectly as the other guy is about to be roadrollered by one of the other pals in retaliation for thor's demonstration
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,this is the best advertisement possible for a game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,such an amazing clip. legit has me chuckling bro
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,cute noises me awwww! yeah it looks like a cute pokem gets murdered me what?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"i never knew i wanted a game with this exact way of implementing muskets, but oh god that shot and reload felt perfect to me..."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,pokemon gotta catch them all palworld gotta kill them all
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"''i have a pokemon'' thor  '' and i have a gun, and i'm not affraid to use it !!''"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,i liked that another sheep aggro'd on the wrong guy lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,summed up perfectly
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,people can be pals like all the others... nuff said
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,he's gonna beat the game with the power of friendship. and this shotgun he found.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,this is the best advertising for pal world i've ever seen
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"i just downloaded this game yesterday and i absolutely love it. it's like pokemon ,ark, and breath of the wild all in one. i cant wait for full release."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,noone gonna comment on how perfect the cut is with that almost to be continued ending with the lamball going after the other guy?
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,this is the short that introduced me to the game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"love how he showcased shooting a lamball as an explanation for the people that havent played, but the rest of us know how he got that thug to follow him"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"pokemon release goodbye, omletechansey!  palword start running, i got to work up an appetite for breakfast omelet."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,fun fact this short convinced me to buy palworld. no regrets.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,it kills me inside to hear lambells die their so damn precious
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"hmmm... yes. i see... could you explain it again, just to be sure i understand completely?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,ik guys hear me out im in love with the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,literally been playing this game nonstop since it came out
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,the most eloquent explanation i've seen thus far
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,i caved now i'm 18 hours deep.i have had this game 17 hours

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,i like how the short cuts off right as that lamball was about to use rollout on that other player.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-10,straight to the point thank you
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,the thing that looks almost like a pokemon  exists looks like a job for the good ol' brown bess.

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,gotta musket all
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-17,we glazed this game so much it's actually insane...
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"who here has never seen this game before i would like to know too at this point, it is everywhere"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"as a fan of pokmon, i really wanted to hate this game but its actually just stupid fun"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-03,it's the sound the little palsheep makes that does it for me. no sleep tonight.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"if anyone needs context as to why these comments are so divisive, theres a rumor going around that a.i. was used to generate the concept art for the game. the rumors come from an old tweet the ceo of the company made talking about how impressive the technology for aigenerated pokemon was, and that they have made a game revolving around ai art in the past. it is notable though that theres no concrete evidence, and multiple human artists are credited as character and pal designers. also, early trailers for the game with the same designs were posted 23 years ago before ai art made its biggest breakthroughs."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,oh peta is going to have an aneurysm over this game and i can't wait!

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"the fact that thor owns a musket irl and would probably narrate calmly like this video as he terminates a home intruder thor you know whats funny, i own a glock 19, but i chose to shoot you with a musket. why? because its a musket and i find that deeply hilarious. cereal killer screaming in agony repenting for his crimes"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-12,legit this is the first time i've seen game play. so gg. you got me. i'll check it out
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,this game has a lot of controversy i would love to hear your thoughts on.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,a more accurate summery is a grindy survival game with pokmon tacked onto the side.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"something i overlooked until now, is that palworld reminded me vaguely of a game called craftopia, and i recently checked, and pocket pair also made craftopia, pocket pair, the devs, actually took many concepts from craftopia, pokeballs kinda stuff and the whole automation  slavery thing."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,bro your last video on palworld convinced me so much that i went and bought it immediately
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,this game is legitimately some of the most relaxed fun i've had in a game for a long time i genuinely wish this game the best and can't wait to see it grow
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,this was the pitch meeting.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,how do you know that little fluffy pokemon didn't just faint when you shot it? checkmate atheists

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,wtf is up with this game? twitch is full with it and it looks veeery boring and pointless.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-07,knew exactly where this was going and i was still wheezing in the end
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,the fact he just nonchalantly blows its brains out while it's being absolutely adorable is hilarious
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-13,"he's a troubleshooter, he sees trouble and shoots it"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,is it full crossplay or just psxbox?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,pokmon could never make a game this great

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,wow

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,pvp?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,this update is worthless on ps5 cause there still is no online multiplayer but pc and xbox have it
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,crossplay with bad servers damm
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,still annoyed none of the pals can evolve
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,nintendo crying
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,i thought we left this game in 2024
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,i smell a anime ..... but after all thie lawsuti bs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,the game is literally broken for me i can't get into a world it just crashes when im trying to get in
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,we needed this a week to a month after the game came out not like what a year later or something. games boring anyways
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,a year to late
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,0
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"you know the more new characters the developers of this game make, the more obvious it is that they're shamelessly ripping off pokmon. that creature at 053 looks eerily similar to lucario and the one behind the lady with a gatling gun at 055 is basically gardevior with extra steps. see, this is the kind of desperate that makes people not want to buy your product ."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,sued and shut down
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,needed this a year ago too late now not coming back
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,they really just be stealing designs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,keep inspiring your viewers! your ideas are always relevant and interesting.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"this ad couldve been for anything  the animation doesnt really tell anything. and yes, the trend is over, due to the lack of end game content."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,ayooo is that kyurem??
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,so does this mean ps5 now has dedicated online servers?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i don't know what i just watched, but it was beautiful. shall we do it again"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,that moment when you realize that the comments under a video can be even funnier than the video itself
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,thank you for your hard work and creativity! your videos always bring joy and interesting ideas.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,wow you made some really good points here! best video!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,you know i wasnt sure you were gonna be able to do it but you have convinced me
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"i am inspired. best video ever 1,00010. well done! d"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,im absolutely convinced thank you
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,yes. yes! absolutely! yes absolutely. mm hmm! youre so right. exactly!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,best video ever
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,10 out of 10 video
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,mission failed successfully?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,what was this?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,part 1 is here! httpsyoutu.be7tv7valxu join into my discord for all my updates! httpsdiscord.ggf3ecjq4fvd
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"some people have done palworld with humans only, could be really interesting with the new changes in 0.5.0, with humans now having different work suitabilities."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,600 oh mah god! yuu saved kenny!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,all predator pals are also randomized in the usual predatory pal locations but retaining their levels same with normal settings
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,this video must have been before the new update
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"the elphidran is because of the randomizer. in one of my saves, that exact predator pal was replaced with a level 48 jormuntide ignis instead of the level 30 or so omascul it is in vanilla"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,about the elphidran there's a level 55 in sakurajima in the regular game so i think the raging pals might also be randomized to different spots? i hunted that one for the predator cores for the inventory upgrades in my main save so that's how i know
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i love youre videos
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,''this is what i've been waiting for! woooooooooooo''
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,if you dont have a fly pal catch a pal
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,yey another part of serie! thank you mega!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"randomizer with randomized levels is the way to go imo, or atleast the original ramdom mode with pal levels thst scale with type, so you can't catch a ragnahawk or something at lvl 1. much more intense and unpredictable."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,nice vid dude but make a movie of it like the one u made of eggs only so its easier to watch
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,jazz hands
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,3612 yk what's massive?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,shiny mozarina cheeseburger
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,my favorite sandwich is jersey mikes turkey and provolone. yum yum! i still love the treehouse base. i want to make one in one of my runs soon
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,new video idea palworld but i catch every pal
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,idk if megabits even reads his comments but you should think about breeding for anubis for your base
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,im happy that i got gifted membership!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"kinda hard as a viewer to keep track of the upload schedule. like u continue a run every 23 month and we should know what happened back then? d edit this one is 2 weeks old my bad, but the point stands"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i had no clue you could find shadowbeak there and grizzbolt in sakarajima
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,isn't the second ice tower boss a shadowbeak?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i would absolutely love to send you my motivation, however i am also currently out so counter offer. sending thoughts and prayers"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,its friday
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,you are the greatest
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,your a goat to
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,"nitewing is huge in the early game. flying is crucial in so many ways and its the first saddle you can get. getting eggseffegys, exploration, and for just catching more pals in general."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,"also, once you get both chillet and arsox, you can breed them to get kitsun, which once you unlock the mount will negate both cold and hot environments"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,be honest whos first boss was the mammorest
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,cattiva underrated for early game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,"maaaan, i started with a chicken. now im riding a stallion"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"you want to cheese early game? here's 2 methods i found 1. get a foxpark and unlock his saddle, then fill the other 4 party slots with rooby'sfor their passive and you have a flamethrower thats incredibly strong 2. catch 5 daedreams at night and unlock their necklace and enjoy artillery being fired and anything you fightthough if you want to capture a pal, dont bring them, they're incredibly skilled at killing anything you try to capture"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,the cattiva at the end
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-20,"tip  catch vixy this pal drops pal speher , gold ,etc and once you unlock the pal essence condenser upgrade vixy to 3 star and it will drop mega speher as well...."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,i would throw in the fire fox and unlock the leash... the flamethrower from it did amazing starting off. as well as giving you a light in the dark.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,my first pal was a foxsparks. probably the best for starting as it saved me from freezing.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,what pals did you start with? proceeds to blow up my starter
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,"when i realized that pals affected the temperature i just about lost it. got my new pal, going into battle...what do you mean the living volcano is giving me heatstroke?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,"might i also suggest the toco toco? while it can be kinda hard to capture, getting one and then crafting its pal gear gives you a hilarious grenade launcher that does amazing aoe damage in the earlymid game. you'll want to sneak up on them for capturing because most of the time they'll kamikaze you when you attack them. best chance to get them i feel is during their raid event. they seem to only blow up when they get to your base. so if you intercept them beforehand, you can do some damage and then go for the capture."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,i still have that first one on the list to this day and plus its freaking adorable as hell
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,"best pets to get for the first ten levels? pick up a cattiva and lamball to work your base, a tanzy and pengullet to work your berry farm, a foxparks for combat with a few rooby's to boost the foxparks flame damage, a rushoar for mining mineral nodes outside your base, dire howl for a mount and a couple of vixies to ranch spheres. maybe add in a chickipee if you want to get a head start on egg production for cakes. if you have the patience to chase one down a lifmunk also helps with general base work."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,direhowl and vanwyrm are the goats. also digitoise is the best miner in the whole game and can be found around level 16 at the lowest.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,foxparks is great given it glows so dark areas are easy added bonus of you get to own a flamethrower
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,"all fire pals keep you warm. likewise, all ice pals cool you down in hot areas."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,me caughing chikpii and so proud about it
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,this helped so much thx i subbed
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-06,currently i am watching techno gemerz's palword series. and i love it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-09,thanks bro for this information.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"celaray  just keep one around the base for carrying stuff until you get vanwyrm and ragnahawk. also who needs to build a glider anyway cremis  wools wools wools, surprisingly scary in combat as well."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,"after watching this video, i discovered the glory of early game rushoar mining. from then on, i rushed pun absolutely intended catching one and never made another metal pickaxe."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,i caught a level 16 tree dinosaur that walked into my base in the first 15 minutes of playing.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,"every fire pal keeps u warm, so does every ice pal keep you cool, you just need to have it outside"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,vixy is my go too
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,"i wholeheartedlyagree with arsox. he's such an underrated pal, yet i used him while exploring the mountain around the 2nd boss tower."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-26,whos first pal was chikipi
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,i love that a max vixxy can drop the red spheres so nice
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,daydream because the leash help is cool.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,foxsparks' flamethrower carried me in early game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"foxparks is good the whole game, if you do a little breeding and upgrade him, it will deal more damage than your shotgun, and it doesn't consume ammo!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,mossanda with the grenade launcher is too fun
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,combat is good to
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"one of my 1st pals was anubis. 2 of them carried me through much of the game, and really transformed my base. shadowbeak was another, and that one is still on the team."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,if you don't keep a chillet in your party for the whole entire game then me and you are not friends. embrace the giant ferret and noodle  that can walk
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,what pals did you start out with? casually nukes a lucky
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,"my first pals were chillet, daedream, celaray, tombat and warsect, was lucky to be able to buy off black marketeer"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,"one of my main starters was nox. if you unlock his special move, it adds shadow damage to your attacks, which is a good addition in early and mid game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-12,my first pal was a wierd dragon and was level like 50 or something he is pretty trash cant wait to get better pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-05,the way you boomed cattiva got me dying
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,u shooting the shiny cativa made me laugh cus the shiny cativa was my first catch
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-28,that cativa was just minding its business lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-19,"foxparks was great for warmth and the flamethrower. also loved using gale claw as a glider, its really fast and i can use it even when l lost all my gear."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,vanwyrm is my favorite pal. hes just so dang adorable and useful all the way to late game. i got super lucky and the first one i hatched had swift and runner for movement and vanguard and musclehead. i rode that same vanwyrm into battle against jetragon and won. this was before they updated to 55 or 60 though.
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-07,"great game , love it , been playing it since 19th of january, when it was first released"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,i had a dinossom walk into my base so i ganged up on it with my camp and used it for early game lumber and planting. plus its real strong
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-28,"chillet, daedream, liffmunk, and foxparks were favorites of mine."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,chillet and foxsparks are my main og
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-21,"celaray, i saw it and thought hmm thats adorable, i want it."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,"daedream is a pretty okay beginner pal. does decent damage for something in the early area, and the necklace allows you to stack them if you have multiple in the party"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-23,i love that chillet is commonly known as noodle now xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,"tombat or if your lucky u can find a nox early game, the lil guy adds dark dmg to all attacks"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,"early game rushoar for the fun mining to be had, bashing 3 nodes per reckless charge. then of course a vixy or three to boost your sphere count to 100 as you try to catch your first sleeping mammorest."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,friend you should get a mount me with with 4 grappling hooks and a glider weeeeeeeeee!
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,what pal did you start with? shoots rocket at cattiva
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-04,with rushroar you can zoom pretty fast using wreckless charge with sprinting mode
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"kelpsea, its not to far from the beginning area and generates pal fluid when you put in a ranch. pal fluid is needed for almost everything since its also a key ingredient in concrete and other recipes. stockpiling it is necessary"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,"oh damn, i didn't know a 3 star vixy drops mega spheres i should get on that! thank you"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-08,i started with a dream now i have a 2.0  cattiva that died at the endd of the video
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,first pal i found and kept was the encrima or something like that its over powered and cool looking it's red and black with a rib cage look they're the best pal in my opinion
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,foxsparks! cuz simply cuteness
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,wetnoodle willie...i get it ! lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,"the most slept on mount is one of the base mounts  direhowl  incubating him and upgrading his star level flat out boosts his move speed per tier, fierce fang is low key one of if not the best spammable unique mount skill. also using a certain skill learned from fruit on him you can access a instant base teleport exploit.. massive for dungeon farming."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,"syndicate grenadier was fun to use, even using him in the battle against mammoforest"
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-10,pengullet as your first waterer and then i use it to keep the food cool because he is smaller than chillet. plus if a fire pal sets your base on fire pengullets get to work to put out the fire. tanzee is my first grass type. cattiva too!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,tbh i figured out how to catch victor and shadow beak so that was one of the first pals i got
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-21,"tanzee, foxsparks, and nitewing are huge. tanzee just does a ton in the base and has a good weapon, foxsparks also has a crazy weapon, and njtewing is the obvious choice."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-16,"i see reshiram the palin the intro ,lapris without a shellchillet,evee,swadloon,oinkologne,and gouging fire the paradox form of entei"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-23,that look cool on each pal in different abilities
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,"starting out, tombat and lifmunk are the goats at base."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,always collect shines even if you dont want the pal and never get rid of high tier trait pals because you can breed the effect onto higher tier pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-20,aresox was like the third pal i've ever gotten because i found him in a thug camp
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,brooo the poor cat at the end
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,i started with cattiva and cheesed a dinosom. those were my starters
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-07,lamball g.o.a.t
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-11,i caught the wierd grassy goodra thing you find in the beginning it was my first pal i caught out of pure luck
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-11,i started with nitewing. i picked up a random sphere and tossed it at him when he landed
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,"a pal no one talks about but i have had on my team the entire game because of the usefulness is croajiro, his pal ability is so fucking useful early and hes got good attacks"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,im level 27 right now and i still have a foxparks on my team that i caught when i was like level 5 .
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-13,"started playing recently. my best palls curently are dinossom was wandering into my base tombat found it near my base too, two eikhtydeer male and female and lambal who just sits in my party."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-08,"as someone who goes by vixie, you best believe imma get a shiny vixy for my archery hunts."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-15,"i started with the basics of the 3, but when i got an egg, i started with dazzy, drazzy? that cloud flying electric pal"
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-21,"chillet, i love that ice noodle"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,could you do a video on best areas to explore as a beginner? the game doesnt make it clear what order the world is supposed to be explored in but clearly some areas have higher level pals by default
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,daydream. once you get the daedream collar you can have every daydream out. if you're going to kill and not to catch its op
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-27,"i would also like to add that in recent updates with vixy, it can now get more pal spheres. now at rank 4 it drops giga sphere's and at rank 5 it drops hyper spheres"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,tombat. i used the help of a wild deer.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,"i started with a lamball that i switched for a level 8 daedream, then i was able to get a bristla from a syndicate camp before getting my direhowl and nitewing that i used to miraculously nab a level 38 mammorest with a 0.03 chance on a mega sphere lol"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-10,lamball and chikipi. warmth and food was my only priority
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,"bro i started with a tombat, but now i have the strongest pals of each elements."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,"daedream. a literal death squad of daedream. sweet dreams, poacher dude."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,"yea, get the heatresistant pelt armor and hit up the turtle in the desert for mining. it's item headband will allow it to mine wonderfully when you use it. volcano has wixen, which is the perfect assembly line worker."
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-18,when you started with non of the ones he mentioned
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,spent forever fighting to capture that damn mammorest at the beginning. he absolutely steamrolls everything early game even with the level balancing
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,my best pal is mossanda lux i got him from a cage when the syndicate thugs were fighting a mammorest
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-09,"riding arsox keeps you warm!?!?! how did i... well i guess i'd need to ride it in order to figure that out. but wow, i've never heard people mention that before."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-03,"none i dont have the game, but i will save this for later when my time comes to get my first pal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,i immediately snagged a lil foxparks and a cremis as my first two
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,"new island 6x the size of sakurajima coming out, this game is far from dead."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,"palworld just announced they're gonna collab with terraria! also, yes, palworld is still a lot of fun!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-07,1 year later... jormuntide still chillin' on the roof lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-29,"for ps5 players, yes. i'm enjoying my time so far. this is ark  pokmon legends arceus, basically, so if you're a fan of both franchises, you will thoroughly enjoy it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,i stopped playing due to the inability to set preferences to pal actions. glad to see that massive oversight was fixed
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,"hope they improve npcs, like better settlements"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,just started playing this game yesterday. so far its a nice change compared to pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"this game if perfect. the only thing it needs is some plot story to give the feeling of purpose so you grind to laborate the island from hands of some evil bosses. and defeating one boss would give us location of the next one  some short story in type of text or cut scenes. like it was done in the old game digimon world 2. in dw2 you should also collect digimons, but your character works as one of protectors of the digital city where people live. and his job is to investigate and elimitate wild digimons and their bosses. moreover he can also participate in a tournament against his olleagues."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-07,been a year already? damn
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,as somebody who played at launch for a few months and enjoyed it for the most part my main questions are did they fix pal pathing to prevent them from getting stuck on literally everything and starving? did they noticably expand the base building system with more complex parts? my biggest issue with this game was that it was pointless to make any interesting base designs because the pals would just get stuck on everything and halt all production. and there wasn't very much you could do with the building regardless. compared to something like grounded which i've spent over 300 hours in
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-06,is pal world allowed to add evolutions as a feature without copyright issues? also for people alr playing is this a feature that would enhanceimmerse your experience further?
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,i just wanted to see your basebuild that was in the thumbnail. i already know palworld is always worth playing for me. that base looks cool!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-29,"loving the game since launch, can't wait to see the new update"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-29,"with the update in december coming with a new bigger island and on sale 24 yesh if you are digging the gameplay hell yeah, jf anyone waita too long the full release will could end up being 405060."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,this game is seriously a game i have dreamed about. i used to love ark but i mostly solo and that game is an absolute chore solo unless you crank up settings. i have also joked about how awesome an arkpokemon hybrid would be and this game is exactly that. im lv 47 and so far solo the game is very manageable. i do turn off weight limits but that's the only thing i really tweak. game is sooooo addictive.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,"if u enjoy a game yourself its always worth to play, no matter what happens or what others are saying"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,bro this video has a great timing. i havent played in over a year and was wondering if the game is worth playing as of dec 25 2024
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,"1,500 hours in the first 7 months, i quit when everyone's worlds started getting deleted. still love the game and will come back once it's fixed"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-08,"i just got back into palworld yesterday. im hoping to get a friend into it.  and nice base! i was feeling ready to sub, so i subbed."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-09,good to be here in 2025.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-04,what killed it for me is the performance. every server i've tried has near unplayable lag and it doesn't seem to be getting better.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,"why who else got this during the steam autumn sale? so far am loving this game cant wait for the next major update coming this christmas, hope they add more pals."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,"and hopefully even if we quit the game, your base still progress"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,"definitely buying this, looks amazing"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-24,"i played some time with gamepass, game is fun as hell but gets way better if you have someone else to play for sure"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,i need that outfit
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,what i would love for the devs to see to actually update the whole map to make it look more pleasing to actually explore and look at because i'm going to be honest while i can appreciate the fact that there are multiple biomes they all look extremely generic and bland for the most part.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"it was 1000000000000010, insanely fun for the first 5 hours. but then it hit me that there is just no real progression or story or path to do. i don't care about bigger islands and more pals  i want something more concrete to keep me playing, but maybe it's just me idk"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,"i mean, they say its a pokemon ripoff. but pokemon hasnt had a good game since they did the gameboyn64 crossover"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,i wish the mmo were designed like runescape without server wipe
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,oh its like pokemon legends thats a game but i like that but with benefits but online that would be a lot of fun with grinding with resources we have and your point
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-18,533 dude you know what else is massive
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,"i love the rpg aspects and like the crafting but im just not big on the focus on survival aspects, i just wished it focused more on the combat and progression, progression meaning progressing and building my character and my pals, i spend half my time between material gathering and micromanaging the survival aspects, i just dont find that fun"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"if ark is a combination between minecraft and rust, this game is simply ark, the only different thing is instead of dyno they use pokemon monster?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,i just bought
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,"so is this game survival craft, without the constant struggle and dread when playing forever alone?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-17,will there be a server cleanup after the update?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-04,"i am glad you and everyone else is enjoying the game! but how different is it compared to launch in terms of polish? also from what i experienced after playing through all the base content from launch, there does not seem much new content other than the new region. my thoughts is that gameplay can be jarring and not optimized properly, and the assets used are not pleasant. customization options for buildings and furniture are extremely lacking as well. having played other survival games such as subnautica and green hell, it does seem like a survivallite instead. there is no tension and challenge, but if the goal is a more cozy and casual game, nothing wrong with that. from your playtime, i assume you played on launch? if so, what is your opinion on the differences other than sakurajima?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,should i buy palworld or ark 2? i want an opinion from someone whos played both
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,i just bought it last week. i'm hooked. now how did you make your base so big?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-25,this is pokemon meets ark.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,"don't get me wrong, i enjoy palworld, but it still feels very incomplete to me. sort of empty i guess, even though there's pals literally everywhere"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,it's an amazing game it will never not be worth playing...i'm playing it again for the 3rd time in a year  good game is good.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,i would like to play i just have no money to buy it xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-14,i don't know. i'll let you know in 2025
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,"after toying with jet ragon and farmed legendary schematic, i decide to stop play palworld, and my friends decide to shutdown the server. i missed sakurajima update, so after i saw feybreak update, i decide to play again. asked my guildies in throne liberty, and we have 5 people with 1 dedicated server. so far it was an amazing experience, leveling up and fighting tower bosses. it's a survival game, people will take a break and returned later."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,yes
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,"does palworld have steam and pc game pass crossplay? my friends got it o steam and i have it free on my pc game pass, so im wondering if we'd be able to play it together?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,why bleep out pokemon ?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,yes
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,titlestill worth playing in 2025 uploaded 2024
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,how you got that outfit man

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,408 hahaha they copied rust on that one
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,it so dumb i havent play in like 10months and play multiplayer and cant even build a base cause its full.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-01,which platform is best? ps5 or steam?
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,"como que un ao despus si el juego sali en enero, espera a decir un ao despus cuando hagan la actualizacin pertinente, por cumplir verdaderamente un ao en enero de 2025."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,2024.. or 2026? lmao 714
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-08,short answer no possible answers no best answer no
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"i think the real issue they faced was the lawsuit, made everyone realize how hobbled together and plagiarized that game really is"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-08,"i have 72 hours in this game and it is fun but so grindy, i wish there were more game settings customization"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-14,what do you mean is it still worth playing... its not even complete
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,still worth playing? it's not even out yet.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,"wow, i was right. this game is dogshit."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,300 hours in palworld and 95 of it was before the first major patch. i only stopped because i was going to spoil the game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,foxparks also keeps you warm so your hp doesnt drain from cold.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"breath of the pokmon, guns a blazing slave simulator might be the best thing thats happened since they invented the spork"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,for your first tip i would recommend putting them by a bunch of ore for a farm instead of just anywhere for fast travel
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,you always keep one palbox free so you can fast travel from wherever you are back to your base and then you just open up the map and dismantle it from there and get all the resources back in your inventory
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,bro kanji caught all the pals he needed for the start of the game to have faster results also making workbenches around the work you can instant travel from island
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,"foxparks is my favorite, i even got the variant that gets you two free freezes, and helps you survive at the volcano by cooling you down."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,also you can get dream chaser with a necklace its just an extra pokemon out at one time
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"another great tip is to get nitewing asap and get the saddle forit at level 15, you can get pretty much anywhere pretty quick, its also pretty good in battle"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,the tanzy holding a assault rifle brought back blood diamond vibes with leonardo dicaprio  they stole it from that movie
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,you can go into game settings before entering your world and change things like exp rate pal appearance rate etc you can change the depletion of stamina and eating as well
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,veexy is the best palsphere generator
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,if you run and then slide down a hill then jump and activate the glider you'll travel much faster. press and hold dodge while running to slide.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,from this point on i started crying hahahahahahahahah 3109 you really brought it full circle asf lmao worth the sub  like 100
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-01,these are the kinds of tips you'd find in an ign article.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-23,this new pokemon is cool looking!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,note for most of these you have to level up if youre a freshie but fear not! just go capture or kill as much palls  do all the challenges you can do off the start.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,this game is fkn awesome
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-29,i just got this game yesterday on ps5. it's the best game i've played lol i can't get over the nostalgic feeling but being able to do what i want
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,max 3 bases i think so use them wisely if you want a permanent base there
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"ark survival meets pokemon, and my inner child is happy about it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,i just started today and i honestly wish i knew that fast travel hack ahead of time lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,a fire type also keeps you warm in cold climates
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-22,"another good tip is to catch jetragon when you unlock the giga sphere, a great flying mount!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,okay real tips over here ur second base definitely recommend it just be for getting iorn an food mane base for me was a little bit of everything
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-19,one of the best games i have ever played.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-19,"fire mounts keep you warm in frozen areas and provide light in cavesdungeons. you don't need to place pal boxes all over the map considering there are fast travel points all over the map. more pal boxes will give you a ton of lag and rendering issues. remember everyone, the game is early access which is basically alpha testing phase. we bought the game so the developer gets paid for us to test it for them and pay for their legal fees. i love this game though."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"nah first things first, get the feeding loop figured out with the berry plots so its autonomous and you dont have to fuck with it anymore"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-25,foxparks is so op if you wanna get a chillet. just make the harness. flamethrower the chillet for a couple of seconds until he reaches 100 then just spam pal spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"put a palbox in nearby resources so your pal can harvest and mine for it, it helps out transferring between main bases and the resource bases"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-12,"what i gather from this is to catch 4 types of pals, grass monkey, penguin, a skiddish cat, and a fire fox."
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-20,"good for early game. wixen, anubis, penking and digtoise are easy to obtain before 20"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-24,hearing is also a great light source when stuck in the dark after i just got stuck and died in a cave
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,tip 6escape from any red japanese company with a plumber mascot
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,its basically mixture of minecraft pokemon and gta
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,"tip 6 catch an foxparks as fast as you can, foxparks can also help you when your cold if you dont have any types of warmth"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,"vixy in a ranch since the dig here ability will get u pal balls, coin and arrows"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,"also, catch sweepa and a team of swee, have a mid game build early game is really good"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-17,nice tips bro
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,wow. these are great 5 tips!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,"pokemon, fortnite, digimon,...? what a weird amalgamation. but it is indeed, art at heart"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-22,i see a lot of people saying to crouch slide then glide. i find it's more effective to use your grappler then glide. it's faster and you can do it almost anywhere.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"use base set ups for material farming, there's plenty of fast travel spots"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-01,best tip as soon as you start go catch jetagon
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,i thought this was a pokmon mod at first
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,tanzee reminds me of that old orangutan meme who holds and shoots ak
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-05,"early game tips catch vixys and ranch them asap! they are around the small settlement and desolate church areas. also go into your world settings. crank the meteorite supply drop down to 1. this will make them drop down every minute to get free oil, pal spheres etc. also they drop those little bottle things. each bottle is worth 20k at a merchant! great way to make money fast!!!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-07,btw guys dont make the first parachute its not worth to much stam it wont really take you anywheee
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,you can also use them as an assault rifle  that killed me. i laughed so hard i choked
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,very great info tyvm. i need a tanzee.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-22,"place multiple all over the map yeah, like its that easy"
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-20,sounds like a joke but its actually good starter tips lmaooo
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,tysm im new to this game so tysm
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,i say get pals that focus on one thing is better. ruchboar is good for beginner stone and the deer is good for wood. get the monkey for planting berries and get the water seal to water them snd make stone into paldium. tococo is also very good but flamethrower is more beginner friendly
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"you can only place down 1 palbox. up to 3 aa you progress. lifmunks have the same skills as tanzee, and they are cuters."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,"some more tips get nitewing asap and craft saddle for it. flying pal that doesnt loose stamina over water is a necesity even if itbis quite slow. catch many melpacas. they sell for around 400500 cash each on black market. you can farm money eassily this way. get vixy. they re super easy to catch and they can work on a ranch where they dig spheres, gold and arrows. make walls out of campfires to defeatweaken bosses easily early game. especially mammorest. dont bother catching beegard early game. you can buy it from most blackmarketers. wild ones will kamikaze you dealing huge damage whille they also get offed. catch elizabee instead abd breed it with dinossom. you wont regret it!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,setup bases at metal and coal quickly
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"penguin, cat, fox, monkey and jellyfish are my faves"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-28,i just started playing this game yesterday and was the first about 15 minutes i realize that its way better than the pokmon games lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i condensed lambballs into five stars and it does 40,000 damage"

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,my man made mutton in 0.5 seconds.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-28,if you want to get a pal with a gun early game use lifmunk instead of tanzee because lifmunk lets you aim and shoot while tanzee has stormtrooper aim
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,fox spark is my best pal rn
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,btw u can get an army of daedream with the necklaces
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,tip 6 always remember to butcher pals you dont need at the moment cause they just fill up the palbox
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-25,thinking of buying this
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,pokemon breath of the ark is so great i hope they keep adding more.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,anyone remember that video of the chimp that someone gave a ak47 to?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,"vixy in a ranch gives you spheres, arrows and coins. at 3 star they occasionally drop mega spheres."

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,"when i first played, i didnt want to move to far from spawn, so i put my pal box right next to spawn, then i discovered warping. i was like great, i can now warp 3 feet, warping would literally take longer because they are so close."

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"as much of a mess it can be at times, ive had more fun playing palworld than any recent pokmon games."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"one of my facorite features of palworld that i wish other survival games would adopt, is that if you place resources in a container within the border of your base you can access those resources from any crafting table in the base."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"this is a waaaaay better experience than most of the shovelware survival crafting games on steam. as long as it isn't permanently in early access, and doesn't get abandoned, i'll be happy with it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,nintendo is that not a black lucario? lawyer naw..thats anubis.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"being able to ride , swim or fly on a mount and still be able to attack or catch pals while on the mounts is a overlooked kudos."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,they really have a gold mine in their hands right now. if they keep the content coming and really flesh out this game its going to be incredible
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"if pokemon addressed the void in the gaming market then palworld wouldn't exist because wants and needs from within the market would have already been properly met. but pokemon did not address the void in the market, so palworld addressed it for them. i hope palworld continues to be an example of what happens when you neglect the market and allow competitors to do a better job than you. palworld deserves every bit of success that it's getting."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,whos here after ps5 release?
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"the devs are hiring. immediately after palworld's release, i saw in their news that they're looking to bring on new members into their company. that speaks loads on them wanting to make sure this game gets the development it deserves!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"30hrs in so far. i like the small details they added like before a fire pal goes to sleep, it will go around my base and light all the torches for the night. some of it is comical like seeing a tiny fluffy pal defend a base with an assault rifle. all around crazy and fun game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i'm not usually a fan of survialesque games, but this game is addictive. it hits all the right things in my brain, progression, open world, heavy on crafting, but perhaps the biggest thing for me is the pals!! so adorable, and the fact that they can help you in your base instead of just being there is toptier."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"when jake said he isn't info survival games normally but this one got him hooked, i felt that something about it doesn't feel as boring as other survival ark types especially with friends"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"as a pokemon fan, i can confirm that this game has achieved what game freak should have accomplished a long time ago, and i'm really enjoying it."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,i seriously hope gamefreak takes note and starts to deliver top quality games. this early access game is in much better shape than scarletviolet was.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,one thing i really appreciate in this compared to pokemon is that every single pal actually has full and mostly unique animations for all of their attacks which for me adds so much to the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"built a base near the giant elephant boss  he stumbled in at level 18, killed most of my pals, but i ended up catching him 17 levels early  its pretty solid for an early access."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,palworld is what happens when you mix nostalgia with a bit of insanity. and i'm totally here for it!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,i'm so glad to finally see a game that's exploding but also fun! definitely a breathe of fresh air.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,palworld has so much potential. i hope the developers don't get lazy and screw this one up.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"so heres my take and perspective. i came across palworld through a friend after its release as he described it as pokemon with gunsmore like pokemon with survival which is intriguing and surprising that nintendo hasnt jumped on this themselves cause the people clearly want it. going into it i thought the game looked familiar and came to realize the developers also developed craftopia breath of the wild clone not a bad game but when comparing it to palworld its just not as put together. it would seem that palworld has received more love and has more intricate features even in early access. it also gives a very comforting feeling reminiscent of playing games as a kid. this mindless excitement. whats there is good but definitely needs to be fleshed out in the long run. my main concern is that both palworld and craftopia are both in early access. i wish theyd finish what was on one plate to solidify the core gameplay, identity, and world a bit more. but im no game developer. palworld is definitely the most exciting survival game in my library currently. it definitely has some faults and buggy moments but is definitely worth supporting. looking forward to its growth and full release"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,pokeark of the wild is pretty fun. pretty clean for an alpha as well.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"i've never been a fan of pokemon and i still don't play those games, but i absolutely love this game. palworld is so dope"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"despite the jank and bugs, the gameplay loop is addictive."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,wow. he did not even mention the best feature capturing humans!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"something i love about the game is the combat and party building. in pokemon only the active pokemon really fights and they all generally do the same thing. in palworld they can all have beneficial abilities to help on the adventure. pokemon sorta tried this with hm moves, and then later just gave up on that."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"it's great because it takes all the extra boring stuff out. if your materials are in any chest in your base, you can use them to craft at any station. if you want to fast travel, there's no animation, just touch a statue you already touched, and you can instantly travel. there's no pick up animation. just gameplay. such a satisfying game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,this game is fire. pokemon shouldve been at this point already. all this game need is a fire story and pokemon is history
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,"palworld scratches the itch that og pokemon gamers have been wanting for so long. there's so much potential here, and the fact that it's not limited to dated hardware like the switch is huge too."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"i love how my pal will look for stuff to work on when we get back to base. a stupid thing, but i enjoy little things like that."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,palworld is what i was hoping the direction that pokmon would take after legends arceus. it's also saving me from breaking and buying the ark upgrade. palworld hits all the same notes with better automation in my bases. just an allround fun weird pokemon knockoff.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"this game came out of no where for me, my first impression going in was a meme , expected to play not more than an hour and now 20 hours, im hooked. i love pokmon and now i love pals as well. game has great potential and i am looking forward to it!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,"i was skeptical of palworld at first, but after starting my playthrough of it, i've come to love it! there are so many features i wish pokemon had, that i can explore and play with in palworld  that being said, i still also love pokemon too 3"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i love how well animated the pals are and how diverse their actions are. the sanity mechanic also adds more depth. tons of stuff to do, collect, and craft. it's varied and well paced enough that it rarely gets dull. i hope some good story content gets added later down the line and of course there's been some bugs, but i can't really complain so far."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"i think its plenty interesting. if you stop thinking about what it copies and just immerse yourself in it, it becomes its own thing. im greatly enjoying exploring the world, slowly building up my base, meeting all the pals one at a time. its funny cause if you stop caring about which pokemon they imitate the pals begin to shine."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,"a fleshed out story with missions, small boats, cities and combat arenas would sell me completely."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"the thing i love the most about this is they nailed the pokemon type open world game i was wanting. the survival aspect makes it even better, you can fight alongside your mons, there are bosses and dungeons. and also youre incentivised to catch them all because you can use the additional pals to upgrade existing ones. every pal has a use in your bases as well. its the perfect formula."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"when you're enjoying a game but has many harsh things to say about it, it means you're hooked and you want the company to do better and succeed! you described how i feel about this game well. palworld has a bright future as long as they keep working on it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i think if you want to see palworld as what it is, you should see the dev's previous game, craftopia. because that game pretty much follows the same idea, it might even be the seed that makes palword possible. palword and craftopia feels like a game that a kid dreamed of imagine combining breath of wild, fortnite and dayz then someone actually put it the effort to actually make it. it's like turkey curry on boxing day, it was made with leftovers. it shouldn't work, but somehow it works, and it was delicious. i really wanted to see how the devs take it from here"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"i really hope the pokmon company cant sue and ruin this game. wayy better than pokmon, their games have been extremely babified and stale for about a decade"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,has a ton of potential and is well worth the price for the early access. yes it has some rough edges as it should be with early access but for what is and what it will hopefully grow into its off to a great start. really enjoying it so far.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"i think this game will improve drastically over the year, considering its only been out for a week and i doubt the developers were expecting such a massive reception im sure theyll have the money to make a full story inside and much more"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i definitely hope they flesh out the story and npcs in a future content update. a main story quest and side quests with named npcs to interact with would go a long way towards making the game feel complete. the gameplay loop is solid, just needs bugfixes and polishing. with all the money they've made, i hope they expand the team a little bit and go nuts with steady updates. if so, this game will become huge."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,the more realistic style of the environment kind of contrasts with the style of the creatures but the gameplay itself looks kinda fun
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"my overall opinion, i think this has the potential to be a game that we needed. whether it's from the source of inspiration or from this developer that had the balls to gather the most successful elements of popular games, this is already a great start. my first impression was ark with pokemon, and it already has the advantage of local servers that don't tether everyone to the host biggest roadblock to playing casual with friends in ark."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"see this is what games companies keep on missing that palworlds got right. it's fun! and lots of freedom, the game is cheep and so fun with friends"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,319 daedream gets hit by arrow. also daedream smiles and waves.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-02,whos coming back to this now that its on playstation?
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"i think the game taps into what people actually want from games fun. it's not about the lore, worldbuilding, voice acting, story, graphical fidelity, etc. in a way, i think it's the simplicity that makes games like these succeed. it presents you with a very simple gameplay loop that you do again and again. in return, it rewards you with incremental feelings of accomplishment every step of the way. if i had to pick a single element of why most people don't complete most games, it's because their progression systems don't offer that. if you truly felt your own growth in a step by step way in a lot of these other failed games, i think they would be very successful. it's a simple psychological thing that i don't think many developers understand."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,ive fell under the map so many times but other than that and a saving glitch every now and then ive loved this game so much and i normally play shooter fast paced games
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i was very suspicious of it, but i've been really enjoying it. to me it doesn't feel cheap. the pals are well thought out and really carry the game. there are interesting combos and they seem to have personality and there are a lot of them. palworld seems to combine what i like in multiple games in to one."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,okay ps5 team lets watch that befor you buy after buying the game xd you know the drill
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"a lot of things certainly feel like they have just being frankenstein'd in, but the game does feels and plays decently and certain systems are well fleshed out. hopefully they try to elaborate more on storying tellingbuilding within the game so there is more cohesion. i'm having fun regardless, it's different."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"this game caught me really off guard. my expectations going into it were low, but man is it addicting. it checks off so many boxes for me and is straight up just fun, with friends or grinding solo. i haven't played a game you just want to grind all day and when you get off, you think about it since jedi fallen order. i know its early to call this my game of the year, but this has been a pleasant surprise"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"me i sure wish i could find a video with just some straight up gameplay, maybe even some first impressions. youtube youre gonna love this"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-19,"i used to get annoyed when new games are compared to older, more popular games. but i've since realized that it makes it easier to understand what a game is like for someone that hasn't played it yet."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"i spent hours farming crops, chopping trees, and mining stones. all it accomplished is make me want to play farming sims. so i ended up trying story of seasons and coral island instead. much more my speed."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"playing it on gamepass and loving it so far, only have played about 3 hours though."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"before you buys are the best reviews out there, you always tell us exactly what we need to know about games, that's a great service thx fam"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,ive wanted this kinda game ever since i knew what pokmon was. i shedded tears when i opened up the game and saw the graphics knowing that this was as close as my dream would be made reality. and this is still just the beginning. i cant wait to see what happens next.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,i have to imagine that 90 of the player base are in their 30s like me and have finally been given the pokemon game we've all been waiting for our whole lives! i've had to do my whole work day on 0 hours sleep because i couldn't get off palworld. i absolutely love it
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,looks like it could have a lot of potential. a game you dont take too seriously and just chill and play. they seriously need to improve that melee combat though! that single move of prodding enemies with a stick looks like it will get tedious very quickly lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i think, although unfinished, the concept of this game works. it takes so many good ideas and makes them work and fit into a pretty nice gameplay loop. it definitely feels like there's supposed to be more behind this game and i really hope to see it fleshed out and finished"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"the thing with this game is it caters to those who aren't big survival game fans. i love survival games, but compared to ark, rust ect the grinding in palworld is fairly light, that comes down to the pals helping. this game could be huge, it's just where they go from here. either way, i'll be here for the ride."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"my favorite part of this game is when you gathering woodstone. we went from catching colorful wild animals and forcing them to fight, to catching them and forcing them to do manual labors, work on plantations and then forcing them to fight. it's only a matter of time before they add a way for pok i mean pals to go on a strike."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,is it just me or does palworld feel like the pokmon game we all secretly wanted as kids?
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"ive played ark, ive played pokmon red and blue only thou. 7 days to die and many others. being able to make your pals work and see them relax in a hot tub, or sleep underwater yes its broken in places but endearing. my partner who has played every pokmon game is just happy as can be to play a pokelike game and we are for sure going to catch all we can. make sure you get to breeding them, and breeding different types together for new results. it does feel hollow without a story but the opening cinematic makes me feel like they know, and plan to do more later on. we will play it to  pal em all then put it down for a year and come back to hopefully something more amazing. but sales figures dont lie, this is what many fans of various genres have been looking for. happy gaming.."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,i love that you can set your own parameters for your world. some people say this game is too easy. they must not realize they can make it more challenging. they just must love complaining instead of challenging themselves.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"one thing to note, in multiplayer if you join others, it seems that it is separate from your single player even if you select multiplayer character. its a totally separate character. idk if it was mentioned."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,i love this game so much. catching pals feels so good. it plays very well and the fact there isnt a cash shop helps a ton too.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i am someone who never got into pokmon as a kid because my parents thought it was weird. i wanted to get into it since they released the more open world games shield was my first game but as i played shield and violet, they just kinda sucked dont get me wrong i loved the aspect of catching pokmon but palworld has totally given me what i was looking for from pokmon. its ironically a breath of fresh air"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"i was skeptical at first, got it for me and my kiddo to play. i honestly am having a blast on it more than i should be lol."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"i've been waiting for a pokmon game similar to this since the n64. i'm enjoying it so far, and i hope it's a success."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i'm genuinely impressed with palworld being as good as it is when all anyone expected it to be was a meme game. it's just genuinely such a fun game, and even if it's more like ark and other survival games than pokemon itself it's pretty hilarious that the pals have more personality than the recent pokemon games and actually have 'high quality animations' like pokemon supposedly has."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"this game is addicting, me and my buddies have been spending days on this game and were only a little under halfway complete"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,people comparing this to pokemon really need to learn about a little game franchise called dragon quest monsters. the concept for battling and capturing monsters to work alongside you came in 1992 before pokemon and then became what palworld basically is in 1998. this game is more closely related to that than pokemon.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i freaking love it, yes it's lore, a story line to follow, and a few convenience of life upgradesbut keep in mind it's early access and has a ton of potential! even with those missing pieces this game is still great! i haven't been addicted to a game let alone a pc game in a long time! solid 810for the time being"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"im excited to see how this game continues to be built. a whole lot of potential and considering its only 60 done, im hoping the rest is doing what you talked about, connecting all of those puzzle pieces together. i think a proper story to fill out the massive world would be awesome and help fix a bunch of those criticisms. some tweeking would be nice and im sure we will probably get more pals too. right now, the game is fun to play but im curious how much replayability they plan on adding because i can see a big burnout happening until the next big update and people come back and then burnout again and that keep happening until the game is finished."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,this game is very buggy. but im addicted. this is my childhood and my adulthood and im in love and excited for the future of this game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,"this is what future pokemon game should look like. being a pokemon trainer is more than just capturing monsters and battling. despite game freak being a multi billion dollars company, their recent game's graphics and gameplays hasn't seen much upgrade at all."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,looks pretty sick! still a little too early accessy for my taste but i'm excited to see how the game evolves over time and will probably pick it up once it has a few more updates under its belt
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i'm really enjoying it so far. it scratches several itches i've had in wanting a game that does one of the things this game does. is it fleshed out in each category i like? no, but it combines them in a way that's fun. also the exploration with friends is great. i love going through dungeons and finding things in the open world, getting distracted by one collectible after the other, never getting to my goal, always getting sidetracked."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,lol so glad you mentioned depresso. he's definitely my spirit animal.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"i've been seeing a ton of mention online. just finished the free preview, and i'm impressed. it has plenty of similarities yet differences from all the games it has been compared to to set it apart. i'm not a huge survival game fan and definitely not a pokmon fan but this game itched a scratch that no game has since i first played minecraft. i appreciate your review. it gave me additional insight on what to expect if when i decide to buy it. i would also add that the price is very reasonable. some games that have had a typical 60 price on release have been a buggy mess and dont quite deliver on expectations. your mention of the less finished aspects don't bother me much considering it is prerelease . overall, it seems this game has had so many comparisons in part because it is somewhat unique. so far it seems to deserve the recognition it is receiving. fingers crossed the development team is able to keep their vision in mind as they move towards release and deliver the awesome experience they have shown off thus far."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,for me it just needs a good story. it can survive without one but a good story will take it into the stratosphere.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,i feel exactly the same way. feels like it has no soul sometimes but god damn is it addicting. i love survival and crafting and exploration. the pals are a plus
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"competition a lot of times is a good thing. pokmon was to dominant in this space and did what they liked, competition will help expand grow this genre of gaming."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"i'm thinking it's popular because it targets the younger demographic which is often overlooked within the game industry. that would explain why such a mundane game is so popular, i'm sure there are some older people who like games like this as well and i would probably find it mildly entertaining. sometimes a chill game like that can be pretty welcome too."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,i agree it needs a lore. a story some quests and side quests more towns and npcs to interact with. i don't have much of a need to venture out other than to get that higher lvl pal.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"im still shocked and impressed at how a game that started out as a meme game upon first reveal turned out to be such a complete banger to play. i legot had more fun in this game than any triple a title thats come out.except for mhwi, that will always be the greatest!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"i very rarely leave comments, but when you said talk about palworld in a year and if nintendo sued them into the dirt you had me rofl. thanks for all your before you buy videos!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,you know the real irony? the pocket pair ceo used to work at nintendo to some extent. and both nintendo and pocket pair hqs are both close by to each other.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,early game boy pokemon game starting a character you cant go into the bushes without a pokemon this game fuck it. doom music
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"around level 15 or so progress started to slack off. but there are world options, and you can give a slight multiplier in xp to keep progress increasing steadily. world settings are very much derivative of ark, however there are a few options i think the game could add, such as a slider that lets you increase the frequency of raids which currently seems pretty rare."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"im kind of hoping its closer to 50 or lower done cause, yes its huge, but i would love to see the whole level of complexity this game has the potential to have. its already deeper than pokemon in terms of the relationship between the player and creatures. id love to see it go even further. also there definitely needs to be way more human involvement in the world that makes the whole factions and designs more convincing"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-29,"whether ppl like pw or not. i gotta say it's pretty dope pocket pair actually give game freak and pokemon some competition. competition is as healthy in gaming as it is with anything else. competition drives progress. so palworld might be constructive for pokemon. doesn't mean the products will become better automatically. we have far to many examples of the opposite. but still. i also think it's cool that a small studio are able to actually make a billion dollars worth studio..which happens to be one of the most popular franchises ever.. to show their claws. no matter if i like them or not, i always nod in respect for that. all in all though, i don't think palworld is an existential threat to pokemon as a brand or on any other lvl at all. nor will it ever be."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,it's just weird how good it is. it's still super janky  souless but there's a lot interesting ideas  mechanics that are addictive. it has so much potential that i hope gets realized.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"its pokmon arceus capturing zelda botw graphics, climbing, gliding, fast travel points  ark survival guns, building and technology tree"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,palworld is the game nobody asked for but it is the game we craved for
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"palworld is absolutely the best early access game to release in years. and yes, it may be a bit lifeless at times, but i think, in five years, you won't recognize it from all the new content and features that get added. they've already released a couple quality of life updates, which speaks volumes about the devs. i have very high hopes for this one, as so far is combined all the elements from my favorite survival games and improved on most. as far as being a pokmon ripoff, it's just not. if anything it's a spoof of pokmon."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"i really love the game so far. i am surprised with how much there is on early access. the map is big and i enjoy exploring and finding eggs, effigies sp?, treasure chests and of course new pals. i believe with the success of this game, they will hopefully pour more love into this game and by that i mean really give us more and more to a perfect full fledged out game by next year. i am looking forward to all the new stuff coming in the future."

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"i might've missed it when you were talking about ancient technology points... but i found a pretty easy way to stock up on them quickly. do a dungeon, don't pick up or mine anything, kill the boss and grab the two chests at the teleporter. when you exit, turn around and go back into the dungeon. run through to the exit teleporter, there will be two more chests. rinse, repeat... you can usually do this 4 times or so, but i stop at 3 to make sure the timer doesn't run out and close the dungeon when i leave. on the 3rd time through, go ahead and mine and pick up mushrooms or whatever, go ahead and get that other chest that you have been skipping. most of the time there will be 3 of each thing because it just spawns items on top of items that you left behind on those other run throughs. now you have 3x as many chances of getting good stuff, including ancient tech and tech points."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,i would recommend also using orserk in ur party while farming pal fluids doe to his pasive skill u get more pal fluids wich also increases when he is a 234 star
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-07,these are the types of tips i love. i've seen one that allows you to be super strong early on and for me it defeats the enjoyment that i would experience as i go through the journey.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,"1934 ah yes, my favorite pal, germantide ignis. jk dude, nice vid"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-30,"if you have a pal that you really love and don't want to accidently sell or butcher, give it a name."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"imma watch this whenever i start slowly down on progress, thank you very much for the tips!!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-07,"supply drops kinda break skill points, so you don't need to be as stingy with your points. i have mine spread out and i'm actually above where your hp and carry weight were at in this vid. seems an update is in order! also, due to multiclimate undershirt 1 along with any armor above metal, you no longer have any weakness to cold or heat, which completely nullifies this tip. save up 100 dog coins and become immune to the rest of the game as early as level 10. who needs switching when you never have to switch to begin with?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,"nowadays, unsure when it got added, for tip 39 theres a passive trait on pals that have the same effect as the mercy ring, which would make your pals unable to lower enemies under 1 hp. a good negative passive to have when capturing pals. the mercy ring is also active when youre riding a pal and use its active skills, meaning that you'll leave enemies down to 1 hp as long as youre riding the pal. slight thing you need to watch for however, dot will still do damage."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,don't overbuild your base i hear as i move my overbuilt base from the starting spawn
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,some of these tips are mildly inaccurate now but are still all applicable in some capacity such as catching 10 pals for xp is now 12 pals. amazing video. succinct  empowering.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,this is a great video! thanks for making it
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,selling nails no longer gives you a ton of gold
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"here is a tip, if you use killarmari as a glider you can actually glide infinitely if you disable it and glide again every few seconds. it actually goes higher each time so you never run out of gliding time and can basically fly with it."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-06,wish there was copy paste base system that lets you just pack up and place your base down wherever without having to destroy it and make 200 trips back and forth due to carry weight.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-01,if your grinding pal captures you can use a pal with mercy hit so whatever they attack won't go under 1hp
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,"great tips, thanks a lot  i'm sure most of them are still usable today so that's very helpful for a newcomer like me currently lvl 35."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-29,"one added update, you can now get pal fluid by having kelpsea in the ranch."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,558 pressing tab on keyboard opens your inventory directly instead of the options menu
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-25,"hey man, really appreciated the video learn some stuff that im gonna utilize, any pointers on being able to make the legendary pal spears at a quicker rate. i got all the level two crafters like the final tier stuff, im having issues getting the materials"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-16,the amount of times i've had to put up the gamma at night to see anything xd foxsparks is a nice tip
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,for traveling use a grapple hook with hangyu until you get jetdragon since hangyu floats up when you use it as a glider you can fly longer
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-18,"another tip that i found useful for the stairs is when you want smaller steps right in front of your build. often we need lil half steps or whatever because pals can't climb and will get stuck. i hit the switch build mode button. i think its r2 or l2 on playstation but when you hit that it lines the stairs up with the height perfectly fit to it. sometimes i build the foundation high, sometimes medium and this greatly help me with adding the steps to it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-02,"thanks, had the game in my library since day 1 but just started playing"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-12,357 when you hit a certain level in the 20s you can unlock a hip lantern
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-26,why is your jetragon black and red?
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-23,i normally dont leave a comment but dude you rock !! great tips
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-06,i just adjusted the multipliers in the game settings and finished the game in a week. had fun
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-12,"i had beegarde in base and after every single raid, when i checked paldeck only she turned out to be dead. i thought she may be just very terrible at fighting but then i realized she had bee quiet xd"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-24,i found a shiney celibythe sting ray once and had it down to half health. i alsed my dad to help and he killed it
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,hi from the future. he is correct about the playstation controllers. which is freaky!
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,"i personally put my stat points in health and damage. damage seems pontless, but you definitely do a ton more damage with those points on"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,i appreciate you making this video. i just started and have been blindly trying to make my camp work. the food tip is especially helpful as i've been unintentionally killing my daedream camp pal as the food i've been giving them red berries has no san bonus.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,nails dont work anymore been updated
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,"foxspark will also keep you warm at night if you're just starting out, and you don't have any clothes yet."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-18,"another tip is, if u are in a cold place at night and dont have a kitsun u just need a torch because heats up when held it worked for me because kitsun just spaw at night"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-06,"i'm really loving this new update. i love this game!!,"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,"the ring of mercy also affects mounts while you are riding them. it's particularly helpful if you have a mount with stun or freeze abilities. for anyone who is unfamiliar, the ring of mercy gives the player mercy hit which prevents their straight damage from reducing the target below 1hp. damage over time like poison or burn can still kill the target."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,thank you for your effort! there are many tips that i didn't know about.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,a lot of good tips in the video for beginners but now kind of outdated because they added a lot of new features and pals that improve farming and fighting. would love to see a new updated video
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-14,this is gold!!! thank you!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-06,take note bring rank 4 katress when killing and capturing toco toco and your gunpowder willl flooding 2117
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-29,i like how you include playstation controls when palworld isnt on playstation yet. it gives me hope
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-15,good to know that movement passives dont effect glider pals. definitely didnt spend the last 2 days trait hunting and breeding yakumos for perfect movement to make the galeclaw process easier. got 3 tiers in. condescending definitely boosts it so worth it i guess.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,i just realized 6 months ago you knew the controls for playstation lol. are you a wizard harry?
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,"tip 101 do no use lifmunk effigies because catch rates are not working as intended, if you level up, it will reduce your catch rate, that's why you get less catch rate in late game, even with low level pals"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,"for the lifmunk effigy's you can just use the palworld interactive map, it is very accurate."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-17,"841 you can't still do that at the start, right? or just not on singleplayer? or am i missing something?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-02,"i think overall lackey is better than the 20 type specific damage boost like flame emperor or divine dragon... for a 5 drop in type specific dps you get a 15 buff to all damage instead. before i had access to legend i bred for luckey 15 damage 15 work speed musclehead 30 attack 50 work speed ferocious 20 attack hooligan 15 attack work speed 10 it was very easy to breed out hooligan for legend. i did breed an army with legendmuscleheadferocioustype specific 20 boost but it turns out i only really use them for bella noir. my most used annubus gets the most use because it is neutral to almost all the end game bosses and they love putting electric attacks on fire bosses or ice attacks on dark types... so in a lot of cases using the type that is strong against the boss is actually a bad idea. ammo you need to start making metal in bulk well before you can ever use it. the metal is the pacing item, gunpowder is easy. i've never ever bought any ammo and i have thousands of rockets and bullets. if it takes more than 500 rounds to kill something you're using the wrong pals or weapons. when you produce ammo only ever keep a set amount of rounds on you and keep the rest in your basenever stop producing ammo even if you don't need it. every time you go to your base that produces ammo make ammo even if you don't need itsame with metal. the game gives you the materials you need for production long before you can produce weapons or bullets because by the time you can produce it you should have a massive backlog of the required materials."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"i dont know if its an update since you posted, but you can get palfluid from ranching kelpsea."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,just started out manage to catch a alpha chillet and made a saddle for it
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-15,you can open the inventory with the tab key
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,bro didn't know about custom markers until he nearly beat the game. lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-19,thanks!
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-29,with the ability to make up to 10 bases now the build a nice base in the location you want is kind of important but also... kinda not as important but still make sure it's a base location you actually want to keep before building up too much.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,just need a way to get pals to put certain things in certain chests without putting multiple of one thing in several slots
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-10,damn this is good
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-24,for capturing pals you also can use ring of mercy
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,144 lol if you're on playstation
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-23,btw you can farm pal fluids now with i think a kelpsea or something like that i forgot its name
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,definitely use the marker function for trees!

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-25,still very relevant info!! thank you!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,this is good advice for me when i finished the game 100 xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-02,i'm convinced that people are just either illiterate don't choose to read markers are literally told to you in the map press e to place them
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-09,and passive skills like swift etc. do have a effect on glider pals but the differrence is so slim it is not worth it
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-20,great vid ty
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-22,1124 ironic when you consider the clip used was a lvl 47 vs a lvl 23. . .

Survival,Palworld,2024-10-16,this is completely off topic but i eas watching this to pass the time while playing the game i was new so i was fighting chillet and i tried catching it for shits and giggles it was low but not much low and i still ca7ght it
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,what kind of jetragon was that
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,"when i fight the dungeon bosses, i dont get no ancient technology points"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,"want a real tip? when building up due to lack of space, be sure you build stairs 3 x 3 x 3 size going up as this will prevent pals from getting stuck and also allow bigger ones to go to top floor jormuntide boss will still have problems. there is more than just poision and frozen that increase catch rate. on fire or wet will also increase the chance and same goes for grass skill that rots the enemy into place. some short dragon skill can cause cause pals to burn on fire. the best way to farm palfluids early game is to visit starting areas islands not all are great and just run araund on your mount and 1 shot low lvl water pals with crossbow or short pal skill. super tip there is a chest in game that can give you pretty much any endgame gear  location however is secret and i will not tell you that. bonus is you dont need to use any keys."

Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,the number of potential breeding partner combinations in this game just floors me. i'm far too used to pokemon's limited breeding feature.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,jormuntides would be good if they werent so huge that they get stuck on every building and cant reach anything in your base
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,the only breeding partner that should be included is myself and the pal i want.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,got to love bastigor's expression when he's cooling
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,leaving this here as a reminder to watch this when i need it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,thank you so much its very helpful your video!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,"actually the best cooling pal is by far vanwyrm cryst, most of cooling pals sleep at night leaving the fridge and that returns the food for their original spoil time. vanwyrm cryst is a dark ice pal so he never sleeps so hes aways cooling the fridge plus you can aways do the sort button to reset their cooling spoil time."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,"while clearing out the oil rig at lvl 20 i caught the incineram noct, and by a stroke of miracle it had remarkable craftmanship, and from that ive managed to get 10 anubis, 2 jormuntides and 2 jormuntide ignis' all with remarkable craftmanship at lvl 25"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"my friend sent me this, thanks! i'm new to the game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,the good thing about splatterina is that shes nocturnal since she is dark type. thats why i prefer her over anubis
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,well for the best planting pal is that new darkplant type since its nocturnal and you can upgrade her with those new books trust me its worth it when she can do everything besides watering to keep your pals fed
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,should have mentioned orserk. its power generation is as good as azuremanes and its got lv3 handiwork
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,it was very helpful
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"best mining is still astegon thanks to his dark type. best electricity is still orserk, handiwork and transport are by far better then collecting 1."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,you know something is wrong when your best pal's family tree is a circle...thankfully it has no repercussions
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,astegon is the best for mining and also it's dark type so you can fully work speed it up without nocturnal
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,i seriously can't be the only one that noticed that frostallion is in the middle of this breed chain who is lvl 60 boss that can't be bred into

Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,in what scenario do we need a level 4 watering pal outside pal soul converting or converting stonemeterorites to paldium?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,since when can u breed jormuntide if js??
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,"because of the manuals that boost stats the best planting pal is shroomer noct it eats very low amounts works 247 and reduces all pals san consumption in the base. if you get 4 each condensed to a different stage and 1 not condensed they all stack for 75 reduction in san coupled with salad you can set pals to max workspeed with food boost and they won't get angry or sick. best kindling pal is sootseer condensed to get it to rank 4 and a kindling book gets it to rank 5 it works 247 and ranches bones between your smelting and cooking. best watering pal is leafant it barely stops to eat so 2 of them can fully water a skill tree before eating unfortunately you have to use 3 watering books on it. best handiwork pal is ribbuny it get boosted workspeed on weapon making at rank 5 handiwork and 4 speed boost passive the increase is 1638 more handwork from the pal passive they can make 999 of any ammo in milli seconds it breaks the animation. best transport pal is wumpo, its slow so if you only have a guild chest and no others and its not accessible they will tele them into a guild chest. best cooling pal is vanywurm cryst it works 247 best mining pal is digtoise at 5 condense it hits ores for 4k a pop best eleecttic pal is dazzi noct it barely eats and works 247"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,what was the first blue thing that looked bored and annoyed
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,did they change jormuntides breed combos? i thought only an ignis and an ignis jormuntude could make an ignis jormuntide
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,azurmane is better than orzerk?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"is azurmane better than orzerk, or is orzerk just harder to breed than azurmane?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,got problem when i see relaxaurus xdd. 99 will get gluton
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,doesn't flares aqua and jomuntide aqua have the same watering level?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,cooling is honestly such a worthless feature it should be used for something else. just hit the sort button and food resets and when it does expire its only 1 at a time then it resets. your pals will likely have put 100 more in the box before 1 spoils
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,anyone have an updated palworld breeding calculator? there was a good one when the game came out that was when you couldnt breed for jormintide ignis.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,"uh, those are just the pals with the highest pal skills in their specific area of expertise, that doesn't mean that they are the best pals for the job you know.. dont ignore the personal skills.."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,if you could send me the script please . rewatching the video everytime is hard. just send me the schedule
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,jormuntides??? nah germantides
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-28,we need better pals that aren't fucking huge.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,why did i hear faleris aqua is the best butchering pal
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,jormantide and farleris aqua have the same watering so why farleris other than the fact jormantide gets stuck sometimes
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"don't like jormuntideignis... no matter how big and spacious your base is, it gets stuck often..."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,"ummm... azurmane isn't the best electricity generating pal, and i have no idea why you would say that, orserk has lv4 electricity, can do handiwork and transporting"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,i cant keep up with the whole breeding chart thing so ive mostly just been flying around the sanctuarys just catching rare spawns like lyleen in the wild
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,"both azurmane and ozark have electricity 4. so, sell me on why azurmane is better."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,best fire pal is blazamut ryu not jormuntide ignis.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,what?! you can breed diff species tgt?????!?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,is it just me or did a lot of the boss pals change locations on the map
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,do you know which pal can breed with another pal for make the most different pals? i wanna grind it so i can share remarkable craftsmanship to any breedable pals in the game but i dont want to waste my time with grindng. i tried yakumo to the catch pals with that passives but after 637 yakumos i only got mmovable heart
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,no pvp no game
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,astagon is better in mining as knocklem because he works at night
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,"easier way to get splatterina, breed caprity with penking"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"check out rocket money for free!!! httpsrocketmoney.comcircletoons also, i'd love to hear what you think about this!! i'm genuinely so proud of this one!!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"cut to months later and palworld has released several updates. several qol updates, a raid boss, items, remolded some pals and have planed an even bigger update for the summer. they really seem to be in this game for the long haul and i look forward to it. they will finish this game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,a small indie game called palworld just dropped you can date this video by this remark alone.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,palworld is more similar to ark than pokmon. the difference being the fact that you can tame every pal relatively easily while ark requires a 23 step process for one dino
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-23,the best addition palworld added was if the item is in your base you can use it to craft. no more digging inside of 50 chests to find loose nails i can just use a workbench
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,i like how the little water guy that was watering the crops for the entire video near the end looked over like why are you making me water these crops for so long they don't need this much water
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,its an interesting feeling when an indie company makes a game that you wanted a triple a company to make for years.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"honestly design wise a lot of the palworld creatures actually reminded more of how a lot of kirby characters are designed, especially on how a lot of the little guys will have stubby arms and legs, and how in general most of them have a rather rounded feel to them. lamball looks like a woolly waddle dee to me, which make them even more cute imo."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-03,"the glitchy pals at the work base, struggling to step over floor beds, is automatically goated as a meme"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,"i don't get why people think that anubis is a ripoff of lucario. the name is literally taken directly from egyptian mythology. just like with the sheep, there are only so many ways that you can reinterpet from the same source material. if anything, palworld is sticking closer to the source material."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-03,620 his escalating aggression towards the mozzarina followed by the bloodbath in the next shot and then other pals are eating burgers lmfao
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"i love the skill fruits, cause they grow on skill trees. i groaned at this first but it was amazing to think about how corny it is."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-24,i love that palworld showed how much gamefreak has been a lazy pos for over a decade.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"the irony is that pals feel more like pokemon from the anime, than the pokemon in the actually nintendo games do."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,whenever i see palworld vs pokmon debates i just immediately think of the classic el dorodo meme both? both  both is good
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"111 that person who made the original tweet talking about how they plagiarized the models admitted that they fabricated the evidence. their excuse was that palworld promoted animal abuse, which to me is one of the funniest things to hear coming from a pokemon fan lol. i wouldn't say palworld promotes animal abuse so much as it's just much more honest with its theming than pokemon is."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-23,"anubis is based on the egyptian god also named anubis, not lucario. he's as different from lucario as pengullet is from piplup. look at the accessories and clothing, look at the head, arm, leg, waist shape even. it's basically a dogheaded human whereas lucario is a dog on two legs"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,the only palpoke similarity i disagree with is lucario. it's literally an egyptian jackal with spikes just because pokemon made a jackal monster first doesn't mean they 'own' it or others are 'copies'.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-16,"whats really amazing about palworld is the fact that pals can actually dodge. in pokemon you have to depend on special items, rare pokemon personalities and odds to guarantee that your opponents move will fail on their turn while in palworld your pals can just step aside when a move comes their way. in pokemon arceus your pokemon can lose half their hp from a single move and a pal will straight up teleport out of the way. watching my anubis and bushi take on bosses give me goosebumps because they're just so good at dodging incoming attacks. pokemon could never. i played palworld for 100 hours before i went back to arceus, after taking on a mass outbreak and watch 4 pokemon take turns decimating my empoleon while it just stood there i turned my switch off. i didnt even bother saving."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,palworld has dramatically improved since it's first release.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-27,"i'll never understand how people think it's a complete ripoff of pokemon. some of them are pretty blatant, but so many of them are unique and interesting that it's genuinely outperforming game freak in many ways. nintendo fanboys are worse than disney adults."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,people nowadays are so aggressive that they cannot conceive the idea of having multiple favorites.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,chess like combat of pokmon i used a single pokmon using 1 attack through most of these games.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-28,"1123 no one ever mentions how useless captured humans are. they have no skills, never use their weapons and can't work at your base. the most you can do with them is sell them to the black market guy probably not for a whole lot, idk because i never found him or if you're particularly sinister, put them on display in a viewing cage."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"i love the attention to detail background humor you have in these, like at 1601 when you comment about working conditions and a pal in the back is like"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-21,"pokemon trainerelectrabuz! use thunder punch! palworld trainer grizzlybolt, use the minigun"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,loved the elephant turning around at 1558 when circle says good working conditions
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,113 weren't most of these if not all proven to be falsefabricated? you'd think nintendo of all companies would destroy them legally if there was any validity to plagiarism claims.
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-25,1245 or you just send them to the mines for all eternity had me actually laughing
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-21,1122 you can also catch people! grin  had me rollin omg
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,"palworld devs did not rip off any fakemon artists. the example used of the mega delphox art, was actually posted after the palworld pal appeared in a trailer for the first time."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-06,as an aspiring game designer i love hearing when indie games do well when they start from nothing because that's where i'm starting
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-03,"037 oh no, someone should warn that kid about the impending housing market crisis!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,the pal dex type song was fire you need to make a full version.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-18,"i never played a pokmon, but i've reached the 1300 hours in palworld faster than in any big rpg, and single player only. i love my pals d"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,i think my favorite drama with palworld is when people started making stuff up! in order to say it's bad
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-08,8 months later and palworld beat the allegations. and instead of people hating palworld more they hate pokmon more because the nintendo ninja lawsuits.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-07,"718 ah yes, because game freak owns the rights to the egyptian god anubis."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"jokes on you, im working this saturday night."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,just dropped oh you can tell when this video was originally made lmao
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,so palworld has vastly improved. pretty great now. gonna throw another 200 hours at it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"718 anubis isnt that bad. there are only so many ways to make a jackal man, which is a public domain mythological idea."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-02,the qr code at 1100 leads to an amazon page for soap lmfao
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"it's fun when people say once you have everything it get boring and there's nothing else to do uhm yeah, just like minecraft, terraria or any crafting survival game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-12,1600 this aged like fine milk.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-02,"additionally, gamefreak has asked people to stop calling them to do something about palworld"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-03,the way he just fkin throws the axe at the lamball at 232 then the other pal is pecking at its corpse later is so funny
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"i absolutely adore palworld due to how ridiculous it is, also it is pokemon esque creatures combined with ark survival evolved like gameplay"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,youre not here to build a wooden axe for the 87th time that shit killed me. too relatable
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,palworld is so far off from the pokemon gameplay i dont think theyd affect each other too much.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,752 yo kai watch acknowledged lets go
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,"this game is honestly an example of how a parody can stand on its own from the work that its a parody of. its the relationship between spaceballs and star wars, space king and warhammer, etc. definitely gonna check this game out. when it becomes full access"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-26,"whether they are stealing or not, they have made a beta game that still looks better than recent pokmon games"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-27,"the devs didnt do shady weird shit with the models, that was already disproved"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-30,"1409 a great example of a good early access game is ultrakill, its polished, not buggy and is only missing content and nothing else"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,508 the 'penguin go boom' thing is actually a reference to disgaea. which has a blue penguin that explodes when thrown.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-19,"to catch up. pokemon is now suing palworld. not based on pal designs no. it's game mechanics. they're going after fucking game mechanics! cause apparently walking with your pal outside of its carrier, having them pick up items, being able to send to to auto battle is not allowed."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,one of the best moments ive had in palworld was when a mammorest wandered into my base and i accidentally shot at it once and then seeing my entire horde of 12 pals completely unload into this beast that was 10 levels above them for 5 minutes. i think what was also makes palworlds world less empty is there is actual reason to catch more of the same type of pal. either by giving more exp for each capture which helps you level up or by having efficient pals work in the camp. that was kinda my problem with la where as soon as i caught most mons there really wasnt much incentive to catch like 10 more
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"i got into palworld because some psycho pokemon fan sent me a jihadi beheading video, because i didn't agree with them on twitter about palworld being ai generated. i didn't even say they're wrong, i just said hey can do you have a source?. they sent me a video where the first frame is something like proof palworld used ai and it immediately hard cuts to the beheading. i went from i mean i'm not into pokemon so i'm not interested in pokemonlite to yeah screw pokemon, all of you are psychopaths, i'm playing palworld out of spite. surprise surprise, palworld is genuinely a good game and i enjoy it despite not being into monster catching games. i'm not into survival crafting games either, but man palworld does a great job at making me enjoy it."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-03,510 holy crap this entire scene is so hilarious the way the scorched pengullet just falls from the sky and the way he talks lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-04,"picked up this game yesterday from the steam summer sale. i was like i'll never play a pokemon ripoff, what is this? digimon? but after playing it for 8 hours first day, it is amazing. 10 years ago i told tons of people if pokemon made an mmo where you level your character, and can fight people to catch certain pokemon, it would be a multibillion dollar individual title bringing in 10 million a month on a subscription easily. this game hit almost all the points."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"i highly doubt this game will be abandoned by the devs anytime soon. you can tell that there's passion put into this game, based on how deep it is. that said, this might also force gamefreak to improve pokemon games as a whole, considering they now have actual competition in the monster catching genre. a worthy opponent one could say."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,i just love how teafant is rolling its eyes at the hypocrisy of fair working conditions at the end.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,re watching this 7 months after again and 815 still made me almost laugh myself out of my chair and could not stop replaying it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-30,"328 holy shit, ive never seen this man before. why is he so dapper"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"111 oh great, it's the guy who edited the pal models and then defended his actions by saying that palworld encourages animal abuse"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,dang i didn't know pokemon invented the egyptian god anubis when making lucario
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-05,"honestly just watched this before bed because i saw it the other day at work and put it in my save for later. however you earned my sub and like after the pokemon rap rip at 631, that is great content and im sure all my 90s kids will agree"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-27,"1123 this part was absolutely hilarious, the silence and the smile"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"something to note, the claim that palworld plagiarized was 100 false. the person who made that accusation admitted that they fabricated the whole thing and they did it because they thought palworld encouraged animal abuse."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"i just want to say i appreciate the digimon world music in the ad segment. wasn't expecting a nostalgia bomb in an ad, haha. oh, and the palworld vs. pokmon war was so stupid. gamers being gamers, nothing new here."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,i love how it's using animals for their talents like ark and base management with incremental upgrades like and some combat like bellwright all in the adorable art style of pokemon! it's ridiculously addictive and early game is so much fun! i love the game's sense of humour as well with catching humans. this is also the first game where i'm actually reading the blurb about the animals
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-14,037 the date on the calendar
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-30,1431 never had any of these problems at all

Survival,Palworld,2024-12-02,1424 i like my sound drippy bruh
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,"i can't stand drawing backgrounds, but i will forever respect those who do, or at least have the patience to work through it for their content. your hard work hasn't gone unnoticed, circletoons team."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-26,"you can mount... not that one! oh, sweet summer child... do you really think lovander cares about consent? as a matter of fact, she does  but she has a reputation to keep if she didn't, she wouldn't be carrying booze and cake as drops. yes, the pink lizard of lust actually does try to wine and dine you before even suggesting doing the deed"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-19,you can also catch people got me laughing
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,not sure what the issue is with anubis's design. same situation with penguins they exist outside of video games even if mythological
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"whoa, the expressive animations from this squaretoons guy really shine. it's like, everything i've wanted from circletoons for years!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-27,854 that boi made my day
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-28,1307 more like a group of murlocs swarming you while going aaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle! actual transcription of the murloc mating call
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,pokemon devs can suck it. they've abandoned their brains a long time ago. palworld is so much better.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,can we play skyblock now
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-09,"the timing of this script almost released after the games first huge update which is coming in a few weeks later in june, after many updates to fix all the bugs that we been reporting d the games come a long way since release and soon as that update drops i'll be back into it after the break i've had. been waiting for more content and it will be here soon! also i did love the salty nintendo fanboy comments pretending nintendo owns the rights to all animals and cartoon animals that exist in both real life and fantasy. somehow. like anubis, which is modelled after freaking anubis but yet somehow is lucario"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,720 this one just makes me angry when people bring it up. is fucking anubis you don't get to call every anubis creature a rip off of lucario. are you going to go to egypt and declare copyright over the god's damned hieroglyphs?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,1348 i had the smoothest add transition and i don't care if it was a doordash add that computer jarble faded into an add for me truly smooth
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-08,there are soo many more fakemon than even pokemon. you cant blame palworld for accidentally coming up with the same idea
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,circleman is back to fill us with nice juicy content!
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"hey, hopefully palworlds success gets more people to play more monster taming games in general surely people will see that theres a ton of options both old and new right? right?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-12,036 that calendar in the back when talking about how you felt as a child. dude. yeah. i remember feeling like a kid before that day too...
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,palworld lore goes hard when you look at diffrent locations on the map like how that fort near the volcano is likely the one from vaelets paldeck description or how that one place in the ruined city south of the frost montains you see that one structure that looks suspiciously like a giant summoning altar
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,did anyone else notice his calendar says september 10th 2001 or is it just me?
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-31,i need to physically restrain myself from making a squaretoonshd channel
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-11,"endofyear palworld summary  released more and more content over time.  big n wasn't happy about it.  sued palworld for game mechanics introduced after the game's launch.  now, palworld is removing palballs because big n doesn't tolerate competition."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"holy!!! wow. this animation is insane. your style is simplistic, however its immediately noticeable how hard you worked on it. truly beautiful!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-29,848 love the silly art
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,"you know, any time i see anubis next to lucario all i can think is i prefer anubis"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"this game is very addictive i play ark religiously, so it's no wonder i love this game"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,credit to uryik on reddit for a great mount speed comparison chart! links don't work in shorts so google fastest mounts and mount hierarchy with condensing
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,you forget that most people are still busy trying to find a way to mount lovander
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,and then there is my dumbass on my kingpaca going 20 mph
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"i just bred a nimble, swift, runner fenglope, and it feels like i'm playing mario kart lol well worth the effort, can't wait to put legend on it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"i've mounted lunaris. i won't be taking any questions, and i won't be explaining anything. goodbye."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"the nicest thing about direhowl being a mount is that its charge attack acts like a grappling hook. meaning that if you are encumbered, mounting direhowl and spamming its charge attack is actually nice, so you can save your resources that you'd otherwise use on your grappling hook for other things."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,chillet also adds the dragon attribute to your attacks. that's a plus in my book.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,people with jetragon chuckling at these slow ahh mounts
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"i got a lucky rushoar that i use as my mount. he's big, slow, and incredibly strong. big guy can handle pals twice his lvl without issue so i can explore high lvl areas freely. i named him pumba"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,chillet became the most useful.....and it surprisingly jumps high for dem stubby legs
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"just finished breeding my nimble, swift, runner, fenglope. hopefully a legend trait too soon. i dont know how palo or necromus compares but this thing is hard to beat. legit flying off mountains with the charge is also fun"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,i will always stick with my boi chillet. my first boss catch.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"btw the only pals that get faster when upgraded are the ones with partner skills that only make you able to ride them. for example, upgrading a direhowl does increase it's speed, but upgrading something like chillet or pyrin would only increase the player attack boost they give you when mounted"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"ultimate hint use rushoar as a mount to easily mine ores, its even faster than just let digtoises or anubis mining"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-23,"i suggest fenglope when picking between it and rayhound! yes its slower but the double jump and insane jump height in the first place can literally let you climb mountains even the snow mountain if you try hard enough lol. plus it has a skill you can unlock called cloud tempest which is this massive and super fast charge forwards and if you use it smartly you can go flying pretty far ie, somewhere high up starting on the ground. dont start it midair because it wont work until fenglope hits the ground again and wastes the charge. but it does work midair if you start on solid ground. its so fun to run around being able to get over practically anything and when i run into an agro pal or a group of hostiles i just activate cloud tempest and immediately get out of the situation."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"rushoar being a mount is a side bonus. you want to unlock the saddle because it can make mining much faster. mines around 10 oreworth in one charge. only issue is needing to get back to the mining spot after shooting off who knows where, but its still faster than swinging a ton and waiting for stamina to rebuild. the deer is faster than direhowl if you charge regularly. the double jump is also surprisingly useful."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,seriously underestimating the early game power of rushroar. he yearns for the mines
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-27,"finally, a pal world video!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-22,"if you want a fast land mount early on, direhowl is your best friend until a wild one sees you."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"frostallion and the dark version are the best to me. i keep both in party now in end game, high stamina, super fast on land and air"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,ooh! a spammable dragon cannon sounds like fun!
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,bro had beef with the boar
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,you misunderstand chillet. chillet's dash has an ability where if you jump middadh you go flying insanely quickly and far. very fun to just yeet yourself off of mountains for max airtime.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,i will continue to ride the danger noodle and nobody can stop me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-24,sylveon alpacaam i a joke to you?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"i dont care if chillet isn't the best mount, im not giving up my danger noodle. chillet is love. chillet is life."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,best early game ground mount is rushoar due to his ability to mine super fast with his reckless charge skill.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,palworld let's you mount many land pals... me pokemon community the dream...
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"rushoar saddle is the best way to get ore before your ore base or digtoise item unlock. he get 20 ore per charge attack on a node. if you bounce 3 ore nodes, that 60 ore in 3 seconds. rushoar is a almost everytime you should unlock when you need that early ore for those first metal items."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-03,kitsun is a underrated mount imo. their skill that makes you immune to the heat and cold is really helpful
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,i know you have a 135k subs but in my opinion your way to underrated in my opinion your the best youtuber keep up the good work
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,chillets cuteness makes up for being a little slow
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,"when it comes to rushoar, you get the saddle to mine better, which can help a lot when excavating land for a base. there are other, better options later, but for a level 6 early game option having a rushoar with four kattiva to help offset the sudden weight and early points into carrying can matter. of course such efficency isn't needed right now, but when it comes time for pvp, there's a notinsignificant chance that could be a factor."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"rushoar is still good, maybe not as a movement mount but as an early game mining mount."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,first finally amazing cool video garo looks like a fun game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,waiting excitedly for the flying mount video!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,chillet giving you dragon damage is insane when you get guns same as pyrin which is also really fast
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,fun fact lovander actually mounts you
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,chillit and chillit ignus are lowkey my favourite pals in the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,direhowl's signature attack can make you negate weight slowdown too
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,that blue character probably doesn't need a ranch to get cake materials cause he got a whole factory back there.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,i choose the wolf mount cause i love it. it's good to know it's a fast mount for the beginning
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,this looks awesome! so much mount variety garoaww
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"direhowl is very helpful when moving while encumbered. his dash attack works even when encumbered, basically giving you a dash while over loaded with crap. great for moving bases!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-08,"nothing beats my pure bred fengelop with nimble, swift and runner attributes combined with the crazy height jump and charge attack i am breezing through mountains like it's nothing. used to be a rayhound believer but fengelop is built different."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,i bred a kitsun with 3 speed traits and it is my go too for it's temperature control.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,definitely unlock rushoar. mount it to charge ore rock. literally the best method to mine before automated mining base set up.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,"rushroar is great as an early mining mount, charge into rocks and ore for quick gathering."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,i use rushoar if i need to mine. early game its very useful. his tackle can take 21 ore at a time.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-19,"man, fenglop with legend, swift, nimble and runner, with ability level 5, using its rushing attack cross half the map in a few seconds, not to mention his long jumps."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,"been going with that xerneas sawsbuck hybrid since the beginning, i found good use of the charge."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"i always like the fact that eikthyrdeer have the antler's uppercut, i spam it every cooldown finishes"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"rushroar might not be a good traveling or fighting mount, but it's amazing for early game ore, stone and paldium farming"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,rushoar with runner was the best starting mount. kept him until mid tier fliers
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,i cant wait to get the pal with the lances for arms because i really like playing as a knight
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,im happy people are finnaly using undertale yellow music in videos as well as originals
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-28,"even though it only has single jump and not particularly speedy andor mighty, legendlord of the underworldswiftrunner condensed maraith is my no. 1. it simply looks so great."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,"i mostly stuck with rushoar for land, and have a variety of flying mounts. the boar's unique attack, reckless charge, does insane damage to ore and stone nodes, and if you hold shift while using it, you get a speed boost that feels like mariokart."
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-04,shadowscale i just want to say thanks for inspiring me to make my own channel
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-13,the thumbnail just allowed my imagination to go wild
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,chillit being a little freaking also giving the fact that there adding dirty features in 2025
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,rushoar is essential early game not for transport but for ore farming
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-16,"nah, bro has the whole damn bakery on him"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,rushoar can mine ore while your riding it. makes mining so much easier your welcome
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-10,lovander is the only land mount worth mounting.  for all other needs there's jetragon...
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"one thing this doesn't take into account is size. the larger ones can be hard to get through certain caves and dungeons. the wolf gets a huge point in my book for being small. his special attack is also a super fast cool down. in my current game i caught one, used him to run around and catch around 100 more. one of them had swift and a huge damage buff, condensed the rest into him for more speed and used some should for extra damage. he'll definitely carry me to end game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,"dazemu is my favourite mount since it has a charge, speed boost on sand and dirt and a slow fall"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,some of these pals can easily double as regional variants of some well known pokmon
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"kitsun gives you weather immunity, is pretty fast, and has a charge attack on a 10 sec cooldown"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,the undertale yellow music is the perfect song here.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,the best land mount is whatever one plays this backround music
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,having the higher jumps on fenglope makes him the best ground mount if you add the speed passives
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,"maraith is my go to land mount for exploring. got furious, swift and muscle head on him and hits like a fright train. plus adds dark damage to my attacks while mounted. also it's jump is pretty high almost like a floaty jump. it's really fun utility mount."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"2nd direhowl i caught had swift and runner trait. used it until i hit level 36. only replaced it because i caught a pyrn with swift, and realized i could buy another from merchant with runner so i could get same traits through breeding. used that horse to get a ragnahawk with those traits"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-01,dazmu with swift is absolutely amazing and you can get him decently early
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,i left at the wrong moment i heard pal world let's you mount men
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,boar is ideal for cave hopping for rushing through mining deposits
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,love univolt bc your weapons gain electric dmg and makes pals easier to catch!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,rush roar is good for mining early game. his wreckless charge name of the ability could be off destroys nodes in a few hits
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-01,love how radical red devs added chillet
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,i use the deer for the get me tf outta here charge.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,fenglope's cloud tempest to me is the most fun traversal skill especially on areas with wide landscapes like the desert or snow area. activate the skill near a cliff and double jump at the end of it don't forget to hold shift you'll go so far so fast.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-03,"dont sleep on rushoar, it makes mining ore veins and boulders away from your base especially in caves much faster with its charge ability"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,frostallion is my favorite mount to use because it's fast on land and through air
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,"rushhoar has a really good charge, so whenever i mount him and am close to running out of stamina, i use the charge and go real fast while it lasts along having the stamina recharged, it's less convenient than direhowl, but it's worth using it while it lasts"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,rushoar is a must have for mining early game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,"at level 40, i bred a direhowl with swift, nimble, vanguard, and musclehead. not ideal i'd prefer runner over nimble, but i wanted one for dungeon running since the player speed is only slightly slower than a rushoar, and direhowls are small enough to fit in all passages freely."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,pal word lets you mount many land pals is what i heard
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,"ride the flying bird thing, try to breed one with speed passive.. then when you can, unlock fanghorn... breed it to have speed passives and it'll be the fastes lang mount you own, it also got double jump so climbing isn't much issue"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,i breed a swift runner shadowbeak thats been my go to for traversing
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,took me a moment to realize that he just blew that one guy with an rpg
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"lighting doge for me, such a good boi"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,i put wind cutter and air cutter on my direhowl. these are fast shooting attacks with low cooldowns. it makes him very good at catching pals. i use the three shot bow to have even more control over enemies hp. rushoar is worth it not as a mount but to get ore. his saddle is cheap to make and with it you can quickly get the ore needed to unlock the second mining base. i recommend mining the nodes near the church.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,only certain mounts get faster when you level them up and you should 100 use tech points to ride pig and fast farm ore earlyish.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,chillet has been my go to land mount for most taking expeditions and for bossing. surprisingly tanky and his 3 burst homing attack has allowed me to tame many a pal outside of our levels at the lower levels. only complaint i have is that the 3 burst homing attack doesnt seem to work for me when mounted for some reason.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-09,with those expressions i'd assume chillit is the vaporeon of the palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,rushoar is great at the beginning becourse it can mine ores too
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,personally i got super lucky with the deer as i got it eaely and it happened to have swift which goves 30 more movement speed which made it faster than the wolf
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,eikthydeer is not slower. if you use the charge frequently you move faster than direhowl. plus you have the double jump
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,i love palworld but i'm sad to say i will never switch of of chillet
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i was expecting dumud to get hit and not even notice
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,these guys just being a savage with their marketing
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i was expecting depresso to expect the bullet but it misses lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"i'm dead. yeah, he will notice like in 4 days."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,depresso is holding a bullseye and the bullet just misses.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,this song is pleasent to anyone who hasn't had one of these machines in their main base for dozens of hours.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"this would be cool to add for pals to dodge or use skills to protect themselves. love that chillets defense is to just arcstretch itself, and quite like that, lovander actually looks a bit sad when you shoot her. poor dumud, though never stood a chance. keep up the amazing work and animations."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,like how realistic the glock is
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i love seeing these shorts not realizing they're official.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"wow, i'm interested in how relaxaurus' digestive system absorb the bullet. amazing."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,just like how they evade those nintendo lawsuits! always on top!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"bruh, i'm dead!  zyzx as master roshi"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,nope. nope. nope. nope. nom. dead.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,dumud when you want to capture it.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i expected lovander to have a more robusty method of absorbing a bullet.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,gimme a lifesize lovander silicone doll for decorative purposes.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,nooo dumud my baby!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,lovander loves handling things peacefully.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"poor dumud!  lovely animation, i always look forward to new ones from you guys!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,how they immune the arrow relaxaurus just eating
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"i'd shoot something at lovander and katress, but it ain't a bullet. i know i'm deplorable."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,nice to know the cute ones lived
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,when your lvl 1
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,it is my professional opinion that dumud is dead!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,i wish pals were this good at not dying to bullets.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"i would've thought, that the bullet would hit a few digtoises as it ricochets off them and wake them up from their sleep"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,www
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,according to imcades video i spent 10 hours breeding this one shot pal at 7 minutes and 41 seconds lifmunks cant be hit by spheres.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,i like how dumuds whole thing is that hes a dumbass  easy favorite
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,just that squishy 'glorp' sound as the bullet hits dumud. xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,this is basically how autoaiming goes when trying to hit a celeray.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,love the idea that lovander uses the concept of lust love to create a barrier around itself.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,lovendar using the power of love to deflect bullets...or is it lust? either or.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,por qu imagin que a depresso le iba a pazar la bala por arriba mientras el saltaba para que le diera sin exito xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,get dumud to the base pc!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,these seem like really cool concepts for them to defend themselves from incoming attacks similar how in legends arceus mr. mine could have reflect so you cant throw balls add it
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,oh right. dumuds reaction times are infinitely slower
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,the damud with the fastest reflexes in the history of the species
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,my favourite palworld song  i love that silly claw machine
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,im surprised depresso wasn't standing right in front of the gun....
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,there was not a single thought behind those eyes
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i love palworld
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,poor dumud
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,i thought dumuds paldex entry said it could be flayed head to tail and wouldn't realize it until the following day.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,yeah you got me..
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,i dont care this is unrelated to the short but i just had a good idea that would be great! a companion pal system. basically it would just be an extra slot for a pal that cannot participate in battle but it helps with base tasks and it has a unique roll of helping your exploration by giving a bonus to your move speed and activates its ability if passive. all the while it is hanging out on your body as it would have to be a small pal.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,i can't believe damud is dead
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"cute, now can we have the original summoning mechanic back from v0.3.10  prior?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,dumud got sniped
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"dumud nooo! ... ... ... well, at least relaxsaurus got a snack out of it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,this is the most powerful of the palmon!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,the last one ...
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,018 heavy from tf2 you are dead not big surprised
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,how? how did you pull off both cute animal collector and mass murder simulator?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,saved the cute ones!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"it would be fun to see relaxaurus consume incoming projectiles like kirby or pacman, slowly healing him up depending on what he consumes it would also be cool to see him spit out rockets and pal balls that he swallowed"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"slippery island, water based pals"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,most accurate glock
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,wild pals have adapted to guns mostly
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"so is it just me or are we gonna be seeing some changes in palworld in the future like more dynamic weather for an example the video with fox sparks and sibelyx video and some water themed stuff for another example the video with cattiva, depresso,galeclaw,and dumud one and will we see how pals in palworld defend themselves in a future update? cause the only pal that can defend itself is silvegis and yes i probably misspelled it's name"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,dumud needs a misty look alike trainer d
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,best marketing

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,its crazy how easy anubis is to get for being one of the best pals in the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,do not use relaxasusrus because it can make all of your anubis have gluten. if you breed anubis i recommend penking and bushi
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,grizzbolt is surprisingly good for breeding since it can chain breed into many powerful pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,"for those trying to breed stats, you can basically turn any pal into any other pal. so no need to mindlessly farm up all the stats you want on a single pal type. just get the stats you want together and then use palworld breeding calculator to see what you can make with each pal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"i used a tombat and a sweepa for anubis. i've got more positive traits than i have negative with that pair. the most notable one i've gotten had a burly body iii, earthquake resistant i, dainty eater, and a veil of darkness. my second one had earthquake resistant i, cheery mind i, 10 increase to neutral attack, and then a 10 water damage resist."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-29,nitewing  helzephyr  jormunaride
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,honestly. i dont get all the hate from pokmon fans. its just another good pokmonesque game
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,i just played this game today i'm new to it so thanks for the help
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-17,i spent the night breeding a max speed quivern. she's super fast and i love her 3
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,thanks this helped a lot!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,orserk is 100 worth it. hes a great fighter
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,i love breeding guides for anubis because its literally always a different combo
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,if you use grizzbolt again with the orserk it gives astagon without having to find a helzephyr!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,ok! thanks for the info!
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,"this is quite usefull, good info."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,somebody like this so i can come back to it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,thank you
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-19,broncherry why am i herejust to suffer
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,i'm going to get anubus so early the entire server going to be suprised
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,"i did that last night, got astegon from orserk and grizzbolt, now after work ill get shadowbeak"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,shadow beak is my favorite and i just got him today
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-13,"ever since i got a kitsun from breeding, its been my best buddy"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-22,i got a max iv attack grizzbolt from breeding and have used it in end game and everything ever since. he has become my favorite pal. used him in my bellanoir libero kill in my party
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,i had a shit ton of mossanda one time. i feel like they can be breed into any pals within 23 generations
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-28,penking and bushi also work for anubis btw
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-11,anubis is my favorite pal for bases lv 4 handiwork makes building crazy fast
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-18,i was breeding some pals when i decided to watch yt while i wait lol i try some of these
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-30,its way easier to get anubis by breeding sweepa and tomcat. both can be found near the first tower so you can breed it before you even start thinking about building a second base allowing you to have an army to help you build said base
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-03,palworld is a mix of 2 of my favourite games. pokemon and ark
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,for jormintide you can also do relaxasusrus and elizabee
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,day 150 havent ran into a grizzbolt lol. never seen one in the sanctuary
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,wow cool mixes
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,u can turn 2 weak pals into a overpowered pal
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,oh wow i can make a shadowbeak... maybe i'll look into that
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,you can breed relaxsauras and grizzbolt to get orserk
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,thanks for the combination of orserk and the parrot
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,the easiest way i got astegon on the 1st and 2nd try is suzaku and pyrin noct highly recommended both easy to get and breed astegon in my opinion and it worked for me
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,collector this is just like mobile games like dragon city!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,you can also breed it with robinquill terra and cryolinx which can be bought from black marketer
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,just check the breeding calculators and find which 2 pals are easiest for you to use
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,you can get anubis from sweepa and tombat. there are alot of busted combos due to the way breeding works.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-26,my favourite is shadow beak
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-11,you can make that jormintide guy with only grizzbolt and nitewing
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-02,that girl chilling on grizzbolt while they breed relaxthing and grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,i really like the garados
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,can you make a video about how to get powerful late game pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,video about how to get strong pals in the late game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,earthdeer
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,"odd thing, since all pals can breed and make fertile offspring, doesn't that make them all the same species?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,"i thought i was being clever putting wixen and kattress in a breeding farm, but all they made was a bigass grass goat"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-16,bruh thank you! cause i have all the parents you named and still need astegon  shadow beak
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-06,you can also breed pen king and bushi for anubis much easier is you get bushi out of an egg
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,thanks
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,you can also use grizzbolt and loupmoon for anubis!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,my favourite breading
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,i accidentally made a 50 faster kitsun 10 levels before being able to ride him
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-14,so you could get strongest tower boss just by breeding
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-15,anubis looks like lucario
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,4 star lv100 shadow beak is insane bro!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,i see you got zoe and grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,for anibus yiu can also get from penkingbushi
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,grizzbolt baby
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,tbh l just crossbreed random pals in hope l get smth good
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,anubis can also be bred by using the pengullet boss and bushi
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-14,you can get anubis too whit chillet and quivern
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-28,so we gonna ignore that grizzbolt's got an unconventional accesory? xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,astegon and jormuntide are my favorite
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,"i think i only used the first and last combo but i have all of them from breeding pro tip breed a relaxasusrus using the grizbolt you need for orserk with pyrin, warsect, or quivern. this way you can get rid of glutton and not have your anubises work better"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-10,anubis can spawn if u breed a wyvern with the sea dragon from the first wild area
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,my favorite breeding pair is the luvander and the player character
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,holy moly
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,that grizzbolt comes with a free waifu
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,anubis is one of the best pet to use for crossbreeding too can be turn to almost all t4 base worker
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,put orserk at the base and watch it single handedly nuke the raid out of existence is super satisfy
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-07,my favourite? ooh.... ooh you know who lovanda is breeding with tonight
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,so long story short relaxaurus is a playa
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-26,relaxsurus and helzapher have best genetics
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,man i need them all of them fr but can't get them cuz don't know how to make cakes to breed with
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,nice.
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-02,lovander is my favorite pal to breed.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,i will point out even the boss grizzbolt with his human partner on his back counts as grizzbolt for all breeding pairs. so if you cheesed that boss early then you can use that for any of its pairings
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-09,penikingbushianubias
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,ray hound and green goat
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,shhhheeeeeessssshhhhh
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,hahaha that grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,grizzbolt  orserk is also astegon
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-07,anubis and vanwyrm is my preferred breed to get faleris who is faster than shandowbeak early kn and you get the saddle at 38
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"its been a while and no one probably remembers me but im back at the first comment, i think"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,you can breed astegon with grizzbolt and orserk
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-08,fun fact the relaxsaurus is in fact not relax at all
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-01,i bread grizzbolt wth relaxarous but it gave me a mau
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-11,depressodeppreso. i got motivational leader depresso...
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-23,i can finally get jourmantide
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,nice
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-22,bushi and penking when breeded makes anubis
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,anubis is recommended with katress and grass mossanda
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,u cant get a boss or a lvl 47 by breeding its gonna be a regular ass one and depending on the passives too just in case ppl think they are
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,i got anubis from azurobe and vanwyrm
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,"yo, got your shadow beak is called shadow freak"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"great strategy! thanks for sharing this. unfortunately restoring to a backup is a bit of a process for dedicated servers, but should still work."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"there is no limit to this. you can apply anything locally, upload it to the global box and revert your local save. so re souls, you can max out everything condensation, souls, books, upload, and altf4 and get it all back. for example you could take 11620 pals and make up a 20 pal raid army by repeating the sequence condense  ivs  skill fruit  souls, upload, and altf4. the same items and 116 blender pals will be back in your box, so you just repeat 20 times and you have your raid army built."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"ever since the book realization, i have been trying to think of what they could do to prevent this... they could give individual ids to books, since they are so rare, could maybe work for iv fruits, but that isn't at all feasible for souls. i can't think of a solution that wouldn't radically change the universal storage. since it would be very difficult to police, i'm guessing they will treat it like save scumming the rig chests, or using mods that allow you to buy the books, or spawn them in or just edit your pals directly... you have fun the way you want. afterall, that's what the universal storage is... it's pal edit for everyone. once you make it once, you can use it everywhere. much more lenient that i had anticipated. i'm interested to see if they let it slide, or come up with some fix."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,you can also max a pal and then dupe it 15 times
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i mean at this point you can just edit the save file
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,saw a video on a glitch with the new large pal storage box basically dupe pals the same way as this with save reloading. except you cant take the dupe pal out till the org is no longer no in existence. havent been able to test but looks like you can soul farm boxes at a time
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"better just mod your game or edit ur savefile, no point in doing all this if results are the same. you could argue the morality of it but thats just stupid and a waste of time at this point."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"so what i'm gathering from all this is if you prep enough beforehand by getting 23k dog coins so you can get 10 of each iv fruit and 4 of the pal extract getting a stack xl manuals which you should have from the mimog farming getting at least 40 small, 24 medium, 24 large, and 120 giant pal souls, and getting 3 of each applied techniques, then you can use this exploit to get a pal to lv.60, max ivs even if they're all 0, fully condense them, fully upgrade their souls, and max out their work suitabilities all without losing any items."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"unrelated, but trying to find a video that explains it. but are pal soul enhancements directly additive to iv stack, passive stack, or food stack? or are they in their own separate multiplicative stack like food?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"i don't think they will patch this exploits since doesn't look easy. first people can still use mods that allows for example condense 1111 or even a save editor where you can make a raid army in one minute with the breed skills. also single play configs allow for player to do 50x more damage to pals and receive 100x less damage. they put an option to not allow upload pals on people server, max they will do is not allow upload palls in oficial servers."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i didn't understand the issues with souls.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,it's just like the old trick in pokemon redblue
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,can i do the same thing when trying to maxing out pal souls ?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,how it will work on crossserver?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,can you do this on ps5 too?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"seems offtopic but i noticed in the update, my astegons wont mine hexolite nodes when im not at that base anymore"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,how to enter save files on xbox?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,i doubt it works online though
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,what happens with the global pal if the original gets butcheredsoul extracted?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,great now it seems you've found the one game breaking op glitch that will make them patch all the others ffs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,honestly hope ppl get their stuff deleted or banned for this
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,nobody wants to do put in the hard work of making raid armies the legit way anymore. it's a sad day for palworld. forget the patent lawsuit ending palworld. the real culprit will be most of the player base becoming bored of palworld because they got everything handed down to them from the players who did all of the work before the global palbox was added. now the infinite item glitch is only adding fuel to that fire. what were you thinking pocketpair? rip palworld
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,"friends by choice, companion by force the vibe from this game i'm getting at loving it"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,well that got incredibly dark out of nowhere
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,finally the long awaited pokemon gun
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,whos here after the game completey exploded on early access? this game is freakin brilliant
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,made for the people who always thought that the pokmon games just didnt have enough guns in them
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-01,"in a world where pokmon, digimon, and my neighbor totoro exist together.. youll form bonds to fight against fainting in labor camps, being eaten alive, and being shot in the face. its all in a days work."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-30,"this is either gonna be completely awful of absolutely amazing. either way, there's no way this is gonna be boring. can't wait to see how it pans out!"
Survival,Palworld,2022-12-18,"they were really like if pokemon won't make pokemon gun, we will"
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-01,im so excited for this game. palworld has gotta be careful though. the last pal getting real close to looking like a zorark and reshiram fusion.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-25,"honestly thought this game was a joke at first, but it actually looks like it might be solid. the pals being able to hold the firearms as well is pretty cool too. hope it does decent on release."
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-01,"this game is gonna be 100 meme material, seems crazy and fun"
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-09,"well, the graphics already look better than any pokemon game in 10 years. interesting concept, will check it out."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,this is outrageous and i'm 100 here for it.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,this is what peta thought pokemon was in the 90s
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,"this looks like an incredible b game. like, a game where the quality isn't all there in terms of graphics but the heart and batshit insanity carries it to valhalla"
Survival,Palworld,2022-07-08,012 never thought i'd see the day when a petililkyubey pulls out a smg.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-26,"that went from 0 to 100 real quick. all these creatures have a striking resemblance to pokmon. ampharos, pikachu, cobalion, reshiram, and zoroark come to mind when seeing this. oh and lets not forget the giant kyogre flying through the sky"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,that reshiramzoroark fusion at the end tho
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,trainer what do you have there? pikachu a gun trainer no
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-17,"this game has the best part of pokmon, gta, fortinite, breath of the wild, metal gear, farcry and factorio. what a beautiful masterpiece."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,"ok this has me hooked, befriending pals and fighting alongside them is my style of how pokemon should be. if pals can speak like digimon and buddy monsters then that is a golden bonus!"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,the graphics and monster designs look like theyve improved a lot since that initial teaser trailer! glad to see this got some budget and traction!
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-30,100 love that you can start your own weapon production line.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,who's here after the great success? game of the year from me.
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-04,its incredible that this game made it this far
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-03,"the monsters look really close to actual pokemon, seeing them with the guns is strange but great, and then it got dark. this game is gonna be a blast. not sure if it's a parody or not, but it looks solid"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,so excited for palworld. easily my most anticipated game so far. such a hilarious take on monster taming. love it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,the game actually came out
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-05,really liking how nintendo has been experimenting with the recent pokmon games. curious how this one will turn out
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-02,this is kinda what i've always wanted to have with pokmon minus the guns but a game where your not just standing behind your pokmon but fighting along side them.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,nintendo is going to have a field day with this one.
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-10,this looks like a game that exists and im all for it
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-04,the reworked assets... i'm loving the sheer campiness of this game and it's design.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,"as someone who just can't stay motivated to fully play a pokemon game anymore, i'm 100 for this game"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-25,this is going to be one of the games of all time.
Survival,Palworld,2022-12-10,lmfao they just went for it. spotted a raichu  a vaporeon within the first 20 seconds and there's a murkrow and a yellow totoro and a lucario and a zoroark and a cobalion like they aren't even trying to pretend give me 10 copies
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-30,ive known about this game for 2 minutes and im instantly in love
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-31,045 i'm a discount raichu with a gun niqqa!
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,pretty excited for this game mostly cause it acts a lot like pokemon while adding in some new mechanics. can't wait to play it!
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-10,how many ips are you plagiarizing?  yes.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,pokmon  shooter? thats a combination id thought ill never hear.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,the monster taming genre is growing with more and creative games looking forward to playing both dokev and palworld for different experiences.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,a truly american story. we need to solve this world's gun problem with guns! gunpals 3
Survival,Palworld,2022-07-12,"no way this actually comes out, some of these are just straight up pokmon."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,"discount raichu in brighter yellow, zoroark with reshiram's body, female kyogre with the leviathan from final fantasy, suicune with milotic's body, pachirisu with carbuncle's body the list goes on."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-29,never thought i'd see an idea like pokemon with guns come to life but i'm so glad someone went in on the idea. i'm very excited to try it out.
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,"one thing is certain for better or for worse, this game will make people argue."

Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,so this is just pokmon set in the us
Survival,Palworld,2022-07-02,"obviously very inspired by other series such as pokemon, but it's different enough like the guns and fusing pals to give it a unique feel to it. overall curious."
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,this game looks like all the devs in the team had their own game idea and one just went up and said who cares let's do everything at once
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-05,jesus the stark contrast of the tone of catching monster and immediately having a shoot out with them lmao

Survival,Palworld,2024-10-27,this is like my favorite game of all time now. wasnt expecting that
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,whats the point in having creatures with powers when you can just beat them by shooting them in the face?
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-06,the designs look great and this is just weird enough that even if its bad its going to be a trip.
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-07,i'm impressed how much the monsters look like actually pokemon

Survival,Palworld,2022-06-11,a smash or pass with this characters will be fire
Survival,Palworld,2022-07-09,the fact that an actual pokmon game does not have this type of graphics and open world yet is very sad.

Survival,Palworld,2022-06-26,spotted at least 4 that are so close to reskinned pokemon it hurts
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,this is insane and out of left field. idk if the pokemon company is gonna flip out on them or not?
Survival,Palworld,2022-06-28,totoro really let himself go
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-31,im really unsure of what to say here
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"one year later, and it's the most played game in steam"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,pokemon working in sweatshops? this is a day 1 purchase
Survival,Palworld,2022-11-23,this looks hella better than violetscarlet
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-28,"some designs are veeery inspired by sugimori and nishida's art style, but the game looks fun! looking forward to it!"
Survival,Palworld,2022-05-24,these designs are kind of hard to tell apart from the real deal! looks a great i'm for sure getting this!
Survival,Palworld,2022-07-13,"037 reminds me of wailord, arceus, and teddiursa"

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,the gene pool gonna be a lake
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,yea i feel the pal box need more specific sections to place work pals fighting pals and fresh catches that you could separate because when you catch pals it messes up your organization and puts an in first open spot then you needa rearrange them
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,"after seeing this there needs to be a comic dub where shadowbeak goes around bullying other pals and then celaray shows up behind it, tells them to stop and shadowbeak just replies sorry grandpa"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-14,bro literally went from lamball to shadowbeak

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,sweet home palpagos islands
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,what they dont say is how long it takes to make cake
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,this ain't the family tree this is the family circle!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,"theres breeding calculators online. literally hundreds of ways to breed into some pals. its really helpful to use when i have good traits on an otherwise unrelated pal, you can breed that good trait into the pal you want, or breed that trait into the pal that makes the actual pal you want. you also cant breed further down than i think a chikipi. you can breed chikipis with themself, but since breeding 2 unrelated pals just averages their power to get the offspring you can only go so far down the list before the power difference is so small it wouldnt even be able to round the power to a lower pal"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,catch them early so that you know you still have over 40 levels of grinding before you can make their saddle.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,here's how to get overpowerd pals before level 20. lvl 50 jetragon rider
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,i got quite a bit of these with just running around and stealing eggs.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,grizbolt has never appeared on that island for me. i had to give in and catch it through that boss glitch
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,lamball and celaray make a wixen.use celaray and relaxasaurus
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-18,that family tree looking more like a pretzel
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,good look finding a grizzbolt d
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,if going for best stats rex has glutton every time unless you breed them. get cryolyx from the snow place and breed with grizbolt for non glutton. would wait till 27 to get the upgraded sphere and the cold metal armor unless you get a good stat kitsun ferociousvanguardburlypreference
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,thats rizzbolt for ya
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,"speaking of shadow beak, i made a random region world and the spawn location was kingpaca and shadow beak. starting off was rough but first pal being shadow beak was nice."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,the astegon breeding method just gives me a chikipi
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,you can also breed grizzbolt and relaxaurus to get orserk and then breed grizzbolt and orserk to get astagon orserk also has level 4 electricity
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,sweet home palabama

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,bro is breading with the parents ayo
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,guys please keep liking my comment so i can actually implement these things
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,"i do like breeding but i think being able to breed really strong pals like shadowbeak orserk kind of ruins the fun of trying to catch them, since you can just breed them with the best passives."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,shadowbeak looks pretty cool
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-23,kitsun really clutched it for me on my first playthrough since i had no idea how to negate weather damage x.x dead ass got myself to jetragon before i figured how to get lv3 resistance
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,the anubis and grisbot gave me a chikipi wtf
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,been to the nature preserve at the bottom several times at least 3 and have yet to find the grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,relaxasaurus with celeray for anubis not lamball
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-05,"this game is crazy man, better continue and succeed on it!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,this be some sweet home alabama stuff
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,grizzbolt and relaxaurus are the parents in every single one of these breeding videos
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,bro broke the game with 4 pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"wumpo has 4 transport but he focuses everything else, honestly better to use ragnahawks, eat less and move faster meaning the items get transported faster"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,what is your favorite pal?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,cool thing if you go to the volcano area towards the left of the map if you can find a huge dragon egg black and purple you can get a jormuntide ignis with level 4 kindling instead of the ragnahawk with level 3 kindling!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,"i mean you forgot all those step in between like having cake, the breeding center and all that and thats the main thing"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,i already caught all the pals so now i'm just waiting for them to add more i haven't used the breeding mechanic cause it just seems like it'll take a lot of waiting for everything to pan out
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,question here does breeding lucky pals do anything ?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,me...never seeing a single grizzbolt in over 200 hours...
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,this doesnt seem very early game to me
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-09,only helps when a grizbolt spawns lol. i spent like 2 hours going back and forth catching everything and leaving restarting the game and going back. no grizbolt. then i bred grizbolt cause i was frustrated and went back to pickup the flowers and bam. suddenly a grizbolt appeared.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,but how do i get the relaxauros with out the damn glutton trait ?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,that glutton passive will follow your pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,pokemon players i like this pokemon because it looks cool. i like this pokemon because it has good moves. palworld players how good is it at being a slave
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,im bout a open a whole bakery lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,grizzbolt getting real busy with his children and grandkids
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,honestly i feel breeding takes so much fun out of the game. its nice to min max your passives later but before that being able to easily get access to strong pals seems really broken. you can ignore them sure but playing with others on the server youll just get left in the dust not doing this. breeding really should be unlocked at level 40 or 45 when youve experienced a good amount of game and maybe even have a fair bit of the strong things you would breed. already
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,you can also get anubis from breeding omascul and penking to get omasucl breed nitewing and dinossom
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,i cant feel my back! grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,"early in the game, yet this whole process will take easily more than 10 hours  also you might have to do multiple breeds if you get unlucky with the genders"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,idk y i never played but it reminds me of pokemon ark and that was so much fun i might start playing
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-03,if shadowbeak finds out about his family tree he will be confused
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,i wish i knew this but now i have every pal
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,ain't no way these pals breed with their dad's and grandpa's and more wild
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-23,nows when the fun starts
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,big congrats on breaking 1 million views! absolutely amazing man.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-06,grandpawhy im i breeding with you?
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,one hell of a family reunion....
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,thx for that tip .... i go test now
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"lamball and celaray makes wixen, not anubis. the easiest way to get anubis early is to breed tombat and sweepa"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,everytime i see anubis i think of the one clip where he dodged a bullet
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-16,this is basically yuji itadori a family tree its so random
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,"now just do a bunch of farm for honey, milk, eggs, and flour, get a pal with igni, built a cooking pot to make the cakes you need to breed pals, easy"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,this is some tennessee family tree right here
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,breed kitsun to astrogon you get legendary pal shodowbee
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,anubis looks suspiciously like a blacked out type null
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,"ive done all of your breeding pals here and the only one that is wrong is the 3rd one where you should get anubis, it will give you wixen."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-02,helzephyr is much better at transporting. they don't take a business hour to get moving and don't get stuck on terrain either because they're smaller and can fly.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,if other worldly cells is transferable i have a feeling your breeding pal trauma is about to increase
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"i will save this video for the future, thanks for the help"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-08,bro literally roast nature in 927582 languages

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,me wirh randomizer uhhhhh these been caught at lv 5'
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,only problem is that wild relaxaurus always come with glutton. if you make a bunch of anubis with glutton you are gonna to be making food for your base constantly
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,also if you 4 star all the pals with lvl 4 work skills they level up to lvl 5 in there skill and makes them even faster in those work skills
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"i bred a whole bunch of anubis eggs, just for their handiwork skill"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-26,the family tree is a whole wreath
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-11,that family tree is a plate of spaghetti

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,grizzbolt be slaying alot if ykyk.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,my grizzbolt is a boss  comes with its own girlfriend
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,why does the player character look like askeladd from vinland saga?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,thing about this is ull be lvl 30 before you breed like this considering the materials for cake you need. the bees themselves will keep from doing it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,celeray and lamball give me vixen every time
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,wow pokemon has really changed sinse i was a kid

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,"i find it funny theyre actually going through with this. i know cult of the lamb already did, but its still surprising."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-03,no game is complete without the ex update quoted from the laws of game creation

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,ok... now this game goes on another route

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,black marketeer triumph over all would bang 1010
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,"joke or not, chillet is the closest thing palworld has to a real, proper ice dragon, so he has to be the only correct answer!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,first what the heck i ask why second chillet is my favorite third that last part tho...
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,that moan got me laughing out loud... my parents woke up by the way.

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,chillet for... proper reasons..........
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,the fact that the black marketeers in the middle tells me that hes gonna be the best character
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,"they really just said fine, ill do it myself"

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,"ahh shit , cotl sex update became more than a meme"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-03,"not fully my infection au mostly my friends who i helped pitch ideas too, it's a unique take on the shows poison jolk that is more parasitic due to the seed of the jolk mixing with a invasive vine species to make a plant that can now infect a pony and use them like a host. the stages are lil fun too so i'll just list em. perpare for long read! stage 1 the pony is newly infected and simply assumes their hooves are stained by the poison jolk, eventually they act more dizzy and almost lost and ponies around them think they just might have a cold. stage 2 the hosts have more visible staining on the hooves and obvious veins in their bodies, they also become a little more sociable then normal while still seeming dizzy. stage 3 the host looking sickly now has even worse staining and the veins look black now, also the dorment vines in the body can now infect so they lay in wait until a pony is near the host body, when a living pony is near the vines launch out to try and infect or consume the living pony, all while the host is still conscious and dizzy. stage 4 the host body looks sunken in like a corpse and the body is more blue like the stained hooves, the host is no longer in control as the vines seek out more living ponies. stage 5 the final stage, the host is fully dead now and the vines have started to root themselves in the ground to grow into a bramble like patch to hopefully infect more ponies. because the plant is like a poison ivy with thorns, it infects ponies though physical thouch, though some infected ponies can bite to infect others the vines normally just exit the body to reach out. in stages 1  2 the host isn't dangerous just yet so stage 3 is when they do become a danger. sorry for the long read, but if you made it this far.. thanks for reading about my friends au!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,they should know the power of the internet by now  never promise something unless you make it clear its a joke. thats how you end up making a spinoff under duress thats somehow more popular than the main game

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,que buen video y est muy god que hayan agregado la mesa de dibujo para no estar farmeando tanto en conseguir los planos legendarios y est buena la caja dimensional pal para almacenar ms pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"ola, pero ola de mar porque ando en la playa"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,y yo que venda o tiraba los planos  que triste realidad
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"excelentes videos bro siempre los miro queria agregar que el icono para los humanos cambio, tambien queria preguntarte si se puede jugar con los personajes de los diferentes mundos al mismo tiempo como una especie de cooperativo local ya que mi hijo tiene su mundo y yo tengo el mio y lo otro es que vi un video de una casa en el arbol estilo japonesa no se si lo hallas visto pero era para ver si depronto puedes explicar como fue que la trabajo para los cimientos"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"graaaaaande zorra, muchas gracias!!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"uff que bueno, me fije que se actualizo pero no imagine que seria lo que vendra en la actualizacin, gracias zorragaming, me encanta como explicas. d"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"y yo que tiraba o vendia cientos de planos basura, y ahora me siento como un tonto. aunque una parte de mi, sabia que debia conservarlos."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"finally, trafico pal"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"hola, exc video, has pensado en hacer uno con las armas, como cuales son buenas llevar y donde conseguirlas?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"cada dia me gustan los cambios que hacen, me gusta que se puedan tranferir cositas entre partidas, asi puedo pasar los pals que ya me mat criando hace meses, aunque creo que para seguir criando seguira siendo mejor en partidas privadas ya que en servers oficiales la crianza tarda mucho, lo de los planos esta bueno, nunca habia dedicado tanto tiempo a armas epicas o legendarias, supongo que ser bueno farmear full eso ahora, seria bueno que se pueda hacer venta de pals entre jugadores, no se qie tan conveniente sea, o intercambios, aunque en servers con randoms creo que estaria dificil porque nunca falta el vato castroso que nadamas jode porque si"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"725 en nintendo switch hay un boton para screenshot, quizas el empleado que le toco, penso cada quien tiene su boton de pantallazo, dejalo asi no mas"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,arreglaron el bug de la estacin petrolera en el que los pals no luchan ni se mueven?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"crearas un servidor para jugar con subs? si la respuesta es si, crees que seria posible activar lo de llevar los pals de otros mundos porfa"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"pregunta, como apilaste las camas?"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"perfecto, ayer estaba en el directo pero por culpa del trabajo no pude escuchar casi nada xd por cierto, an sigue pasando en xbox cloud lo del mapa borrado y el cierre del juego por el tamao del archivo"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"apenas me enter de la actualizacin y esto haciendo pruebas para poder pasar pals a otros mundos en otras plataformas tengo juego en steam y xboxl pero no encontraba como se hacia tal cual y moviendole a cosas di con una forma pero aun no se si esa es la forma o hay una forma mas directa y segura... tecnicamente mi metodo es el que quiera un clon, meti mi personaje secundario que es de xbox a la principal que es de steam, y entonces para poder clonar tengo que agarrar un pal de la caja dimensional de mi mundo de steam con mi personaje de xbox para ponerlo en la caja de mi base temporal en ese mundo y de ahi pasarlo a la caja global y clonar, salirme y en mi mundo de xbox al meter a la caja global ahi esta el clon para pasarlo a mi caja de base... esa es la forma en que se va a hacer o hay otra forma mas rpida?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,mi estimado podrias hacer tu una guia de ssar pals de crianza o como sacar los que son exclusivos o no estan?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"y para jugar entre ps5 y pc que recomiendas, un server oficial podria ser?"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"funciona cualquier tipo de plano o si quiero de arma ocupo usar los de arma epico para sacar los de legendarios?,o se puede 3 epicos de casco para sacar 1 legendario de arma?,y sabes si cuentan los planos que vende el vendedor?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"est muy bien que los humanos ahora tengan aptitudes de trabajo, pero... cuando van a poder atacar con sus armas? xk tener un to enorme con una gatling y que no dispar con ella... hace que solo sean tiles los del bate de bisbol"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"hola, gracias por el resumen, me dio mucha info que no conocia y daba paja leer jaja y otra cosa que me gustaria preguntar, no se si el crossplay funciona en xbox one a steam, porque 1 no puedo hostear una partida multijugador 2 no me deja unirme a una partida multijugador de steam al menos que es donde probe no se a que se deba eso, ya que cuando intento unirme me carga y me manda al menu otra vez y para hostear literal me dice que no puedo post data lo estoy jugando con game pass normal, no el ultimate, no se si afecte tambien en algo"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,ps5 no est jo
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,que juego mas aburrido ojala nintendo logre cerrarlo para siempre
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,"if a pal is caught, the homing sphere will be lostbut that's the price of simplified catching!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,you can also store food inside of a guild chest and it'll stop any spoilage.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,"to be fair, just about anything in the world is faster than a mound, since mounds can't move, they're just piled up dirt..."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,i like hangu but you can't shoot while gliding so i prefer to use galeclaw
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,i can only imagine someone's going to try to complete palworld only attacking with kicks. xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"also put a medicine cabinet with basic meds in your farm bases you dont visit as often, those pals will get sicker faster and this way they can heal themself"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,you can also press sort to stop anything and everything from rotting
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,also if you kill any pal and they are on the ground if you kick them you can move them away or launch them to mars
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"useless, but i was surprised. lmao love the honesty and the approach"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,you still want to do the research speed branch.. as the bottom of it gives a 2 increase to your pals attack and defense stats.. in each tree. totaling to 18
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,you can leap with the grapeling gun and the worst glider with a bit of good timing as early as lv 12. you can just aim from high areas down to the ground and use the momentum to fly with the grappling guns accelaration if you perform it correctly. pretty good to manuver dangerous high level areas with a lower level
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,kick only playthrough
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,pal expeditions are a thing. i somehow didnt know they existed until level 49
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,you still need the research branches cause they unlock the base damage and defense buffs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,actually helpful
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,my friend found out you could attack with the kick emote after accidentally kicking a person and getting jumped by the pidf
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,actually pals will only eat the left most food that contains what they need sanhunger so whatever is closest to left thay suits their needs is so what they eat
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,i discovered multibase research but never considered samebase multiresearch! thanks!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,palworld definitely tells you about assigning pals to specific things. i would've put in the method to stack garden plots to save space
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,me and a mate of mine were playing football with a dead lamball using that kick animation  they are unsurprisingly very bouncy
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-26,me kicking the level 10 bounty boss
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-07,halfway through the game i realized there was an option to toggle crafting dont make the same mistake
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,im lvl 60 but i only discovered the emotes and kick emote yesterday...
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"i'm breeding 18 pals at once, takes a good 30 minutes to collect all eggs and incubate them"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,the research thing never worked for me. once a pal is working on one all of them registered being used by that pal and assigning another pal changes who is working instead of having multiple
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,soooooo grind and grind and make tons of stations that take time to save time ..ok got it.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,making jetragon even more of a waste of time lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,thanks
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,"question... if you stack rsearch stations, does it cost more resources to use?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,i still forget how to emote on console.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,so if you use the homeming phere with the scatter shot sphere launcher how many spheres can you make orbit?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"i disagree on research, you will need those to get to the attack and defends ubgrades, what gives u at full research 18 attack and 20 defends for basepals raid."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-04,what mod are you using to give you the iv potential in the hud?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,i stopped playing this game for a month and surch it up on youtube. this is what is happening. this aint even the same gamr
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,salad or minestrone?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"i don't understand how these double jump boots work, is it normal jumping like space or do you need an extra key for that? i tried to jump twice for double jump, but even with the boots on, he just jumps once like normal."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,does the stat increase from the fruits transfer through breeding?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,how the f do you see the numbers like in the end ?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,i have a question is that. do u guys know what location put down a base can trigger raid event. i have 2 bases and 140 days lv45. i don't encounter even once raid.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,putting to the left in the feed box is not true.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,ok
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,are you indian
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,jump boots air dodge and a pal slot to move. not worth
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,first
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,jormuntide should get a huge speed boost when he is in the water. it is criminal how slow he is
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,jormuntide absolutely needs a rework as player's pal but not as a boss pal. it's literally a wiggly noodle that wants to get stuck on top of everything.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"the moment i saw orserk throw a fork at somebody, i knew he was the one for me"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,depresso. he is just so relatable
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,i remember hatching jormuntide ignis from a random egg i found when i was only lv27. i was so hyped. he has become my favorite when i gotta quickly smelt some ingots to repair armor before a boss fight. i can't wait to catchhatch the others.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,i really like kitsun. his passive skill makes him the best pal for traversing all areas due to him making you literally immune to cold and heat environmental damage!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"katress for design and decent stats that makes it work 247, fenglope for zoomies if you have swift and runner and finally quivern for being absolutely cute fluff dragon."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"sweepa, the pal above all"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,my fav is shadowbeak. no matter what. i just love him
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-17,"xenogard, could never forget the surprise when i was farming meteorites, expecting to see xenovaders like usual only to be surprised by it being there instead. also it being an absolute unit when i went after jetragon."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"never been much interested in survival games, but this one is really fun. i bet itll take a while, but ill look out for these!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,"i like suzaku and blazamout for design, love fenglope and amubis for how useful they are at the stage of the game where you have access to them"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"honestly, fenglope i've found can be extremely powerful when beefed up, and is faster, than paladius. and it tends to be smaller in normal size which means it fits even through every mineshaft, dungeon, even little crevices, and it's double jump is higher than paladius' triple jump. the mobility is far better, and less slidey. for getting around that i feel is the best terrestrial mount to get around with and again, can be quite powerful especially if you use the boss variant and a lucky one in breeding. i usually keep jetragon and fenglope in my party whenever i'm out exploring. there is something so satisfying about using it as a terrestrial mount, and i find myself using it more often than jetragon unless i'm crossing large swaths of mountains."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,orserk is crazy. i have one on my team and for the fun of it at a group of relaxaurus that were twice the level and bro decimated all of em with that lightning aoe move. cemented his spot on my team for sure lmao.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"mossanda lux. decent power, large as hell, two grenade launchers to knock back and destroy, has consistent feather fall, looks punk as hell, and is good for bases for wood cuttingpunching transporting and handy work. good pal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,frostallion or noct ver both of them are strongest imo due to their mount partner skills. when you mount on the horse u not only get the specific element  also enhanced the element atk meaning you can do insane dmg with rocket or any firearm this including their moves as well.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,i like direhowl because hes pretty good at all stages of the game and you can unlock his saddle early. also daedream as the necklace is easy to craft and it does great damage
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,my favorite pal is anubis speed work.. and fantastic attacks..
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"i just adore that foxsparks allows you to hug him while he sets everyone ablaze, i'm not gonna lie, early game that was fun as hell"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,paladious doin a double take ever sense those triple jump boots came out
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,"i've never been big on survival games, but this one is actually really enjoyable. it might take some time to get through, but i'll definitely keep an eye out for those"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,fenglope is my favorite ground mount. super quick and has super high double jumps.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,shadowbeak by far my favorite for combat. among non legendaries it has solid survivability and its exclusive skill divine disaster is fucken awesome.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,anubis and ragnahawk are my favourite pals. jormuntide is pretty big in fighting a narrow space and slow.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,the more i watch these the more i feel like playing the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,digtoise will always have a special place in my heart
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"paladins other half has an attack rating of over 1000 with just pal soul boosts, also boasts one of the scariest melee abilities in the game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,i love the flame sakuza with the masochist trait. he kicks everyone's ass
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"those are legendary, ofc you love it!!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,bushi and dazzi are my favorites. bushis badass yet chill vibe is so nice. then you have dazzi who canonically is a shiteating gremlin i and freaking love it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,my jetdragon is by far my favorite one. then mossanda lux bc of his rocket launcher partner skill. its so fun
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,my previous favorite was warp boar but they fixed the bug that made him so fast. used to be able to manual run at the start of the action rush to yeet him at faster than jetragon speeds across the map.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,anubis is my favourite
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,"flopie. i like how she just walk around with me, picking item for me and just being adorable while my jetragon is massacring everything"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,my orzerk that got divine dragon legendary ferocious and emperor of lightning passes thing is an absolute monster
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-17,"still new, but ive kept a shiny creamie in my party as my strongest so far 15 days in. i love it since i really like eevee."
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-06,chikipi is my favourite
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,the favorite one is the sheep one..  delicious
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,did not know the anubislooking pal was just straight up anubis
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,galeclaw and fenglope is a must for mid game imo. almost everything listed is endgame pal.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"fun fact, any flying type can hover over the water without consuming stamina."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,cant wait for more pals to be made and added to the game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,i took that neutral legendary and turned it into a fire legendary the way it was meant to be. it just makes sense for paladin to be a fire type instead of neut
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,yup. i use all of these but mainly jetragon and frostallion. jet for transportation and frost for battle
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,btw orserk is an amazing fighter
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,"warsect is my dude simply because i think it's cool, and i always go out of my way to get daedream first because it was my first pal on my first save. gotta love the big ol' beetle and the little galaxy sheep."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"my friend says that if he could be a pal in palworld, he would be kitsun. now i'm wondering what pal would i be only thing i can say is that i love fire and what pal would we get after our breeding? and yes, i know the shadowbeak breed pair, but i'm a little dissapointed in kitsun's partner here nonspoiler for those players who don't know"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-27,the orserk lightning tornado  lightning charge  throwing a fork combo is the best
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-22,thanks bro. my wifes been out of town for the last week!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-17,"i like that final clip, i like suzaku alot."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,the fact that that legendary has neutral damage just makes starter neutral boosters even more useful than i originally thought lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,finally someone who says jetragon the right way. most people ive watched say jet dragon
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,pengullet rocket launcher build is my favourite pal. making him fly like he wishes
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-01,"relaxaurus is one of my favourites, i mean look at the dude, hes just a silly fella"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,ive heard of palworld before but never played it
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,"i love unpaid intern 4  ankha zone my egypt lucarios i love how you can just give them every tm and swap out moves, they scale pretty well too."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-22,"my fav is frostallion, because it is the god of ice"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-29,"blazehowl noct was my go to before i found anubis, you can breed a lot of pals once you have anubis"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"i love my main pals frostallion, frostallion noct, orserk, grizzbolt, and jet dragon. a replacement when im breeding either of those is wumpo or wumpo botan!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,i love watching jormuntide ignis make ingots. it's like watching a machine spit out coins.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-09,"hangyu, grapple zooming is fun and good movement early"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-20,loveander. i am not ashamed of that.
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,not a popular choice but vaelet. even at lower levels i won a lot of alpha boss battles with her. she's very powerful in combat
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"shadowbeak with swift, runner, nimble is hands down my fav. it runs hella quick with minimal driftslide in both run and fly and is very strong with the right moves. my main flyer is faleris with same passives. its crazy quick and powerful, only minor downside is its agility driftsslides flying fast but it also keeps you warm in cold climates regardless of armour."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-08,"grizbolt is my favorite, it shocked me he pulled out gatling gun outta nowhere"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-14,cameraman not dies
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-01,"i recently bred an anubis with nocturnal, work slave, serious, and artisan. i am now working on getting it to 4 stars."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"i love swee and gumoss theyre just little guys  and foxcicle, cremis, univolt, pyrin, warsect. s tier designs, so good."
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-10,"i like the killamari my whole gamer theme is all about cephalopods like ammonites, octopus, cuttlefish and squid mainly ammonite tho"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-04,ok im convinced i should play pal worlds at this point
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,i have all of them other than the last two and jetragon is my dream pal
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,cattiva is simply goated
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-09,"my favourites and currently my main team pyrin noct, faleris, lyleen, anunis and orserk. honorable mentions rayhound and shadowbeak"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,currently my fav is quivern botan. cutest and coolest plus a truckton of damage and defense
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-04,i like warsect. dudes a beast and reminds me of digimon
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-18,this list is valid
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-28,bastigor. dudes a beast
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-03,i got this game for 30 bucks for ps5 and i have to say this its very very cool. i love it. we needed something like this for playstation. i hope they will not delete the game. the developers are doing a very very cool job.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,i got frostallion when i was around level 28 with 3 of my friends and it's been my favorite since.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-25,germantide... and jetragone... you're killling me
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,no pal beat depresso on favorite pal list. he is me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,i like mossandamossanda lux because of the area damage grenade launcher. grizzbolt is pretty cool too with the minigun
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-02,blazamut i think is amazing. good damage and just a beast.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,whipping them into shape
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-01,my favorite pals are the pals that we made along the way
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,never played it but will have to now.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-25,last one is my favourite
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,verdash is so good and so underrated
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,"lamball is 90 of why i bought this game, it just also happens to be amazingly fun lol"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-16,frostallion is a beast in traveling and fighting
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-31,the one he used when he asked which one is your favorite
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-17,"lol my jormuntide died in water cause of stamina loss. yes, water dragon just drowned"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,quivern is probably my favorite tie between him and astagon
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,"the best pals shockingly, the legendaries. who would've guessed."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-06,germuntide
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-19,my fav pal is lucario with egyptian cloth
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,yourmuntide is my personal headcannon for the pronunciation so far. we need an anime to confirm all these pal names
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-28,relaxaurus is probably my favourite. i have one named doopid and hes my favourite party member. i caught the boss relaxaurus lux and named him big doopid.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-06,"frostallion alpha version with decent upgrades is practically unstoppable, she anhilates everything"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,and zoe is cooking in our base is because she was capture before it patched out lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,"pocketpair lets cook, pals!  also pocketpair lets cook pals!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,we are always on your side pocketpair
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,a wholesome 2d palworld short? inconceivable.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,"it's things like this that make this game different, including the way they advertise and promote the game. 9 months and i'm still playing and having fun hunting pals, building bases and traveling through the islands looking for strong pals. thank you pocket pair. you guys are special."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,evil zoe rayne be like
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,first wholesome palwolrd video
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,these cookies are how we're gonna fund the legal battle

Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,"yesssssssssssssssssss flambelle on the main channel, finally!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,"a happy ending in palworld is one where no one is eaten, only symbolically."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,yay! flambelle getting attention!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,2d animation looking good pocketpair.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,i love how cute everything that comes out of this franchises even the stuff that's not cute is cute
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,not gonna lie i thought the joke at the end was gonna be that it only gave them like 2 points of hunger and they were still gonna complain
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-12,we should be able to recruit leaders after fighting them or see them pass in a camp like travelling marchants
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,"you know i never got a good close up of how her outfit actually looks like. mostly because the entire fight, im focusing on her pal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,no pals were harmed in this video...for once xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,flambelle? on this channel? what a good day to be alive.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-17,i hope the devs eventually get around to fleshing out the factions and their leaders in the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-25,"we need zoe, lily and rayne hiring options on our base immediately! we need to write an petition to pocketpair"

Survival,Palworld,2024-11-22,what a wholesome game....
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,you'd expect the leader of a criminal organization to act in a... less wholesome way
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-12,that very first scene is my team 90 of the time
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,should add those cookies to the game
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,flambelle cooking it. also flambelle not getting to eat any. lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,ooh you should do more interactions between the other tower bosses and their pals or maybe interactions between the tower bosses in general like zoelily or axelvic
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,from pals help pals to pals eat pals lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-13,that's so cute!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-24,awww iron mouse is such a great person
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,looking forward to have her as an ally in my base.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,kattiva cookies made with real kattiva
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-24,flambelle is possibly the cutest of all pals.

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"omg, a palworld animation where they dont die !!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-22,adorable!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,great now i would like a dlc or something where you can befriend and get the tower bosses on your side where they will help the player with collecting resources or by staying at base and keeping the pals happy...
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,she's a waifu . cute animation once again
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,we love when pocketpair cooks for us
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,i love the game and pocketpair in a whole. were with you no matter what
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,dont give up palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,"i want cattiva cookies now! pocketpair, that needs to be a thing on store shelves!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,"you gotta love the obvious difference in morals between zoe and palgirl, hope to see them face of in one of these shorts"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,that's nice to see. life is good.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,as soon as i saw the wiskers on the cookie i thought aint no way that's gonna be there after it bakes
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,so cute!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,how adorable!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,this is what happened to zoe after we folded her at the tower battle
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,awww i love it its cute!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,my pals deserve pizza and i will not have them eating anything lesser
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,cute! and no harm done on pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-25,zoe the better marnie
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-13,"it took me forever to figure out that higher quality food is just as important a creating hot springs. a pal with 50 sanity easily jumps back to 80 with a portion of pizza, and it works faster too! i don't like it when games hand hold me... but certain game mechanics could be explained a bit better."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,looks so friendly. all the pals represented by their personality.. now the lovander  goodluck making that even a tiny bit wholesome.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-12,i would really love it if you will make more animations on zoe
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-12,"lol, i love this game and the devs"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,"meanwhile, the player you don't need to eat, just work harder"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,"every time i fight a boss i use fire to make them feel a small part of my pain i live with on a daily basis, life is only hell because of other people and im lucifer."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,pals make their own food
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,so wholesome
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-26,and here i thought zoe had less survival skills than even a freshly shipwrecked player character
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,it seems like someone has already adapted to her life as a slave and is making the best of it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,"aww, this is adorable! i want a cattiva cookie!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,surprisingly wholesome  i guess only the player character is a monster
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,bring back the option to capture tower bosses pls. i need zoey for my base
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-08,"yknow, sucks that we have to battle her. sure, she's a tower boss, but this makes me actually wanna hang out with her in game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-20,"i don't need to feed them, they just drink mozareena milk as the rest farm berries and take turns during work shifts breaks plus i made a couple hot springs"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-10,i love palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,i wish we could pick her hairstyle. i love the two color pigtails.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,no disturbing moments... yet.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,this is soooooo cuuuuuuuute 3
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-09,very cute. but who let zoey out of the breeding pen?
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,as soon as i saw the depresso walking by with flour. i thought they were gonna deep fry and cook em
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,"awww me heart, this is to cute"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,adorable
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,let us capture pal trainers
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,"we need one of zoe and her grizzbolt now, this is just too precious u"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,"interesting how with official palworld animations, you never know whether you're going to get something wholesome played completely straight, or ruthlessly meanspirited humor."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,btw this is canon since tower bosses you captured with the old bug are still usable so you basically do have zoe in your base whether she wanted it or not.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,if only zoe was recruitable
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,everybody's gangsta until the flying animal with missiles comes out
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,if the pokemon devs made palworld they would've made paldius and necromus on 2 separate 60 versions of the game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,mewtwo just getting a little sloppy from his trainer
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,aint no one gonna talk about how he blew up that lucky cattvia
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,i think jetragon is a fusion of latios and salamance lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-12,aw yes palworld. a game which is basically if ark survival evolved and pokmon had a baby
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,i dont have time to talk about him conveniently because he isn't in the game officially since he was leaked
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-27,bro found paradox future salamance
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,this game did what pokemon refused to do. add guns.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,it really does scare me how quickly i started enjoying the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-23,jetragon kinda looks like a violet paradox form of latios
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,the mewtwo is only a model in the game files by the way
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,the flying ice one just looks like suicune with wings ..
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-15,"ah yes, latioslatias, suicune, and ceruledge with horse legs. my favorite pals"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,latios and latias? that's a salamence with iron moth's wings.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-23,"this game is some unholy combination of gta and ark, with pokmon mechanics thrown in. i love it!"

Survival,Palworld,2024-09-28,jetdragon is a fusion of pikachu and jigglypuff lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-28,paldius and necromus are like zacian and zamenda from pokemon sword and shield
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-16,jetragon is like selamence
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,"jetdragon is basically the american palmon, because nothing screams american like a fast moving jet that blasts you into nothing with missiles"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"jetragon is probably a reference to monster hunter, to be honest. he is a literal jet dragon and the crystals are red, all a possible hinthomage to valstrax the crimson glow."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-14,ceruledgeafter sees their species from different dimension do we have 4 legs?! armarougei need bleach...
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,the first one is identical to a semilegendary pokmon named salamence

Survival,Palworld,2024-08-02,"jetragon looks like salamence i think, just different wing style"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,love the ending. mewtwo.  but i dont have time to tell you how. meanwhile its a mod

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-28,jetragon is basically just a living version of the opressor mk2
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-10,"erm actually jetdragon has a greater resemblance to the pokmon, salamence"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,shadow beaks divine 12 attacks are probably the best out of all the flyers though.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-27,get it
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,the most unique atack of all times. the multicolor beam
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,the cyborg looking pals can also be called digimon lookalike so these pokemon must sue crap can get in line
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-06,nintendo suing them for the pokeball mechanic instead of the almost exact same pokemons is wild haha
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,frostalion looks like suicune
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,the horse is literally suicune recolored with added wings. this is insanity
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,how dare your fictional characters inspired by real life cats and dogs look like my fictional character inspired by real life cats and dogs   pokemon stans in a nutshell

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"listen i think this game is distinct enough that its totally not able to be claimed as violating copyright in and of itself but damn, these designs are literally just sentence mixed pokmon, its crazy."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-05,"bro, looks like latios and latias, by that logic, then so does salamence"

Survival,Palworld,2024-07-07,necromus and paladius also have a double jump of which one has a tripple jump but i always forgett which of the two
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-14,"basically latios, suicune armarouge and ceruledge, dark suicune and mewtwo"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-18,"so salamence, pawmo getting wrecked by tactical missiles, ice suicune, some kind of escavalierlike thing, dark ice suicune, and dark mewtwo"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,they all look unique to me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-29,"jetdragon looks kinda like dragapult, but latios"

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,how did you get that mewtwo from pokmon tekken?
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,jelagon looks exactly like salamence
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"literally ark, elden ring, and pokemon"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-05,jetragon looks more like a mixture of latioslatias fused with salamence.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,tier list
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-30,this is how you start off pokmon as an adult. tired of always starting as a kid in the game lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,use code pair in the fornite item shop i now its phaleur
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-08,everyone is gangsta until i delete the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,dumb comments trying to say they look like specific pokimon..pokimon looks just like other creatures before its time so doesnt really matter man
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,"fro stallion looks like a fusion of suicune, articuno and rapidash"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-01,jetadragon looks like salamance in pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-10,the puns following with the get it help me
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,mewtwo has a pretty unique name
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,jetta gon looks like latios and latias damn dont even mention salamance then
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,the mewtwo says edit this one
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,"one is blue, and the other is re b l a c k"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,jetdragon looks way more like salamence with a jetback
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-12,black sounded way too aggressive
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-26,the crystals on the first ones back are the same as iron moths
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,aint no way bro didnt didnt say jetragon looked like salamance
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-07,this first looks much more like salamance then latios
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,honestly jetragon has always looked more like a salamance to me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,jerdragon or whatever clearly resembles salamence waaaaay more than latios and latias cmon
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,palworld is literally a combination of pokemon and ark
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,i havent seen devs listen to their community this well in so long its so refreshing.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-04,"ah, yes the good old palworld habit of trying to capture anything that moves"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,"game of the year, without a shadow of a doubt"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-28,lets have a pal battle gets kidnapped
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,the black marketeers don't retaliate when someone is talking to them. the level 50 guy has a level 50 helzephyr that loses its brain once he dies. so basically a free level 50 helsephyr. and a free 10k.
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-14,"i can comfirm that you can, indeed, steal the random pal traiers pals lol i found out the second time i found one was like can i steal their pal? its palworld, i can capture people, no way i cant steal their pal and thats how i ended up with a gobfin before level 10 lol"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,"you missed some. they changed the icon for the milk . there's also an illegal pal seller that wonders the map. i found one smuggling 3 dusmud he was walking with 3 dusmud following him, it was so cute. i can't wait for the game to exit early access. i just can't get enough of it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-13,pal trainers who wanna make their pals happy while not wanting to kill certain pals for that in the process rejoice
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-16,"i am a huge pokemon fan, but have recently started playing palworld because it became available on ps5. despite of the resemblance it bares, i think that they are very different. i did not expect it to be so complex, difficult and yet extremely fun!!! i dont even want to rush through it, sometimes i am just happy dismantling and rebuilding stuff at my base. i have just taken penking down  there is so much to do! simply incredible."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,pokmon i beat you i get bragging rights palworld  i beat you and i own you
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,ive seen the shady pal merchant and the tamers and i can confirm you can catch the tamers and their pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-23,i wish they would've added a pal to drop electric organs but mainly base building add some circularcorner pieces to the builds like for the roofs and floor
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-04,"some pals now have their own idle animations .. like orserk streching, jormuntide sometime just looking right and left with a specific manner, dumud being a silly little goofy guy.. etc"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-16,i faintly hear prepare for trouble when i see random trainers
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,"im pretty sure the kelpsea and dumud ones were written in the patch notes lol. however the next 2 i found out on my own, and the last one i havent seen yet!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-13,will be back to this game when its full release
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,i am really really hoping they fix the terrain. tired on having a flying pal on me because of false floors and cliffs
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,they buffed my vixy! lez goo!
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-14,this is hon3stly so exciting i love being part of a playerbase that gets listened to
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,that pal fluid was a pain i will definitely try that now
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-10,"the vixy method really comes in handy for farming spheres, but now we can run them through crushers for paldium too  anybody still having crashes in caves?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-25,farming mamorests thing of the past melooking back at the trail of dead turtles and cotten candy sheep
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-14,i actually came across a trainer who had a marlith and he was tough but i killed him and took his cryptid for myself
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,"fun fact, there's a friendly paltrainer in a cave somewhere on feybreak, and if you talk to them, they give you a random book to instantly bump one of your pal's work suitability stats by one. for example, getting jormuntide ignis from lv4 kindling to lv5."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-13,wait what! where do u find a pal trainer? i never seen them but that is so cool.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-11,i've ran into a crule pal tamer and a new pal trainer and they both wanted a fight to the death lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-07,the last one catching the pal and trainer was the funniest shtt ive ever done
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,i capture the cruel pal tamers just for the ironic punishment.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-26,pretty sure the mud one could always drop pal oil at the ranch.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,the last one be like imagine losing a pokemon duel and the enemy can just capture you and your just his slave
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,yep you can steal their pal. xd i tried it out of curiosity since you can catch people. i was determined to give it a better home lol.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-20,"i play like team rocket  i capture their pal, then i catch them"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,going to turn into team rocket for the last one
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,i tried fighting one the trainers and as soon as i accepted her disappeared. sad times xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,so i ran into a pal battle on accident before this update. it was in the red forest with a syndicate goon that pulled out an incineram to help him fight. idk if anyone else found him and if it caught you off guard too
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-04,when i saw the trainer another one for my collection
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-09,my captured up and coming pal trainer calls me a coward when i decline a duel. i put them back in the pal box for time out.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,"if you're dumb enough to throw out a pal fighting me, you deserve to lose posession of it to me"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,i capture the trainers and leave the pal to live their best life.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-11,"i enjoy running around on foot and messing around, and i've only seen 1 npc pal trainer in the wild since may"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-09,i saw a random trainer randomly when i came back to palworld after many months. i got excited it was like finally a trainer encounter? normally its boring or annoying in pokemon but at least you can steal their pals and capture the trainer
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-18,my dream of capturing trainer along with their pokemon became a real thing.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-08,we need farmable electric organs. blowing up sparkit and hezephyr lux is just mind numbing.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,can confirm you can most certainly capture the trainers
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-10,i hope they continue the trend of making certain pals drop organs even if it doesn't make sense since going out and hunting pals is really inconvenient and i feel bad
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-24,wit the last one i found a trainer. caught his pal then caught him
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,"true i don't know if it's count but i got some encounter with syndicate that summon pal, i steal his inceneram but kill the owner in the process."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,ok now that last one just makes me think they are trying to become more like pokemon with the random trainers
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,"im pretty sure they announced all of this, maybe try their ur channel and steam logs"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,the  other pal tamers have been in since last update
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-24,heres five secrets they dont tell you in palworld bro its literally in the paldeck
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-04,i caught a lvl 50 pal tamers. she lives in my viewing cage now along with my other human captives.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-12,just started the game. first time i came across an npc that challenged me i captured his pal and the trainer. it felt morally wrong since i didnt actually expect it to workespecially since the description also states that it is wrong. but it was also funny as hell.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-24,pal trainers have been around since before the update. i actually fought my 1st and only one way before this update was announced
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,the last ine is true i did it thinking i found a new pal also thinking the guy was a enemie
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-05,this game is so burning by yourself.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-08,"yeah the 1st time i came across a pal trainer, talked to them and they were shit talking to me so i took their pal and captured her as well now they are both working as slaves in my oil base whos the shit talker now?!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-02,thanks for the information
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-05,all great changes
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,i love drinking pal fluids
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-12,coming into the game fresh for the first time with all these mechanics and it's awesome. hoping to see more good stuff. and that pokemonnintendo hopefully drops or loses the lawsuit.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,algirithim came in clutch. was wondering how to farm pal fluids.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-26,oh hell yeah!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,im pretty sure demud was already dropping pal oil before this update... also! something to mention is a guy naned dr. brawn who aill preform a experimental surgery on a pal of your choice... it can greatly help or really hinder said pal's states and abilities.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-16,merchants can steal pals as well
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,wait capture the trainee im horrified what people are gonna do
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,literally caught the pal n trainer last night can farm after capture
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,i've caught 1 of each npc pal tamer  they'll rot in the palbox forever
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-20,you know what's funny i found all of that update all by myself
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-03,i have heard real world pal theft might be a thing in real world battles
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-05,came across a nest earlier with 3 eggs in and loads of pals was the wolves
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-30,can confirm you can steal the pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,"i been farming high grade oil, thank you so much"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,there is no way you thought pal trainers were real online characters
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"dumud has been dropping oil since launch, never farmed mammorrest for oil early as he is lvl 38 as bossalpha and lvl 2838 in world wandering."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,i now must hunt for alot of horse vaporeon and oil ups for the pal fluids and oil
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-27,the mud looks familiar
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,5 tips big pal doesnt want you to know
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-26,i havent experienced that last one at all
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,imagine being a pokmon trainer and some 10year old pulls up on you at low health steals your best friendpalpokemon then catches you and keeps you in a ball forever
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,i still havent saw a random pal trainer i cant wait to find one
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,you can steal the pal and capture the trainer. i have committed multiple instances of human trafficking.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,these would be great for security
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,if you butcher anubis you have a chance of getting tech manuals
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,hyper spheres almost never drop even at level 4 for me
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-13,
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-28,they could put eletric organs farming in ranch
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,i havebt found a wondering trainer yet but when i do they will be my next pal
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,they do if you read the patch notes
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-11,litterally killed that mammorest at least 1000 times for hq pal oil
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,"ok, whaaaaaaaat?!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-18,only the pal trainers walking around the world are new everything else has been here since the beginning of the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,kelpsi always did that
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-17,would be nice if they made it you have a party of npc trainers or something instead having capturing them
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,capture the paltrainer you said.......oh my
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,im proud to say i mever farmed mammorest... but when i look back... cativa...and other low levels... i killed in billions!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-23,i have a whole base of dumuds just for the oil
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-06,o shoot yea i just ran into random trainer i didn't know it was new
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,wooooah. pal fluid?! ya serious? ive been ignorant this whole time
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,i like to capture both pal and trainer and put them in the same base
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,this game is basically the child of arksurvival evolved and pokemon arceus legends. i am all for it honestly! some of the monster designs are cool.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-19,crazy how its more polished than an actual pokemon game
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,"this is literally what i imagined a future gen pokemon games should look like! well, without those crafting survival mechanic."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,"never played ark or pokemon but just watching gameplay around yt, this game looks fantastic. it doesn't just keep you in a static zone or age where you have to live in huts and gather wood, ore and small pals forever. it has real progression and modernization not only with tech but also with the pals. there's always something to be pursuing and it encompasses creativity such as base building. i'm getting it but just have to wait and see what platforms it ends up on."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,some company i never heard about actually made a pokemon game way better than nintendo ever did.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,bruh i love this game and how its literally just shitting on pokmon while also being a fun game thank god there are still game developers with the stones to do things like this
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,i like how the pals can have different elemental types. would be cool to have a team of just one chickens but one of each type lmao.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,"playing it rn and dude its sick, clearly noticeable that it isnt fully finished yet and that theres a lot to polish but thats not a bad hting, i absolutely love the idea and the game will hopefully pick up in popularity and get even more development. im not watching the vid cause i wanna experience shit myself but ill definitely come back once im done"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,"i watched the video from start to finish. thank you for your hard work and this video. i'm looking forward to playing it myself, and your video has made me want to play it even more."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,"i feel like you could have rotated your pals more during boss fights, since their attacks have cooldown. your pals spent a lot of time just staring down the final boss"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-19,"gotta say that since i saw the first footage of this game i thought it would be something silly. turns out it is pretty well put together. aside from the critters, i think it would be even better if they could implement a more distinct style for things like the buildings and equipment. styles that mesh with the pals more."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"tip for fighting boss at early levels is engaging them somewhere with rocks nearby. allows you to strafe around for healing, and switching pals."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,cj please do a full series when this launches! this game looks absolutely sick and i cant wait to pick up my copy.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,"dude, i've seen quite a few videos of people playing at this game and you have accomplished far more than all of them together. 1010 dude, just an awesome travel through palpagos"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,"the combat is looking so much better them in the trailers on their channel it looked like everyone was a damage sponge and you just clicked attack constant until the enemy finally died, in this video i'm seeing a nice balance between easy and hard battles with some good damage that don't let things stretch out too much."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,if pokmon takes this game down i will never buy a pokemon game ever again
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,my dude has grinded to get this video out! can't wait to watch it!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,entertaining video! i had a good time watching it. a tip for the final boss fight keeping jetragon out for so long ruined your dps. his attacks have a long cooldown before firing again. you could take the boss out if you recall and cycle through all of your pals after they fire their volley of attacks so you keep up your dps while they recharge their attack cooldowns. you are correct in that the ten minutes is definitely not long enough to defeat him unless you are cycling your pals during their attack cooldowns.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,"omg that is way better than i was expecting, and i had high hopes already"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,"glad this game exists so pokemon fans can be taken out of their shell and see that it is possible to make a better poke game, they just choose not to."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,"would love to see a deep dive on breedinginfusion. i saw that infusing levels up the pal ability. i'm wondering what that's going to do for pal abilities like flying or vixy's 'when ranching sometimes dig up items'  which includes pokeballs. is it going to dig up better stuff or just more? also definitely going to try running 4 daedream and failing that, infusing the heck out of one. also can you try capturing a wandering shopkeeper? i saw one of the streamers catch an interactive tip giving npc last night and it kept its normal dialogue. shopkeepers might work the same! looking forward to the 19th!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,ngl i really like the progression of this game like you have to work not only for the basic tools and weapons but also progress from muskets to modern day guns that's pretty rad
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,"it's like a monster hunter, ark survival evolved, and the newer generation of pokemon games all combined into one. sounds like a great idea"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,beating pokemon into subjugation is what team rocket was all about yet they never allowed us to join them
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,everybody says hoocrates but i think its hoocrates like the philosepher socrates. lol because he looks like a little philosopher. edit another thing i realized is the relaxuarus is litterally a way to relax in a fight... which makes so much sense lol he's also just so derpy and perfect in so many ways def a must have in a team.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,literally imagined this game and wished for it as a kid growing up in the 2000's well done palworld  i'm excited to play this with my kids. thank you.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,this honestly looks exactly like i hoped
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"people for the protection of pals is a riff on peta, which has long been controversial because peta very much doesn't treat animals ethically xd"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,"eikthyrdeer is a reference to eikthyrnir the mystical stag that stands on top of valhalla and chews upon the branches of lrad sometimes also called yggdrasil, as it chews on the branches the sap falls and makes up the rivers that surround the homes of the aesir."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-12,this looks better than pokmon 100
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,"nice video! palworld isn't really my style of game, but i'm always glad to hear when an indie game finds success"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,"to give an answer for your question to enter the island with the big tree on it. at the very beginning of the game, this pad said the towers are the keys, the tree holds the truth. i'm not that far in the game atm, but i guess you have to beat all tower bosses to get access to the tree island"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,victor seems more oriented towards multiplayer with how much hp he has. i hope they change it so solo worlds can beat him in some way
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-06,"4920 another good option is if you built your base along the path of the mammorest, you wait till its walking past your base and then attack it. it will begin to attack your base and the whole base will defend."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,endgame turns into godzilla vs kong.i really hope the smaller pals are still viable towards the endgame. even if it just takes some work.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-05,"best palworld playthrough i've seen so far. i'm convinced that palworld is one of the best games of 2024, period."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,it's like pokemon mixed with the stanford prison experiment
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,"wumpo is my favorite fellow, he just sits around slapping trees and carrying stuff"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,might want to repair that amor so u take a bit less damage lol but loving the vid cant wait to play
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,pal world is the most powerful game out right now. this is insane omg. its a must play. game of the year if you ask me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,you not having a done shield on the whole beginning really drive me nuts lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,3025 sounds like he missed a lucky pal in the distance with that chime
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,thank you for making this can t wait to get my hands on palworld!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"the funniest thing in this game is the traders literally selling you back your pals thats youve dropped in the past, they thought of everything"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,this is what ever pokemon next gem game we wanted and never got so thank god be palying friday asap
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,i like how well they designed the abuse of the pals. ther is no blood in this game but yet it looks so graphic. this game is iconic
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,"i have no idea if the devs are listening but i have an idea, mythical spheres they guarantee that you would catch the pal that you're wanting to catch but the downside would be they are extremely expensive to craft to balance it out so you couldn't just crank them with the assembly line"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-23,"i literally can recall my first few hours in palworld, i was so focused on taking out that lvl 36 mammoth pokemonpal near the first base area that i died like a gazillion times trying to pull off some ds kinda gameplay. this game is so funny at times"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-25,"really feel like palworld should give levels for the tower bosses, because you're supposed to challenge the syndicate tower around level 15 but so far i've seen 3 people avoid it until lever 25 lol"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,i love the concept of this game so much
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-17,you can catch humans that's cool
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,the fact he caught like all the pals i have missing so far in the first 30 mins
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-18,"game looks incredible. when it drops on consoles, it looks like a must have"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,this game is everything i wanted in a pokemon game since getting older
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,this is awesome! thank you for sharing!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,1630 hedgehogs! these are hedgehogs
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,a new game to the steam wishlist
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,i love how this is more fun and better than any game pokemon has ever released.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,i spent 100 in game days completing palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-16,hyper beam had me laughing so bad. dude your so funny
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-18,"i love the zelda botw, ark, pokemon mixup"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,lol mozarina!! its named after cheese!! bro took that personally
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"aaa games is spending about million of dollars for realistic game that realistic game gollum or the day before. choose your pill... small studio is working hard and only spends 10,000 small studio what if i make mmorpg like surreal mobile game ads into reality but only pokemon clones? that game masterpiece"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,this gane is actually more like child of ark survival and legend of zelda botw with pokemon arceus as step dad
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,people like to compare this game to pokemon. but i find it closer to dragon quest than pokemon. people probably say pokemon instead because they havent played dragon quest.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,fans of ark will love its survival aspects. fans of breath of the wild will love its combat and exploration. fans of pokemon will love the critters. fans of factorio will love the automated base production fans of world domination will love the ability to capture humans and make them forced laborers it has a little something for everyone.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,game literally just comes out random youtubers i played 100 days of this game! you wont believe what happened?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,this is the game we all wanted when playing pokemon red and blue on the gameboy  nostalgia at its finest

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,"cjthecheesedj one thing that might have helped defeat the last boss was having multiple pals out at the same time? have something like dazzi, flopie, or daedream and put a necklace on it then use its partner ability."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-16,this game make pokemon scarlet and violet look like a complete jokethe fact that this looks better
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,this man is a legend the game only came out a few days ago.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-12,can pals evolve
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,13328 maybe a firedragon pal with ice skills fire to negate the frost attacks and dragon to negate the dark attacks and ice skills to go up against the weekness or maybe it doesn't need to be a drogon type because those could be dragon skills so probably a fire pal with ice and fire skills
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-20,"basically the kid from zelda, ark survival and pokmon. me and my friend are really enjoying this game!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,wooooww... i don't know what to say so much grind man painful yoo
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,"the latest pokemon game scarletviolet was released with an incomplete map, that still isn't filled in even after 2 dlcs, this game on release already looks like so much more fun"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"2737 i was like c'mon luna oh, yhis is palworld"

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"not sure if anyone has mentioned it here, but you can catch the bosses too! just get a wanted level, get the cops to chase you into the boss battle, and as soon as they hit the boss once, just throw a ball and you auto catch them.  if anyone didnt know this, yw!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,"awesome try, caught almost every pal in the 100 days."

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,3629 the way it rolled always kills me
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,they killed the designs here. better than the vast majority of fakemons and its all pretty coherent! the abilities are crazy and the guns are fucking hilarious
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"fun fact if you are riding chillet and shoot from its back your shots become enhanced with what it appears to be its type purple and deal a looot more damage. at least if you use a crossbow, havent tried it on anything else yet."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,"to beat victor, you can breed pals with better passive skills, especially the attack. don't sell the pals with bad passive skills, they can be used to strengthen your best pals as well. dragons are good against victor, which is dark. furthermore, you can let pals eat food to increase their attack, and pal souls can strengthen their attack as well. another way is to beat victor is by strengthening yourself and use weapons like rocket launcher."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,"cant be the only one who gets legend of zelda breath of the wild vibes from this game, the shrines, the sounds everything."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-05,i feel like the only english content creator left on this game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,i love how this video spent 100 days playing palworld nonstop. even in my opinion i play less time because my first impression was just basically fortnite and borderlands combine
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"2822 literally just this games version of peta, a funny mockery at that."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"awe, i can't use the hot springs... that's not fair... as he has a pal labor factory surrounding him"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-28,you have a drop fps but good content this is really fun

Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,"just started playing this game yesterday, and i'm having a blast! there's a lot of good things about it, but the rag dolls are great"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-21,"the second i realized i could capture people, thats all i did for over an hour, those idiots dropped me extra capsules when i failed to capture them. basically i ran back and forth through a dungeon and they responded every time i left to a different room. at a 10 capture rate, it only takes around 10 capsules per thug. i got around 2 capsules per 3 man group, so it i captured around 1 thug per every 15 i defeated. i've got over 20. i can't wait to level up enough to use the condeser."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,i still think its hilarious that you can catch people and their pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,"the incineram was owned by one of the people, but the game doesn't care. you can steal them without repercussion."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"bro watching the base pals not be treated for their illnesses or injuries actually hurts me inside, great video overall but i just had to say something"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,128 you gave your anubis an eating disorder...from stress. i didn't even know that was possible
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,"if you had souled and condensed your bastigors you would have had a nice fight with xenolord. as it stands you were missing far too much in terms of numbers for the raid. all in all great vid and congrats on what you accomplished in 100 days, even with boosted xp!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"you can actually get to feybreak the moment you can make a surfent saddle. may take a bit to get there, but absolutely possible to do."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,"i love hoocrates, but mostly because his name is like hippocrates and he's my favorite philosopher and physician."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"the raids remind me a lot more of ark bosses, as they take the same level of stupid preparation over several weeks. cool for the people who want to put in the time for it though."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,"hello cj, i hope you have been well lalely. this whole 100 days palworld video was very enjoyable to watch, and there were so many new things with the feybreak update, the rainbow passives are 1 of them, and 1 of the rainbow passives is called remarkable craftsmanship, this passive gives you're pals a 75 in their work speed, and trust me cj, pairing this passive with passive that have the 50, 30 and 20 work speed and giving them pal souls to help make the work speed even stronger will be game changing, it truly is. anyways, i hope that the info on the remarkable craftsmanship 1 of the rainbow passives and the rainbow passives helps you out and take care now cj."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"the fact that he got a compound bow in less than 40 days single player, when it took me and 2 other people almost 75 days to get everything necessary to craft a production line, weapon line, and sphere line...damn"

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,"love how nearly everyone calls paldium, paladium."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"hey, for the mimogs... hanging trap. it works perfectly, sneak up to it, build it and it's hanging upside down and can't do a think until you throw a pal sphere. put on a ring of mercy and go to town and then you can easily get a few of them. edit the pal disassembly line had my jaw drop. i did not know about that tech, holy fuck pocketpair has a fucks deficit. that is amazing."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,i was almost screaming the entire time because he didn't get a ring of mercy but i have no idea if it was even in the game at the time. with a ring of mercy you can shoot or hit a pal like crazy but it will always have 1 hp left so long as it isn't chip damage like fire damage. makes catching pals crazy easy. great video overall though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"its crazy what you can do with this game with changing server stats. im just over 100 days in, and im only level 3738, you seemed to get there in half the time. you levelled up far quicker and some things surpassed me so quickly but then there were so many things i was like broooo how do you not have that?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"they added an new update, i was already thinking of a play through of it again but now im excited to do it"

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,"this is what pokemon should have been if they wanted to make more mature ideas for the universe. we need slavery, catching human, butchering pokemon and human for part to use as weapons, base making, flying faster and better more open world on your pokemon, better world design with many different environments like desert, arctic, forest, mountain, caves, and more fantasy design area like the world tree in pal world feybreak area"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,"base building is very difficult and takes many hours of experience to learn the techniques needed to build a base of your dreams, unfortunately the game isnt decide to have easy building"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,what were your ratessettings? just interested.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,625 not the 200 pump
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,i'm still baffled that this game was even allowed to exist.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"i love this game, my world has 240 days but seriously, its stupid the amount of time you need to waste breeding perfect pals, condensing and soul them for just a boss fight, i'm planning on do that obviously with custom settings so i dont go insane breeding over 2000 bastigors"

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,i've used your beginner guides for several games over the last few years. i'm consistently impressed with the level of detail you put into them. they really are excellent. thank you.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,"im over 110 hours on this game and i can't get enough. seriously, for 30 bucks i've never been this impressed with a modern half price game"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-26,this game just launched today on playstation and ive been wanting to play this game since xbox got early access.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"just to be clear, it's 4163264 for each additional star for a total of 117 pals including the base pal. it's a lot of investment for sure, but it you're breeding for good passives anyways, you'll usually end up getting to that goal in the end anyways. and furthermore, if you get to the point where your boxes are getting kinda full from breeding, you could always shove them into a viewing cage temporarily, since they can store up to 40 additional pals. 3 also, the viewing cage can be used to quickly revive your pals too, since you can pop them in and they automatically go into a resting state when placed in the cage. they'll appear dead when you shove them in there, but when you take them back out they'll have at least 1hp."
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-01,"for people who turned off items drop on death, you can just click respawn from options to immediately be able to teleport to base if you dont feel like finding the nearest fast travel tower"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-21,"as a new player playing with some friends, i needed to understand 'what on earth is this game about' and 'how do i play?!'. this video was super helpful and covered things that my friends did not. thank you so much for this content"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,i cracked up when you said pokemon instead of pals at 2739. my gf and i say it all the time.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,"10 10 video. i've already been playing quite a bit, and have only made it 30 minutes into your video. so far i haven't learned anything new, yet i'm completely enamored with your style of video and am loving listening to you! i highly recommend this video for anyone new to palworld or who has been playing palworld and just wants to be able to listen to some enjoyable content about the game! keep up the awesome work, i just want you to know that your content is appreciated!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,i need this guy to be my professor and explain things
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,palworld has been my first survival game and been on quite a long break since the release. found this video very interesting and helpful as i was watching it and starting brand new again.
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-03,"just bought this on playstation and im absolutely in love! tweaking the world settings is super fun. a pokemon game with guns and the abilities of a god. pure sandbox madness. after moving on from beating the elden ring dlc, this game is a welcome sight. completely hooked"

Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,"this tutorial has helped me so much, ive been struggling trying to figure the game out. thank you so much."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"the best movement tip i can give is what the community has dubbed galeckaw hopping. when you initiate gliding, galeclaw gives you a movement bonus in the direction you're facing. so not only can you use the sliding momentum bonus, you get an additional little air dash when the glider is activated. honestly, this is best used in boss fights as a air dash to avoid big aoe attacks."
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-29,"thank you thank you! i tried palworld once before and felt kind of lost and aimless. after a quick watch through of your video, i jumped back in thinking i still wouldn't understand and sure enough i was immediately zooming through play and loving it! awesome guide"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,i finished enshrouded and started this and it's got me hooked.

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,"thank you so much for taking the time to make these. i've been playing for a little bit but, this is the first survival game i've tried so, i've been struggling to wrap my head around the mechanics. can't wait to start a new playthrough now with everything i've learned. amazing video, thanks again! keep up the awesome work!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,"hell yeah i been waiting for this video. your by far the best game guide creator, and your guidesvideos always reflect that. keep up the good work bro"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,this is by far the best introduction and overview to palworld i've encountered. thank you!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,i love your guides. always concise and informative. always awesome.you have helped me a great deal. thank you so much.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,been waiting for this! great vid! thanks bro! and hellooo!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,"while the fast teavel points are a little annoying, i do enjoy that the game doesn't just let you freely travel like that. it forces you to explore and delve deeper into the late game options for mobility. feel like you're moving too slow? get a grappling gun and a gliding mount, gliding is a much faster way to traverse, and you can spam it. grappling gun also lets you cut climbing time in half, if you look for points on a cliff you can stand on. still feel like you're moving too slow? get a ground or flying mount, get a faster ground or flying mount. upgrade both of those mounts for the fastest mounts in game. palworld gives you the ability to dominate the map, it just doesn't hand it to you. thats something i really enjoy. it also gives you bases, which if used correctly, can set a fast travel point to anywhere you need. i have a base for iron, coal and i plan on setting one for quarts. the tower warp at the volcano can be farmed for sulfer. that covers all of my needs. i could blend my iron and coal farms to free up one of my bases if i wanted to be more efficient. my coal farm also has tucotuco spawns for gunpowder, right by anubis spawn. also doubles as palfluid farm with damud"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,thank you for this! i bought the game but didn't really like it right away. watched this video and tried again and now i'm really loving it!

Survival,Palworld,2024-09-06,"watched the first 3 minutes of the video and determined, yep, i need to start over..."

Survival,Palworld,2024-11-25,"i advise using the wooden club on small pals and getting your capture bonus on lamball, cattiva, chikipi, and tanzee. use the bat as soon as possible but dont unlock the bow. keep using the bat until you get high enough to unlock the crossbow or you can run around and open chest until you find the crossbow schematic. doing this saves a decent amount of tech points and lets you advance a good bit pretty fast since when you unlock the crossbow that early youll be one tapping a lot of small pals and itll be easier to melt the weaker alpha pals"

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,thanks for the awesome video
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-15,finally gave in and bought the game today and honestly so far it's great! i'm a little overwhelmed with some of it but being a new player that's normal. but i am absolutely in love with the elements of this game!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-17,thank you!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,as someone who just bought this game tonight! i want to play this with my partner do we have to play online or can i invite her to my world?

Survival,Palworld,2024-11-14,this is a type of game we want from pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,hello lucky ghost i am in a dilemma. i want to buy palworld but its still an early access on the steam deck. should i buy it because its still an early access and then wait to play it or should i wait to buy it when it is out of early access that is my dilemma so could you give me some info so i know what i can do so i could feel better because i really wanna play this game so much.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,i wish the multiplayer for playstation was more multi player. from what i can tell you can only have 4 people join with your code which doesnt make sense when it lets you choose how many guilds and stuff there can be cause right now you can only have the guild you have theres not really much room for people to make more. and it says 130 for the guild even though you cant have that many people in your world

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,frostalion noct us the strongest dark pal because of the 100 percent damage buff from passive
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,"that necromus boss fight is rough, even with multiple jetragons"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"chillet is busted, but not because chillet itself is strong hes just the cheering section, along with 4 gobfins, all bred to have passives that increase player damage, and then full condensed to max out their partner skill, max out your player attack as well, and then from there its a simple matter of hopping on your chillet with a legendary rocket launcher and oneshotting everything that isnt a tower boss this build when optimized oneshots jetragon"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,the hand full of end game pals make all other pals obsolete
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-31,rocklem is now the best ground type for raid boss fight. anubis best combat use is to convert player attack into ground

Survival,Palworld,2024-07-13,you forgot to mention that anubis is no slacker in other skills too
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-24,you forgot the meat shield and for that i use zoe and grizzbolt
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,"helzephyr is underrated af, dark element plus fire moves and great attack means it is a fantastic midgame battle pal, also it has level 3 transporting, is nocturnal, and has high movement speed, so it is a very good base pal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,sweepa with 3x swee and shadowbeak for mount riding lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-23,that one dude who still uses his lamball.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-22,honarable mentions shadow beak
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-24,i choose frostalion because he can freeze his enemys and he can also fly which makes him a very good mount other than the rocket dragon which i like the rocket dragon as well.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"you can also breed an anubis with penking and bushi, which are admittedly even easier to get"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,paladius and frostalian crying in corner

Survival,Palworld,2024-11-02,youre the first youtuber ive heard say jetragon correctly. praise cthulhu
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-21,shadowbeak will always be my number juan
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-17,wish there was a legendary for every type
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-25,i have an idea to catch up the powerful pals use the fall damage for pals make them fall from a high place then u can easily catch them without fighting!
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-15,"my end game pals are . shadowbeak , frostallion , orserk , faleris , anubis ."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,i use a lvl 50 chipiki or something i gave him dark and plant elements
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-12,i would argue shadowbeak is a better dark type than necromjs because of its access to its exclusive attack. you can even breed the bosss shadowbeak attack into your own if you do the boss catch glitch and that attack is insane as well
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-11,t rox is laughing at the pal
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,i use rooby and have all my pocket slots full of them to increase the attack power of fire pals and it stacks so the more you have the more damage you do
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-07,i use a faleris as my main anubis for quickly building stuff grizzbolt for the gatling gun  a mod that disanles the cooldown and a mossanda lux cus the grenade launcher is fune last one is killamari for the glider
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-21,breeding with relaxasaurs sucks the offspring always will have gluten

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,ty needed this
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-16,get one of those bowsers!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,"guys, who remember art money? it works"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-17,or i could just get a coal mine in an area around a bunch of ore but overall this is probably a better way to get coal and ore
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,first lets goooo love your content man
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,thank you!!!!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-05,i found a ore base nobody has talked about it's in volcano area near the axel and orzerk tower to the east i think it's to the right of it on a hill on map it's very close
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-02,the pal box is impossible to place
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-22,isn't astegon better than a digtoise? since it has lvl 4 mining and works all day and night
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,this spot is bugged for me. my pals collect the coal but the iron ore falls through the ground.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,thats crazy bro always find bugs
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,i still havent used coal that much
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,thanks partner
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,thanks for the coordinates. very helpful of you
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,i need that bowser pal! where the heck do you find those???
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,coal and charcoal are two different things
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-16,how long till it respawns? i buid my base here and i don't see it respawning and yeah i didn't put anything in the place of ore and coal and yet it isn't respawning
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-16,i live here but the ore is respawning but not the coal? it was respawning for a while then just stopped
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,charcoal
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-24,what's the mount at the beginning of the video?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,i have 20k of almost every resource in the game
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,charcoal?? i think you meant coal sir..
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-09,where to get that pal tho
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,dont use digitize hes slow use damud and anubis
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,for some reason my pals in this base barely ever mine coal its wayyyyy more ore than coal that they mine is there a reason?  i use penkings and digtoise
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,"190, 38 that the spot"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-25,what are the cords?
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,i put my boys down and they just get stuck and die without mining and transporting somebody help

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-13,your using the worse mining buddy just to lyk
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-08,"this spot is overrated, and doesnt have that much of ore or coal. ive found better spots with better coal and ore."

Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,risk of rain 2 music moment
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,it actually works
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,yeah its perfectly normal that a sheep can shave its own wool out but not normal that a pal that digs cans dig up a pall sphere that get thrown thousands of times
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,coalescence w
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,palworld palworld palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-19,some of them are good design for pokmon
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-01,i dont understand why you make it seem like its broken when you can only get the 2 worst pal spheres in the game sure its good for starters but you wont need them after 2 days of playing
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,time to catch 64 vixies
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,did that vixy just shit out a pal sphere
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,thanks a lot i'm going to be a pro
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,not gonna play this game but still good content
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,i don't need mega spheres lmao
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,i dot need palspheres or megas im lvl 56 im not a starter
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-25,but i still have to grind for the exotic spheres
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,can u breed them and do it that way or do they have to be wild?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-08,i guess it better to crash down vivy
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,song?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-11,what happened to halo
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-18,yeh but its useless in the late game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"never trust shorts, how do you not list the most meta and discussed best base location with 8 ore, 6 coal? i can't remember it myself off the top but its like 189, 38 i believe"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,"spots are here, here, and here good luck"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,the desert locations both have buggy ground and you fall thru and lose ore frequently. but i still suffered them!
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,proud to say i have bases at the ore and coal locations without any help from this video. just happy this validates my choices
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,"my base is up on a mountain around where the first base he suggested, and that base protected me from raids because they can't figure out how to get up where i am, even though there's a clear path to it. not even flying creatures can figure out how to get up the mountain."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,do not walk on snow that has no texture in that area. you'll fall through.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,first spot is best as there are 2 extremely close by cave dungeons and 2 more very close by cave dungeons that can be used to farm early alpha pals as well as the nodes that spawn in them.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,quartz isn't as big of a problem as coal in my opinion usually i can make a trip gathering quartz last alot longer than a trip gathering coal.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,never make a base for quartz actual waste. learned the hardway.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-19,"188, 37ish on a super high level is a spot that has like 10 ore and 10 coal and a bunch of trees. it's just barely big enough for a base location in the center, but that makes it raidproof. if you can deal with somewhat uneven terrain, it's perfect for a mining base."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-19,tnx dude
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"you might as well post the coordinates of each in a text post, that'd be more handy. i can't see anything in this short."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-08,thanks man! i built at the early game one already it's bomb. still my main base.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,ok but you dont need the sulfer one at all cause theres a fast travel right next to it
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,"tip for beginnersfind a favorite spot. once you can build a second base,get a flying andor ground mount. travel to these locations and mark as mining spots on your map. set up base and use your best mining and gathering pals. build a wooden chest. gather all resources. once all resources are gathered at whatever location you choose, travel back to your main base and drop your resources. you can now delete your second base and set up at another marked mining spot and repeat. it's a grind but it's worth it...if you don't like to cheat"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"kek. this is a true palworld short. halfway in it l a g g e d and i had to restart. still great game though, what pokemon could've been."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,"building on top of a huge plateau slightly south of the quivern boss or between that and the beakon boss area would be better imo. it's spacious, safe and secure from most raids they usually get stuck and eventually leaveaggro pals, aesthetic scenery, mostly flat topography, etc. ore is abundant and the other resources mentioned in this short would still be relatively close if you were to set up a base there. the plateaus where relaxaurus lux is located is also ideal."
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-22,there is a good spot near the elizabee boss fight north of it. has stone ore 1 coal wood and a skill tree
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,anubis statue aka twlight dunes is neighbouring to bamboo groves and has a neutral tempature so no dying out of cold or hot
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-06,"i have a location with 8 and 7 coal on it, volcano syndicate tower is easy access to sulphur, quartz isn't high demand so you can farm that every now and then."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,that second spot i do have a base at and ill just go there to get the coal and resupply theyre good once in awhile
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-14,i'm still new to the game but this is helpful
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"u don't need a base for sulphur, its soo light and easy to carry."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,"i live on the beach west to the tower from the volcanoes, a lot of ore in the nearby area"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,"hahaha i discovered the first and the second spot on my first playthrough, still using them"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,"dont even need them now, just one base with all the mining camps. thank god!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-07,"theres a fairly flat cliff face with a bunch of coal at 436, 520."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-12,can't wait for the next patch to drop with coal and sulfur pits throw that in the forgoten island and you won't ever have to leave the base
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-29,"upper left spawn on the map.. a plateau on the bottom left of the island. stone, ore, wood, a chest, and an egg spawn. it's raid proof, even to the flying pal raid."
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,"this makes me think of ark, but with pokmonlike creatures."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,you missed the mid map mountain off to the right. has 6 ore and 6 coal and a short jump for sulffer. because it's on a jutting up piller it is unraidable aswel
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-15,"tried the one in the desert near anubis location, bad place often get raided by powerful psychos xd even with a defense wall up, your pals get alerted and go stand by the wall that often results in conflict resulting in a massive disruption and ko of them, even if you dbl the layer, to me the best base location is one most have been raving recently near the sealed realm of the guardian at a high top area with a mix of both ore and coal and one sulfur node not far, by far the best place to set up shop there."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,ur missing the one that has both coal and ore and has roughly 6 to seven on each and they are together close enough to all be inside a base
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-18,he didnt mention the best orecoal spot in the game. its too small for an actual base but youll never need to worry about coal or ore again.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-04,have fun getting the coal behind the anubis statue without getting chased by anubis
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,there's a spot in the volcano with 9 ore that can't be reached by raids.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,"no one needs to mine sulphur. even after nerfing the nails. get rid of the assault rifle and go with the shotgun and just buy your ammo. keep a good bow to tag mobs. i use a fully upgraded ragnahawk as my main and he's outfitted with the lowest ct abiliies i can give him. allows better control to lower a mobs health before capture. you need so little quartz its easily farmed with just a road trip. the big pain is pal metal, so you need lots of coal, lots of ore and definitely lots and lots of rocks, but everyone is trying to be a hero and get clicks."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-28,woah very yes yes
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-05,you sorta cant make a base in the astral mountains cause even the strongest armor type doesnt even have level 3 cold resistance when you hit nightfall.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,ty
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-24,the snubis statue looked like lucario
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,good video personally dont think quartz base is needed just mine it when u see it and u should have enough
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-11,the mammorest blocking the 7th coal
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-14,i think anshu bisht see this video and build his base at 1st location
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,who noticed white mamorast
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,"i have the first base, its a great spot"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,"theres actually a really good flat spotthat nobody knows about for sulfur at 591 403. un raidable, 8 sulfur 1 ore, build out onto the lava. 1010"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,bro missed the god spot
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-27,the map for the second spot shows a location that's different than the coordinates. the coordinates you put on the screen end up in water.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-06,"i wouldnt builld a base for sulfur, just because the last location you showed has a bunch of if right next to a teleport, so you can mine and teleport to your base easy peasy. grappling gun can help you mine as much as you want even encumbered so you minimise the trips needed"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,nice
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-14,the best location by far on the mountain top toward the top right of the map which has.7 ore and 5 coal. only place in the game that has coal and ore in the same spot.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,sounds like runescape mixed with pokmon
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,you barely need quartz. and whatever you can make through sulfur is like 150220 at the right merchant
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,the 2nd location has the wrong coordinates. lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,man am never gonna het there
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,"i think it's190, 24 .. the best spot. no risk. and a split of coal and iron."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-29,sadly you can only make 3 base in game which is suck
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-04,what are the coordinates?
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-01,"their are much better sulfur ones, the tower makes it so you can only get like half the nodes there"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,theres a tp right next to the mountain one i wouldnt waste a base spot
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,i got my bases by crude oil and just use mines for all the ores
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-29,yo missed the mountain sound the of verdash and west of jourmetide idk how to spell it
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-30,sulfur spot is right next to a fast travel. no need for a base
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-08,any chance they are working on making base radius a bit bigger?
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-17,i couldnt set up a base at the final spot sadly
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"naw i did mine in a mountain range ,attacks can never get to it has sulfer ore and coal arojnd it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,i love miners
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,bro to the right of the tower boss theres a 9 ore location
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-03,how to kill a game in 29 seconds.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-23,best base location in palworld in near starting point
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-13,"the sulfur at the top of the volcano is a terrible base location. there's literally 2 separate teleports, right next to it. it's a great spot to tp, and just harvest all of the sulfur, then return to your base. but terrible spot for an actual base."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,"these spots are now useless with the additions of different ore mines, just build your base wherever you feel comfortable"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-14,live insaan set up bases at these locations only lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-01,the sulfur spot u cant put a base that close to a tower
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-25,"there is a better base location that have 4 coal and 6 iron , in the top of the mountain rigth from vaelet boss and no attack can get near"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-12,"not at all, best location is 8 ore 6 coal on top of a mountain next to vaeletverdash bosses. and having 1 completely flat base is also a good idea so you can place multiple breeding pens or ranches."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-08,how about crude oil?
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-25,"little problem, if you leave there pals who can mine, when you teleport far from there they will stop, so anyway you will have to mine everything"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,just defeat the towers you can get the base mines
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-14,1st place used by streamer mr ig
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,i don't have pc but i want to play palworld
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,yo how did you get my base locations?
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-19,i disagree. i built my base behind the volcanic rift and it's a perfect base. runs for sulfur and quartz are easy just hold a base for mining runs.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-21,name your favourite pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-22,jai shree ram
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-08,all nodes are pointless after update. place your base wherever you would like
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,oder man baut sich einfach den entsprechenden steinbruch im lager
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,bro i'm going to screenshot this video because right now currently i don't have pal world well i played the video game but i'm an xbox player and the before like maybe 4 months ago the video game was free on the xbox game pass so i got the game pass and i played the video game with my friend that was super fun i was having a blast i basically became addicted until i started not playing it for a while a bit since like i didn't know really what to do but actually i didn't know what to do except like i just wanted new pals and i didn't know really how to get new pals so that's why i started the kind of not play it a lot then i started to play the game a lot then the the video game became pretty expensive and then i downloaded the trial and then the trial went away and not one set because i can't play pal world anymore
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-15,someone tag techno gamerz
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-16,you missed like 4 other locations
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-05,"second one is wrong. its 167, 92"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-29,background music name
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-10,dont bother with a sulfur base thats just a waste of a base slot. the only use for sulfur in the entire game is to make gunpowder which is used in ammo production and u wont need nearly as mutch sulfur as u may think u do. with the changes that lets u increase the amount of bases in the world settings u may wanna throw down 1 sulfur base before lvl 50 but after that u need those extra bases for crude oil becouse dear god oil production is slow.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-02,001

Survival,Palworld,2024-04-02,finally a good playthrough of palworld where the youtuber isn't complaining about it being a pokemon ripoff the whole time. glad you enjoyed it!
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,what i love most about this video is how at the start he is calling all the pals pokemon names ans towards the ends he starts calling them their actual names more and more thats peaks character progression
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,"purplecliffe went from the shiny hunter, to being hunted by shinys in the span of 2 minutes."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,"devil fruit tree? tm tree? no my friends, that was a skill tree"
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,"i took a game prototyping class at my university the professor is an indie developer and one of the things we learned is that it's okay to take inspiration, in fact it's often encouraged. you can't always create a brand new concept. if everyone always tried to create a brand new idea, good games would never get made. edit i'm not saying palworld didn't copy designs. that much is blatantly obvious. i should've clarified i meant inspiration for certain aspects and broad concepts i'm a pokemon fan to my core but that doesn't mean i won't enjoy a bit of palworld"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-07,purple cliffe in the beginning its a rip off bahsjckjdje the endhell yeah gunnnnsss
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,you know its a good purplecliffe video when he fails a shiny in the first 2 minutes

Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,i love how the first shiny purplecliffe missed was the same ahh color as the first shiny he missed in paldea.

Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,i loved the t pose part
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,i love how jack puts the time into learning pal's names but for pokemon.... we have tanjelly
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,palworld is a really fun game with a surprisingly large amount of attention to details and considering the game still isnt fully done is shows the developers actually tried to make it as fun as possible if only people didn't have the builtin bias against it also sad you didn't include the others reaction to lovanders dex entry
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-01,purplecliffe ahhh this game added shiny sounds hmmm thats an accessibility green beam shoots at him ahhhhhhhhhhh 1439
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,purplecliffe. your the best. you gave me something to watch while i eat and while i drink. i can not forget this moment thank you.
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-31,dark pit theme to start the video is complete heat and i just have to say that you're the goat for including it
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,"hey purplecliffe, just want to say that today is my 18th birthday. i've been going through a lot of emotions with growing up, and you uploading today made me realize how much your content has helped me with background noise for school, and as a comfort creator that i love watching all the time. thank you for everything you do, and for making some of my favorite content on this platform. 3"

Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,the only thing i hate about this is that they did a huge jump in the gameplay why did they play the game without us
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,the only thing to remove that wanted screen is to leave your not gonna die you keep your stuff and untouched and the wanted screen is gone i hope this helped you

Survival,Palworld,2024-06-25,lmao idk but kept rewatching this even still today scents when the vid was made
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-03,it pained me every time they called a lucky pal a shiny
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-21,"i think the paldium  paldea is such a reach. the game is named palworld, the creatures are called pals, the merchants are called palmerchants, of course the core important metal would be named paldium."

Survival,Palworld,2024-03-30,first!
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-19,just incase anyone dosent know this but at 5720 he goes over the egg farm and makes a very common mistake. the workspeed traits has no impact on pals when used in the ranch. all thats effecting how fast u get drops and what drops u get are the pals partner lvl. the work speed stats does nothing in the ranch.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-19,wyh purplecleef didnt get ani of bossses and check the new upbate and wyh purplecleef bibnt get the new boss raceall

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-05,"for those that don't know, a cryolinx can be used for many insane combos, and can be gotten from the black marketeer...use a hanging trap on a black marketeer, then put a campfire underneath him. once low enough, use whatever sphere you got on him, assuming you have at least level 6 lifmunk effigies. put him as a base pal, see what he has, then if he doesn't have what you want, put him back in the box and repeat...another tip is to have lamballs with all the passives you need, a male and female cryolinx with no passives, as well as a male and female foxparks,

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,i have found that grizzbolt can be bred into an alarming amount of useful pals and you can get one under level 20 from the first sanctuary in the south east.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,thanks for the amazing tutorial. i have four splatterinas to do all the crafting haha
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,this voice saying pal names in something else.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,i love splatterina. she's actually very similar to one of my personal oc i came up with years ago and even sports the same colors. the but there even easier combos then what this video shows. like malepaca and surphant which are very easy to get early on as there very low level pals and not too far from each other. idk the spelling of things sorry about that! xd
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"i feel like a nerd now seeing 600 berries is enough to keep pals full. i have over 20,000"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-06,my go to for splatterina at the beginning of the game is penkingcaprity
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"i got a prunelia with celaray and bushi, nyafia with celaray and nitewing, and tarantriss with nitewing and daedream"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-05,splatterina  anubis  nyafia
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,i bred a fenglope and a fenglope lux and ended up with a mozzarina... somehow.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,also for all the fam. anubisfrostallion bastigor
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,i think prunelia is the best. i was tired of having everyone hungry at my base.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"considering you can make feybreak pals with base game pals, what was the result before the update? feels like they're always messing with the breeding tables, it may be different next patch."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,i hope this guide helps you. subscribe for more content. thank you so much for watching.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,thanks bro...

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,thank u
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,you cant tell me splatterina isnt just a better anubis cause its dark so always works yes ik anubis is better cause of its other work stuffs but still
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,paladius and lunaris
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,real life  bird  bird  more birds palworld  bird  bird  woman with cleaver with no relation to bird
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,how do you breed faleris aqua
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,dinossom and helezpher
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,can't get shit cause the new power update destroyed my data not starting over
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,"you can get the new pals from pal eggs on the new island aswell, just walk around and look for big eggs or heck even small eggs and then hatch them, doesnt work on most boss pals so those need breeding, but if you want overworld pals then just walk around and look for eggs"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,my game keeps crashing. advice?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,"breeding breaks the game. personally, i'm not even touching eggs until i catch pretty much everything. over the summer i had breeding tower bases with armies of maxed out base pals and raid teams. enjoyed it a ton, but feel like end game is where all that stuff should stay."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-06,anubis  splatterina
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"yep, a perfect video to answer peta"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,the fact thg this actually canon with the game is incredible
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,the fact that this is an offical palworld animation is wild to me.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-24,the lambs in the back are just casually ignoring the death and vibing
Survival,Palworld,2023-11-12,''is there a vegatarien option? i only eat pals with plant type.''
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,the fact that this is the official palworld yt is fucking hilarious to me
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"i love how they're just a walking chunk of meat with no bones, they're pretty much like octopus or something"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-29,i never knew lamball had such pretty bluegreen insides. thanks pocketpair!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,the fact this was posted by pocketpair themselves is amazing fuckin love you guys
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,pokemon retirement option release into the wild palworld retirement option
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,cooking with pals  cooking pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-16,i adore how palworld is just the uncensored glory that it is.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"the fact that it just looks like it's sleeping and could wake up at any moment gets me in my core, man"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,"sorry bud, i cant have a pal with the slacker disorder slowing down my concrete production. pulls out the cleaver"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,can we just appreciate this was posted by the people who made the game lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-26,completely and utterly traumatic. thank you
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,pokemon fans nooo! thats immoral! palworld fans it comes with the territory
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,the first thing i did in palworld was feed the raw lamball i accidentally killed to the first lamball i caught. the funniest thing was how happy my lamball was being a cannibal.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,the fact that bullet removal was not shown means that theres a possibility that each lamb bbq contains at least one chunk of steaming copper inside of it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-24,can we ignore the fact that the other 2 lamballs were ignoring the death? that really was the cherry on top
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-15,"this is what happens when you don't have perfect ivs editon a serious note, im having an absolute blast playing this childhood dream of a game...im deeply grateful for everyone working at pocketpair and can't wait to see what the game becomes when it's fully released."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-15,oh shoot wait this is official?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,lore accurate pal cooking
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-27,i love the fact that this is official and not a fan animation like one of those cooking pokemon animations
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,"its funny lamball is constantly rolling around helplessly. but in the one true moment it absolutely had to roll away, it failed. how ironic."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,the cartoon running had me laughing because this is insanely accurate but imagine the pal helping you make the meal is related to it
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,you know this being completely canon is really funny
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,"lets eat, pals  lets eat pals"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,i love how this is from the official channel
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-16,"imma be real, its nice to see a monster game with the balls to hurt your cute friends"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,"they told me palworld was pokemon with guns, but this feels more like pokemon with happy tree friends."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-28,sheep are my favourite animal  im so traumatized
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"as someone has cooked lamb before, this is exactly the way, using slicer. no skinning, no gutting and no beheading. straight up slice like an orange he is."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,"people seem to forget where their food comes from, that this is seen as extreme."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-20,palworld is everyones intrusive thoughts about pokemonwith a side of guns
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-23,we've already started off right at the beginning lolllllll
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-07,all pals go to heaven would be the best sequel ever.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-06,i didn't even realize this was official until i read the comments  this game is wild and that's why it's good.
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-07,you know this video made me cry?tt ive been crying for 1 hour bc of this tt tt
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,"this is the official yt channel, right? crazy"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,peta is gonna slap their knees and have a good giggle when they see this!
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-19,lmao you even parodied those pokmon cooking videos
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-26,that escalated quickly
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,the fact that you can wake up have a good day and then open youtube to see this masterpiece
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-10,hahaha this is probably a fan animation oh how i am so wrong
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-11,bro took i hate cute to a whole new level
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,"why is this so cute, cruel, and funny at the same time?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-09,"poor lamball, easily the most helpful pal when first starting, yet is always portrayed as the punching bag of the game lmao."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,"i'd watch a whole series of cooking with pals. next up, chikipi!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-02,man this company actually gives zero fucks lmao love you guys never stop
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,me before the video  me during the video  me after the video
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-01,i never thought i'd hear myself saying these words but... i am genuinely fascinated to know what peta thinks of this video game.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-23,the sheep are my favorite pals. i cant hurt them. i have 6 of them running around my camp
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,palworld uploads only one short video of lamball getting turned into a meal refuses to elaborate leaves
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-15,"i just took psychic damage, thanks"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,i love how you guys embrace the community
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-15,this is fucked up... i want more.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,just a quick reminder that you can catch people and they will be treated as pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,dark side of pokemon that you hear all the time but never see
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,dude. palworld is absolutely insane. love it.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,trauma  childhood ruiend  therapy
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-15,"this animation is a kinda cute at least in the start lol and very well animated, i'm genuinely surprised that his meat is blue"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,this is what happens to the pals that slack off.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-02,well that was cutely morbid. remembering that you actually do this in game
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,the fact this is less creepy than the one with chikorita from some years ago and only because you actually can slaughter and consume your pals ingame.
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"i need that knife,he cut bones like butter"
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-17,i really like the cute anime art vs the actual gun .png.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-05,damn!!! lmao that beginning was brutal asf
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-22,"just realized this is the official youtube channel, god damn"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,cooking with pals? no. cooking the pals? hell yeah
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-10,finally some good fucking food.  gordan ramsey after eating lamball for the first time.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-15,"whats even better, this is the actual company making this"
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-31,the other lambs completely ignoring that situation is the most accurate part about this video besides the shooting a pal at point blank
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,"yeah child, where do you think the meat comes from?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-23,there are animation videos about preparing and cooking pokemons. absolutely horrendous yet fascinating at the same time
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-27,"thought this was a fan animation. then i saw who posted it. all i can do is stand up and salute you, pocketpair for your insanity, depravity, and absolute willingness to go all in on the absurd."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"dude i love the fact that when these animators did this exact thing for pokmon, they got hammered by nintendo. whilst pocketpair instead posted the animation to their channel. its so poetic"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-24,pov you fell asleep first at the sleepover rookie mistake
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-06,"honestly, these little guys are so cute that it hurts when you have to hunt them."
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-15,bro peta is gonna explode if they find this game lmfao edit omfg they found it and theyre not exploding tf?!? edit 2 nvm they are exploding lmao
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-02,"i love this community, it's so unhinged xd"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,the fact that this is the first short i see after playing palworld for the first time
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-25,"lamb chopping recipe stuff. perhaps in palworld game, have cooking recipes, to cook up and eat slaine monsters. also create egg clones of your beaten human boss characters, but rebirthed, make them your allies, to fight alongside you. allow each to run assets for you. learn pal recipes, and extra hidden knowledge, from each of your cloned exboss characters. delicious! defend your pals and assets, from pal raiders. add fpstps option. capture squares, and capture diamonds upgrades. more fun animations, too. congratulations on palworld for playstation 5 launch.  consider making, a cool gonzo style, palworld anime show. get started on your next new game. have a nice day.  well done, pocketpair!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"i think the most unnerving thing about this is just that it doesn't do anything flashy, dramatic, or shifting in tone. it has the same structure, feeling, and delivery for the video start to end as if there isnt anything wrong going on at all."
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-04,cooking with pals cooking with pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-23,
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-04,my ass really saw the thumbnail and thought woa dungeon meshi
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,that went from awww! to awww in like 3 seconds
Survival,Palworld,2024-03-04,you guys are legitimately unhinged and i fuckin love it
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-30,"the fact this is official surprises me, kudos to you guys"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-07,am i the only one who loves these videos
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-28,you know they are similar when palworld gets cooking pal videos!!! i love this.
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-03,good to know your pals go to heaven
Survival,Palworld,2024-02-26,
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-04,"the truth is very good, the video seems like a meme"
Survival,Palworld,2024-01-29,official pocketpair? lmao they are wild for this
Survival,Palworld,2023-09-15,"finally, exactly what i was waiting to see. i hope the cooking is exactly this elaborate."
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-09,meega geega and heefa spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-12,"one thing to add to this, is you can use the ranch to get high qual pal oil and pal fluid now, so you don't need to hunt as much mammoths"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-13,learning the facts  vibing to zelda ocarina of time music
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-14,they need to increase base area and mainly fix those bugs
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,in new update u can make ur base near anubis where is coal because u can make paldeum ore stone and wood farms
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-26,they should make it so that base borders when colliding instea dof saying base is too close to another base the borders merge to one large area
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-23,"learning this i will definitely make use of it for my second base and make it my main, ive already beaten lily so once i get the materials for the condenser ill definitely be farming vixey, thank you very much for these tips also got my first bellanoir slab fragment so i cant wait to do that when im much stronger"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-10,"from the last base, head east ,ne there's a cluster of coal and ore on a plateau that's a good mineral spot"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-27,"the spot was so great i transferred there and made it my main base. i, after hours looking for the right precision, managed to place stairs from the top of the cliff where the ores are down to the road at the bottom of the cliff and completely blocked it, with my playmates needing to climbfly over the wall to pass through. i had a massive farm, big enough for a jormuntide to freely walk around without getting stuck. i used up all the ground space, so i had to create a 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th floor that even connects the road side which had 3 floors on its side just so i can fit everything, and yes, i had stairs and enough open space for a jormuntide to access all 4 floors, since i wanted to see jormun ramsey my max level jormun ignis go up the path and cook me some ingots while i have a sky view. i even had a gate at the 2nd floor that connects to the stone spire. i even had an orsek that i completely walled next to the electric heater and its own food. i even had a tower of 160 incubators set up in the 2nd floor right next to the breeding centerwhich was ditectly above my massive farm. i specifically had each floor at a specific height and placed openings in the ceiling so i can grappling hook to all the floors like spider man. eventually i transferred all the incubators to a dedicated breeding base, where i had set up 280 incubators in 7 floors, 40 each and thwy were always full 3 bases, 3 breeding centers after all. i really hope pokemon took notes from palworld for plza, they did so many things right"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-21,"meega, geega, and heepa spheres"
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-09,bro violated chillet by calling him wet noodle  never expected this much likes love yall  peace  it got viral so... guess who the pokemon is
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,when i first played palworld and found that island i loved it. 4th world i'm starting up and i'm like..i need my first base there lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-12,"bro is farming engagement with the pronunciation of mega, giga, and hyper  lmfao"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"i finished a playthrough about a month ago with 1 base in the beginning spot, worked well for me."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-18,find it funny that the science civilization part is just a spark plug
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,"yo, i started to play 1 month ago and while i was exploring the early game map i figured out that place would have been perfect to set my base so i decided to move there and i can agree the iron never been an issue for me."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-04,300 hours and i never knew vixies drop pal spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-24,thanks i used the volcano spot and got a base started right now im getting material to saddle jedrago
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,i needed this!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,there's a space for a base on a cliff directly west from anubis pal. the place is perfect for a base because any raid spawns enemies in a way that they start retreating before even reaching your base.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-05,1st one has been my base location every playthrough! so pretty
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-18,right across the bridge from chillet is amazing too like 5 ore nodes and a good bit of wood and stone
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-19,aint no way bro said meega geega and heepa spheres
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,ice wind island is a great little island. i have a base setup on the plateau south of the third spot in this video.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-15,"there is an awesome flat area in new japan island where you can farm mushrooms from the trees, its flat and has 2 oil next to each other"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-13,oh yeah and there's a really good spot where there's a bunch of ores so if you want to set up a second base their go right ahead so you can get a lot of ore but it's like for like starter people a case like you already have a bunch of ore on you
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,staring location best spot except for when you want to build on the high ground and your palbox is on the low ground or vise versa
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,i had my bases on the last spot before the raid boss was a thing as it was a nice island base
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-17,bro said  giga and hipper spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-28,meega geega and heepa spheres as well skull
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,i don't recall chillet being able to producefarm ancient civilization parts.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-07,"i made a base in the last spot, it's been extremely nice as a central location in the map, as well as tons of ore nodes on the island and coal in the desert south of it"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,"how about the top right side of the map ! its a massive dessert next to multiple different biomes and has some pretty decent pals, not to mention the little mini boss that spawns there for some loot. and the crazy amount of fast travel and pal spawns nearby ! you can easily fit four or more pal boxes in it so friends can really get crazy. its not an easy spot per say, but its definitely one of the best probably a bit better than your last pick !"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,located here on the map...then zooms in immediately. great. wish i knew where here was.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,"the last spot was actually already a location for both my base and breeding farm base, which is funny"
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-23,"farming interaction with that abysmal pronunciation of mega, giga, and hyper. smart."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,"so many better spots, nice tip on the vixxy though!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"i removed vixy from ranch after i no longer needed arrows, but digging up hyper spheres changes it because it was only mega spheres before, which i consider useless by the time you can get vixy to four stars."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-30,hey i am about to buy palworld soon thanks for the tips
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-02,did not know vixy was doing all. gonna focus on them
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,i cant wait till they make a sequel this game is special
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-30,"honestly i didnt know when i start d and messed up. then i moved my base to the first one before seeing this video and con confirm is it a good base, trees, rocks, small chance of ores, vicky, and the bore things come by every so often. even during the raid not many can pathfinder the trail"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-23,"early to mid game i actually built a base on a cliff near the volcano or one of the larger plateaus near lily's boss tower that has alot of ore spawns and since its on a cliff the raids can't overwhelm or destroy my base, and i can just leave it as a place to get ore over time. paldium is easy to get as soon as you unlock the crusher and stone pit which are level 7 and 8 unlocks. though the last two areas are good locations for late game for the stated reasons. flat ground is so good to have once you reach late game and don't need to worry about raids posing a threat."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,i have my main base in that last one because thats actually one of the bugged spots that will never get factionpal raids
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,big ty
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-27,i watched this after playing funny thing is that my first time playing i actually picked that exact location for my main base the one that you suggested first no prior research just luck. it really is a great spot flat and full of materials only issue for me is that i feel like it's cheating using that spot it made the game really easy compared to other spots.
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-11,i like the forgotten isles by the port nearest to the other land top left corner right by sakurjima
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,love the suicune at the beginning of the video....ohh wait its a totally original not in anyway related to pokmon creature.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-30,not me inadvertently using the last spot for my main base and farm base xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-11,"depending on how many people are in a clan, we need more bases than three. i think it'd be nice to have like a main clan base, then 3 bases for each clan member so that they can go get whatever resources they need. the main clan base should have beginner resources, then grow as the clan grows. those are just my thoughts, stay frosty!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,"today i finally catched the wet noodle, he is so good at dungeons, and i caught 2 clandestine starter hunter"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-14,the last 2 i've definitely used as baces
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,i literally made two of three bases in the last three days. my first day playing was actually three days ago. im doing good boys
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-25,i really enjoy palworld a lot. wish pokemon did something similar after arceus.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,lamo just watching this for the first time and my first base is in the first location  talk about instinct
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,that last one you just showed i used that one as an actual like a habitat just for them i guess you decide to want to murder them all instead and turn it into your evil bass
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-07,i had so many vixis and got so many normal spheres and spammed all the legendary pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-13,thanks !!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-22,that wet noodle roast
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-02,i didn't know suicune was in palworld. i've gotta catch one.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-01,the new island has a spot with a mushroom wall behind it that is my favorite spot now
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-13,the first base shown is the same exact spot me and my friend started our first base
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,"this pretty much comes down to having flat, open areas. i don't disagree, but it's also a bit of a nightmare to play end game without an oil base."
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-31,whell now i know where im gonna set my breeding pen
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-21,you had me at heepa....
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,the other day i built a giant pyramid in the third spot just to see how high i can make it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,"giga, meega and heepa spheres"
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-04,thanks
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,meega geegha and hiypa spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-18,btw another good way to farm high quality pal oil is by putting dumud in the ranch
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-30,i thought those were suicunes for a second
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-21,"i had my breeding empire on my friends server on top of that circle, 4 chests to loot and i was selling max speed flying mounts and super chickens with 120 egg poopin speed and cows for max cake making."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,chill outttt  i love that little wet noodle
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-18,ok i did not know about condensing that pal for better spheres damn
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-03,this makes me want to get xbox live again to play it
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-27,"bellanoir just fucked up my base, time to build a new one"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-24,"i love how the title is about best base spots and thumbnail is a chillet with text here tbh i'd totally have a base on a chillet, i don't complain"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,"vixey is a noob trap. by the time you get her condensed enough to actually be useful, you'll be past the point of her usefulness. maybe if you are willing to throw three or four of them in a ranch, that might be worth it to not worry about spheres and arrows in the early game."
Survival,Palworld,2024-09-29,i built my base next to the church on that hill by the ore rocks but its a rookie base fore now im lvl 15
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,ultimate raids are crazy
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,"the first spot sucka now. since they added the new oil rig next door, pals on base get stuck"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,i dont know if people know this but this is atleast a tip if you put the big black shark or what his name is in a ranch he will drop high quality pal oil for free no killing the mammorests just get those ez
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-07,i was literally just about to build a base at the first one
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-11,this game seems pretty fun
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-22,
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,thx
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-06,what's funny is i use that platform tower thing for my raids
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-06,chillet is the cutest pal..
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,i cant wait to use definitely not suicune
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-26,i got 4 mix ranked vixys. they do not dig up hyper spheres. also they forgot that vixy digs up bones.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-27,the second one is also great because its virtually unraidable...
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,2nd spot is one for me every new world.... you also cant get raided there and no pals spawn after you set it up so dont have to worry about being attacked
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-08,"but for someone just loading in they dont see the map like this, is there a way to post the coords for the locations for someone to go straight there when they spawn in?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-07,people overlooking vixy digging up bones for cement too.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,omfg i confused vixy with cremis i was wondering why it didn't drop the spheres i am so dumb
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,the 2nd spot wont let me place foundations
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,base location south of second boss. has both ore and coal deposits. thats the best base spot.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,im so sorry but i am just starting palworld and this helps a ton!! thank you so much only question i have is is there any way you could tell me the coordinates of that first base location?? thank you so much again for the video!
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-11,iused that spot since pal world came on to xbox its still my spot ever since if any1 used this that berfore tbis short video was post like this comment
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,the first base location is literally where one of my bases is and the pals in it keep getting bugged
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,they have teeth..... since pocketpair put it out that's canon.....
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,knowing they have teeth... im now terrified of those little blue monsters
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,gordon ramsey finally some good fucking food.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,pengullet with no beak can't hurt you it's not real pengullet with no beak
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-19,this is even better when you know it's a parody of fan made pokemon cooking videos in the same style... pocketpair knows exactly what they're doing and i love it
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-13,she didn't even need the pengullet launcher. that was just done out of pure cruelty.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,full of protein a pancakes to enjoy
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,that morelike ground penguin meat so it's not a pancake but a penguin burger steak.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,"i love this dev group more and more, cant wait to see where it goes"
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-30,cooking with pals  cooking of pals
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-22,the fact that the penguin is cooking his own kind
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-25,"pocketpair should totally release a palworld cookbook with the names of all the recipes being different pals in the game and the food in these animations, i'd totally buy it"
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,the definition of oddly satisfying
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,pengullet has teeth!?!?!!

Survival,Palworld,2024-10-07,"nothing nightmare inducing here, just normal hunting."
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-08,i thought it was gonna be some wholesome cooking. i was not expecting this.

Survival,Palworld,2024-05-19,keep more food content up palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-15,palworld is basically pokemon meets happy tree friends.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,lmao the one in the launcher is like sorry bro
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-24,wholesome
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-19,that pengullet pal looks really adorable ingame and even here... the mc here tho seems to always be portrayed more of a monster than the tower leaders.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,so fun fact if i don't have food what i will do is just starve myself
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-20,
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-08,the thing i like about eating pokemon is that they are all meat with little bones. no guts. so 1 waste.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-22,why take the beak and hair off if you just toss the whole head anyway
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,seeing the pengullet meat canonacally purple is......traumatizing...
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-20,
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"their mouths are built like chika from fnaf. beak on outside, teeth on inside."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-09,i really just have the so tasty! sound effect from monster hunter running through my mind as soon as it flashed pencake on screen
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-12,i love the detail of pengullet having horrifying sharp teeth just like real penguins and geese.
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-13,i play palworld and this is terrifying
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-12,pengullet really doing a fnaf 2 thing here.
Survival,Palworld,2024-07-22,well at least we know who the monster behind these brutal slaughters is.

Survival,Palworld,2024-06-14,sentient creatures go hard as breakfast
Survival,Palworld,2024-08-11,bro this is brutal even if its your own game

Survival,Palworld,2024-12-02,no bone no intestines?!
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-19,oh gosh. that pengullet looks interesting
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,pengullet serving the food is one of the most unginged parts of this.
Survival,Palworld,2024-06-26,"first, you tenderize the pengun by shooting it with another pengun. don't cook the second one as the gunpower ruins the taste."
Survival,Palworld,2024-11-02,i'm glad we all as a society agree that the fact that he has teeth is the most unsavory part of this video
Survival,Palworld,2024-10-04,makes more sense than the one i saw with pokmon.
Survival,Palworld,2024-05-18,gonna have to make some soon p

Survival,Palworld,2024-06-16,"just like cooking any other pal, none of it goes to waste feather make boa beak and teef make fertilizer for plant bone and feet make stock meat make food"

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-09,bro i kinda mourned my level 29 pengullet i named cooler after i accidentally used the butcher knife. meanwhile youre just casually shooting them out of rocket launchers and cooking them.

Survival,Palworld,2024-07-08,getting your hands on the meteorite pals opens a whole bunch of breeding avenues. using xenovader and common pals can breed chain all the way up to astegon. also using the hanging trap to catch a male and female mimog early so you can breed up its passive skill will save a bunch of frustration from needing keys on your adventures
Survival,Palworld,2024-04-16,funfact i dont have any parent put i have those baby pals except last one

Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,hearing the theme fills you with determination ... to catch some pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,i have a xenogarde i named praetorian. he is a powerhouse and i love him. when things go south he is who i call on. he has saved my ass so many times.

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"you said i'm missing these but they were some of the first in the sakura update, which is also a couple months old now"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,i found selyne guarding a meteor north of anubis
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,i want them to make a new palworld so i can start from scratch.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,2 4 knocklems are the best combat pals in the game. just cycle their ability so they constantly have uptime
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,got some breeding to do tonight
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,but it refused. ahh music
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,i ironically got selyne just outside the moonflower tower in a meteor drop
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"knocklem is awesome with it's base skills, but i think it's true strength lies in it's active ability making it simultaneously extremely durable and a wrecking ball."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,i actually randomly got a xenogard from a falling meteor while i was setting up an oilcoal base in the northwest part of the desert...
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-03,string player gamer music was a nice choice.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,i found a wild selyne during a meteor eventpaldium as if she was guarding it. no other pals where present at the time and i caught her..
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,majestic
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,you dont need to do any of those just pop up a base near the leaves that match them near the grass tower for xeno and the japan tower for selena red balls and up work usually after two throws.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,i love and use knocklem but tbf astegons still better being a dark type aka nocturnal without the trait
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,noted. get a work specialist helzephyr. possibly even one with pure speed passives.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,can literally just catch all of these lmao
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,didn't know you could get selyne outside meteor events
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,"i got her from a meteor drop, i didn't have to breed anything"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,you can get knocklem in a multitude of ways
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,selyne has a meteor drop on the sands of the sakura island i like to wait around and get her. i got them both day and night.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,i was around level 33 and was going through the desert area looking for electric types for my base. i see a meteor and i go towards it then the xenogard popped put and i nearly crapped myself. i somehow managed to catch it with a 4 chance now my brother is constantly trying to catcg meteors to to have one
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,i actually got my selyne from a sakurajima meteor drop it dropped at like level 50 give or take im sure its higher now with the new level cap
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,"selyne is a meteor drop, but at night."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,for does who want selyne you can find selyne at sakura island when meteor drop
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,me crossed beakon and reptyro and getting knocklem lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,gonna sub bc of this video
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,my first ever meteor was xenoguard and i was around level 15 and i got my ass whooped. havent seen one since
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,"you can also get selyne from a meteor, but i haven't got one so far."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,if you dont know selyne if breeded can now get legend
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,only recently cam u breed for selyne she was originally only available from meteorite on sakurajima
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,that new ark mod is crazy
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,or you can random encounter sylene with a meteor strike
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,selyne would
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,selyne is a dark and neutral type tho..the only reason i say this is bc of her passive while riding her youre dark and neutral attacks do more damage please if youre gonna give information give all of it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,you can also just find them
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,i only need to capture selyne to have the meteor trio. found one in the sakajuria area but i don't have level 50 spheres yet.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,palworld reminds me of 3d terraira
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,knocklem also has level 4 gathering
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-15,to obtain selene you will need to challange paladins to prove your aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a wise man one said
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,had the bird but it don't kill
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,i have some of them.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,you can get selyne from a meteorite drop
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,dark type i'm out
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-15,ive got 5 xenoguard
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,sounds easier just to go and catch selyne over breeding its not that rare lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,"i have only 1 xenogard, i think she feels lonely.. but i can't find the male for her"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,i got my selyne on meteor drops and im a newbie btw.....
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,was the short over? you didn't make it clear and did that totally original thing that annoys me.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,yes i already have each and every single one of those and i didn't do anything that you show in this video except for two of them and to be honest the second thing you showed the big one that walks around on four legs yeah you use that one all the time the moon one pretty good qualities to the factor of helping around the base and basically i read a the level 60 dragon you find at the corner of have the volcano area can't remember his name all i know it starts with a jet and basically the new creature that you also showed in the video which made that armored guardian the one that is black and gold so yeah there's only two things that you've shown that i've actually done already and i haven't even watched your video
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,this is just blatantly wrong information. selyne is a wild encounter almost always around a meteor dropsite not needed to fight a legendary beast and breed it....
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,can someone reply to this so i can remember this
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,is that a fucking a kyurem white? pal world i love you the fact that yall can rip off pokemon this much and aint shit they can do about it is wild but also super petty and funny!! my kind of party!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,ah yes the copies of pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,pokemon is better
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,pour les donjon je pense que globalement au niveau des grottes ils ont augment le volume de passage ce qui fait quon peut circuler dedans avec des montures volantes plus facilement. du coup je pense que cest  cause de a que les torches sont prises dans la roche

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,premier
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,p
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,i also highly recommend using yakumo to pass remarkable craftsmanship  its the new best passive for base pals!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,i got a lucky one and he is truly the goodest boy from sakurajima
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,im so happy they added a global palbox to the game. so you can essentially copy pals from your other worlds. trying to get these passives is tough recently. fortunately i had a bunch of swift on other pals in my first world. such an op passive on your rideable pals. jetragon  legend  swift  runner is so much fun to use
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,would have been nice to know while catching and breeding my hundreds of creatures that it would just straight be better to capture them with this guy.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,that anubis was huge o.o i've caught alpha anubis b4 but i don't remember him being that tall!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,this game seemed fun when i first got it but i just dont have the time like back in the day anymore for thinking of best strats or maximizing
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,very great help when catching legendary pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,"yakumo probably will make short of work for legendary even slightly its welcome boost regardless,i remember back in the day catching jet and frost to get desire passives was super hard. im breeding its parents rn and i use boarush and as my starter to transfer the iv and passives by using my prwvious bred higher tier pals etc. now i got few pals have all the passives and 90 iv since u can just fruit it to 100 u just need it to be 90 as i heard one fruit gives 10 points."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,side note. you don't need to ride yakumo but you do have to have him out.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,you just made getting a swift jetragon a great deal easier for me.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,"i got a lucky one right before this update, w"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,its impressive how thick this game is
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,fantastic!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,"i finally got my orserk with legend, lord of lightning, demon god, and vampiric because of help from yakumo. my only issue with yakumo is that, if there are more than one pal around that i'm trying to catch, he usually gets merc'd when i send him out c"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-07,me csstyaly accidently catching a lucky demon god with eternal engine in starter wee me let's go
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,finally finally finally someone has the balls and play with pals x3. much better game like this
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,i didn't know you can get different mood with different parents
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,"he reminds me of gabumon, but a dog."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,"that is growth, but bigger"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,i need this
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,are rainbow tiers like remarkable craftsmanship random? like do you need to catch a bunch at a small chance at getting it off a pal? or there a faster method?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,yakumo is literally a reskin of growlithe from pokemon. i knew he was going to be clutch in the game.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,i'm sad that i can't wait to update because every time i open the game my xbox account gets corrupted and my games won't save anymore
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-23,hold up its giving gabumon on all fours
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,whos that pokemon? its arcanine!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,i made a perfect work yakumo besides remarkable craftsman whats the chance of getting a pal with all the same traits
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-21,what is that bow that u use on the frostallion?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,but how do i get the passives i want on yakumo? catching and breeding till it pops up? i catched hundreds of pals and the rainbow traits are barely there
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,"quick question , idk if anyone asked this, if i raid bellanoir with yakumo out does the egg have chances to get the passives or is it just in the wild?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,wait i'm still able to breed legend off my frostalion? idk why it doesn't work on ur dog
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-05,sadly i lost my world due to palworld not being able to save some kinda bug on xbox i cant find out how to fix it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,"i have a lucky lamball, if i use them and a nitewing whats the chance my new pal will come out with lucky?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,bro how are you using a bow to deal so much damage to frostallion like wth
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,how is there three frostallions?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,i have a question i searchd on google with nit really an answer xd i breed about a 100 shadowbeaks and once the breeding container had to the normal glow also some sparkles on top and made another sound when hatching but i could not see any difference to my other shadowbeak? can someone explain what that sparkle is for?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,can passive skills be changed?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,can someone tell me the best passives to have on yakumo? for combat purposes
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,would legend work?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-04,how did he dealt 8000 damage in one shot ?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,yeah i'm doing it now but i couldn't remember if gender matter or not?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,i could not get demon god to transfer.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,"wait, yakumo can actually pass the new passives?!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,this is incorrect. legend can be inherited by yakumo. i have a photo of my own to prove it
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,does anyone just play games to have fun anymore
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-11,only disappointed by yakumo cuz you can ride it but holy shit does its ride speed suck ass
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-07,this still doesnt help me understand how to get the rainbow passives so this rlly isnt helpful
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-07,bro can i recommend slowing down. i can barely understand you. respectfully.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-08,you don't. think i know that
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-06,its still faster to just breed for passives
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,duckhmanzch
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"lmao, getting sued by nintendo and then adding lightsabers is absolutely the ultimate power move."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"this update has been an absolute treasure! some of the best qol implementations ever. the extra inventory slots, the cross base inventory box, the new pal sphere modifiers. i am loving it."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,mfs waited for nintendo to sue just so they knew what to remove to cancel them out
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"you know what i love most about these updates? their not even the 1.0 version of the game yet, all these new islands are still being added during early access"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,i guess nintendo just owns the rights to throwing spheres
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"blitz you should check the tech tree again. they add stuff for the lower levels of the tree. also, the bounty tokens the ones you get from the bounty people on the map, that are purple on the mapyou got can be turned in to a guard in a village"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,i cracked up when jetragon got shot down from exploring the new island for the first time. yep sucks doesnt it? i know cause it happened to me too lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,hey blitz! so glad you're still playing palworld. don't forget to always have smokie out when you're mining chromite to collect more d also they're more common in boss cavesdungeons
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"check backwards... they added stuf for earlier levels too in the tech list. and some of said techs are all kinds of awesome. seriously, you get cheap stuf to do serious damage, chests that transcend time and space, a research center turn your pals into scientists to make your team extra awesome! and so on and so forth."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,"i bought it 2 days ago, just randomly on ps5, and have been hooked! your video is the only reason i know that some of this is new content!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,for those who don't know you can catch the npc bounty's and you have to disable all of the antiair missiles in order to use a flying mount and an easy way to catch mimog is to box it in
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"they'll get sued by disney next. lightsabers. beam sword shouldn't get them into trouble, now if it was called a lightzaber or something similar then 100 yes they'd come after them."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,just a warning the aa defenses will target you regardless if your flying mount is grounded... physically grounded even. the aa ai only checks if you're mounted to a flyable mount.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,to get night sand you have to be on beaches at night and you will see it in new place
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"modders also brought back the original summon mechanic, not the animation though, but still. one of these days they will find a way to restore it fully."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"keep your other sword, cuz the beam sword cant mine anything. i found that out the hard way. also, if you want the armor, the boots, the belt, the plasma gun, the gatlin gun, etc., the grind for hexolite and chromite is best found in the cave dungeons. the overworld has those spots too, but cave dungeons are where i got most of mine, so yeah. have a wonderful day!"

Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,i've been waiting for you to play and upload a video on feybreak! thank you!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,what we have all been waiting for keep it up blitz!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,i've been waiting for this video glad your back blitz missed your palworld videos
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,gotta love how nintendo refuses to improve their products and sues anything remotely better than them instead of
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,1229 ancient civvzuilacshin parts
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,if you want to insta heal your pals wait til night and sleep.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-28,i enjoyed watching this ... am sick as a dog this was a good distraction as well as entertaining.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,"i haven't played since it first came out! thanks for showing us some of the new stuff! still trying to figure it out, like the expedition building!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"palworld should add a feature to the pal box that allows storage access to full base and if wanted could sort everything the best the game could with the amount of storage, or make the pals transport from palbox to storage and to sort"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,that truck needs a good steam cleaning!  40 years of lot lizard shmegma in that sleeper!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"ive been watching your content forever, waiting for more palworld"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,very lovely video  i'm very excited to try out this new update it's gonna be alot of fun also i look forward to seeing all the new pals  also maraith is so cute i wonder if there will be a plushie of it someday if so i'm buying one  gn or good day to you
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,"i left before they added anything on palworld pretty much only things were patches for fixes. returning theres so much new stuff added and tbh, all the game needs is a story and better music for the background and its pretty much a finished game in my eyes. that's nothing to say about the mods that people have made between then legit updating the shiny and alt colours idea that was pretty much for 23 pals has now expanded to a whole lot more! the bnl one being my fave, it makes nighttime looks mysterious and beautiful. loads of starts in the sky to get lost in. there are many more amazing mods avoid the nsfw stuff though as creativity spans all forms...  that you can try and at the end of it all the game feels fun. as fun as playing pokemon gen 1  5 or in my case 6 as well back in the day or a digimon game. tbh palworld imo is a parody of monster catching games and a really good one too! sure the pals look familiar because its a parody if they didn't look anything alike nobody would know what they're parodying but more importantly, its ironic that a parody is more fun than the actual thing. nintendo needs to see this as a wakeup call to add more fun to their games because if not, i can see more parodies doing a better job in future. tbh i just want pokemon to do better and palworld to stay around and i hope they do."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-18,would be so funny if they made the palshpere just slide on the ground until the old throw range
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"003 my brother in christ, we can no longer throw our pal spheres! it's an absolute loss for all parties except nintendo and sets a precedent that they can do whatever they want and get away with it! that luigi fella really shouldn't have been caught and continued his... my lawyer has advised me not to continue this bit."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,hes back with the palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,finally a new palworld vid
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,the thing that gets me is how tf they gonna say they came up with the catching system when pocket pair has had the mechanic in a game some 2019! craftopia came out in 2019 and has had the same mechanics and came out 3 years before arceus how can pokmon company get away with this suit? its ridiculous honestly
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,the critical on spheres feel so good
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"you take fall damage if you fall. but, if you are riding a pall and they fall, there is no damage. you can jump from the highest peak, as long as you are mounted, you are good."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,i love your content blitz! keep up the great work!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,think they should replace the throw move with a whip d
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,431 can i ride you? that have multiple meaning
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,i cant wait to see how this game looks in another year
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,i still think they should have swapped the throw animation for firing a deployment pistol. that way the gameplay isn't nerfed and it gets around nintendo's throwing nonsense.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,wait til he found the maumere sword  on tech
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,"oh my god, blitz!? i havent seen your videos in a decade"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,looks like i need to hop back into palworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,i love how alot of the updates seem to be just poking the bear back at nintendo there hardcore mode is basically a nuzlocke something nintendo hates players do the spear modifications are similer to the special balls in legends arceus like the one that makes them heavy but increes catch rate is just a leaden ball to me its poking fun at how once nintendo plays with a concept they dont touch it again every time i look at this update i find more things they are doing xd
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,i think you missed the earlier stuff their are much more weapons like now you can craft a cowboy style six shooter. the new one you got you can craft a shotgun and more.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,gotta respect palworld for squashing corporate greed
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"soooo, a new pal can be breed by breedingnanubis and frostalion right?"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,chromite is moreso found in alpha pal caves and dungeons.
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,let's go new video
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,so far i found chromite lot more often by fighting bosses that are underground or the dungeons with 4 ore spawns in certain rooms
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,i love watching blitz he awease makes me laugh!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,keep playing this is great!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"imo i think it's better to just summon your pal to your side instead of targeting and throwing...makes me feel a bit epic, like have you met my friend, sir fluffles? summons beastagon xd"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,we need moreeeee!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,me when i know nintendo sues palworld  nooooooo! but when blitz uploaded palworld me eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,"blitz you can download the hp fix for pvp server, casting a pal out where u face just no throw animation due to nintendo but works the same... you can this by going to nexusmods, and u just place on server side folder and it will auto update for all users on user server."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,they had a golden coins assembly line
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,build your own animal?  chkn gameplay
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,chromium can also be found in supply drops on new island
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"guys, wait until wildcard gets involved because building mechanics and leveling up"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,blitz did you know dredge has dlc if you even remember dredge
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,"2103  lets just run windows update real quick... oh, it wants to upgrade to 11... delete system 32... okay. aa tower disabled."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,pal time!!!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,hey blitz there is a research station it's in the start
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"im currently doing a palworld run where i never unlock pal spheres, vixiw in ranch and overworld finds are my only pal spheres the only pal sphere i might unlock are the top tier ones that cant be found in such sources"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,"yeah, the hardest part of the new map, is finding nearby warp points...."
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-30,"for anyone that wants to know, chromite is easier to find in caves"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,i've been waiting
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,you can find a bunch of chromite from certain caves
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,i only need to find three more raid slab fragmet
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,"nintendo had no sayso, it was the pokemon company."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-18,did you know having smoky out of your sphere it doubles how much chromite you get
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,1830 if u take an hour to order your items its so much more chill love the vids keep up the great content
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,woo!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,it so peak
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,"umm... the reason they swapped to summoning to the side was because thrown pals would sometimes clip into terrain or fall through the world, i had experienced the issue myself before they implemented the change"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-31,i want to get astarion as a mount too...
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,my question is when are we going to the big tree because the newest island is technically the farthest from it
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,smokeys are so cute and i was the first one who got on the update
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,"i was wondering why it wasnt throwing the pals out, and i thought it was a bug."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-01,"now the question is, can you play a new random world.... and i mean full random, not just regional."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-09,i don't know anyone belives me but while watching this video i got a pokemon ad.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-04,i caught nimble lol
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,yay
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,was waiting for this vid!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,the maximum level is 60 with the new update
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,there a new setting to remove weight my guy!
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,"they need to fix the light sabre, its currently unusable. huge attack delay and long animation, and its all to easy to overshoot your attack completely missing 70 of the time!"
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,get to level 60 you an unlock a egg incubator that can hatch 10 eggs at once
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-26,real blitz fan assemble!
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,you sound like blitz from helluvabodd
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,ilovepalworld
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,hey blitz have you tride shape of dreams yet? its on demo currently but its fun i reccomend you to play it if you want to i wont force you
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-27,wth. i only get 50 chromite per spot and i only find them in special caves
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,so you still throw the spheres to catch pals?
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-28,go get the new chrismas skins for your pals and sue nintendo
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-10,after the samurai island update i wasn't able to catch the tower boss anymore. did they fix it with this new update or is it still removed?
Survival,Palworld,2024-12-29,"can you please tell me how you have so much stamina while flying? also, if it's a mod are you on a server? i hear servers can only use pak mods. blitz"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,"for some reason, pals assigned to research laboratories unassign themselves after completing the research, so be sure to reassign them next time!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,mimogs roasting on an open fire no! no! it's a month too late for that. now you have to wait another 10 at least.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,another fun fact with food sorting your inventory resets perishable items to their original times.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,i've noticed cake won't spoil if in the breeding farm storage either
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,it's possible to fit 5 extractors on 1 node. ultimate end game for the american expansionist
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-15,mimog also doesn't run away if you kill it in one hit
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"also, hitting sort will cause food in a nonguild chest to reset its spoil timer. as with the guild chest, hopefully this never gets patched."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,be careful if you try doubling up oil extractor cuz you'll need a ton of electricity
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"finally! i always hated those little mimics! i never tortured koroks, but now i will now how it felt 3"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-20,that campire and mining trap is brutal. might have to try it. im already going to palworld hell for catching humans anyway
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"finally, i can catch that pesky ass mimic thingy!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"i like to think the guild chests work by transcending time and space to make items accessible in multiple places at the same time and this is why food doesn't spoil. you make a great point that ot could be patched, i am just trying to justify why i think this is either an intended feature or a reason to make it stay lol."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,"i used to just build walls around the mimogs, but on hills that can be tough! this method sounds better!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-28,"this is super helpful! can't wait to try these, especially the mimog tips. thank you!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"there's another way to capture treasure pals if you didn't get the hang trap, simply build a box around them and create a fish in a barrel, especially make a hot barrel with a camp fire."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,food spoil timer gets reset when you sort inventory. so every once in a while you can sort inventory on the cooler and the timer gets reset
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-22,"also, mimic dont run from every stun in the game, so rockets are finerocket launcher and jetdragon rockets works"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-17,"i knew all of these from getting really into the game over the summer. however... since replaying and starting fresh, realizing i haven't been using the hanging trap on mimog is really annoying. in more progressed saves i just flew around lava zones with rate increased. mimog groups are easily noticeable since they're constantly taking damage."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,that double extractor tip is insane. thank you !
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-02,the research stations task is shared between all bases. so you only one to start the research in your main base and have more stations in say you breeding base or other bases that don't have as many active tasks needed.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"my husband noticed food wont spoil if you click the sort button, it restarts the countdown"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"also for mimog use ring of mercy to not deal death blows, and shoot them from afar. they dont run away unless you atta k from close range or attempt to catch. so, take them to one hp from afar, then get closer and hit them with whatever pal sphere gives you 100 depending on their level. i think i got this with giga sphere, not positive."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,shit i think all 5 of these gave me at least some new take on the topic
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,awesome. thanks!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,mimog also doesn't run away if you use an electric attack they just go back to sleep.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,i discovered that mimog glitch accidentally thinking it was a regular chest
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"that mimog vs hanging trap is huge, those little shits are fast and hard to catch as you basically blast them and hope the pal sphere connects and captures it otherwise it will run at mock 15. for a low tech alternative for assigning research, simply pick up the pal and throw them at it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,... how did i forget about the snare trap? that is much cheaper than building a structure around the mimog...
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-15,meanwhile my dumb ass is planning on creating small bear traps for mimogs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"i hope the guild chest protecting items from spoilage never gets patched as its how i can keep producing food for my 4 bases. without it, id be fresh out of so much stuff."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-12,i noticed the chest critter wont run if you use some long range weapons. it's not a distance thing either because i noticed some weapons will make it run at the same distance.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-26,damyummm i dont know that u can double it ... really good to know man . thanks
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,problem with the oil production is how rough two are on a power... i have a big generator with four capacitors.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"imo i have no problem with food cuz once i made some, it's for the base pals and as for my journey i dont need to store any food in guild chest"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,ok the glasses trick is good
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,2 best tip of all time
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,here i've been building structures around mimog so they can't run away. i feel so stupid
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,given the guild chest exists in a packet dimension i think the timer pause is deliberate
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,mimog's also won't run if you attack with a meteor launcher.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,we need a 2 in one fire trap next patch
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"also note that the two oil extractors means more electricity, so you may need more generators and more electric pals. it's absolutely worth it to increase that production but i wanted to mention it to help others prepare. also having katress out when you catch or kill mimog increases the item drop rate, especially if katress is condensed for the partner skill! imo this is absolutely worth breeding and condensing for since katress is great for battle and expeditions outside of increasing dog coin."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,wow i didn't know the iv trick thanks lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,or shoot with a water cannon that you feel your pal with.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-25,yeah these are real and super efficient for oil there is a vid how to do it right its quite challengeing
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,i tend to forget the hanging trap exists
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-17,cake doesn't spoil in the breeding farm chest!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,oil rig trick on xbox is hit or miss depeding on the node
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,i smell freedom
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"i just cant put 2 oil in one spot, its blocks any kind of construction close some pal or build is blocking"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,"i legit never thought how to use the hanging trap unusually, that's for sure. but the ability glasses go into your key items, right? also, i thought the recent patch stopped double oil pumps from working. or at least if it does, which sides do i need to place on, since i heard the shape of the side will make it easier to perform."
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,so with the glasses are you just looking for yellow numbers or are there specific ideal values for every pal?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-31,i do this with 9999 baked berries
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,sadly i can't play pal world anymore because i tried to download some questionable mods and broke my files
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,"i tried to do the oil trick, but i couldnt get it. i was trying in the area where there are three nodes close to each other other"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,do you realize just how much electricity it takes to even run a single oil extractor? certainly more than any of my pals can charge the thing.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-10,if you catch a trainer will it fight for you with its pals?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-01,is the oil rig trick still working
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-15,justice for mimogs...they didn't do anything wrong
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-27,was that a meowmear from terraria?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-12,wont work 6 in oli rigs because the energy it too high
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-30,can you still fit two extractors in one node in the current patch?
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-11,does food spoil on the ground?
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-13,i've tried to many times to put 2 oil extractors on one spot. it's impossible for me.
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-16,cant place to oil farms on 1 oil patch
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,wym assignment board? is that a mod or was it patched out or something??
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-29,"mimig trapping doesn't work. do i need to place it better, or what?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-06,ivs arents important u can literally just get iv potions
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-24,2 extractors no more i think 0.4.13 i tried but can not
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-14,"oil production is way too slow, waste of time"
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-19,a existe encore a
Survival,Palworld,2025-01-14,you don't think i know how to play palworld
