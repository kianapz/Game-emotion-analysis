It helps kickstart the breed for endgame worker and combat pals process, and its a low resource cost strategy (Cremis can be caught easily with blue spheres, or greens south of the Anubis desert, Mossanda are a relatively painless catch with yellows, and trivial catch with reds, which are still fairly cheap spheres). Also, back to Mossanda, it makes Sootseer with Vanwyrm - which is another good pal to mass catch because Vanwyrms can make Anubis and Faleris and are also low level common enemies west of the Azurobe alpha. One sootseer and one Kelpsea at the ranch are all the bones and liquid youl ever need for the cement needs of red sphere mass fabrication, and that sets you up for breeding into Astegon to solve all your mining bottlenecks.",1

Personally I focus on Anubis for breeding specifically as I have a ton of breeding chains that fork out from it in addition to it being the best generalist pal imo. You will want one for combat as an element swap pal, so that covers a Demon/Serenity set. You will want one for work speed (RC/Art) as not only is it BIS handywork but also breeds directly into Bastigor down the line, and indirectly to things like Jorm/lyleen/Jignis via Faleris. Lastly it makes a pretty competent transporter for natural nodes and ranches at midgame as it has surprisingly good speed so you can even use a Swift/Runner set.
