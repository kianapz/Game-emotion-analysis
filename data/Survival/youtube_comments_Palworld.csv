gLU8vfYpj_U,@alephnole7009,2025-02-24T16:54:27Z,"As somebody who played at launch for a few months and enjoyed it for the most part my main questions are: did they fix pal pathing to prevent them from getting stuck on literally everything and starving? 
Did they noticably expand the base building system with more complex parts? 

My biggest issue with this game was that it was pointless to make any interesting base designs because the pals would just get stuck on everything and halt all production. And there wasn't very much you could do with the building regardless.

Compared to something like Grounded which I've spent over 300 hours in",2

I used to love ARK but I mostly solo and that game is an absolute chore solo unless you crank up settings.

gLU8vfYpj_U,@keenshibe7529,2024-12-04T05:54:49Z,"I am glad you and everyone else is enjoying the game!

But how different is it compared to launch in terms of polish? Also from what I experienced after playing through all the base content from launch, there does not seem much new content other than the new region. 

My thoughts is that gameplay can be jarring and not optimized properly, and the assets used are not pleasant. Customization options for buildings and furniture are extremely lacking as well. Having played other survival games such as Subnautica and Green Hell, it does seem like a survival-lite instead. There is no tension and challenge, but if the goal is a more cozy and casual game, nothing wrong with that. 

From your playtime, I assume you played on launch? If so, what is your opinion on the differences other than Sakurajima?",0

hka3YOx-Tfg,@scucci,2025-02-24T23:01:48Z,"I might've missed it when you were talking about ancient technology points... but I found a pretty easy way to stock up on them quickly. Do a dungeon, don't pick up or mine anything, kill the boss and grab the two chests at the teleporter. When you exit, turn around and go back into the dungeon. Run through to the exit teleporter, there will be two more chests. Rinse, repeat... You can usually do this 4 times or so, but I stop at 3 to make sure the timer doesn't run out and close the dungeon when I leave. On the 3rd time through, go ahead and mine and pick up mushrooms or whatever, go ahead and get that other chest that you have been skipping. Most of the time there will be 3 of each thing because it just spawns items on top of items that you left behind on those other run throughs. Now you have 3X as many chances of getting good stuff, including ancient tech and tech points.",1

A good negative passive to have when capturing pals. The mercy ring is also active when youre riding a pal and use its active skills, meaning that you'll leave enemies down to 1 hp as long as youre riding the pal.

I want the technology points back. I'll give it another go on the Steam version and update the comment for that if it's different.

Edit: You cannot build too close to a Black Marketeer on PC either, and you cannot death warp to locations previously unknown. Tried to do both on PC on a new world but was unable to see the other respawn locations and I was unable to build anywhere near the Black Marketeer at any of the abandoned church locations.

zOHDoJ1vqQ8,@WakoDoodle,2025-01-13T18:33:19Z,"I left before they added anything on palworld (pretty much only things were patches for fixes). Returning theres so much new stuff added and tbh, all the game needs is a story and better music for the background and its pretty much a finished game in my eyes. 

That's nothing to say about the mods that people have made between then; legit updating the shiny and alt colours idea that was pretty much for 2-3 pals; has now expanded to a whole lot more! The BNL one being my fave, it makes nighttime looks mysterious and beautiful. Loads of starts in the sky to get lost in. There are many more amazing mods (avoid the NSFW stuff though as creativity spans all forms... ) that you can try and at the end of it all the game feels fun. As fun as playing pokemon gen 1 - 5 (or in my case 6 as well) back in the day or a digimon game.

Tbh Palworld imo is a parody of monster catching games and a really good one too! Sure the pals look familiar because its a parody; if they didn't look anything alike nobody would know what they're parodying but more importantly, its ironic that a parody is more fun than the actual thing. Nintendo needs to see this as a wakeup call to add more fun to their games because if not, I can see more parodies doing a better job in future. Tbh I just want pokemon to do better and palworld to stay around and I hope they do.",1

Anyways, I hope that the info on the Remarkable Craftsmanship (1 of the Rainbow passives) and the Rainbow passives helps you out and take care now Cj.",3

Use the bat as soon as possible but don’t unlock the bow. Keep using the bat until you get high enough to unlock the crossbow or you can run around and open chest until you find the crossbow schematic. Doing this saves a decent amount of tech points and lets you advance a good bit pretty fast since when you unlock the crossbow that early you’ll be one tapping a lot of small pals and it’ll be easier to melt the weaker alpha pals",1

H4b9aJgeZ0I,@michaelhayes8519,2024-02-18T17:40:53Z,"While the fast teavel points are a little annoying, i do enjoy that the game doesn't just let you freely travel like that. 

It forces you to explore and delve deeper into the late game options for mobility. 

Feel like you're moving too slow? 
Get a grappling gun and a gliding mount, gliding is a much faster way to traverse, and you can spam it. 
Grappling gun also lets you cut climbing time in half, if you look for points on a cliff you can stand on. 

Still feel like you're moving too slow?
Get a ground or flying mount, get a faster ground or flying mount. 
Upgrade both of those mounts for the fastest mounts in game. 

Palworld gives you the ability to dominate the map, it just doesn't hand it to you. 

Thats something i really enjoy. 

It also gives you bases, which if used correctly, can set a fast travel point to anywhere you need. 

I have a base for iron, coal and i plan on setting one for quarts. 
The tower warp at the volcano can be farmed for sulfer. 
That covers all of my needs.

I could blend my iron and coal farms to free up one of my bases if i wanted to be more efficient.

My coal farm also has tucotuco spawns for gunpowder, right by Anubis spawn. Also doubles as palfluid farm with damud",12

I mean you seem smart and knowledgable but.. Where's the entertainment in this video?  I literally premeditated to find the most interesting part of the video (it was in the gameplay loop section) .. and ad popped up.  The ad was way more entertaining to me.  Even the title though..

I'm just saying try to add a little bit more entertaining to your videos.. maybe try the title section?

zNev_-Kjn5E,@ZephyrosNocte,2025-02-15T07:51:28Z,"Look, the remeshing is shady af, but don't they look way better than the pokemon they ripped off? Like Serperior, even though I liked the design at first it always looked sort of incomplete, my literal first though upon gazing an azurobe was like ""Oh look, is like an actually good looking serperior"".

Many pals feel like weird combos of certain pokemon, but at the same time said fusions will never exist in a pokemon game, so it's nice to experience those ""fakemons"" in an actually fun and playable form. I'm not sure how to feel about the electric Totoro rip-off, but hey, gaming companies do things that are way worse all the time and we accept it anyways.

Also, this is the only ""Breath of the Wild clone"" that I actually enjoyed playing, even though games like Sonic frontier or Genshin Impact are actually good, I never really enjoyed the whole Windows XP background simulator with infinite collectibles, and this is actually one of the few things I would also frown upon in Palworld (I'm looking at you, lifmunk statues), but there are other focuses inside the game that deviate from what I consider bad gaming practices. Pals have a soul to them (not the literal one we put in the blender), some of them have animations that really scream the Pal's personality, even though many things in the game are generalized, you can also find some love and craftmanship when paying attention to certain details. Not bad for a first try at the ""f you PKMN, make a good game"" initiative.

Also this video is a year old now, updates have expanded the game quite nicely since, and developers seem to listen. We can only hope Palworld's future will not meet the same fate as Pokemon's.",0

I just love that spot as the first base. Plus, you aim the base boundary right, and you'll have 3 iron nodes in your base for start, which isn't bad at all.",0

FdukX2LK52c,@Chazzvc,2024-02-22T21:30:28Z,"1:06 I find it better to stagger the catch bonus out. Try to catch as few as possible before lv25. Then at 25 I can get to 34 very quick since I can just catch low level pals in rapid succession and their exp per catch will be much higher than it was at the start. 

catch bonus scales with your level. By late game Killamari goes from a sad 80 exp at lv15 to a whopping 23,000 at lv49 because I missed 4. 
lv49-50 is 1700k which means you need about 70 captures. Imagine if you planned 70 early game pals to capture 10 of. 49-50 becomes a joke. 

You get loads of exp grinding alphas, especially if those alphas were around your level, it could be a 25% level chunk per kill. 
Though late game alphas are much harder to kill, eat up more resources and ammo to capture/kill. So its better to grind alphas early and capture pals late.",0

FdukX2LK52c,@crossvinburn831,2024-02-21T16:30:53Z,"How to get saved and be right with God for eternal life! As anyone can get saved!

1-Realize that everyone has sinned before God in some way or another.

Romans 3: 10+23 (KJB) 
10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

2-Realize that God loved us, even as wicked sinners, enough to allow Jesus to pay the full price for our sins as a freely given gift.

Romans 5: 8-9 (KJB) 
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""
9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""

 3-Confess unto God, asking to be forgiven of your sins by accepting this free gift of forgiveness, that is given freely to whosoever does so.

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.""
13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:""
28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

(Lastly here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. 
I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”",0

Crank the meteoriteé supply drop down to 1. This will make them drop down every minute to get free oil, pal spheres etc. Also they drop those little bottle things.

Make walls out of campfires to defeat/weaken bosses easily early game. Especially mammorest.

Ok so… funny story. When I played this game around this time, I discovered that you could actually catch the legendary pals by just sneaking up behind them then chucking legendary spheres at them. It was like a 10% catch rate, but 10-20 legendary spheres was a worthy cost for an early legend.

Edit: just tested this again, it still works! 6% chance with 13 leafmunk upgrades and the tier 1 sniper node, as well as the sphere tier above legendary, caught myself a sleeping frostallion.",0

If  I am higher level higher sphere and +6 it should ALWAYS say 100% but on lucky pals it is not.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3 foot 3 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they are large enough to handle humans, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.

DJx_HYw2XZs,@LookingGlass1865,2024-10-27T06:43:54Z,"🤓☝️ Um, actually, Nintendo isn't actually suing Palworld for making creatures that are similar to Pokémon. Nintendo has actually *patented* the game mechanic of ""throwing a ball at a creature which then captures said creature."" They're suing Palworld because it uses this mechanic.

Now, this whole situation is kind of shady, because around the time that Palworld was created, this patent didn't exist. Then, once Palworld started getting popular, Nintendo made the patent and subsequently sued Palworld. So essentially, they didn't care about Palworld when it was a small game with a small fanbase, but the second they start making money, Nintendo scrambles to find a way to sue them for everything they own.

Obviously Palworld is different enough from Pokémon to be its own thing, rather than a straight rip-off. This just feels like Nintendo getting greedy and grasping at every opportunity to make some money, even if it involves absolutely destroying an indie game studio.

Also, we should all be very afraid of the use of patents in gaming. Basically, because of this patent, nobody can make a game that uses the Pokeball mechanic without risk of being sued. It's absolutely insane, and makes me worried for the future of games.

I'm not good at explaining any of this, so if you want a better and more succinct explanation of the situation, PirateSoftware has a good video all about it.",0

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3 foot 3 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they are large enough to handle humans, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there is no doubt in my mind that an aroused vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so you could easily have ... with one for hours without getting sore.",1

You should've set up 2 teams. Build team and fight team. Build team with miner and crafter also player craft and mining speed boost. Get the build team out at your base for fast crafting of gears.

The game is not suppose to be hard if you find it hard you out steching yourself. First get your base ready. 4 berry plantations ranch with chicken sheep bee also condense them for greater productivity. Make sure you have base pals that cover all the jobs.

some tips that should help you

the messenger of love NPC is if you do the emote they say (the surprised or whatever they ask for) then you get free loot

get the homing module it gives you +3 capture power and gives you the same effect as the homing launcher from the days of old game

if you build the bastigor with the new passives they added you can do some nutty damage",4

ZNLYJoSAvrw,@TrueSighted,2025-02-20T02:12:06Z,"Did you ever post the link with that youtuber who made the video on the rocket launch base? It seems interesting. 

Good video. I just got into palworld on a solo world, and am in my mid level 30's after a week, and spent the last 2 days breading a way to get a shadow beak. It was quite frustrating, as I had watched a video with an old breeding order to get to shadow beak within 6 different breeding's. And pick up a few other great pals along the way, but as it was old information, Some of the string did not produce the Pals they use to produce. So I spent 2 days, trial and error, and looking into whatever info I could find on different Pal combo's, looking for which combo's produced the desired pals, and which did not. Until I finally found a set of pals  that would get me to an Astegon, which I had red was the new combo partner for the final step in the string. And I finally found the pals I needed to get him. And was finally able to confirm that pair would work. 

All in all it took me a string of about 12ish pals, to finally get all the pal pairs I needed as prerequisites. And Brought in 4 new baby Shadow Beaks. Several Astegons trying to get the right genders, a few cryolink terra's, and ever the oddball Dazemu, Azurmane, Nyafia, and Nightmarry. not to mention Grizzbolt and the palls it took to get him, as well as the Sakura Aqua I managed to find an egg for, by chance when exploring to open the map up in the more dangerous areas of Pal World. no risk no reward. Was Quite the process, but I ended up with plenty of cool pals with some interesting stats, that should come in handy later. when I try to optimize more. 

Even got one of those pals you mentioned, with that ability to help catch pals with the same stats, but had no idea he could do that. He popped up when I was hitting dead ends with getting reliable data on things, and decided to do a few random breeding's. At that point I figured I had nothing to loose. Guess I should put him to work in the future, and remember how I made him. lol  But, yeah.. Any info on usable accurate information, really comes in handy. Guessing at random really doesn't do it for me. I like to be able to find the advantages I want, and seize them. making them My Advantage. I figure shadow Beak looks pretty interesting, and should be valuable to me in some ways in the future. And until I have the power to take down the legendries, I can always breed up some back up that makes things entertaining along the way. 

I'm going after a flying mount that's probably the best mount before the legendries, next. Should be simple once I breed Smokie. Then I'll go hunting more in the world again. My characters growing stronger every day. 2 bases up and counting. one general purpose, one metal and breeding. though I just learned about the upgrade to the work monitoring station. So I need to go back and unlock it, if I want to customize and dial in the bases further. The ability to turn off/deselect unwanted traits in the base, sounds like a gamechanger. here's hoping.",0

- you got the raid bosses with perfect stats even tho neither bellanoir libero nor xenovader can be yakumo-encountered; you basically say to breed hundreds of them for the random god given passives that sometimes show up to be rainbow..
- Dr. Brawn can take away more than one good passive and transform them into negative ones
- the yakumo you use to farm the ""perfect pals"" does not feature perfect passives
- you got all those raidbosses maxed out but it's your first time killing the Tarantriss Alpha?
- you're that far in the lategame and don't know about the button to instantly fill the incubator?
- you got all those raidbosses maxed out and run around on lvl 60 with a meowmere and measly 15 exotic balls?

Be sure to always have the stone, wood and paladium fragments in you to make them since traveling to reach them again can be a pain in the backside.

Chromite: easily found in dungeons and using the metal detectors the pal smokie and like the last ore the pal Silvegis can be mass breed and put them to bed to get it as well. New materials: predator cores are from rampaging pals unfortunately their not on your map so you would have to look up where specific they are casue I don’t know all of them and they cannot be caught no matter what, Giant pal souls: bosses usually drop them or chest/supply drops that are in the new island same with Rampaing pals to.

NCq3UZ96jXY,@BluePoo52,2025-01-29T01:40:14Z,"For the expedition sites I just build a wall like 6-10 segments high and then build a roof and put the site there. Just gotta make sure you have foundation down in your base to build roofs. It might look kinda ugly, but you can use a flying pal or a grappling gun to get up to it. And your base pals don’t need to be able to walk to the expedition site so you don’t need a walkway to the entrance.

NCq3UZ96jXY,@jannetlouis103,2025-01-23T06:36:36Z,"For those questioning of how Accumulators actually work:

Accumulators are like a Base’s Power Bank and they “stack” in the way of increasing its battery size. Where just one provides 100% battery and every additional accumulator would add another 10%, for example (not real percentages)

That is why they all charge and drain together. The more you have, the longer it takes to fully charge and fully drain. Having multiple is beneficial.",8

NCq3UZ96jXY,@Balila_balbal_loki,2025-01-18T04:00:08Z,"Actual best working pals.

For kindling it's sootseer you get it condensed to rank 4 and 1 kindling book gets it to rank 5 kindling. It stops to eat much less than jorm ignis and works 24/7 because its also a dark. Using farming books gets it even higher lets it spawn bones in the ranch while its waiting for you to start any cooking simply have the stand nearby your kitchen and forge to quickly switch from the ranch to it.

If you find a bunch of farming books you can get vixy to rank 5 ranching which lets it dig out exotic spheres. Moozarina and chikipi and beegrade would give an item per game tick there are 10 ticks a second you will get 10 eggs a second so for the most part i got 1 wumpo stuck on ranch collecting 10 honey,10 milk and 10 eggs.

Quit breeding and catching just do expiditions they are worth it and they show the rewards just run around catching pals for xp and go the sanctuary for tech manuals catch strong pals struggle and beat bosses once to unlock expiditions and you become gucci. 

All of the books can be gotten from expiditions.

Best handiwork pal is ribbunny you need 4 handiwork books to get to rank 5 as well as condensing it. It has the fastest ammo and weapon manufacturering in game higher than capped workspeed anubis and it stops to eat a third of the times anubis does. 

Best planting pal is shroomer noct comboes with lulu. Use planting books to max that skill out and condense the shroomer and lulu because they drop the sanity for all base pals and lulu makes skill trees and crops grow faster.

Best watering pal is teafant you need a ton of watering books to get it to rank 5 but this dude doesn't stop to eat like ever when watering a skill tree a pair of them is enough for anything one can do 999 flour while the other one does 999 grinder. 

For transport you need to place a container in a none pal accessible area above the ground this makes transport pals teleport the items in it. The end result a wumpo walks and scoops everything and everything immediately ends up in the container you can stack the containers on each other for more storage. 

Best mining pal is mammorest you need the mining books for it compared it to rank 5 mining digtoise and mammorest because his default work speed is really high and his animation is a single swing to the deal the dmg side by side a 1 min vid he is roughly producing 30% more but this is at rank 5 mining only so you need 4 mining books to get there. 

Dazzi noct is the best electric pal because she uses the least food and works 24/7 you need the manuals to get it to rank 5 electrical generation.",3

NCq3UZ96jXY,@Kodamare,2025-01-17T22:00:16Z,"From what I can tell, Accumulators DO NOT stack, they appear to work similar to the work proficiency items like fountain, garden bed, electric pylon, etc where only 1 benefits you. I built a ton of them at that 3 node volcano base with 6 oil extractors and all the accumulators will decrease in power at the same time. I also tried building them at different times so they had different levels of energy, same thing, they all go down at the same right not one by one like you would imagine. I bred 2 Orserks with nocturnal traits and work traits, everything works better, alternatively if you have space like I do and its only a few pals needed, use some Helzephyr Lux as they have lv 3 electric base and are naturally nocturnal if you just want something to hold over for the night

Also for the Double Oil Extractors per node, as far as I can tell, you want to be facing SW or NE when placing them trying to put them on the very edge of where the game will allow you. The Oil Spots are all the same meaning they are the same odd shape (they are not complete circles) and they are all oriented the exact same on the map. So face either SW or NE when placing them and you'll have no issues. Did this like 2-3 days ago after I saw people posting it was patched and as of writing, it is not patched",40

- Some additional set for structure that feels like a nice home on the insode. We got a lot of nice furniture after all.

Beyond that, I of cause hope for more space in my Pal-Box! There are a lot new Pals to catch after all!

I also hope the world itself and the Dungeons get more polish. They feel rather rudementry right now.

Thanks to all the devs that made us have a great first year with Palworld! I can't wait for more ;)",1

If you capture him, you can do this once a day, and its a good way to get the new rare Traits.
I had a spare Xenolord that I called Brawn's Pawn, and once a day I use that Xenolord to get random roll's on it. I've already had other Xenolord pawns get given Demon Lord and Vampire using this NPC.

Best way to capture him is in the Northern desert in Sakurajima - he has a chance to spawn near to the Fast Travel as he's considered a world event, like the Pal Nests you find.
If he hasn't spawned, fly about 200m away so the area refreshes, then just keep going to and from until he spawns.",25

Is honey so just kill or breed pals that drop honey there thats a better tip your welcome i am pretty sure there a guy you can kill over and over for money as well so money shouldn't be a problem and you could always set up a ore frame and sell the ore to buy ingredients for cake  if you have it set up right you can also have a cave there for your pals this guys tip is ok but I just made some better 6 minutes in it's like hold up wait a minute lol  yes the cave for the pals are big just have to have it out of the way bulid a 5 wall high platform with stairs obviously, your pals are in the cave. Getting  materials a couple pals are getting you ore good little money farme I have a pal cave at all bases that's just the beginning for someone that been playing day one i know more then some youtube as you can tell good video there's a few good tip oh ya 100 % drop rate when you kill anubies for large pal souls",0

And no need to apologize.
Info was concise, informative, and easy to follow.

I'm enjoying the update.
I haven't hit Feybreak yet cause I just moved apartments and I am set on breeding my main pal team with the traits I like.

But I i did make a Katana...
I'm mixed on it gameplay wise. I wosh I could toggle on/off or use the slash dash as a special move instea dof every attack. (I may have slashed myself off some cliffs....)

I need to make the sphere modules, I haven't toted with em yet.
Are they key items or inventory?

(Also I hope he can at some point change the gender of pals. I know that sounds morbid but these are fictional creatures and it would be for the purpose of making breeding easier or even possible in some cases.

- Instead of hot-swapping pals, set up a recovery area to get them back into the fight.
- Set up a line of turrets on a metal wall to bombard the hell out of the boss.
- Create channels where the enemy boss won't path through, to keep a degree of separation between recovery area and fight zone.


When I have time to take on these raid bosses, I'm breeding an army of Vampiric, Element-effective, Rugged soldier-pals. 

This zerg-rush tactic seems costly, slow, and frankly a little cruel to the pals.",7

This video and your ""Get ALL ESSENTIAL Workers by Breeding ONLY 4 Pals in Palworld"" video especially have been some of the most easily understood and most completely useful guides I've seen on Palworld breeding bar none, since you added into the video sooo many useful diagrams and explained it all crazy well so THANK YOU. you made everything so simple and linear and that is ALMOST completely lacking in the 50 or so other videos I've watched over the last few weeks (yes really that's like 6 hrs of video XD) that have been released by the more mainstream or popular ""big name"" YouTube creators since launch. Don't get me wrong, They are very useful also, certainly for specific things (Thanks DPJ and FireSpark81 ❤) but none have been as easy to understand and follow and full of USEFUL DIAGRAMS for visual learners like myself as your videos. I literally paused like 5-10 times on each video of yours to screenshot your info and add it all to my Game Guides master folder thats been growing for the last decade or two. In fact i finally caved and made a brand new Palworld exclusive album just to save your shit so it wouldnt get lost in the vast sea of other guides for old games i dont play anymore lol. So props to you Sir all the respect! I've spent way too much time hopping around to different videos and trying to piece everything together in the right way so that i can isolate easy steps to apply to any sort of Pal/skill combo that I want to get, and it's saved me a lot of effort and irritation sifting through spreadsheets and various companion apps, so please give yourself a massive hug and pat on the back or whatever you do haha go treat yourself, because you've made a guide that's better than most creators who do this type of thing exclusively for a living. Money is nice but being easily understood and having the ability to impart information effectively and simply like you have is the mark of somebody who will likely be really successful in the long run if you stick with those core things and continue to bring content like this out to the player base. I hope you have an amazing year! Keep churning out guides like this, and ill keep my eye out for if you start a discord or patreon or something so that you can do this more full time. 😊",2

As a PvE player cake farming is one of the first goals I tend to set myself, as setting up other infrastructure is all well and good... but everything you can possibly set up gets way better with lv 3/4 suitability workers, which of course means caaake (especially if you're going for good passives).",4

vUUwP5ivC3c,@DuxGalt,2025-01-03T13:11:33Z,"Ive had my own little research project going for a while. It started from what i thought was a simple question. How few pals does it take to make all other breedable pals. I dont have the answer, but what I've learned is its might be 4. but might end up being 8. 

The biggest takeaway from my research is that the rarity level is relevant. if you have a common, rare, and epic pal. you can get almost all pals. However, within each tier, there are bridges up to the next, but if you follow them, you will have a dead end unless you capture a specific pal of that tier. 

Relaxorous is for sure one of the keystone pals, but there are some others. Feel free to take this research project onto yourself. its a nightmare of a spreadsheet to build.",0

vUUwP5ivC3c,@PeteZam,2024-12-02T14:04:25Z,"you can just breed nocturnal onto orserk, and he is significantly better than helzephyr lux.  pretty much the best setup for most pals if you dont use the monitoring stand to overwork them is: artisan, serious, workslave, and nocturnal.  if its a pal that needs to move around the base some, you can always swap out serious for swift.  generally i dont care about my anubus being able to work at night time, so i let them use swift, artisan, serious, workslave.  if its a dark type, they already come with nocturnal, so for astegons, frotsallion noct, ect i use swift, artisan, serious, workslave.  i dont know if it helps or not, but since wood isnt all that important, i just use shroomers with nocturnal or shroomer noct on my lumber mill, because supposedly their passive helps keep pals happy and reduces sanity loss.  although ive never tested how well it works, i just use them as my lumberers, just in case it is actually useful.  

if you like using the monitoring stand, and overworking your pals, just swap out one of the skills for workaholic instead.  ive personally never had a need to overwork pals since i just play single player, and once you get a proper setup, they will provide you with more than enough resources at regular speeds, and there is no need to overwork them, and worrying about their sanity dropping and causing injuries.  especially you are able to afk in your base for a few hours every now and then.",0

The best planting pal is shroomer noct it eats very low amounts works 24/7 and reduces all pals san consumption in the base. If you get 4 each condensed to a different stage and 1 not condensed they all stack for 75% reduction in san coupled with salad you can set pals to max workspeed with food boost and they won't get angry or sick.

Best kindling pal is sootseer condensed to get it to rank 4 and a kindling book gets it to rank 5 it works 24/7 and ranches bones between your smelting and cooking. 

Best watering pal is leafant it barely stops to eat so 2 of them can fully water a skill tree before eating unfortunately you have to use 3 watering books on it. 

Best handiwork pal is ribbuny it get boosted workspeed on weapon making at rank 5 handiwork and 4 speed boost passive the increase is 1638 more handwork from the pal passive they can make 999 of any ammo in milli seconds it breaks the animation.

Best transport pal is wumpo, its slow so if you only have a guild chest and no others and its not accessible they will tele them into a guild chest.

Best cooling pal is vanywurm cryst it works 24/7

Best mining pal is digtoise at 5 condense it hits ores for 4k a pop

Die älteren Pokemonspiele sind meine absoluten Lieblingsspiele und ich denke das liegt an der unglaublich schönen Spielidee und nicht an der Pokemon Company/Nintendo, diese besitzen einfach nur das Patent/Copyright an unseren lieblingsfiguren, melken hauptsächlich das Franchise, das durch gute Spiele und einen tollen Anime aufgebaut wurde und bereichern sich in letzter Zeit mit auf Gewinn optimierten Schrottspielen :/ also alle Macht an Palworld, ein besseres, wenn auch anderes Pokemon herauszubringen",0

Genau wie du schon sagtest, vieles hat man in Pokemon vermisst. 
Das viele Spielefirmen sauer sind, ist natürlich verständlich, ihr Grundgedanke wurde immerhin verwendet.
Andererseits sehe ich das auch als einen art Tribut an die Spiele.
Man muss das Rad ja schließlich nicht immer neu erfinden, wenn man die Animationen etc. noch gut was verändert.
Natürlich ich sah viele Pals die noch sehr ähnlich aussahen, seien es Meganie bzw. die Weiterentwicklung von Elekid etc., doch ich glaube Griffel haben sie 1:1 übernommen oder täusche ich mich da?
Meine Meinung, wenn die die Modelle noch was mehr abändern, sollte das doch gut gehen. 
Persönlich würde ich, obwohl das ziemlich offensichtlich ist, noch die eigentlichen Spiele, wovon man sich von hat inspirieren lassen bzw. bedient hat, aus Respekt erwähnen ( natürlich wenn das alles rechtlich geklärt ist ).
Ich hoffe wirklich sie entwickeln das Spiel weiter. :)",0

fONv_12IglY,@XxGadwinxX,2024-01-31T07:24:11Z,"danke für das Video!    

Langsam hasse ich Nintendo! (kein Fox in Starling für andere Konsolen. Trotz Aufsatz sämtlicher Flugzeugen und Waffen für die XsX./ Mario/Bowser usw in Crossplay sperren aber Halo Skins durchlassen...) 
Wenn die jetzt Palworld kaputt machen sollten ist Schluss. dann verkaufe ich alles. Switch/GC/N64/SNes usw..

Anstatt zu sagen:..""joooooooo. Palworld hat eine Spielerexplosion. Last uns versuchen mit zu wirken,  Pokémon  kann  da reinpassen, bzw. Welten verschmelzen. oder sowas. aber nein. 

Da meldet sich der ka... neid und Nintendo will jemandem etwas weg nehmen NUR weil etwas ähnlich aussieht....ernsthaft? der punkt ist. Sie sehen NICHT gleich aus. oder haben sonst was gemeinsam. Das welche sich ähnlich sehen kann ich nicht verneinen. dennoch sind sie nicht gleich.  Wäre das eine düstere oder evtl  eine Farcry Grafik mit den Tieren, wäre es dann immer noch so schlimm oder ist es weil es so farbenfroh ist?

Das spiel hat wirklich Garnichts mit Pokémon gemeinsam. Pal´s sind schlicht Tiere. Die man fangen kann oder (will das Wort nicht sagen xD) abknallen!^^ Sie besitzen keine höhere Intelligenz. Okay! sie sind schnell geschult und hören aufs Wort nach dem fangen aber es sind schlicht Tiere die arbeiten verrichten können. ca 15% der Tiere, können nicht einmal arbeiten. die schickt man in den Kampf um Menschen zu.....ja....das spiel hätte auch gern blutig sein dürfen :D ^^ aber ja. Man selbst startet mit einem Speer und schießt später mit einer Panzerfaust. 

Pokémons können Menschen verstehen und logisch denken. Pikachu kann mehr als Donnerschock und goldig gucken. Nämlich noch donnerblitz/Donner und donnerwelle ^^.Manche können sogar Surfer ^^. der würde nicht blind zum Gegner rennen der mit explosive zurück schießt, Und nur weil ich darauf zeige. oder stumpf tag ein tag aus ....arbeiten ohne zu meckern ^^

Pals sind einfach nur knuffige Tiere die man ohne schlechten gewissen um die ecke bringen darf.  (musste mich aber auch erst daran gewöhnen die ganzen knuffigen Viecher jagen zu gehen)

Nintendo könnte mit Pokémon ein spiel ins endlose machen. Auf dem spiel weiter aufbauen. WoW macht es doch gut vor. Anstatt gefüllt jedes Jahr ein neuen teil zu bringen und Rekord verdächtig viele neue erfundene Namen zu haben......0
Und ich Wette! Das wäre der burner!..Ist aber auch nur meine Meinung. das wäre mal was wirklich neues und etwas was einen Langzeit fesseln konnte.

Open World mit mehreren getrennten Kontinenten/2 Fraktionen. wählt die Trainer Gilde oder man tritt Team rocket bei/Mit Pokémons lvlt man berufe um Geld zu verdienen in der Poke Firma  /Echtzeitkämpfe!!(Fremde Spieler können, während des vorbei Fahrens mit dem Rad, den Kampf sehen und zuschauen.(wäre zwar ein wenig von WoW geklaut aber wäre das schlimm?.  anhand einer Poke Farm ...oder so. 


Wenn Nintendo  uns allen Palword kaputt machen sollte,  ist der laden bei mir unten durch!!!.


sry für die menge aber das musste einfach mal raus. texte sonst nicht so zu. aber da war der geduldfaden einfach zu ende. lg",0
fONv_12IglY,@janrohr3085,2024-01-30T22:03:01Z,"Man stelle sich ein Pokemon-Spiel vor mit der Engine. 
Dann noch bei den Kämpfen in die Perspektive des jeweiligen Pokemons gehen um maximale Varianz in den Kämpfen zu erreichen. 
Getoppt mit einer halbwegs gute, erwachseneren Story mit interessanten Charakteren, Arenakämpfen und bereits bekannten Pokemon-Minigames. 
Der letzte Mauerstein für ein All-Time-Fav ist ein online-Modus.  

Beginnen wir einfach mit nem Spiel in der Größe und UMfang (150 Pokemon) des 1. Pokemon-Spiels. Dazu ein DLC-, ABO- oder Season-Konzept und das nächste WOW ist geboren.
Leute - im Ernst: wir würden es sogar dann kaufen, wenn es quasi die Map des 1. Pokemon-Spiels Copy-Paste wäre :D

Das könnte die Viewer hier mit falschen Erwartungen füttern. Allerdings finde ich die Aussage, dass Pal World ein Pokemon sei, wie man es sich wünscht, sehr zutreffend. Mal abgesehen von den Waffen natürlich. Palworld bietet Pokemon fans genau das, was schon lange die Erwartungen an Nintendo sind. Nintendo hingegen war immer zu stur und eigensinnig um mit der Fanbase zu gehen und hält daran fest, immer einsteigerfreundlich für Kinder ab ca. 8 Jahren zu sein.
Fazit: Palworld erreicht die Pokemonfans der ersten Stunde und lädt sie ein in einer sehr guten Welt im Ark Design sich auszutoben.",0

fONv_12IglY,@schwebkraft3571,2024-01-29T07:43:52Z,"3D-Artist hier. Wenn man von „Skalieren“ spricht, bedeutet das, dass die Modelle größer oder kleiner gemacht wurden als bspw. die Referenz / Original Modelle. Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass ggfs. die Topologie (also die Form der Geometrie bzw. des Polygon-Netz) gleich geblieben ist. Mit anderen Worten: Ein 3D Modell von einem Schlüsselbund ist immer noch das gleiche, wenn es größer oder kleiner „gescaled“ wurde. Urheberrechtlich sollte das also keine Relevanz haben und wenn der Kollege sich die Modelle von Palworld wie auch Pokemon diesbezüglich angeschaut hat, gibts da auch nichts zu entschuldigen, solange er die Topologie der Modelle nicht zu Gunsten einer der Entwicklerstudios verändert hat.",0

To me, not having a copy of the lowest form of Squirtle, then it doesn't count. The penguin puking water nonstop is similar to Squirtle after a squads night out at the club, wearing sunglasses because he's hung over and just smoked one plus he's cool, but the water isn't vomited with same velocity or force as any true Squirtle can. 

Like human beings, they can't hold their Nattie Light, Mickey's tasty malt beverages or Pabst BR, same with Miller Highlife, the champagne of beers - but it's a paradox. It's what gives them their powers so they *have* to drink copious amts of it and go to meetings all the time for ""breaks"" in between. There's no Pal world animal like that at all.",0

DDwqE37YoDU,@bobnewkirk7003,2025-02-03T04:24:17Z,"Mimogg was tested and though it has the highest paper transport speed it also has terrible reach. You are better off with Faleris/Faqua as not only do they have high transport speed, but also high non-transport speed and a really long reach due to their large model. 
Personally I use Legendary Spheres over Coin printing as with all the new Research upgrades as well as a team of Noble/Fine Fur pals you make significantly more coin per pal.
With the post-FB upgrades to work one max Orserk (passives and 4 star) can power a base of 6 extractors. Two is overkill unless you are running into the discharge bug.
Yakumo sadly has a really narrow use-case. For most pals its going to be faster to just chain breed the passives you want, so its only really applicable to pals that only come from breeding themselves. Of those, the Raid pals don't get the bonus when you hatch the eggs so its basically just for catching wild Legend Pals. Because there are so few options, its best to just treat them as disposable, only breed one passive at a time and just roll a new one and blender the old one to catch the next passive; you can breed the legend pals together later on.",1

i have also been playing pokemon since blue and red, blue in my case, and im not saying firered or leafgreen here. what i mean by that is that i was there gandalf. 3000 years ago. i am a pokemon fan, i havent played all games, but i have played a lot of them, there are simply too many. i like pokemon, but i also like palworld, and the two existing is good for both, but specially por pokemon. even if you dont like palworld because you are a nintendo fanboy and feel like you need to defend your company, is still a bad idea to do so. because the existence of palworld is what is going to give you better pokemon games in the future. im sure you have seen the last pokemon games, they are quite lazily done, i think that everyone can see that. that happens because pokemon doesnt need to try if only pokemon is in the market. 

but that means worse games for you and i and more money for nintendo. unless you are a shareholder, that doesnt benefit you my dude. if palworld is in the picture, even if you dont like palworld, its existence is what is going to give you better pokemon games, which is what you as a pokemon player, want. so think carefully about what you are defending",0

Since I was 14, playing WoW in 2005, me and most Pokemon fans have been craving a 3d pokemon MMO.  When I see the carbon copy gameboy games still being spat out every year on a production line, it puts me off getting back into Pokemon.

Good to see other developers are happy to push the genre forwards and nibble out of Game Freak and The Pokemon Company's pockets, as they have sat on their hands for two decades printing money and not innovating at all.

Nintendo relies on it's console exclusive publishing too much, and should consider a Pokemon project which is cross platform, or at the least, available on PC.  This would bring back millions of millennial PC-using pokemon fans, who wont use their few hours to game each week on a gameboy and instead are craving something deeper and more long lasting.",0

Guess what, it gets better; Pocketpair's previous game, Craftopia, incorporated a sphere item to catch creatures in a 3d world. Released 2020.

Even if you count the original date of the patent, it still was made after Pocketpair did it, by letter of the law and patent.

Let's not mention how riding a bird like creature basically is a direct threat to literally ANY game with mounts. If they actually pushed that, they'd be making enemies with Microsoft, who own Activision Blizzard, who own World of Warcraft, aka one of the longest running games to have flying mounts like griffins, as far back as *2004*. About, I dunno, 17 years before the bird mount riding patent was filed. They'd probably piss off Sony too.

And since these flying mounts are also a main source of income for the companies due to microtransactions and being a useful purchase, so even the people who sneer at horse armour are okay with buying them, the corpos would ACTUALLY respond to it. No amount of Pokemon GO microtransactions and government funding will stop the constant barrage from that. And that's assuming the corpos don't pull the same bs using legal precedent and loopholes to say that patents can be made and used to sue games for mechanics made before the patent was filed for. Cause if they do that, Gaming as a whole is f—ked, including Indie devs who would be bullied by the standard lawsuit practice of ""wait for them to run out of money"" employed by every single corporation 'too big to fail'.",0

The anime, the card game, the toys, the plushies, the shirts, all of it. That is Pokemon. Palworld is not a ""better game"" it's not even similar to pokemon than the barest of surface level. The problem is that Palworld is teaming up with Sony, and Sony intends to turn Palworld into a rival multimedia giant.

The Pocketpair lawsuit has nothing to *actually* do with Palworld, and everything to do with the threat Sony poses to Pokemon's global dominance. This is just the latest in a long history of these two companies fighting eachother. Palworld is just the latest proxy war.",0

Grinding to actually catch Anubis in a fight is hype and the progression you get from adding him to your base makes sense for what stage you're at.

Nintendo is a Japanese company, but totally behaves like an American one. Except the executive salaries aren’t anything crazy, they’re earning maybe a max of two and a half mill per year. Which is still a lot, but nothing like Activision and EA’s executive salaries that exceed $25mill per year.

And they still won't because they don't see it or let alone acknowledge it and if bringing those to the dabs takes so much then find a different formula or accept you also took your character designs from earlier animes also sooo there's that.

So this was nice if a little spoilery for me cause I'm still learning about the game. Just wished we could pause in solo mode so I didn't die having to read 😅. While I normally enjoy story based games, survival doesn't leave a lot of time to read for us new players especially when after the first 2 islands everything attacks us. Or our stomach is trying to kill us. I'm enjoying the game so far, sadly I can only play it solo cause I got the game on sale on PS5 and my ps plus ran out.

Ue65_y-7NwI,@themather1,2025-01-27T07:25:35Z,"I don't think the alien invasion has taken millennia. The way I read Xenolord's Paldeck entry is that Jetragon was supposed to be the aliens' advance force, conquering the island for them. But instead of conquering the island, Jetragon naturalized and became its protector, and the aliens are now tasked with terminating their rogue asset.
This seems particularly likely given that Jetragon, like the aliens, possesses seemingly mechanical parts, and how it has the same crystalline wings as Xenolord and Xenogard, just in a different color.

There's also one question that is completely unanswered, which I feel is related to the Calamity, and that is the nature of the ""abyss"". Bellanoir and Bellanoir Libero's entries describe how they sprung into existence in an effort to bring vengeance upon reality, and were banished to the abyss. While Astegon's entry describes that it was born of the abyss.
Noteworthy here is that Bellanoir and Bellanoir Libero are considered of Legendary rarity, where the other raid bosses are merely Epic.",2

It's not like they can hire a builder, buy a car, or pop to a supermarket 😂 The only place to spend money is with the merchants and black marketeers, but then what are they doing with that money?",7

Ue65_y-7NwI,@Zedvais,2025-01-23T14:09:13Z,"Wow it made so much sense. Yeah we look like a villain right now because the game is not complete. But yes as you said i think it will have to do with like the villain is imprisoned in the world tree or even the world tree itself is the villain kinda situation. The tower seal the palpagos island until the hero (main character) comes and the bosses acts as like their training probably. I just wish we can befriend the bosses after defeating them. Kinda wish zoe would be able to adventure outside alongside bjorn and lily can see that the organization she created and spearheaded do the thing they swore to destroy themselves. I never read the journal because the game is not yet finished but i really like Lilly, i share many of her sentiment aside killing the human thing. But anyway long rant but thanks for the great summary of the current lore. ❤",4

Ue65_y-7NwI,@rmcl8037,2025-01-23T06:43:26Z,"Hmm...some interesting pieces in here, but there's a LOT of discrepancies. The first and I would think the most jarring are the oil rigs and the attack helicopter. These are both products of a more modern age and wouldn't line up with a ""crusade of a thousand years"", the oil rigs themselves are constructed with modern parts, using modern weaponry like surface to air missiles and the Rayne Syndicate is kitted out with gattling guns...the entire Rayne operation screams big money to the tune of tens of billions. Also you wouldn't waste the insane amounts of capital extracting oil just to have it sit idle, either the Syndicate has SOME way to offload all those barrels, probably through oil tankers, which means that there is a way off the islands in some fashion. I'd like to think that Bjorn and whatever task he sent Zoe's father off to complete ended up with him becoming incredibly wealthy and he's the sole reason the entire Syndicate is as ""wealthy"" as they are. The shipping containers scattered around and ""Pal Inc"" just further that thesis. The question here though is IF the outside world is aware of the Palapagos Islands and to what extent that would lead too. Victor and his research are just more evidence to the fact since he employs some rather modern laboratory equipment or if he merely just repurposed whatever ""they"" left behind (The Genetic Researchers are equipped with the laser rifle after all), so whether he invented the Pal Condenser remains to seen. Aside from that we know the ""Castaway"" ranged pretty long so it's possible he to was able to leave. I guess we shall see, but the merc we meet at the first eagle statue seems beyond shocked that Pal's behave in that ""way"", I've actually chalked her trauma up to the Dinossum roaming the starting area as if you the player get to close they have zero issue with killing you without hesitation. I might also add Astegon to the equation as he was ""trapped"" and assumed to be slumbering/dead, but is clearly awake now. His tag is ""Ravager of the Stars"" as well so take that as you may

In early trailers (the Unreal, not the Unity) we catch a glimpse of the player constructing a rocket, which would serve little other purpose then space exploration, the Xeno hordes are from ""somewhere"" not to far away, there's also Lunaris whose entry all but says she's from out there as well, the ruins are all but screaming they are from another planet (moon? Would fit Saya's entry somewhat and Selene also isn't from here) but I am betting on the fact that we're going to space at some point. The Towers are another matter since they would ""seem"" to be keys to unlocking something, but I'm not sold on the idea that they are merely there to entrap the ""calamity"" and have another purpose altogether, the occulus gate has gate right name but where that goes is something else to speculate...my personal theory is that it was used in the ""ancient"" times to shuttle around whatever Pal the huge skeletons scattered everywhere was/is and probably used to travel between the Palapagos and outer space, since there are also numerous stone ""human"" built ruins everywhere as well which infers that the ancient human civilization had first contact with some civilization. Lily is the odd thing here, as there are still humans that originally inhabited the islands, and the Free Pal Alliance's weapons and dress supports that to some extent. Duneholm is contradictory in the fact that if they are native, and Marcus introduced or exploited whatever ""powder"" he may have/had not been in possession of when he took over the region, but again he screams of modernity as himself and the PIDF are cops from SOMEWHERE since the various officers hint that they too were shipwreck victims and the ""runaway desert refugee"" also attests that their influence and mere presence interrupted their way of life. They also founded and guard the sanctuary's which also attests to a more modern ""conservation act"" type of thinking as well as Marcus' mastery of control over the ""drug"" trade and knowing what strings to pull as far as addictions are concerned.

I'm not Jetdragon is the ""thunder dragon"", though he holds the ""celestial"" tag, as do the pegasuai, Elphidran is the ""gentle sky dragon"", Orserk is the ""roaring thunder"" and both are dragon in species. Jet is from whatever civilization among the stars Bjorn ""fell"" from, as are both versions of Froststallion (hypothetically) and the only Pal in that legend that was already a resident was Palladius, the rest gaining their title AFTER whatever the calamity was/is as the statues littered around were signs of affection from the humans already on the islands (this goes for Quivern and Anubis) and all were worshipped for who knows how long, as Hungyu's entry tells of some old school executioner, Celesdir as a ""beast of salvation"", Azurmane and Univolt (Univolt's nickname is ""Thunder Deity"" and both served a ""Thunder God"" who may or may not be the dragon in question. And, honestly, my hot take is these are two seperate conflicts: the first being the calamity, potentially locked up in Yggdrasil, making Jet and the others refugees from the Xeno entries, and another where the netherworld itself has been rendered asunder (Bella, Sootseer, Hezylphr Maraith dex entries) and this instance caused by Katress (Ummhmm) that she's unable to fix, and was probably warned against screwing with in the first place (Wixen) but if these are mutually inclusive events or two issues altogether remains to be seen...and this instance itself IS NOT related to whatever the Pal religious view was, nor the folklore (Incineram, Felbat) that was practiced during the time.
