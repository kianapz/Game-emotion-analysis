hka3YOx-Tfg,@xXCursedWorgenXx,"Nowadays, unsure when it got added, for tip 39: theres a passive trait on pals that have the same effect as the mercy ring, which would make your pals unable to lower enemies under 1 hp. A good negative passive to have when capturing pals. The mercy ring is also active when youre riding a pal and use its active skills, meaning that you'll leave enemies down to 1 hp as long as youre riding the pal. Slight thing you need to watch for however, DoT will still do damage.",2025-02-11T05:39:58Z,0

hka3YOx-Tfg,@WillsBeard,"The Ring of Mercy also affects mounts while you are riding them. It's particularly helpful if you have a mount with stun or freeze abilities.

For anyone who is unfamiliar, the Ring of Mercy gives the player Mercy Hit which prevents their straight damage from reducing the target below 1hp. Damage over time like poison or burn can still kill the target.",2025-01-17T06:56:50Z,2

I think its R2 or L2 on playstation but when you hit that it lines the stairs up with the height perfectly fit to it.

Not sure if that's PlayStation only but I couldn't build anything within a country mile of one. It just gives me the prompt ""Too close to a Special Boss or Facility"". I want the technology points back. I'll give it another go on the Steam version and update the comment for that if it's different.

Edit: You cannot build too close to a Black Marketeer on PC either, and you cannot death warp to locations previously unknown. Tried to do both on PC on a new world but was unable to see the other respawn locations and I was unable to build anywhere near the Black Marketeer at any of the abandoned church locations.

gLU8vfYpj_U,@keenshibe7529,"I am glad you and everyone else is enjoying the game!

But how different is it compared to launch in terms of polish? Also from what I experienced after playing through all the base content from launch, there does not seem much new content other than the new region. 

My thoughts is that gameplay can be jarring and not optimized properly, and the assets used are not pleasant. Customization options for buildings and furniture are extremely lacking as well. Having played other survival games such as Subnautica and Green Hell, it does seem like a survival-lite instead. There is no tension and challenge, but if the goal is a more cozy and casual game, nothing wrong with that. 

From your playtime, I assume you played on launch? If so, what is your opinion on the differences other than Sakurajima?",2024-12-04T05:54:49Z,0

zOHDoJ1vqQ8,@WakoDoodle,"I left before they added anything on palworld (pretty much only things were patches for fixes). Returning theres so much new stuff added and tbh, all the game needs is a story and better music for the background and its pretty much a finished game in my eyes. 

That's nothing to say about the mods that people have made between then; legit updating the shiny and alt colours idea that was pretty much for 2-3 pals; has now expanded to a whole lot more! The BNL one being my fave, it makes nighttime looks mysterious and beautiful. Loads of starts in the sky to get lost in. There are many more amazing mods (avoid the NSFW stuff though as creativity spans all forms... ) that you can try and at the end of it all the game feels fun. As fun as playing pokemon gen 1 - 5 (or in my case 6 as well) back in the day or a digimon game.

Tbh Palworld imo is a parody of monster catching games and a really good one too! Sure the pals look familiar because its a parody; if they didn't look anything alike nobody would know what they're parodying but more importantly, its ironic that a parody is more fun than the actual thing. Nintendo needs to see this as a wakeup call to add more fun to their games because if not, I can see more parodies doing a better job in future.

Luckily it’s today so we have a high chance we got people in the patent to understand gaming, especially more gaming companies, giving out patents too. Unfortunately, the main issue we have is how many games already use the systems before the patent exists or will exist. Most companies don’t check unless people are talking about the game systems. Even the patent office sometimes doesn’t know about it. Nintendo wants to patent Auto switch mount depending on its environment land, sea, and air, depending on what mount is the best one for moving in the environment I believe there’s a game that already has that system",2025-02-18T17:52:53Z,0

But that would be against Japan's tradition to honor and be loyal to archaic corporations, regardless of how ludicrous this all is. Have to respect it's how they run things, but it doesn't make me root for 'em!

I am genuinely intrigued and concerned of Nintendo's machinations because I'm not seeing a specific US congregation being transparent about the patents being passed by. Which powers-that-be in the US are handling these patents (USPTO is the most likely candidate, but if the inquiry is ""who is handling these"" then my question still stands)? Can we get more spotlights on this so we can watch what's happening? Aside from that, the patent for ""character riding a character"" does not extend to Palworld since Pals can easily be summarized as ""food"", ""tools"", ""weapons"" et cetera simply because of how versatile their utilities are. Is it ""character"" or ""mount"" that the patent is specifically detailing (one or the other; if it tries to include both it would have been grounds for rejection)? There's more murk in this than I would deem acceptable, if I was working at the patent office. Definitely some behind-the-scenes scheming going on here.",2025-02-18T16:36:03Z,0

BQfCNWVC0AI,@Matoakas,"Whether ppl like PW or not. I gotta say it's pretty dope Pocket Pair actually give Game Freak and Pokemon some competition.
Competition is as healthy in gaming as it is with anything else.  Competition drives progress. So Palworld might be constructive for Pokemon. 
Doesn't mean the products will become better automatically. We have far to many examples of the opposite. But still.

I also think it's cool that a small studio are able to actually make a BILLION DOLLARS worth studio..which happens to be one of the most popular franchises ever.. to show their claws.
No matter if I like them or not, I always nod in respect for that. 

All in all though, I don't think Palworld is an existential threat to Pokemon as a brand or on any other lvl at all. Nor will it ever be.",2024-11-29T12:12:08Z,2

Same goes to the blind hardcore pokemon fans, yall are just delusional.

Use the bat as soon as possible but don’t unlock the bow. Keep using the bat until you get high enough to unlock the crossbow or you can run around and open chest until you find the crossbow schematic. Doing this saves a decent amount of tech points and lets you advance a good bit pretty fast since when you unlock the crossbow that early you’ll be one tapping a lot of small pals and it’ll be easier to melt the weaker alpha pals",2024-11-25T14:00:14Z,1

H4b9aJgeZ0I,@michaelhayes8519,"While the fast teavel points are a little annoying, i do enjoy that the game doesn't just let you freely travel like that. 

It forces you to explore and delve deeper into the late game options for mobility. 

Feel like you're moving too slow? 
Get a grappling gun and a gliding mount, gliding is a much faster way to traverse, and you can spam it. 
Grappling gun also lets you cut climbing time in half, if you look for points on a cliff you can stand on. 

Still feel like you're moving too slow?
Get a ground or flying mount, get a faster ground or flying mount. 
Upgrade both of those mounts for the fastest mounts in game. 

Palworld gives you the ability to dominate the map, it just doesn't hand it to you. 

Thats something i really enjoy. 

It also gives you bases, which if used correctly, can set a fast travel point to anywhere you need. 

I have a base for iron, coal and i plan on setting one for quarts. 
The tower warp at the volcano can be farmed for sulfer. 
That covers all of my needs.

I could blend my iron and coal farms to free up one of my bases if i wanted to be more efficient.

My coal farm also has tucotuco spawns for gunpowder, right by Anubis spawn. Also doubles as palfluid farm with damud",2024-02-18T17:40:53Z,12

DJx_HYw2XZs,@LookingGlass1865,"🤓☝️ Um, actually, Nintendo isn't actually suing Palworld for making creatures that are similar to Pokémon. Nintendo has actually *patented* the game mechanic of ""throwing a ball at a creature which then captures said creature."" They're suing Palworld because it uses this mechanic.

Now, this whole situation is kind of shady, because around the time that Palworld was created, this patent didn't exist. Then, once Palworld started getting popular, Nintendo made the patent and subsequently sued Palworld. So essentially, they didn't care about Palworld when it was a small game with a small fanbase, but the second they start making money, Nintendo scrambles to find a way to sue them for everything they own.

Obviously Palworld is different enough from Pokémon to be its own thing, rather than a straight rip-off. This just feels like Nintendo getting greedy and grasping at every opportunity to make some money, even if it involves absolutely destroying an indie game studio.

Also, we should all be very afraid of the use of patents in gaming. Basically, because of this patent, nobody can make a game that uses the Pokeball mechanic without risk of being sued. It's absolutely insane, and makes me worried for the future of games.

I'm not good at explaining any of this, so if you want a better and more succinct explanation of the situation, PirateSoftware has a good video all about it.",2024-10-27T06:43:54Z,0

zNev_-Kjn5E,@ZephyrosNocte,"Look, the remeshing is shady af, but don't they look way better than the pokemon they ripped off? Like Serperior, even though I liked the design at first it always looked sort of incomplete, my literal first though upon gazing an azurobe was like ""Oh look, is like an actually good looking serperior"".

Many pals feel like weird combos of certain pokemon, but at the same time said fusions will never exist in a pokemon game, so it's nice to experience those ""fakemons"" in an actually fun and playable form. I'm not sure how to feel about the electric Totoro rip-off, but hey, gaming companies do things that are way worse all the time and we accept it anyways.

Also, this is the only ""Breath of the Wild clone"" that I actually enjoyed playing, even though games like Sonic frontier or Genshin Impact are actually good, I never really enjoyed the whole Windows XP background simulator with infinite collectibles, and this is actually one of the few things I would also frown upon in Palworld (I'm looking at you, lifmunk statues), but there are other focuses inside the game that deviate from what I consider bad gaming practices. Pals have a soul to them (not the literal one we put in the blender), some of them have animations that really scream the Pal's personality, even though many things in the game are generalized, you can also find some love and craftmanship when paying attention to certain details. Not bad for a first try at the ""f you PKMN, make a good game"" initiative.

Also this video is a year old now, updates have expanded the game quite nicely since, and developers seem to listen. We can only hope Palworld's future will not meet the same fate as Pokemon's.",2025-02-15T07:51:28Z,0

This is exactly the type of monopolistic BS that I HATE Bigger company bodies doing to smaller companies because they would rather bully the competition ""LEGALLY"" than make something that stands on it's own in the market. 1 thing pocket pair did right, make it available on EVERY platform, something NEVER to be seen in the avenue of Nintendo. But again, IDK, maybe this entire fiasco will help to shed some light on the egregious behaviors of companies, and we'll begin to see some turncoats.",2025-01-21T10:05:05Z,0

If you allow one company to have a monopoly on an idea forever they get lazy with it because they have no reason NOT to be. Why innovate when they can just litigate their competition away. Its even worse when the idea they are allowed to copyright is just a vague concept. They literally tried to sue them for the concept of mounting. MOUNTING.

zNev_-Kjn5E,@jadedjaws4952,"I just wish animal capture games would stop making humanish looking creatures to capture. It feels morally questionable, and both Palworld and Pokemon do it. I capture actual humans and it somehow makes me feel better. 😂

Seriously tried it on purpose just out of curiosity, didnt think it would actually work. I have always wondered in Pokemon what dictates a pokemon and a man when some pokemon looked like literal people (in '96 when i was in kindergarten chewing on my favorite squietle card, the best example was probably Hitmochan i think). Some look so human one should say owning that pokemon should be illegal. MAKING it possible to catch Humans in a way makes it more real because that just seems like a logical thing for a sphere to do. How would it know better? 😂
And there are consequences! They dont just add things we didnt know we wanted, but they add layers. You can tell so much love went into this. And with the recent faye update... Its no wonder Nintendo is sweating. 

ALSO YOU CAN PLAY AS A FUCKING ADULT. 😂
I got so tired playing Pokemon looking like a child. I noticed Pokemon GO got SOME new body updates after Palworld, but it could just be coincidence. I dont expect them to not do anything though, even without the lawsuit, they know now the fans will get what they want from someone else if not them, so if they want the money, better start giving the people what they want. 

On an unrelated note but still Palworld... How funny are the pal freedom alliance?  Theyre basically just the PETA of Palworld. 😂",2025-01-19T16:58:25Z,0

cvyOMhC-Fbg,@jordancambridge4106,Nintendo isn't releasing a new console.  Sega was suppose to make the Switch 2 for Nintendo because Sega made the Switch for Nintendo and Sega told Nintendo to read their finger as they flipped them the middle finger and separated from Nintendo forever.

But Sony being interested in PalWorld makes it a threat, so they’re lobbing Patents because Copyright won’t stick, Trademark’s too risky and also likely won’t stick, but patents are effectively legal troll fodder. Not super risky to lose, relatively easy to obtain, and if anything sticks, it could serve as a deterrent for Sony, as Sony having a creature catcher that looks *just enough* like Pokemon if you squint hard enough *could* plausibly hurt their sales of Pokemon games and merch.",2025-02-17T00:25:09Z,1

I want Nintendo to suffer for this. They deserve to be put on absolute blast. But it won't happen. They won't lose anything. That's why they're doing this in the first place. 

They'll just come out with yet another reskin of the same game they've been selling us for the past 10+ years, and we'll still buy it despite their horrifically dishonorable behavior. 

I can say that I won't buy or play their games anymore, and no one will believe me, because that's the point I'm making here, and that by itself proves it.

Can we as a community decide right here and now that we're going to make their wallets hurt over this? I know the switch 2 is coming out soon, but that will be impossible to buy outside of a scalper's hands anyway.

 Can we all just stop supporting them while they do absolutely everything humanly possible (including bullying the little guy and stifling innovation) to avoid finally giving us a truly good pokemon game? Palworld is great and popular because there are aspects of it and mechanics in it that pokemon fans have been asking for for literal decades.

They refuse to make the pokemom game we want, so someone else did, and that's the bottom line here.

cvyOMhC-Fbg,@comiccams3044,"I'd like to remind everyone that Palworld started its development before Legends:Arceus released, I believe by a few months, when we didn't know anything about it's gameplay
So even if its gameplay resembles modern pokemon gameplay that Arceus pioneered, it's not like anyone else was doing ball throwing mechanics and summoning monsters through them for battle before. Especially since Palworld is always in Real Time, something Scarlet and Violet only introduced recently and even then is more an auto battle mechanic.
What other patents Nintendo could possibly try to sue Palworld for, like ball based catching apparatuses- Like, bro, Pokeballs are based on Crank Game capsules, they gonna sue YuGiOh for their Capsule Monsters too (Remember that)? Pokemon wasn't the first Monster collecting series, Megami Tensei predates them and I'm sure if we dig deeper, we can find something else. A catalogue for monsters, digimon has that and just about every other monster collecting series. 
Hell, Nintendo might have lore-explained its best mechanic ever, Mega Evolution, but Digimon has Mega Evolutions (not the actual Mega level) with Burst Mode, where strong enough Digimon can power up to stronger versions of their current self. What if a Pal in Palworld has an Active Skill that physically alters their form and makes them stronger, are they gonna patent a mechanic that's not even theirs?! Palworld already doesn't have Pals who evolve, which is just sad cuz I bet it's to avoid Nintendo they did that. Especially when there's Pals who definitely were gonna do that, like Swep and Sweppa, the bees and bee queen or Pengullet and Kingpen. 
I swear, if Nintendo was this petty back in the early 2000s, or the 90s, we'd never have any action platformers where you travel between dungeons and find equipment to solve puzzles just like Zelda Ocarina of Time.",2025-02-16T17:28:00Z,0

Get Vixy. They re super easy to catch and they can work on a ranch where they dig spheres, gold and arrows. 
Make walls out of campfires to defeat/weaken bosses easily early game. Especially mammorest. 
Dont bother catching beegard early game. You can buy it from most blackmarketers. Wild ones will kamikaze you dealing huge damage whille they also get offed. Catch elizabee instead abd breed it with dinossom. You wont regret it!",2024-03-21T18:36:05Z,0

- Create channels where the enemy boss won't path through, to keep a degree of separation between recovery area and fight zone.

Ok so… funny story. When I played this game around this time, I discovered that you could actually catch the legendary pals by just sneaking up behind them then chucking legendary spheres at them. It was like a 10% catch rate, but 10-20 legendary spheres was a worthy cost for an early legend.

Edit: just tested this again, it still works! 6% chance with 13 leafmunk upgrades and the tier 1 sniper node, as well as the sphere tier above legendary, caught myself a sleeping frostallion.",2025-02-13T18:10:42Z,0

If  I am higher level higher sphere and +6 it should ALWAYS say 100% but on lucky pals it is not.
The same goes for the newer bandit pals or whatever the yare called the purple guys the % to capture is MUCH  higher than the level like at least 3 spheres higher and you often will never see 100% not even if 4 spheres higher.",2025-01-30T22:10:01Z,0

Ect I also like to make one base with everything but when I get most of the things unlock. I take the material I build up and build more bases making one a farming base with vixies (sorry if I misspelled the name) with full stars so they dropped max spheres. A ore mining base with the ore mining site. And another with the logging site and the mining site. Separating them like this make them more efficient.,2025-01-27T16:55:28Z,0

jkl09iGN-Ew,@Some_big_black_guy,"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokemon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokemon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3 foot 3 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they are large enough to handle humans, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there is no doubt in my mind that an aroused vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so you could easily have ... with one for hours without getting sore.",2024-03-27T23:36:42Z,1

You should've set up 2 teams. Build team and fight team. Build team with miner and crafter also player craft and mining speed boost. Get the build team out at your base for fast crafting of gears.

The game is not suppose to be hard if you find it hard you out steching yourself. First get your base ready. 4 berry plantations ranch with chicken sheep bee also condense them for greater productivity. Make sure you have base pals that cover all the jobs. 

Fastest way to level up was catching each pals up to ten. High level give the same bonus xp as low level pals. So catch all 10 of the easy pals first.",2024-03-14T04:26:28Z,3

D9w97KSEAOo,@derekhudson3415,"I was skeptical about this game last year when i bought it. I bought it out of spite first as a f u to Nintendo, tried it, and realized withing the first few hours, there was too many things different from pokemon, it was difficult to figure out all of the mechanics and Ui (drunk gaming) and so i was like meh, im just happy i gave them money for support and didnt play for 8 months. 
Picked it up later that year to give it another try. Man was i surprised. After watching a few tutorials on youtube about how to organize your space on base i started a new game and started over and it became my favorite game to beta play. Its super engaging, theres too many things to list in a review but you HAVE to learn while playing. They barely hold your hand throughout so i had to google stuff here and there to learn about lvling tasks of pals and what their specialties are (didnt know it showed you in their details screen) and damn. Mapping. Do early mapping! Just put on a show or podcast on your phone and map the areas and learn them. Itll make late game work so much easier if you unlock the fast travel towers first.  Im lvl 60 and still havent mapped the entire game. Its huge. Hot and cold temps effect you so build and carry different shirts. Plant crops because they hungry af Pals. The bosses are extremely difficult to beat. Youll feel overwhelmed and my god do NOT try hardcore mode. If you die, you die. I had to start a new game after lvl 32 because i DIED 😢. Normal is difficult enough for beginners or just customize the game for super easy if you just wanna have fun. 89/100 for me ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Dont think. Just get it. Best 40$ i spent.",2025-01-22T14:13:40Z,0

- Dr. Brawn can take away more than one good passive and transform them into negative ones
- the yakumo you use to farm the ""perfect pals"" does not feature perfect passives
- you got all those raidbosses maxed out but it's your first time killing the Tarantriss Alpha?
- you're that far in the lategame and don't know about the button to instantly fill the incubator?
- you got all those raidbosses maxed out and run around on lvl 60 with a meowmere and measly 15 exotic balls?

If you're gonna breed, just breed for a 5 star smokie, do literally any boss that's in a cave on the new island, then put down smokie and you come back with 600 chromite (enough to craft 120 hexolite), and that whole sequence, from base to boss back to base takes less than 5 mins.  You can do that at least 4 times per in-game day.  Hexolite quarts is the main bottleneck.  If you're gonna breed for hexolite mats breed celesdir, who drops the quartz.

D3UK9sMkxFg,@RikkuEcRud,"Necromus is a better choice to butcher for Large Pal Souls than Anubis unless you're really desperate for Technology Points or you're fishing for the Ring of Earth Resist +2 from a random Alpha.

Necromus and Anubis(and Frostalion Noct) drop Large Pal Souls at the same rate, but Necromus has the most valuable secondary drops with 10 Pal Metal Ingots in comparison to 3-5 Bone from Anubis or 10 Pure Quartz from Frostalion Noct.

Pal Metal is both the most valuable of the resources(crafted into Legendary Spheres and sold they can buy a lot more than 5 Bones) and the most work to get(10 Pal Metal would require mining 80 items from the Ore Pit, putting 40 through the Refrigerated Crusher for 20 Paldium Fragments then smelting 10 time versus just mining 10 items from the Quartz Pit).

Necromus also doesn't need Nocturnal/Vampiric for whatever that's worth.

Personally I ran Anubis until I got the Ring of Earth Resist +2, then I ran Frostalion Noct until I got the Ring of Dark Resistance +2(which has been replaced on his drop table with the Legendary Laser Rifle Schematic as of Feybreak) and now I run Necromus.",2025-01-12T04:49:58Z,19

Also for a tip from me to newbies, the lvl of raiders you get, is tied to your base lvl. With that in mind, speeding running your base can in fact get you screwed because it can start sending higher lvl guys, if you only focus on building your base lvl, then you will not have the fire power to deal with some of the higher end raiders. So, just because you can upgrade your base, doesn't mean you have to. You can get op first if you are willing to grind",2025-01-12T03:48:50Z,32
D3UK9sMkxFg,@battleme33,"I have a question about breeding, I am finally reaching late game-ish for the first time and want to start targeting specific passives.  I have watched a few guides and get the basics of breeding but one thing I basically never see addressed is when I first start out, it is my understanding that for the best chance to breed your passives down you would want 2 from 1 parent and 2 from the other, as that is the highest chance.  If I have potential pals that have the passives I want but also have extra traits, are these pals basically useless because there would be a pool of 6-8 passives being rolled?  Am I better off just spam catching the parent pals until I get parents with just 2 passives each that I want to pass down?",2025-01-12T03:24:21Z,3

Chromite: easily found in dungeons and using the metal detectors the pal smokie and like the last ore the pal Silvegis can be mass breed and put them to bed to get it as well. New materials: predator cores are from rampaging pals unfortunately their not on your map so you would have to look up where specific they are casue I don’t know all of them and they cannot be caught no matter what, Giant pal souls: bosses usually drop them or chest/supply drops that are in the new island same with Rampaing pals to.

(Also I hope he can at some point change the gender of pals. I know that sounds morbid but these are fictional creatures and it would be for the purpose of making breeding easier or even possible in some cases. Istg I had to hatch about 300 beegarde eggs before any of them were male, so good luck when the gender of either parents starts to matter like it already does for Katress/Wixen when getting a Sakurajima variant.)",2024-12-25T01:21:33Z,0

- Stairs with 0.5 and 1.5 hight, to accomodate the walls.
- Roof corner bits as wenn as roof tops is you have an uneaven amount of ""blocks"" to cover.
- Some kind of hallway enterance or gate that allows bigger Plas to enter the building, without having no wall within an area.
- Some additional set for structure that feels like a nice home on the insode. We got a lot of nice furniture after all.

Beyond that, I of cause hope for more space in my Pal-Box! There are a lot new Pals to catch after all!

I also hope the world itself and the Dungeons get more polish. They feel rather rudementry right now.

Accumulators are like a Base’s Power Bank and they “stack” in the way of increasing its battery size. Where just one provides 100% battery and every additional accumulator would add another 10%, for example (not real percentages)

That is why they all charge and drain together. The more you have, the longer it takes to fully charge and fully drain. Having multiple is beneficial.",2025-01-23T06:36:36Z,7

NCq3UZ96jXY,@Balila_balbal_loki,"Actual best working pals.

For kindling it's sootseer you get it condensed to rank 4 and 1 kindling book gets it to rank 5 kindling. It stops to eat much less than jorm ignis and works 24/7 because its also a dark. Using farming books gets it even higher lets it spawn bones in the ranch while its waiting for you to start any cooking simply have the stand nearby your kitchen and forge to quickly switch from the ranch to it.

If you find a bunch of farming books you can get vixy to rank 5 ranching which lets it dig out exotic spheres. Moozarina and chikipi and beegrade would give an item per game tick there are 10 ticks a second you will get 10 eggs a second so for the most part i got 1 wumpo stuck on ranch collecting 10 honey,10 milk and 10 eggs.

Quit breeding and catching just do expiditions they are worth it and they show the rewards just run around catching pals for xp and go the sanctuary for tech manuals catch strong pals struggle and beat bosses once to unlock expiditions and you become gucci. 

All of the books can be gotten from expiditions.

Best handiwork pal is ribbunny you need 4 handiwork books to get to rank 5 as well as condensing it. It has the fastest ammo and weapon manufacturering in game higher than capped workspeed anubis and it stops to eat a third of the times anubis does. 

Best planting pal is shroomer noct comboes with lulu. Use planting books to max that skill out and condense the shroomer and lulu because they drop the sanity for all base pals and lulu makes skill trees and crops grow faster.

Best watering pal is teafant you need a ton of watering books to get it to rank 5 but this dude doesn't stop to eat like ever when watering a skill tree a pair of them is enough for anything one can do 999 flour while the other one does 999 grinder. 

For transport you need to place a container in a none pal accessible area above the ground this makes transport pals teleport the items in it. The end result a wumpo walks and scoops everything and everything immediately ends up in the container you can stack the containers on each other for more storage. 

Best mining pal is mammorest you need the mining books for it compared it to rank 5 mining digtoise and mammorest because his default work speed is really high and his animation is a single swing to the deal the dmg side by side a 1 min vid he is roughly producing 30% more but this is at rank 5 mining only so you need 4 mining books to get there. 

Dazzi noct is the best electric pal because she uses the least food and works 24/7 you need the manuals to get it to rank 5 electrical generation.",2025-01-18T04:00:08Z,3

NCq3UZ96jXY,@Kodamare,"From what I can tell, Accumulators DO NOT stack, they appear to work similar to the work proficiency items like fountain, garden bed, electric pylon, etc where only 1 benefits you. I built a ton of them at that 3 node volcano base with 6 oil extractors and all the accumulators will decrease in power at the same time. I also tried building them at different times so they had different levels of energy, same thing, they all go down at the same right not one by one like you would imagine. I bred 2 Orserks with nocturnal traits and work traits, everything works better, alternatively if you have space like I do and its only a few pals needed, use some Helzephyr Lux as they have lv 3 electric base and are naturally nocturnal if you just want something to hold over for the night

Also for the Double Oil Extractors per node, as far as I can tell, you want to be facing SW or NE when placing them trying to put them on the very edge of where the game will allow you. The Oil Spots are all the same meaning they are the same odd shape (they are not complete circles) and they are all oriented the exact same on the map. So face either SW or NE when placing them and you'll have no issues. Did this like 2-3 days ago after I saw people posting it was patched and as of writing, it is not patched",2025-01-17T22:00:16Z,36

100 Days Digimon Next Order when? Or the stories games- I'm not picky. Anyways, pog Digimon enjoyer. Greymon my goat. Love Rizegreymon.

How Glib! Goated FF14 enjoyer.

And now after finishing the video. Good work. One thing to  consider with Jetragon vs Bastigor is that Jetragon is weak to his ice moves too so he gets popped. Oil Rig is disgusting so I don't blame ya for skipping it. Finally, good work. Another amazing video. I love watching your stuff and enjoy your sarcastic and monotonous content. Keep doing the free form voice overs. People say they don't sound as good, but I thought it was good, and regardless- Improv is a skill that takes time to develop. Especially when you're Schizo and talking to yourself for a video.

Palworld's mere existence not only gives us Palworld (which is pretty damn good), but will force the Pokemon franchise to actually TRY for the first time in nearly a decade. We will get better Pokemon games from Nintendo and Gamefreak because of this.",2024-04-13T19:16:35Z,0

Pokemon is a turn-based RPG about monster collecting. Palworld is a FPS survival game about monster collecting. Sure... monster collecting is similar between them. Pokemon, while not the first monster collecting game, made the concept popular. There are plenty of other monster collecting games like Monster Hunter Stories and Dragon Quest Monsters that get a pass... yet those games are more similar to Pokemon than Palworld.",2024-04-08T18:14:00Z,0

real time combat, crafting, base building, creatures that do labor and that can be automated, i'm a big pokemon player and i'm not sure in what pokemon game you could find that.
What you're describing in the video is a copy/paste of a pokemon game, typical frauds that just do the exact same things and add ""mon"" to their names.
But then, why would you use ""Palworld"" in your video title?
Looks like you ran out of ideas, it even looks like you did not even know what Palworld was.

The best planting pal is shroomer noct it eats very low amounts works 24/7 and reduces all pals san consumption in the base. If you get 4 each condensed to a different stage and 1 not condensed they all stack for 75% reduction in san coupled with salad you can set pals to max workspeed with food boost and they won't get angry or sick.

Best kindling pal is sootseer condensed to get it to rank 4 and a kindling book gets it to rank 5 it works 24/7 and ranches bones between your smelting and cooking. 

Best watering pal is leafant it barely stops to eat so 2 of them can fully water a skill tree before eating unfortunately you have to use 3 watering books on it. 

Best handiwork pal is ribbuny it get boosted workspeed on weapon making at rank 5 handiwork and 4 speed boost passive the increase is 1638 more handwork from the pal passive they can make 999 of any ammo in milli seconds it breaks the animation.

Best transport pal is wumpo, its slow so if you only have a guild chest and no others and its not accessible they will tele them into a guild chest.

Best mining pal is digtoise at 5 condense it hits ores for 4k a pop

If you capture him, you can do this once a day, and its a good way to get the new rare Traits.
I had a spare Xenolord that I called Brawn's Pawn, and once a day I use that Xenolord to get random roll's on it. I've already had other Xenolord pawns get given Demon Lord and Vampire using this NPC.

Best way to capture him is in the Northern desert in Sakurajima - he has a chance to spawn near to the Fast Travel as he's considered a world event, like the Pal Nests you find.
If he hasn't spawned, fly about 200m away so the area refreshes, then just keep going to and from until he spawns.",2024-12-31T20:02:47Z,24

The way I read Xenolord's Paldeck entry is that Jetragon was supposed to be the aliens' advance force, conquering the island for them. But instead of conquering the island, Jetragon naturalized and became its protector, and the aliens are now tasked with terminating their rogue asset.
This seems particularly likely given that Jetragon, like the aliens, possesses seemingly mechanical parts, and how it has the same crystalline wings as Xenolord and Xenogard, just in a different color.

There's also one question that is completely unanswered, which I feel is related to the Calamity, and that is the nature of the ""abyss"". Bellanoir and Bellanoir Libero's entries describe how they sprung into existence in an effort to bring vengeance upon reality, and were banished to the abyss. While Astegon's entry describes that it was born of the abyss.
Noteworthy here is that Bellanoir and Bellanoir Libero are considered of Legendary rarity, where the other raid bosses are merely Epic.",2025-01-27T07:25:35Z,1

Ue65_y-7NwI,@rmcl8037,"Hmm...some interesting pieces in here, but there's a LOT of discrepancies. The first and I would think the most jarring are the oil rigs and the attack helicopter. These are both products of a more modern age and wouldn't line up with a ""crusade of a thousand years"", the oil rigs themselves are constructed with modern parts, using modern weaponry like surface to air missiles and the Rayne Syndicate is kitted out with gattling guns...the entire Rayne operation screams big money to the tune of tens of billions. Also you wouldn't waste the insane amounts of capital extracting oil just to have it sit idle, either the Syndicate has SOME way to offload all those barrels, probably through oil tankers, which means that there is a way off the islands in some fashion. I'd like to think that Bjorn and whatever task he sent Zoe's father off to complete ended up with him becoming incredibly wealthy and he's the sole reason the entire Syndicate is as ""wealthy"" as they are. The shipping containers scattered around and ""Pal Inc"" just further that thesis. The question here though is IF the outside world is aware of the Palapagos Islands and to what extent that would lead too. Victor and his research are just more evidence to the fact since he employs some rather modern laboratory equipment or if he merely just repurposed whatever ""they"" left behind (The Genetic Researchers are equipped with the laser rifle after all), so whether he invented the Pal Condenser remains to seen. Aside from that we know the ""Castaway"" ranged pretty long so it's possible he to was able to leave. I guess we shall see, but the merc we meet at the first eagle statue seems beyond shocked that Pal's behave in that ""way"", I've actually chalked her trauma up to the Dinossum roaming the starting area as if you the player get to close they have zero issue with killing you without hesitation. I might also add Astegon to the equation as he was ""trapped"" and assumed to be slumbering/dead, but is clearly awake now. His tag is ""Ravager of the Stars"" as well so take that as you may

In early trailers (the Unreal, not the Unity) we catch a glimpse of the player constructing a rocket, which would serve little other purpose then space exploration, the Xeno hordes are from ""somewhere"" not to far away, there's also Lunaris whose entry all but says she's from out there as well, the ruins are all but screaming they are from another planet (moon? Would fit Saya's entry somewhat and Selene also isn't from here) but I am betting on the fact that we're going to space at some point. The Towers are another matter since they would ""seem"" to be keys to unlocking something, but I'm not sold on the idea that they are merely there to entrap the ""calamity"" and have another purpose altogether, the occulus gate has gate right name but where that goes is something else to speculate...my personal theory is that it was used in the ""ancient"" times to shuttle around whatever Pal the huge skeletons scattered everywhere was/is and probably used to travel between the Palapagos and outer space, since there are also numerous stone ""human"" built ruins everywhere as well which infers that the ancient human civilization had first contact with some civilization. Lily is the odd thing here, as there are still humans that originally inhabited the islands, and the Free Pal Alliance's weapons and dress supports that to some extent. Duneholm is contradictory in the fact that if they are native, and Marcus introduced or exploited whatever ""powder"" he may have/had not been in possession of when he took over the region, but again he screams of modernity as himself and the PIDF are cops from SOMEWHERE since the various officers hint that they too were shipwreck victims and the ""runaway desert refugee"" also attests that their influence and mere presence interrupted their way of life. They also founded and guard the sanctuary's which also attests to a more modern ""conservation act"" type of thinking as well as Marcus' mastery of control over the ""drug"" trade and knowing what strings to pull as far as addictions are concerned.

I'm not Jetdragon is the ""thunder dragon"", though he holds the ""celestial"" tag, as do the pegasuai, Elphidran is the ""gentle sky dragon"", Orserk is the ""roaring thunder"" and both are dragon in species. Jet is from whatever civilization among the stars Bjorn ""fell"" from, as are both versions of Froststallion (hypothetically) and the only Pal in that legend that was already a resident was Palladius, the rest gaining their title AFTER whatever the calamity was/is as the statues littered around were signs of affection from the humans already on the islands (this goes for Quivern and Anubis) and all were worshipped for who knows how long, as Hungyu's entry tells of some old school executioner, Celesdir as a ""beast of salvation"", Azurmane and Univolt (Univolt's nickname is ""Thunder Deity"" and both served a ""Thunder God"" who may or may not be the dragon in question. And, honestly, my hot take is these are two seperate conflicts: the first being the calamity, potentially locked up in Yggdrasil, making Jet and the others refugees from the Xeno entries, and another where the netherworld itself has been rendered asunder (Bella, Sootseer, Hezylphr Maraith dex entries) and this instance caused by Katress (Ummhmm) that she's unable to fix, and was probably warned against screwing with in the first place (Wixen) but if these are mutually inclusive events or two issues altogether remains to be seen...and this instance itself IS NOT related to whatever the Pal religious view was, nor the folklore (Incineram, Felbat) that was practiced during the time.

Galeclaw Gloves is a relatively early game item that you can craft, and allows you to use your Galeclaw as a Glider, and it basically works as one of the higher end gliders, only you can get it way earlier. If you prefer height to speed, or want to abuse Grappling Hooks Momentum, use a Hangum instead, because it gives you height each time you pull it out, allowing you to get height quickly if you pull it out and put it up repeatedly.",2024-12-16T06:43:40Z,0

PpxiPYHaK7Q,@WaldoBagelTopper,"The only thing that bugs me about this game is the same thing that bugs me about most modern games. No matter how fun they make them, or how adjustable the difficulty is, the creators abandon all sense and logic when it comes to what they WANT you to perceive as epic moments in the game.

I'll give you an example. This game uses the same exact mechanics as pokemon. So if you are going to a boss battle with an electric type boss, then obviously you want to focus your strategy on the effective type against electric. So you take a ground type with you. But nope, it's a bossfight, it's supposed to be hard. 
But I have the type advantage over the boss.
Don't care, boss fight... hard.
Ok, but in addition to the type advantage, I have a level advantage. 
Don't care, boss fight... hard... dramatic.
So what is the use of types at all to begin with?
You use types to strategize against your opponents so you can have an advantage over them.
Don't care... boss fight... hard... dramatic... equal.",2024-10-06T19:24:39Z,0

Don't ignore night time and set your game to mostly day you'll need some of the night mobs mats or you might need them.
Don't panic in any fight simply  look around for cover like a tree or post  hid behind and take pot shots.I highly suggest some sort of ranged weapon early as possible to pull down a flying foe to get a fly mount.
Finally don't bother reading all those exploit tips almost nothing works after several patches.Oh one more tip  try to keep in mind your button to remove your Pal because sooooo many times my Pal will just kil everything so if I want to tame it I have to remove my Pal when HP gets sort of low.",2024-07-21T04:08:39Z,0

There is always a teleportal next to a merchant so no need to keep one in your base.

Another tip to keep Jormantide from getting stuck on top of the silo or shipping container. For the silo, I place foundation and box it in with 4 walls and a roof. I then build the silo on top of the roof. He hasn't gotten stuck there for me anymore. For the shiping container I do similar. I would just put the container under 2 roof tiles that completely covers the container then put stairs so anyone who does get stuck up there can easily get back down.

y6X-gy5Jsp0,@thefiresworddragon927,"The patents themselves were only updated in 2024, they were originally created back in 2021 for a game called Pokemon Legends Arceus. Guess what, it gets better; Pocketpair's previous game, Craftopia, incorporated a sphere item to catch creatures in a 3d world. Released 2020.

Even if you count the original date of the patent, it still was made after Pocketpair did it, by letter of the law and patent.

Let's not mention how riding a bird like creature basically is a direct threat to literally ANY game with mounts. If they actually pushed that, they'd be making enemies with Microsoft, who own Activision Blizzard, who own World of Warcraft, aka one of the longest running games to have flying mounts like griffins, as far back as *2004*. About, I dunno, 17 years before the bird mount riding patent was filed. They'd probably piss off Sony too.

And since these flying mounts are also a main source of income for the companies due to microtransactions and being a useful purchase, so even the people who sneer at horse armour are okay with buying them, the corpos would ACTUALLY respond to it. No amount of Pokemon GO microtransactions and government funding will stop the constant barrage from that. And that's assuming the corpos don't pull the same bs using legal precedent and loopholes to say that patents can be made and used to sue games for mechanics made before the patent was filed for. Cause if they do that, Gaming as a whole is f—ked, including Indie devs who would be bullied by the standard lawsuit practice of ""wait for them to run out of money"" employed by every single corporation 'too big to fail'.",2025-02-16T11:47:24Z,0

The anime, the card game, the toys, the plushies, the shirts, all of it. That is Pokemon. Palworld is not a ""better game"" it's not even similar to pokemon than the barest of surface level. The problem is that Palworld is teaming up with Sony, and Sony intends to turn Palworld into a rival multimedia giant.

The Pocketpair lawsuit has nothing to *actually* do with Palworld, and everything to do with the threat Sony poses to Pokemon's global dominance. This is just the latest in a long history of these two companies fighting eachother. Palworld is just the latest proxy war.",2025-02-15T22:24:07Z,0

I had stopped playing it because I want the constant crashing to be sorted out first and even I believed that if this game was gonna get sued, it was going to be copyright, not whatever this ""getting patents approved only after serving Palworld lawsuits"" stuff is.

Nintendo already hunts everything down that so much looks in it's direction, now imagine what it could do and inspire other companies to do if it had patents to shut people down with rather than just copyright. Especially when those patents are stuff like ""throwing and ball and catching a monster"" or I think one of them was ""Riding a monster in an open world"", some of these patents can effect gaming genres outside of creature capture if they go through.",2025-02-14T19:48:58Z,0

I have always loved Pokemon, and I still think Nintendo is overdue to be knocked down a peg. They've gotten lazy and corrupt, and if they didn't have such a stick up their ass, they could have been the ones partnering with Pocketpair instead of Sony.

I also really hope that Pocketpair sticks with fair business practices. There was a lot of talk early on about how they don't do ""crunch"" and have a great, laid-back environment.

And they still won't because they don't see it or let alone acknowledge it and if bringing those to the dabs takes so much then find a different formula or accept you also took your character designs from earlier animes also sooo there's that.
