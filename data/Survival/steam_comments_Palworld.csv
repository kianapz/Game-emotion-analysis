"Palworld isn't your typical creature-collecting game.  It's a bizarre, beautiful blend of monster taming, base building, and surprisingly intense third-person shooter action.  The core gameplay loop revolves around befriending (and sometimes battling) a huge variety of adorable, yet potentially deadly, Pals. Daedream is my favorite companion pal – its cute looks and powerful abilities are a total game-changer!
 
My base is a testament to the game's robust building options. I've got a castle-like residential area for my Pals, a bustling factory for crafting, a relaxing Japanese hot spring where my Pals can unwind (and, let's be honest, maybe get a little romantic), and a dedicated farming zone to keep resources flowing.  It's a little slice of organized chaos, perfectly reflecting the game's spirit.
 
My combat strategy?  Pure, unadulterated pandemonium! I release my Pals, yell some words of encouragement (mostly incoherently), and hope for the best.  It's less strategy and more controlled chaos, but hey, it works more often than you'd think! 
 
The unpredictable antics of my Pals during combat are constantly hilarious.  I've seen them get stuck in the most ridiculous places, accidentally launch rockets at my own base (oops!), and generally cause more mayhem than a troop of caffeinated monkeys.  It's all part of the charm!
 
While the graphics aren't groundbreaking, and the story is fairly simple, the sheer joy of collecting, training, and battling with these adorable yet deadly creatures makes up for it.  The blend of cuteness and carnage is unique, and the base-building aspect adds a welcome layer of strategic depth.  Palworld isn't perfect – it can be repetitive at times, and the occasional glitch can be frustrating – but the overall experience is incredibly enjoyable.
 
Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good dose of cute chaos!",True,74,5
"The start of this game is so good. I played together with a friend and had a blast the first 30 levels or so. But man does the pacing get ruined in mid game.
The fun I got from playing Palworld was mainly from exploring the world, finding and catching new pals and collecting collectibles. But when you enter mid game, which is around level 30 you can't progress by simply exploring anymore. You instead need to farm materials to craft necessary items and farm the same pals you've already caught to gain exp. And this loop of farming and running around can go on for hours.
Me and my friend changed the world settings (higher drops etc) to make it more bearable but even so the game was too boring for me to want to continue. And it's so frustrating because the beginning of the game was so much fun and I wish the developers would've designed the game progression to be like that through out the whole game.
There's more stuff I could criticize the game for but what's written above is the main complaint I have and what made me stop playing.",False,255,42
"It's good, not great. It's a monster party game, you run around and catch your monsters, etc. But you only have a party of five and there are always going to be utility slots taken up for your personal movement and the like. Each pal can only actively have three moves slotted in, too, and given it's all real time it runs on cool downs instead - which is horrible if your pal whiffs and now everyone is twiddling their thumbs. Part of this is covered up by some pals being mountable, so you can fight as them, and then you yourself can have a weapon and run around. Except just you shooting most things is a lot more consistent, DPS-wise, as you don't have a cooldown even if you do less damage, so at some point once you're established the game becomes flying in on a bird, shotgunning a deer in the face before throwing a legally distinct pokeball at them and flying off again. Which is entertaining, but also pretty much the entire gameplay loop so things start to get stale. And you kinda have to do it, too, as everything is level-gated in a surprisingly stifling way.

But! It's also a thirty dollar game, so it being good, not great, is perfectly fine. Pal with your buds. It has jank, but nothing show stopping.",True,24,4
"I have played this game since the release of early access, this is an amazing game. I had great experience with this game so far. Yes, it has issues, especially end game, but overall it has more pros than cons for this price range. So far devs addressed many game breaking issues and keep improving the base game while adding new content. I recommend everyone giving a try, it is more fun with friends if you can afford to host your own dedicated server. I don't like how public ones are handled though, I don't recommend them.

"At first its a fun and silly game. Your enjoying catching pals and progressing.

"Palworld is the 3D open-world creature collector game that Nintendo never managed to make, and it absolutely delivers on the fun. The world design is great, the Pals are all unique and interesting, and the mix of exploration, crafting, and combat keeps things fresh. Capturing and using Pals for base building and survival adds a new level of depth that other games in the genre are missing. The game really sucked me in, I played nonstop, just wanting to catch more Pals, build bigger bases, and explore every part of the map.

That said, the game still needs work, there’s no real story to tie everything together, and the balancing can feel off at times. Some Pals and weapons feel way too strong, while others feel useless. But despite that, Palworld is already a blast, and with some updates, it has the potential to be one of the best creature-collecting games out there. If you love open-world survival games and always wished Pokémon had more depth (and guns), this is definitely worth playing.",True,7,1
"I've played Palworld for over 250 hours, and I’m still having a great time. there’s plenty to enjoy. It’s a great mix of survival, crafting, and creature collecting that keeps you hooked. Palworld is a game that keeps me coming back. 

Whether you're playing alone or with friends, there’s always something fun to do. if you enjoy survival games with creature collecting and base-building, this is definitely worth playing.

P.S. Pals are cute - 10/10",True,5,0
"The game just doesn't hold up to the hype. It lacks unique gameplay, and the world is devoid of interesting or unique aspects.  The pals are sporadic and random throughout and not unique. There is no real story to the game. It is extremely unbalanced gameplay, some enemies die in 1 hit, others kill you before you can it with max gear. The building is just beyond terrible, unless you are fond of squares. As that is the only shape you can really make. The building is a poor import of Ark building. The game can be good, but just releasing ""skins"" to prepare for release with a cash shop doesn't make it good.  

1, Make the game unique like originally claimed.
2. Improved QoL and Balance
3. FIX BUILDING - more unique designs (not just decor), allow terrain clipping, ect
4. Add real content - not an empty island that forces you to wander around, with nothing unique and makes you waste time",False,4,3
"It's base building and combat with cutsey allies.  You are sure to get at least a week of so enjoyment out of it.  There are some mechanics that are annoying like the weight and temperature mechanics, but these don't detract much from the game.  The base building is satisfyingly rapid and strategic and there are a number of decorative options for people interested in that.  I will say for those hoping to do multiplayer, that the multiplayer is very basic.  You have to either give other players a code each time you start up, play on public servers, or run your own server.  Emotes are also almost nonexistent.   Still, I'm sure things will improve and you can still make it happen with your buddies!  I recommend to all strategy and fps fans!",True,4,0
"Great Idea, Disappointing Execution
The concept behind Palworld is absolutely brilliant. It’s what many players have been wishing for: a blend of Pokémon, survival gameplay, and sandbox adventure. For players who aren’t too concerned about technical details and just want to enjoy the gameplay, I can still recommend this game. It has its moments and can be fun if you’re not looking too closely at its flaws.

However, as a software developer and hobbyist game designer with experience in UE5, I find it hard to overlook the many issues that hold this game back. These problems might not bother everyone, but from my perspective, they significantly detract from the overall experience.

I understand that my negative opinion might not be popular, I've never been a popular person anyway xD, but this is the perspective of someone who knows the tools and workflows of UE5. And from that standpoint, Palworld feels like a missed opportunity.
After spending considerable time with the game, here are the key issues I’ve noticed:

1. The AI: Broken and Frustrating
The AI in Palworld is poorly implemented. NPCs and Pals often run into obstacles, get stuck, or act illogically. The pathfinding feels almost non-existent, which repeatedly breaks immersion. This is particularly noticeable during combat, where enemies frequently get stuck against walls or fail to navigate properly. As a result, the battles feel clunky and unengaging, making them more frustrating than fun.
As someone with experience in AI development, I can confidently say this level of AI is unacceptable, especially when using modern tools like UE5.

2. The World: Generic and Empty
The game world feels lifeless and unfinished. Large, empty areas are filled with randomly scattered objects and items, while Pals roam aimlessly without any sense of purpose. With UE’s free assets (like Megascan), and the PCG Framework (Or Voxel), it would be possible to create a richer, more immersive world in just one day. Unfortunately, Palworld feels like it lacks the thoughtful design and detail needed to bring its world to life.

3. Animations: Clunky and Outdated
The animations are incredibly awkward. UE provides so many tools and features that can simplify and improve animation workflows, even for small teams. It’s baffling that a game built on this engine can deliver such unpolished animations. With proper budgeting and time, this could, and should, have been far better.

4. The Building System: Low Budget
The building system in Palworld feels incredibly low effort. It reminds me a lot of the Player Building System package available on the UE marketplace (https://www.fab.com/listings/c3806e8d-1903-47b3-97c2-378f279c399b), which was free for a time. While this package is functional, it’s clearly a template designed for prototyping rather than a polished feature for a full release.

5. Visual Style: Inconsistent and Disjointed
While graphics aren’t the most important aspect of a game, they do play a major role in immersion. In Palworld, the cartoony Pals and NPCs clash heavily with the semi realistic environment. On top of that, the Pals appear almost placeholder like with their low-poly style. A consistent low-poly aesthetic for the entire game might have worked better than this mismatched ""Frankenstein"" style. Additionally, the game’s LOD settings are strange and contribute further to the visual inconsistency.

6. Technology: Unreal Engine Not Fully Utilized
UE is one of the most powerful tools available to developers, offering countless features to make development easier and more efficient. Yet Palworld feels like a game that barely scratches the surface of what this engine can do. It comes across as unfinished, as though the developers either didn’t have enough time or didn’t fully leverage the tools at their disposal.

Final Thoughts: Great Potential, But Little Substance
I really wanted to like this game. The idea is fantastic, but the execution left me disappointed. I found myself constantly thinking, “This could have been done so much better!”.

I might even spend my next vacation creating a Palworld clone to demonstrate how some of these issues could be addressed. With the power of UE5, there’s no reason this game couldn’t have been much more polished.",False,15,0
"So first I was on the fence about spending the 28€ for the game in case it gets taken down by nint3ndo soon. But after playing a ""demo"" version of the game I could not putting my steam deck down anymore and went ahead to purchase it on steam. Well Steam says I played 96 hours and it certainly feels like around 5. I am kind of addicted to the game and can only recommend others to play this absolute banger of a game. It combines so many aspects of different games and makes all the ticks for a game I love. It does everything better than pok3mon and adds even more depth with building a base and random events. I really hope it gets released completely at some point and will survive any lawsuits (tbh some pals are a blant copy...)

Got kinda stale after the 30ish levels. May be more fun with friends.,False,1,0
"Overall 7/10: Up until about level 30 (of 60) the game is fantastic. The pacing is good and you really feel like your progressing and things seems fair. But that all changes shortly there after. From level 30-50 the grind starts to ramp up. Things start to take you twice as long and the difficulty curve starts to spike on the bosses. Then come level 50+ holy s*. If you aren't min/maxing and breeding all the passives you need you will be in a world of hurt so be ready to invest another 20-40hrs doing working on the un-fun activities so that the game can be playable somewhat again.

But wait. The devs so graciously provided a way to skip the grind they themselves implemented by allowing you to modify the world settings! That way you can level up at a more balenced pace, increase the drops, and increase the encounter rates.

Idk. I don't like to spend 100+ hrs on a game to get to the end (which I haven't yet) and being forced to change settings to make the game playable and being forced to min/max just to enjoy the last leg of it. There is still time to course correct and fix the pacing and implement more QoL features. Perhaps in another 2 major updates i'll re-review my thought on the game.",False,1,1
"It is still a bit buggy, and I wish the bases were larger.. But it's the ArkSurvival + Monster Tamer game I've come across in a long while.",True,1,0
"The animations are cute, and the gameplay loop is enjoyable.  They have game settings right from the start that let you minimize the grinding you have to do, which was a blessing, and you can change them any time you start up that save, which is even better.  I would not allow young children to play it, though.  Pokemon is cutesy and tee hee they just fainted.  Palworld takes rocket launchers to people and pals alike, and has a lot more adult content.  Nothing graphic, but the concepts behind some of this stuff aren't what I'd put in front of kids if you have any who might want to watch you play.

If you don't want to breed super powerful pals, you aren't going to be able to interact much with the higher end content/raid bosses, which is a negative for people who don't have time to actively sit there and breed 116 of the same pal to cram into the one they want to upgrade.

Overall I enjoy the game, but it IS in early access still, and there are a lot of bugs related to the pal AI.  They put out updates fairly regularly, but it is still annoying to have things spawn in odd places and slowly starve into insanity without you knowing,",True,1,0
"It's been a year and the game is no more polished than it was when it first blew up. The devs are intent on adding new content and that's nice, but it's at the expense of polishing off existing content, mechanics, and visuals.",False,9,1
"Even with the extreme amount of hype for this game, it still exceeds my expectations.
Realistically, this game is VERY upfront with how it works. You can buy it, try it, and if you don’t like the basic gameplay loop, you will not like the rest of the game.

[b]Main aspects[/b]
The world is huge.
The base building is complex and enjoyable.
The pals and you each fight on their own, but you can ride/control pals if you want.
The combat is extremely fun, and far doesn’t get old at all.
The AI is pretty terrible, but the game is still EA. Even if it didn’t get fixed, this wouldn’t be “that” bad that it’s a deal breaker (to me).
There are some minor bugs, but people get way too bent out of shape over them.
The exploration for the game is amazing. There are legitimate rewards that make you want to look in every nook and cranny. So far, this is probably my favorite part of the game. Also, Lifmunk Effigies are honestly so much fun to hunt for.

[b]Something else they got right.[/b]
It's like each decision they made, they thought to themselves, ""what would be most fun to play?""
This seems obvious, but other games usually lack this. For example, ARK's base creation takes TONS of resources, even just for walls. You then have to place the wall, then sit there hammering it. Building a simple house can take FOREVER. Palworld sees the good of this approach, and removes the monotony of it, so it’s cheap and immediate.
When you destroy something, it gives you ALL the resources back, so you can experiment with your base without feeling like you’re wasting resources.
When you build, the game accessing ALL inventory within the base to use as resources, so you don’t have to keep going back and forth between storage.
You can ride Pals very early on, and even fly very early on, rather than waiting the whole game for it.
There’s just a lot of things in the game where it really feels like the devs chosen enjoyment over other unimportant things like realism or grind. They just wanted to make a fun game, and they succeeded.

[b]The bad stuff[/b]
You’ll see people complaining about bugs… people do that all the time about everything. From my experience there are very few bugs. I have clipped under the ground on a few occasions, but I’ve been able to remedy it fairly easily. That said, I’ve turned off drops on death, not to make the game easier, but because I don’t want to lose everything just because of a terrain bug (this almost happened just a while ago). That said, gear actually isn’t that hard to make, so it’s not even that big of a deal.
I believe there might be some multiplayer bugs for servers, but I also see them trying to fix these in their news reports.
The game doesn’t really have any story or anything, which is kinda lame at times. It’s completely open, and the only thing to guide you are little quests in the top that are basically irrelevant and you could completely ignore. After a while all they are, are “go here and kill this thing”. They have cool looking anime characters that are full of potential, but they do absolutely nothing with them, lol. There’s no story, no character development at all, they don’t talk, there’s no story. That said, the game is going in such a good direction, that I actually don’t want them to waste valuable dev time expanding the story/character elements, but it would be nice.
The game doesn’t hold your hand at all, so sometimes you pretty much need to look stuff up online. For example, I’m really trying not to just follow online guides, so at the moment I have no idea where to get quartz in the world, except from this one boss battle. I really need quartz, and I’ve explored far and wide and can’t find it, so I’ll probably have to break down and Google it.
Pal rarity should be more interesting. It’s basically just location, and then day/night cycle. Nothing is actually “rare” in this sense, and you don’t feel like you need to hunt them. There should be an element of having to hunt, and find them, but that’s missing from the game. Perhaps I’m just being too picky here though.

[b]Is it a rip-off?[/b]
Note, this is not a rip-off of Pokémon. It is also not ""Pokémon with guns"". This is essentially a rip-off of ARK, with Pokémonish creatures instead of dinosaurs. If you didn't like ARK, you will not like this game.
Personally, I don't care if it's extremely similar to ARK. Basically every game that comes out is similar to something else; there's no way around this. Did they copy some Pokémon ideas? Almost certainly yes, however, there's like a thousand Pokémon, so it's kind of hard ""not"" to at this point (there's a literal bag of trash Pokémon after all).
The whole court case thing is actually a massive problem for the gaming industry. Regardless of what you think of Palworld stealing from Pokémon, if Nintendo proves that you can patent just about anything, and stop other developers from making enjoyable games, this will create a monopoly situation. This will hurt video game development for decades to come. Another good example of this is how Shadow or Mordor/War created the amazing nemesis system, but now NO ONE is ever allowed to ever have this in their game, with it being literally decades until people are allowed to again. This ruins creativity and possibilities for game devs. I understand wanting to protect your intellectual property, but we’ve gone way past that in this case. Game devs should be allowed to do what they want, use whatever ideas they want, to make the game they want to make (aside from just flat out stealing code).

[b]Should I buy?[/b]
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever. That said, it is an open world survival type game. If you don’t like that, then you won’t like this. This is not at all similar to the Pokémon games’ gameplay, so keep that in mind. There’s a lot of base building/management to do if you want to succeed.

There have been a ton of quality of life improvements since launch, and a lot of content as well, which are all promising things in beta game.

Whenever you are a solo player or a person who enjoys playing with others this game is really perfect for both styles. You can host your own game for you and your friends, or just for yourself and enjoy the experience.
You can change how difficult your game is, and there is even a HC mode.

The game doesn't put one under a lot of pressure, one can spend hours exploring and playing around and have nonsensical fun without bad consequences for the game progress or becoming boring - literally ""playing"" - but for the more ambitious there's also always a challenge ahead.

"I like that you can make your own server, pick the settings. Although the settings could work on it. Also I can't wait for more content on it. As well as new pals. It's a very unique game. I hope they will allow for the base territory to get bigger. Rather than just having to keep creating new bases to have more space. I would like to be able to create a village in one base. Or a big house or a castle which would also allow me to accommodate the working palls and assembling lines etc. It would also be nice if you can place things in your base even when the worker Pals or your party palls are in the way.  I would also like to be able to access the things we have in other bases without having to keep going there and carrying them from base to base. And more things but listen, overall this game is amazing. I love it. Also I would like some more options for the characters aesthetic. It bothers me that the enemy from the towers look way better than my character xD lmao but that's more of a me issue. But again this game is amazing. I am not a fighter so i have the option to sit back and allow my palls to do the fight while i just dodge. But my husband is a fighter so he gets to fight alongside his pals. IT just accommodates a lot of different types of players.  What I said about what I would like in it, is a me thing.

In my opinion it's close to perfection.",True,0,0
"Kinda good, if you wanna experience this game better then playing with friends is the answer. Now im not saying solo is bad but unless you tune down and modify your gain in world setting, this game is way too much grind.

Nothing has a fixed deadline, you can play at your own pace, and there's lots of difficulty settings you can adjust to your liking (more games need this!!).

"There's definitely still minor issues and bugs you'll come across, but you can tell the game is becoming more stable with the release of each update.  The features & additions they're planning in their roadmap are definitely something to look forward, too.

Leveling feels nearly identical to ARK: SE, but that's not a bad thing especially if you're playing with others in a team/guild so you can take ownership of specific things as you all level together.

Dedicated server hosting is also very straight forward and well documented, and configuring the server/world is just modifying an .ini file.  My only issue is that it can be troublesome at first to host 2+ servers on the same system, however you can resolve this by modifying the launch parameters to ""listen"" on a different Steam port.

The process of grinding resources can be tedious, but not grindy.

If you have ever played the open world crafting game by just yourself, you might thought ""Damn, I need some friends (slaves) to do the work or gather some materials for me. Therefore, I can just build and design my base and adventure this beautiful world to get the rare items, and I can be the GOD of this game or something. Too bad that I'm a loser and no one likes me""
Well, fellow lonely gamer. This game is perfect for you!
Since, enslaving the human is morally bad and if the person coincidentally have darker skin shades, oooof I really dont wanna think about it. 
I mean you can enslaved the humans, but, like in reality, most of them are weak and useless than the animals.

"The game isn't even out yet at the time of this review, but is just a joy to play most of the time. With custom server rules, you can play in a way that compliments your amount of playtime. One of the best ones, that doesn't really change the core pace of progression, is lowering the egg timer to as low as it can go. There is no reason to wait hours for eggs unless you're on an online server where time continues to move while you logged out. If playing solo, don't torture yourself and change some settings.

There is always something to work toward, and recent patches have lowered the ridiculous endgame grind for resources. It will be nice when we can finally get to the tree...

"I don't tend to like these sorts of survival crafting games, Ark specifically comes to mind. While they can be some fun, I tend to find that these games can become repetitive, and I've failed to finish any of them (Except Minecraft but it took me a decade to ever actually get to the end).

While I Haven't actually beat Palworld yet, I can comfortably say that I plan to. It's a lot of things that make me say that, from the more involved pal mechanics, the RNG forcing your hand into trying new areas you haven't seen before for the sake of progression, the stable peer to peer multiplayer, or even just the simple satisfaction of getting new shit whenever you level up. There's something about about this game that's doing something for a genre I can never commit to.

My favourite part are absolutely the pals though, especially as the game goes on. Thanks to the breeding system, it's entirely possible and doable to get your favourite pals out of sequence, leading to a sense of personalisation that I find really admirable. Not to mention the several systems put in place to ensure that even the weakest pals can catch up if you dedicate yourself to one. It really helps bring out that ""Pick your favourites and go on and adventure!"" feel that Pokemon tends to do, without limiting you to what's available during the early game.

Palworld is very special, there's a very good reason this exploded the way that it did last year, and I know for certain that the game is only going to get better as the game gets worked on. The last year of updates, (Which I admittedly wasn't around for), added a bunch of new content to extend playtime and customisation, as well as much needed QOL and balance tweaks.

"Only 15 hours in, I cannot recommend this game enough. I am addicted to expanding my base, exploring the HUGE map, catching cute new pals and breeding awesome combinations. I can't express enough how much content this game has, and how much fun the combat can be as long as you know what you're doing. The dev's are working hard to release updates and keep the community up to date on the roadmap, and what they intend to add.

The bosses are awesome, and the combat is fun, I think the game design as a whole is super awesome, it's a very fun game to either chill and build your base, or to have epic fights with huge, cool bosses. I cannot recommend giving this game a try enough.",True,0,0
"This game is great the fact this game has been having update after update especially within the first year is appreciated I love 99% of the game this 1% I have an issue with isn't a ""don't buy"" 1% I recommend buying it it's just things that need ironing out.

These are the following that need to be ironed out:

1)Oil rigs are buggy as all hell.

2)Level 60 oil rig isn't fun just tedious the SPOILER: The attack chopper isn't fun all of the mobs in the level 60 oil rig needs changing you can cheese it with a legendary rocket launcher and you only do that because the health pools and damage of those oil rig enemies are so high that the best way to do it is by stun locking them with rocket launchers rather than using the other weapons.

3)The level 60 egg incubator is amazing finally a way to quicken that whole process my only hope is that they make it level 40 instead so you have 20 levels of breeding pals better suited for the oil rig/bosses.

4)This also another dig at the Oil rigs is the drop rate of gold schematics I know you want to make them rare and hard to get but with the level 60 oil rig to get the legendary schematic for the guided missile launcher it has a 1% to drop from the Gold chest and i'm not sure if only one schematic can drop from said gold chest because if that's true that 1% is even lower and with the state of the level 60 oil rig I'll pass trying I'll probs do the last boss then do all the raid bosses then not bother until the next patch.

Too much grind after the exploration. The medicine production is just awful. Pals get sick and injured because you don't log into the game. It's a massive grind after the start of mid game. It's too expensive for an Early Access game. The pals get stuck attacking and you die. You get stuck in the ground and you die. Each time you die you have to go back to your stuff and pick it up. You are expected to grind eggs constantly. The base building area is too small. Server performance is not great and needs to be restarted frequently to avoid memory leaks.

Maybe my tastes have changed, but I've played a lot of similar games and loved that about them. When this comes out of early access, I'm 100% going to check it out again.

"Heads Up: It's not a ""PKM game with guns,"" it's ""an open world survival game with PKM... and guns."" It's not the same type of game as the ones which it sometimes references or parodies and if you want a clone you will be disappointed. That said, it will 100% also hit that nostalgia crave and is an excellent game in its current state.

Note: I play it as a one player game and don't know anything about multiplayer other than the basics of how it works.

One thing I really love is that the morality is totally wide open. Like the game will let you play it as a truly adorable and genuinely lovely ""go play in an open world with PKM"" type game or as a ""let's get super dark and examine things like predator/prey morality, economic exploitation, habitat destruction, animal rights, the brutality of nature, etc..."" type game and both work equally well. I personally go the ""chaotic good"" route and it absolutely supports that. 

It also has VERY fine grained difficulty options that let you fine tune it to your style of play.

So as long as you don't mistake it for a clone of a PKM GAME and assuming you like what you've seen so far I'd say it's one of the most interesting and engaging games I've played in a while.

My cons with this is quite imbalanced the meta. You can only release a pal at a time, but at end game even your strongest pal will die too quickly. At best they are there to distract your enemy while you destroy them with your advanced human weaponary. The best way to deal damage as high and as long as you can is by buffing yourself instead of your Pals.

"Man. After all the hours I have in this game. After some of the most magical moments I have ever had in all of my gaming experiences, to put into words what this game means to me is difficult. I came from Valheim and Raft. Early survivor experience player. Very early. I quickly became addicted to this game because I loved pokemon from when I was a teen. This is what I always imagined pokemon was growing up. This game however explores the slave aspect of the game and what it means to slave another being. It's sad and breeding based, but it's easily the most addicting and fun game i've ever played haha. The best survivor game i've played, yet it's pokemon with better art and more in depth difficulty. Then you add guns, dungeons, legendary item hunting, and it's just unbelivable truly an art piece. 

I recently had my son and i played this game a lot during my paternity leave. It was the perfect game to be able to start and stop at will. I would log in the morning and at night at random times. Didn't matter much solo and I was able to string along random sessions at solid moments. This really mattered to me in a time that was difficult and special to me.

Do yourself a favor and get this game. It's still even being built. I'm up to feybreak, but I still haven't played it yet because I keep[ restarting, learning new things, and restarting the grind.

"Palworld – The Pokémon Experience PC Players Have Been Waiting For
Palworld delivers the long-awaited Pokémon-like experience for PC players, combining creature collecting, training, and action-packed adventures into an exciting package.

Gameplay: Fun and Innovative Mechanics
One of the most standout features of Palworld is how it takes creature interaction beyond the usual catch-and-battle formula. Your Pals aren’t just companions in combat; they can help you with tasks like construction, resource gathering, or even working in factories. This versatility elevates the game from a typical creature-collecting experience to something much more dynamic. Each Pal has unique abilities, and strategically using them is incredibly satisfying.

Shortcomings: Sparse World and Unshaped Story
As Palworld is currently in early access, it does come with a few drawbacks. The open world feels somewhat empty for now, and the story has yet to take proper shape. However, these issues are natural for an early access game, and I’m confident the developers will continue to enrich these aspects as the game evolves.

Future Potential: Guaranteed Fun
Despite its current limitations, Palworld’s mechanics alone provide an engaging and enjoyable experience. The variety in how you interact with your Pals creates a sense of attachment to the game’s world. If you’re a fan of Pokémon-like games and want to experience something similar on PC, Palworld is definitely worth keeping on your radar.",True,0,0

I've ditched Pokemon for this since it feels more organic to have many ways to build camaraderie with your Pals and have the freedom to design your own bases and explore a variety of play styles.

This game goes far beyond any pokemon game in depth and complexity.  While there are clear rip offs from that franchise it is unique game in it's own right.

"This game is fantastic, better than Ark survival and Pokemon.
Very possible to get 100%  of achievements.
Huge open map with a ton of creatures to capture and battle.
Crafting things does take quite a lot of time though.
Much more fun with friends too, though overseas friends will experience connection lag with push and pull.

Jetragon is great for fast a moving mount, Anubis is good for farming Palsouls.
Sleeping pals are easy to capture since campfire damage is a thing.
Dark pals are great for 24/h workers
World settings are easy to comprehend and are great if you want a more relaxing time or to not have to worry about penalties with death or inventory weight management or if you want a more challenging experience.",True,0,0
"the love put into this game is incredibly apparent and shows what a monster catching game could be like. while i admit, a COUPLE of the designs of the initial release were uninspired and blatant copies of some pokemon, there are so many more unique and creative ones, or ones that take inspiration and uniquely improve upon the design (e.g orserk v garchomp, imo orserk is way cooler). With the latest sakurajima and especially feybreak updates, every pal in that got added is unique in design from any pokemon, and goes to show the creativity the devs have and the love for this game they are putting in. this all goes without mentioning all the fun gameplay things they add, ranging from things that casual players can enjoy such as exploration and finding new pals, to things that hardcore players can put hours and hours into. 

overall a really good game that gives some much needed life to the creature capture genre. praying pocket pair continues to introduce more fun and interesting mechanics and areas and expands on the already large amount of interesting pals in the game",True,0,0

Actually a very fun survival game.
Its like Ark survival but without the need to senselessly sink vast amounts of time into it.
It's also a bit like Pokemon/Digimon but with more robust gameplay systems in place.
A survival game where base building is fun and tasks can be automated utilising an army of Pal slaves.

Building bases could use a bit of improvement and more parts (like half walls,railings, etc.)  but it's a lot of fun for what doesn't need to be a huge time investment.

I had my first base feeling self sufficient in the first day of play, and now at 20 hours in I'm well into my second base building a completely unnecessary fortress(when I should be progressing) just because I have the resources to spare and I can. I expected it to take much longer to get to the point I could just build things for fun. Especially after having played games like ARK.

My only disappointment so far is the lack of interaction with the factions and characters in game. Even the boss battles are just intro scene and then you fight with no words or explanation whatsoever that's a bit weird to me.

"Only 7 hours in and I can't stop playing. It's 2.19 AM and I have blood tests to do at 9.00 AM lol. I haven't sunk into a game like this in a long time. I have to go to bed :P But I'm looking forward to jumping on tomorrow. 

I picked this game up for $32.96 AUD and it's worth every cent. Kudos to the developers, I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to video games. I'm loving the Penguin pal, I take him every where when I go to slaughter everything.

I'm sure I'll have some later feedback, like the timer on food that can be reset by just clicking the sort button. But that's trivial. I can handle small things like that. Other than that, the game runs really well. The game has Zelda vibes, but with building / tower defence / pokemon / minecraft / World of Warcraft. That's my take on it. 

Anyway, wish me luck for my blood tests, hopefully my arm doesn't fall off.",True,0,0

its fun and almost like pokemon and love pokemon the base building and servival is awsome,True,0,0
"This game has been everything I had hoped for! I'm determined to get this game to full completion in every way imaginable. The base building is fantastic I love the mechanics of building a base in this game with all of it's functions. One thing I find quite annoying is that if I log off and come back on the next day all of my pals at base are in critical condition with all sorts of sicknesses and low SAN, to solve this I just drop them on their own page in the pal box before I log out and take them all out every time I log in. The range of pals is pretty neat and I'm kinda sucked in to wanting to catch every single one of them. This game is so in depth with the pal perks and stats you really have the possibility to create your dream team pal arsenal! I love the game so much I went ahead and got 6 months server time for my own server I'm currently level 54 and still have SO much to learn about this game and that is a very good thing! This has been a game I want to play and play.. and play. :D. If you haven't picked up this game yet I'm telling you - you have NOTHING to loose! This game has been a 10/10 on a scale of enjoyment for me highly recommend!",True,0,0
First played on Xbox through gamepass Just bought it again on PC. A lot of new changes since I last played. Lot of cute and cool pals. My favorite thing about this game is that how grindy the game can be  is 100% up to how you play and you can even change it in the settings. Pal designs are great I wish they would come out with plushies. Really cozy survival game.,True,0,0

"This should be the new standard for an Early Access games. 

I don´t really have anything to complain about, it feels like a complete and very well made game.
Only pointers: 
- More pals
- Better technology tree (Or system) 
- Job priorities (Like in Rimworld) 
- Job commands for crafting stations (Like in Rimworld - ´Slaughter animal - Infinite´ - would be nice for spheres) 
- Make transport more powerful - double if not triple it´s effect.
- Make pals able to empty workcamps (Stone pit, Logging site etc.) 

It isn´t a fantastic co-op game since paldium is used for Pal spheres which can be quite the hastle for two people to share early in the game.

"솔직히 이 게임 몇년 전에 트레일러 처음 나왔을 때만 해도

생각보다 재밌는 게임입니다.

버그 같은 성능 문제의 하자 말이죠.

"No doubt like many others, I got this game basically just to point and laugh at the pokemon rip off. I could not have been more wrong about this game. This game is what pokemon should be. I have been hoping that pokemon would do something like this for over a decade. Legends Arceus being the closest thing. There are certainly some designs that are blatant rip offs of pokemon, but from what I have seen thus far, there are significantly fewer of those than I was lead to believe. As a survival game, this game is fantastic. It is incredibly immersive to live in tandem with the pals, working and fighting alongside them. Seeing them all walk around and exist in their respective habitats is fascinating. I am surprised that it took this long for something like this to come along. Fighting alongside your pals while dodging enemy attacks is incredibly engaging. The map is absolutely enormous and filled with interesting things to find, like chests, dungeons, upgrades, and most importantly, new pals. The progression is vast and it feels like each level up is actually meaningful in terms of tech for your base and weapons for taking on stronger enemies. My biggest complaints about the game revolve around bugs and general stability. I can often play without issue for extended periods, but when a bug does happen, it can be game breaking, like falling through the map, or pals being stuck in place and not being able to do anything. These bugs hopefully will be ironed out in due time. All that said, I am extremely excited to see where this game goes in the future. To anyone on the fence about picking this game up, or to anyone who still thinks this is a rip off of pokemon, I strongly urge you to give this game a try, I honestly wish I had given it a chance sooner.",True,0,0

Explore but watch out for environmental factors such as hot/cold areas.
Trade with traveling Merchants, Villages or more dubios characters, you can straight up sell your Pals to some Merchants.

"Want  to start off saying This is what i always hoped Pocketpair Craftopia would have some day became. So if you enjoyed that game you should enjoy this.

I have about two hours in and within the first 40 minutes i already had my first 4 pals and the fun could begin. I from the bit seen the game is Single player friendly and for all my pet trainers out there i will give a bit of extra details. Pal gain XP while not on the play field. So you can have your battle pals and your mount pals and they won't lose out on xp being in their balls. You can DE spawn your Pal in less then a second including mid attack so you don't have to worry about your pal randomly KO the guy your currently trying to capture.

As to game play well it's fine to good. I'm not deep enough to see if melee improves and as this is a shooter not much reason to expect much from the hand to hand. I will say that past the first three default Pals you can die. This game is not making the starting zone your play ground like in other games. the early Pals can kill you with five or six hits so be careful.

On a side note i can see why Nintendo had to knock the game down a peg with legal non sense. This game could honestly give Pokemon a run for the money. Battling with the Pals and their limiter move set has been what must Pokemon fan have wanted for generations. Honestly watching my pink cat Pal fighting a sheep pal without me made me think of early Pokemon anime. Sadly for Pal command you just have, don't attack, attack what i attack, and attack everything that moves. The clothing/armor has it's charm and the weapon's do have that fantasy scifi look and feel. If not for Nintendo i think this game would be in a even better place. 

Still in the end the game has had a number of massive updates so Pocket pair seemed to put a lot of the money from the OG popularity back into the game and it has honestly from the start looking and playing well and it worth getting Full price to help stick it to Nintendo but with all Early Access Games worth getting on a good sale because it's impossible to know where/what state the game will be when Pocket pair takes the Early Access Game training wheels off.",True,0,0

The base building is also very easy and the CO-OP is FANTASTIC!!! My girl and I have played through several worlds and we have even messed with settings to make some worlds easier than others. I can't say enough amazing things about the game. For the price you're getting a fun experience.,True,0,0

"Palworld is a fever dream of a game. It throws adorable monster-catching mechanics into a world of dark humor, automation, and survival chaos. It’s quirky, unsettling, and somehow still charming.

[h2]The Great[/h2]
[list]
[*]The monster designs are obviously Pokémon-inspired but bring enough charm to stand on their own. They’re oddly cute despite the madness around them.
[*]The audacity of tackling themes like forced labor and even cannibalism. It’s dark, but it’s so over-the-top it feels like the game is in on the joke.
[*]The world is bright and colorful, making every corner feel like it’s bursting with personality. You can’t help but want to explore.
[/list]

[h2]The Not so Great?[/h2]
[list]
[*]The idea of enslaving or arming monsters is funny at first but gets uncomfortable quickly. The message is murky and feels hard to digest.
[*]Repetition kicks in too fast. Once the novelty wears off, the gameplay can feel like you’re going through the motions.
[*]Playing solo feels empty—like the world is big but missing life. It reminds me of survival games where you notice the loneliness when no one else is around.

Palworld doesn’t always hit the mark, but it’s impossible to deny how bold and unique it is. If you’re in the mood for something unapologetically weird and chaotic, give it a shot.",True,0,2
"Palworld is a game that Pokemon could only hope to be while Nintendo only keeping their game on an under performing platform.  The only real criticism of the games similarities can only go as far as what is already included in other games and giving millions of people what they have wanted from Pokemon games before, meaning inspired by which is not illegal.  Any cartoon like monsters are going to take on similar features and many games have already done this, even the capture system is similar to concepts before Pokemon even existed, just Pokemon is the most popular.  As far as the game goes it is great, has improved constantly, offered excellent battles and capture process, and has consistently patched any issues I've ran into since first playing when it came out.",True,0,0

"An implausibly good mashup of different gaming elements--from obvious inspirations like Pokemon to bits of Breath of the Wild, Minecraft, and third-person shooters. This game is everything I hoped it would be, even in early access. Can't wait to see what full release looks like.
And now for my very, very specific hangup on Pal World's competition, the thing which really makes the game stand out for me. You see, despite how good the game-play itself feels, my favorite aspect of Pal World actually lies in the monster design, which, far from being mere knock-offs of Pokemon, match or often exceed the early designs from Gen 1 - 4 of Game Freak's long-running franchise. Personally, I'm tired of collecting dumb-looking monsters as Game Freak keeps trying to reinvent its design philosophy. Give me an edgy fire lizard or a floofy mound of poof. Stop with overly complex designs that no longer resemble anything in nature.
Anyway, please give the game a try. Unlike Game Freak, this development team has no laurels to rest on, and they are actively trying to earn goodwill from the community. Give them a chance, and you won't regret it.",True,0,0

"🔥 Palworld is EVERYTHING I Wanted and More! 🔥

I freaking LOVE this game! ❤️‍🔥 From the moment I jumped in, I was hooked. It’s like someone took all the best parts of survival, crafting, and monster collecting and mashed them together into something absolutely incredible.

🐉 The Pals? Perfect. You can fight with them, ride them, work them to the bone (sorry, little guys 😅), or just enjoy their company. Every Pal has unique abilities that actually feel useful, making them more than just cute pets—they’re essential for survival!

🔫 Combat? Insane. Whether you’re using bows, swords, or straight-up firearms, the mix of action-packed battles with RPG elements keeps things fresh and exciting. The boss fights? Absolute adrenaline rush!

🏡 Building & Crafting? Addictive. I started with a small camp, and suddenly, I had a freaking fortress with an army of Pals working nonstop. Automation in a monster-catching game? GENIUS.

🌎 Open World? Gorgeous. Exploring feels rewarding, and every biome has something new to discover. Plus, multiplayer? Running a base with friends and raiding enemy camps together is just NEXT LEVEL fun.

Sure, it’s got some jank here and there, but honestly? I don’t care. This game is pure fun, and I can’t stop playing. 1000% worth it.

⭐ Final Verdict: 11/10 – Would force Pals into eternal labor again. 💀🐾",True,2,0
"This game started out much better. But it has acquired too many bugs over time. The TL;DR is, it's just playable enough to be constantly frustrating

There is a dedicated server mode where you can host the world for just you and your friends, which is great. During this mode, the game clock continues when you're not playing. So you have to set up your pals to feed themselves for hours without your help. They'll do that, until they get caught in an infinite loop of getting stuck and then teleported to the palbox (their 'fix' for getting stuck) only to be stuck at the palbox. There's no clear indication of what's impeding their movement most of the time. In fact, a facility that the pal has been using for hours suddenly becomes labelled ""Unreachable by pals"" and they'll no longer assign themselves to work there. Even freely moving pals will stutter for no reason, which doesn't affect anything but sure doesn't look great.

So just wait until it's out of Early Access. They just released a massive expansion to the world. So they're definitely still adding stuff. But it's puzzling that they would ignore such a major component as pathfinding. It didn't used to be so bad",False,1,0
"TLDR; Its ark, but actually functional and fun.

Jokes aside, this is a really good game from an indie studio. Although people say its a ripoff of pokemon, its honestly closer to survival / base building games like ark. And it outshines both in those aspects, doing more than either have done in the last few years.",True,3,0
It's such a buggy mess it's nearly unplayable. Progress is deleted over and over. Don't pay for a server. It doesn't work at all! Even with only two persons playing the game bugs out. Massive lagging and glitching.,False,3,0

"It currently feels like a “make your own fun” kind of game, like Minecraft. I’d appreciate some story, an impetus to go out and explore the world beyond resource gathering. It may just be that I’m just not big on crafting games, however. The idea is interesting and I want to see where it goes.",False,2,1
"I had a pretty good time for the first 60 hours or so, so I'm recommending Palworld. Unfortunately, I continued to play for another 50. I gradually realized I was getting more and more bored.

There's a lot of stuff to do at first. You need food and shelter to survive, so you build a small base, and gather things like berries and cook them. Then you go out and fight Pals and maybe capture them. Captured Pals can fight for you, but they can also work at your base, doing all the stuff you were doing by hand.

Pals require food, so you need to do more gathering. Eventually you unlock farming, and Pals can farm and cook, taking over most of the maintenance.

Almost. One quirk of Palworld is that nothing is ever fully automatic. You must put in orders to cook food on a regular basis or your Pals will starve. There's no way to give orders to ""make flour and cook bread"" indefinitely. You have to return periodically to issue more production orders.

In the early game, you have to gather all the wood and stone you need for your base yourself. Eventually you unlock ways to automate this so Pals are constantly cutting down trees and mining stone and ore. That's automatic, but the Pals won't do anything more complex like smelt ore without orders.

Eventually Palworld turns into a simplistic village simulation. Unfortunately, there's no way to set priorities, so Pals will merrily mine more stone forever even though you have 10,000 in stock. If you want to shut down production of something because you have enough resources, you have to destroy the mine or farm.

In the same vein, you can tell individual Pals ""don't do this kind of task,"" but you can't prioritize. So you can't tell a Pal ""cook first, then transport if there's nothing to cook."" You have to prohibit transportation entirely if you want the Pal to prioritize cooking.

This isn't terrible, just limited compared to other village simulators like Rimworld.

There's a technology system. The main way you get tech points is by increasing your character level. You infrequently get tech points other ways, but mostly it's from leveling. You never have enough, which has the unfortunate side effect that it's a bad idea to ever spend tech points on unlocking any of the optional decorative items.

There's a breeding system for your Pals, and that could stand to be a lot better. Most games with breeding systems have a sort of an advancement tree, where you steadily advance to better, more powerful monsters. Palworld doesn't do that. Instead, Palworld averages the two Pal IDs together to get the offspring. Some combinations unlock advanced Pals, but most combinations just generate some mediocre variants with no special skills. You very much have to consult a Wiki to determine what you should breed with what.

The ultimate goal is to defeat tower bosses. The first few bosses are reasonable challenges, but as the game progresses, the bosses become more and more ridiculous bullet sponges. There's a 10 minute time limit, so ultimately the late-game bosses become DPS tests.

The late game becomes a really tedious grind. You've built most of what you'll build in your bases, so you're doing a lot of breeding new level 1 Pals, and then grinding XP to level those Pals to the point where they'll be useful in combat.

That's when I got tired of the game. The combat isn't *that* interesting without spending time on the other elements like base building, and the boss combats are really boring due to the boss HP.",True,3,0
"For anyone who's been a fan of open-world survival craft-type games, Palworld hit me like a dopamine truck and scratched an itch I've had for a really long time. Since the first time I entered this vivid and broad world, I was hooked. I want to kiss who ever had the idea of combining soulslike, open world, RPG, third person shooter and creature collector genres to create Palworld but they did something Nintendo didn't. In this game what ever the f<3<3 you capture is now fighting for you no matter what.

One mechanic that absolutely slaps is the crafting system. You can assign specific items to chests like a neat freak on steroids, and the best part? If you're chilling in your base, you don't have to tear through every damn chest like a lunatic looking for that one missing resource. Just walk up to the crafting bench, and voilà-everything's set. So smooth, it makes other games feel like they are still in the Stone Age. Finally, a game that lets you focus on the fun instead of playing 'Where's Waldo' with your resources.

And the pals. dude, you can just literally not give a single f<3<3, just build them a base, and let them work themselves to death like loyal little slaves or go full parent mode and treat them like your precious children. In any case, they are ridiculously loyal, never complain, and do your bidding without ever questioning it. Want them to fight, farm, or literally die for you? No problem-your Pals got you covered.",True,1,0

So much so that they decided to patent game mechanics this game uses after it initially released and use that and the backwards legal laws in Japan to make moving forward for Pocketpair much more difficult as we've seen in recent updates that we can no longer summon our captured pals by throwing them into a location of our preference and now only spawn right next to us eliminating an element of surprise and a loss off gameplay fun. All thanks to Nintendo. I bought this game 3 times. Once for me, one for a friend, and another for me on Playstation because I hate seeing billion dollar corporations throwing their weight around abusing the courts to snuff out the competition. Buying games like these is a middle finger to the bad actors out there. Thankfully this game is also fun. It's definitely more Arc Survival than Pokemon since you can nearly complete the entire game without catching a single pal believe it or not. The animations for each individual pal fit their designs and they have a quirky ragdoll element to them when you knock them out that reminds me of goofing off in Garry's mod in my old lost Steam profile. Given it's still an Early Access game it has a lot to offer and feels stable and complete nearly 100% of the time. Worst offense is the autosave occasionally fails which can be remedied by putting your pals back in storage and cleaning up any loose clutter. Second worst offense is classic Unreal Engine random stutter on PC. Not as bad as some other games but still worth mentioning. Also as it currently stands as of Feb '25 there really isn't much of an end point yet as the big tree can't be reached still so you just end up working towards completing a checklist for rewards. Each update they do put out does add new items, tools, pals, and land to explore. It is indicating they are chipping away towards that end goal, it just isn't there yet. If you're ok with that and have an itch to try it I say go for it. I put in hundreds of hours into this across 2 platforms while I balk at chances to even launch other games or go back to other old titles I'm fond of.",True,0,0

"[h2]Simply unbalanced[/h2]

The first 30 or so levels of progression are actually surprisingly interesting, but then it all goes downhill. The gameplay is a mix of exploring the vast world, capturing pretty creatures and ENSLAVING YOUR FRIENDS SO THEY MINE RESOURCES FOR YOU. The last part [i] can [/i] be done without friends, and instead you can manage all the intricacies of being a mom for all those creatures you caught. That said, it's a pain in the a$$ to get the base to function properly without any oversight. And that's what I found myself doing after reaching level 40. If it were to be on the level of the Factorio, for example, I wouldn't mind it, but in reality pals simply don't function the way you expect them to. So here I am, hopping on for an hour just to grind on the resources instead of exploring all the other stuff, and it's rather frustrating. But hey, cool game still",True,2,0

"For the most part, the game is a jack of all trades and master of none, but it's quite a good jack of all trades. I would say the game's strongest selling point is that it has a very simple and rewarding gameplay loop:

The design of the game is very intuitive (yes, I've played Pokemon growing up, but the concept of capturing and owning monsters/creatures through similar mechanics isn't all that exclusive). The base building in the game borrows ideas from other similar survival games (ARK immediately comes to mind). Towers, bounty targets, and oil rigs are easily identifiable boss/raid locations. Leveling up your character and your pals for these world events is straightforward - simply engage in battles or use exp items that you may find throughout the world. Every item you can get in the game has a simple description that tells you mostly everything you need to know about that item so you don't need to spend time trying to search online for what things do or how things work, outside of the more intricate meta-game mechanics, of course, if you absolutely needed to know those things. Speaking of game mechanics: there isn't a whole lot of meta-level intelligence that isn't already provided to you within the game just through sheer gameplay experience and observations. If you wished to really understand the game mechanics and go outside of the game to learn about those things (popular example: breeding), thankfully all of it isn't dense and complex. Lastly, there are many parameters that you can tweak with each world instance you play in. So you can make the game very punishing if you wish, or you can be like me and make things a bit simpler for when you're unwinding from a rough day at work.

The only gripe I have with the game (and it isn't really an issue for me personally), is that the core gameplay does not strongly engage the game's lore, in that much of what you would learn about the world is through things that you happen to find along the way and choose to engage with, rather than the gameplay following a storyline that you get entrenched into as you progress. I see a lot of reviews saying there is no story or lore and I have to very strongly disagree. I think the aspects and implementation of the world's lore and story is similar to ARK, where you can go down a deep rabbit-hole for hours and eventually no longer look at the game the same way you once did when you first started, but only if you spend the time to seek out those character journals and lore items.

That said, I strongly recommend the game. The content and gameplay it provides lines up perfectly to the price you pay for it.",True,1,0

"I was pretty disappointed in this game, but alas, that's what so much hype does sometimes!

I've seen a lot of people say that it's like a combination Fallout/Pokemon -- I am obsessed with both of these games and I do not find that comparison accurate. If the only thing you love about those games are the mechanics and exploration, then maybe you'll like Palworld in its current state. But imo what makes those games great is the story/character development. And the fact that your actions drive that story. Palworld has 0 of that. Everything feels shallow and pointless, which, for me at least, meant my interest dwindled very quickly. 

I hope a story or questline is in the works because that would change everything. If it's added I will definitely give it another go.",False,0,0
"I have completed the game.
All achievements, re-leveled, farmed everything, power-leveled from 0 – basically, I did it all.
Here’s my review and my improvement suggestions:

Review:
Solid gameplay, I really enjoy the exploration and breeding mechanics. The bosses on Hard mode are challenging, which I think is great. The oil rigs are fun, and the base-building system is solid.

One minor complaint I have is the limited building space. If I want to have everything in one base, it’s simply not possible.
All in all, I give the game 9.5/10.

My Improvement Suggestions:
Improve the Pal breeding system. I would love it if upgraded Pals (with Pal Souls) could pass down their stats. To keep it balanced and legit, I’d make it similar to the Predator Cores system. There should be a building or a base expansion that unlocks this feature. To construct it, you should need a rare resource that is very hard to obtain. This would create a natural progression wall while still allowing players to unlock it later. With this system, you could even introduce ""Alpha"" versions of Pals that can be bred, shifting the focus more onto Pal breeding.

Late-game content. Xenolord was really cool, but once defeated, I had nothing left to do. With the Altar System, you already have a great summoning mechanic, and now you have the freedom to expand on it.
I’d suggest hidden summons that require rare Slabs scattered across the world or dropped rarely by bosses. These would allow players to summon extremely rare Pals. The egg drop rate for these should be below 5%.
Add an achievement for this, and hardcore players will have content for a whole year.

Dungeon rework. They are a nice idea, but in my opinion, too easy. I just glide through while my Xenolord or Blazamut turns everything into minced meat. Even at the start of the game, dungeons don't feel challenging.
My suggestion:

Add Relics or special items inside dungeons, required for summoning or building structures (like Ancient Civilization Cores).
Force players into dungeons by making these items necessary for progression.
Hide some dungeons completely off-map, making them harder to find.
Make dungeon bosses more challenging. It should feel like an event where a group must prepare properly before entering.
Add an item that allows two Pals to be out at the same time. Like I said before, it should be very hard to obtain. This would add strategic depth to the game.

Pals with healing abilities!!!

Other Pal ""Trainers"". This would be a great way to troll Nintendo even more. 😆 It would also diversify boss fights. Plus, you could introduce tournaments! (The Arena is already a good start.)

I have more ideas if you're interested, but I don't feel like writing anymore.

"I initially thought the game would be a fun and engaging experience with Pokémon, but I quickly realized it focuses a lot on life skills, which wasn't what I was expecting. While some players may appreciate these aspects, I personally don’t enjoy the emphasis on life skills, and it detracts from the core gameplay I was hoping for. It’s a well-designed game, but it may not be the right fit for players who are more interested in traditional Pokémon battles and adventure.",False,1,0

"(very little playtime, so take with a grain of salt) 

Even thought the time I had with this game was so short that i shouldn't be able to make much of a well thought opinion, there wasn't really anything i could see changing my (subjective) opinion on the game. With friends it can be a bit of a blast for a bit, but it just felt a little soulless. most of the appeal that ive seen from this game is that it is ""pokemon with guns"" which is both false and also pretty boring if your game isn't known for being any of the actual gameplay mechanics.

"Do not get this game. Why? Well let me tell you why. Early game to mid game is fun, exciting, and lovely. You'll explore nice regions, capture new pals, and you'll probably even beat a tower boss or two. However, the instant you get to the end stages of mid game and start getting into late game stuff, it becomes a grind. You'll need crude oil, and lots of it at that. Crude oil is the life force of the late game. What's the issue with that? You cannot get it at rates that are not mind numbingly slow, or without exploiting supply drops. You could dedicate a entire base to breeding pals that drop crude oil to then be harvested, and it'll still be way slower than what you need. This game lures you in with its early game, it makes it seem tame, calm, and fun. Its late game will make you want to pull your hair out and blow steam out your ears like you're a cartoon character.

Tl,dr- The game has horrible late game progression and feels like a grueling journey. Save your money for a better base builder.",False,0,0

"Palworld, a year in release, is simply too buggy and janky to recommend.

Let's look at the oil ring, basically a large, lengthy combat area. Pals are useless in the oil rig, since they bug out and having trouble moving and attacking. So you essentially have to clear the rig without them.

Now you have to search the oil rig for the big treasure chest.  This search may take forever cause currently there is a bug that the chest simply never respawns, ever.  Since the oil rig chest holds most upgrade schematics, this is annoying shall we say.
