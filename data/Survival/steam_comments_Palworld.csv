Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,"this is the adult version of pokemon we all wanted for years. screw ninento and their lawsuit trying to stop a game that is objectively better than anything they have put out in over a decade. i can't wait for the full release of palworld either, the early access is so much fun already and every big patch i am loving"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-15,so first i was on the fence about spending the 28 for the game in case it gets taken down by nint3ndo soon. but after playing a demo version of the game i could not putting my steam deck down anymore and went ahead to purchase it on steam. well steam says i played 96 hours and it certainly feels like around 5. i am kind of addicted to the game and can only recommend others to play this absolute banger of a game. it combines so many aspects of different games and makes all the ticks for a game i love. it does everything better than pok3mon and adds even more depth with building a base and random events. i really hope it gets released completely at some point and will survive any lawsuits tbh some pals are a blant copy... 55  can recommend and if you like pok3mon but with more things to explore and do  this will be giving you many hours of joy
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"palworld is an incredibly fun and addictive game with a huge world to explore and tons of unique pals to discover. the designs of the pals are well thought out, and the gameplay offers a great mix of exploration, combat, and basebuilding. with every update, the basebuilding mechanics keep improving, making it even more enjoyable. boss fights are no jokethey require solid preparation and strategy, which adds to the challenge. however, some achievements felt overly grindy, and overall, the game is very timeconsuming. it took me 180 hours to reach 100, and while i had a great time, im also glad to be done with it. pros  welldesigned and interesting pals  huge map with plenty to explore  boss fights require strategy and preparation  basebuilding improves with every update  more fun when played with friends cons  some achievements require excessive grinding  very timeintensive if you enjoy openworld survival games with deep mechanics and a touch of challenge, palworld is definitely worth playingespecially with friends. just be prepared to sink a lot of hours into it!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,"pocketpair's historically crazy stances aside, the game itself is pretty solid. i enjoy it more than i have the last 3 generations of pokemon games at least. despite what nintendo is trying to say in court, palworld innovates on some of the core concepts of pokemon in fun new ways that we'd never get to see from nintendo. that being said this game has about as much in common with scarlet and violet as unreal tournament has to do with overwatch. is there some common dna and some common gameplay between the two? absolutely, but no sane person would ever put ut and ow in the same category. i have a lot of fun with it, but nowhere near as much fun as my wife does."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,super fun game kinda reminds me of something else but better
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"the game was on my wishlist for a while now, im happy that i came around an bought it. ive been having a blast on it, really like the base building aspect about it though i would like to move around builds without destroying them. looking forward to the future of the game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"so far not a bad game at all, you've got survival, you've got adventure, you've got the collect them all goodness of other games, graphics ain't shabby. overall its been addicting and surprisingly more difficult then i thought it would be."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,this game was sooo much like pokemon. that is until they remove the throwing of the pal sphere. now it is nothing like pokemon. if you are looking for a pokemon like game this is not it. would recommend to anyone who likes capturing little or big critters and making them work in your factory.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"i love this game. my only issue is if you have to start all over on a new server to play with someone, why cant all multiplayers build up on the same base with everyone else? like a village type of deal. camping areas should be a bigger area of space depending the number of people in the server."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"beating cute animals humans included, sticking them in balls, and making them your labor force. freedom to be kind or evil to those that survive. mating isn't optional, for the pals. oh! there's also guns, rockets, grenades, and lasers. remember to killmaimburn andor enslave responsibly. the game is fun for collectors, builders, adventurers, and explorers. this is a solid purchase, especially for early access. many high end games don't look this good on their full release thanks civ vii. if you visit my ingame bar, remember that neo's fight club and lounge is now serving disappointment just like i do on tinder! valentine's and christmas day discounts 20 off if you bring your girlfriend, 25 off if you bring your wife, or 50 off if you bring both!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"i am going to need nintendo to get over their shit because this game is amazing! it is not a pokemon knock off... it's more like if pokemon, minecraft and zelda breath of the wild all had a baby together... and then armed said baby with a gun. the perfect mixture of survival tactics, crafting creativity and adorable creatures!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,this game is great and i had my doubts at first it was a pokemon knockoff but it wasn't even like pokemon at all
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"this game is essentially a better version of another very popular creature collecting game. this is way more effort put into and it shows. it has survival mechanics, base building, and exploring a vast open world to name a few. i've had way more fun with this game then the other game. also worth noting that they have over 30 million players speaks to how popular the game is."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"reviewed as of 01032025 unfortunately while this game does have some neat ideas, at the end of the day it feels soulless, generic and incredibly grindy and stressful. they grabbed a bunch of ideas from other games such as pokemon, zelda breath of the wild etc, threw them together, and then didn't focus on refining any of them. no story, no real objectives aside from get higher level, unlock all crafting options in the level skill tree, beat all bosses, capture all pals. and the road there is incredibly grindy and sometimes downright boring. constantly you have to micro manage your inventory and your bases. it often feels more like factorio meets rust than pokemon meets zelda breath of the wild. to get better armor, weapons, and spheres to capture pals, you usually need to craft them yourself. for that, you need to micro manage the shit out of your bases and your pals to make sure everything gets produced in sufficient quantities. sooner or later you will also need to spend hours breeding pals to get 4 stars 116 pals sacrificed to get 4 stars which boosts the stats of one chosen pal basically. you need to repeat this process for many pals, to get good ivs hidden bonuses that influence how much attack, defense and hp they gain per level and target perks stuff like 30 attack, defense, workspeed etc. i have probably spend more time building bases, carrying resources, and breeding pals than on exploration and combat. it often feels more like work than playing a game. even 154 hours into the game i still havn't beaten the last tower boss because i'm not strong enough yet, and there is still a lvl 60 oil rig, and several summoning raid bosses that are even stronger. but i don't feel like breeding specific pals and farming souls and all the other stuff that's necessary to come up with the perfect roster of pals for each of those challenges anymore. you spend 1030 hours preparing for a single fight that is over in 10 minutes or less if succesful. how is that fun for anyone? i will say this much you can spend a lot of time in this game, and the exploration and even base building is decent if you're into that sort of thing. many of the pals can be kind of charming as well. but for anyone who is afraid of games that are too grindy and micromanage heavy, stay the fuck away from this one."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"hands down one of my favorite games to play within the last year. they keep fixing bugs and adding new content. so whether you're picking this up for the first time or are returning from a break, i think there is something in it for everyone. the pals are adorable, there's crafting, combat, survival. i can't put it down."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"i love the open word concept and the ability to play a variety of ways. while the game can be akin to others, it really stands alone by seamlessly meshing some of the better qualities from more popular games."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"guns and slavery, the best combo."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"i love this game so much i genuinely cant put into word how much i adore this game. if your not sure about this game and it goes on sale, buy it, i'm sure you'll love it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"once you pick it up, it'll be hard to put it down! this game can captivate you in a lot of ways. the monster catcher themes blend well with the survival crafting game. it's just phenomenal! not to mention the constant updates and the fostered community built around the concept the so called redacted with guns. the attachments you form with the creatures and you get to exercise your creativity and need for exploration every step of the way. the challenges and action packed open world exploration, i just can't get enough of this game and i'm hoping to see more things added and improved as time goes on. palworld is just one of those games that you must have in your account."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,fix the connection timed out issue with multiplayer. it makes the game unplayable. i cannot even get onto the server i've been playing on so now i lost a level 50 character.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"this game is so good. 100 worth 30, if it goes on sale, pick it up. you won't regret it. mixture of survival,exploration,rpg... and best of all... pokem err i mean pals cough. highly recommend."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"i... i might have a problem. the game is super addictive. the survival aspect is slightly challenging in the beginning, then it becomes manageable, but then it ramps right back up towards the endgame and beyond! the meta gets really intricate and fun to explore, and as of typing this, i don't think pocket pair are quite done with this game. after over 1k hours, i'm still finding new things to do. would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun survival game with a monster taming system."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,great game. love how they make more and more content for the game. very happy.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,amazing game cant wait for it to have much more to do and i hope nintendo goes and get something better to do rather than mess with good game devs
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,got this game less than 2 days ago and i've already played for 16 hours. i love this game it's so addicting and it seems like there is always something to do. the pve is nice and the ingame survival guide made it quite easy for me to start. no wiki required to help you figure it because all of the starter questions can be answered without leaving the tab. 1010 would recommend
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,good game but its bit laggy for mid end pc need to put some patch or lower some graphics setting which can adapt the system compatiblity other wise very good game enjoy lot
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,god if only it was pokemon. i really enjoyed it tho. bit of a grind towards the end and i didnt like it so i just changed the world settings to make it more enjoyable
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"love the concept and crafting aspects, very similar to conan exiles and ark survival. the pals are diverse and fun, a fresh take on something pokemon should strive to be instead of trying to shut it down. i enjoy both palworld and pokemon a lot and still play both. i recommend this game to those who enjoy pokemon too and give it a try."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"still early access, but after 24 hours i've hardly noticed. i've still only played single player though so can't say anything about the multiplayer experience.. i was looking forward to the game and i gotta say it's exceeded my expectations by miles. the building, the gathering, the catching and caring for the pals. i'm loving it and i can't wait to continue playing."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"let's say u invested a lot of time in one server in single player mode or a private free server with some friends, just stay playing on that server! unless itz a friend's server u invested a lot of time on, then rip if they don't play anymore or don't have the time to. the amount of times i restarted cuz of friends is so insane. dont make my mistake if you're trying to enjoy the game genuinely. it takes a lot of time and effort to get far even with cheating u can say. but if u are just playing for fun with friends and enjoy fucking restarting the same shit over and over go for it. play on multiple servers and get no where. another solution to enjoy the game would be freeload a friend who invested a lot of their time already on a server if you wanna try out the game or experience the new things that updates ever so often. thank you for reading. p.s. don't come at me for thinking when i said enjoy, it meant building pretty shit on mods or feeding my pals burgers. enjoying is that, but what i really mean is exploring the map and breeding and collecting pals. it takes six ever."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"worth every cent, worth every penny, yes it is a finite game, but to put it simply if you like survival games andor pokemon games, you will love this game despite the glitches here and there."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"the gameplay is phenomenal and combines a lot of different mechanics from different games very well. i can see its potential for becoming a widely recognised and loved franchiseif it already isn't. however, in my opinion, since i care a lot about the future of this game, there are certain things they have to make sure they don't overlook the game lacks a compelling story. all the new mechanics and features are really good and much appreciated but they need to be somehow tied to a consistent story line or at least all the major features do. now i know this is a survival game but what makes a game timeless is a good story line that complements the gameplay such that it adds to the replayability of the game. while the awesome team at pocketpair does all the amazing work with the banger updates, i believe this is something that needs to be prioritised. the game lacks polish in some aspects that, if addressed, could improve the gameplay experience a lot the building mechanics have the option to build foundations of variable heights  you can charge more resources for taller foundations. pals caught with a type of sphere should maintain its colour as it is stored in its sphere. i.e. mega spheres green should remain green when summoning the pal stored in them and so on. key items like hip lantern should be toggleable or at least be able to be removed from inventory. the light scattering from the lantern is often distracting in certain parts of the map. some may also prefer the aesthetic of the darkness in some places. ability to compartmentalise pals in the palbox i.e. separate tabs in the palbox ui for storing breeding pals, base pals, fighting pals, favourites, etc add a weather system  i.e. rain, thunderstorms, blizzards, sandstorms, hailstorms and volcanic eruptions, maybe? to make the environments more immersive. and maybe make some special pals spawn in certain weather conditions."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"amazing game!! got so hooked its unreal! perfect monster survival game with plenty of things to look for and best of all, you can entrap humans xd i love it xd"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"honestly... it's a solid game, yeah there might be some bugs, but they've been updating and adding new content and qol updates. it's great as a game... and for a small developer, earlyaccess game it's amazing. 1010 recommend, you get exactly what you'd expect from a survival game with monsters."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,i have enjoyed the game in the amount of time i have played on it. its open world but the quests that you get keep it interesting unlike elden ring no offence elden ring players. it can get grindy and i think a good feature is those wait times count for when ur outside the game too. like waiting for eggs to hatch or dungeons to finish but overall im enjoying it so far!  graphics   you forget what reality is  beautiful  good  decent  bad  dont look too long at it  msdos  gameplay   very good  good  it's just gameplay  mehh  watch paint dry instead  just don't  audio   eargasm  very good  good  not too bad  bad  i'm now deaf  audience   kids  teens  adults  grandma  pc requirements   check if you can run paint  potato  decent  fast  rich boi  ask nasa if they have a spare computer  game size   floppy disk  old fashioned  workable  big  will eat 15 of your 1tb hard drive  you will want an entire hard drive to hold it  you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data  difficulty   just press 'w'  easy  easy to learn  hard to master  significant brain usage  difficult  dark souls  grind   nothing to grind  only if u care about leaderboardsranks  isn't necessary to progress  average grind level  too much grind  you'll need a second life for grinding  story   no story  some lore  average  good  lovely  it'll replace your life  game time   long enough for a cup of coffee  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond  price   it's free!  worth the price  if it's on sale  if u have some spare money left  not recommended  you could also just burn your money  bugs   never heard of  minor bugs  can get annoying  ark survival evolved  the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs  ?  10   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  author   httpsvojtastruhar.github.iosteamreviewtemplate
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"a more difficult pal collecting game, that includes guns, armor and decorating. highly recommend."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"me like shoot guns, shoot big guns fun too, shoot guns at funny looking pokemons fun too."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,palworld is a game for anyone. you can play with multiple people or just yourself. it is equally as fun either way. would recommend! enjoy!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"this game may still be in the early stages but it is a really fantastic, fun and immersive game, with lots of beautiful locations and interesting monsters to battle and collect. camp building is fun and engrossing, playing with friends makes the game even more fun. i do wish they would add a feature where your character can remain persistent throughout multiplayer worlds, so you didn't have to reroll every time you want to join a new friend in their world."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,engaging fun and addicting. i fell in love the the adorable designs for the pal and have been working on collecting them all
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,good fun lots of building to do and making of friends
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,far too fun and far too addicting!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,pretty fun and entertaining nintendo should just get bent they are just mad they can't make this good of a game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"seriously addictive. it's what we've wanted from a monster collector for a while. the lore is silly, the combat is challenging, the pals are cute and cool sometimes at the same time. palworld is far more than pokemon with guns and honestly to claim it is, is an insult to the game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,its good to play with friends but u know it early access so it have some bug.that all
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,the gameplay mechanics are great and the game itself was great!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"jogo  bom, mas no funciona o multiplayer local, no consegui jogar com amigos, fiz de tudo"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"good, fun game reminiscent of pokemon but you can play it on pc which is a plus.. at the very end of the game this farming for better monsters and leveling monsters to defeat the last tower and 2 boring monsters.. i recommend it"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,even after taking a break from this game at launch. playing this game again after multiple updates and it's still fun to play. palworld has almost everything i wanted from pokemon. all the pals in this game have incredible animations to show each of their own quirks and character. having a base pal like lullu in the base and it spins when helping you build is amusing to look at. new quality of life updates such as making bigger pals not get stuck and no longer needing to hold f thanks to a new toggle button help make the game more enjoyable even now. the game is still in early access but i am very much looking forward to the final version once it releases.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"a delightful blend of pokemon and ark. the critters are adorable, which makes and hilarious contrast with the darker themes. the combat feels good, though i would like the aggro of enemies and pals to be a bit more predictable. if you and your pal are fighting a boss, it seems to randomly target either you or the pal, even if you are not actively damaging it yourself and letting your pal do the work. the way they have been releasing new content has been nice, with new content being added with a 5 to the level cap. my major complaint at this point is that the late game at this point is excessively grindy. needing the large labor camps to very slowly process materials is a bit much. the game is early access so i hope that will be addressed in the future, the pal expeditions and research facilities are a good start. lots of replayability, in fact mostly just replaying the early to midgame has the most fun at this point. overall, as the game currently stands, 7.510 with high hopes to get better in the future."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"this game is a lot of fun at first but can be really repetitive after. i woke up today telling myself ill be breeding a perfectly equipped yakumo with all the passives i want on it. i spent a day grinding and after i got my perfect yakumo, i was like, what now? still lot of fun  i like how we can customize the world based on our preference. i like the designs on the pals!! i just wished we could also have a preference to just be able to make it easier to catch pals with better passives for those like me who dont really want to go through the breeding process and catching a lot of pals. i just want to hop on a good mount, enjoy the world and shoot pals for no reason."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"i mean. it is literally monsters that you keep in spheres on your pock... bag. it is a very known, very beloved, and proven type of game. the only difference is that pocketpair has actually made a fun game and not a brainless copy of old, nostalgic games. you can put a machine gun on a vulpi... foxparks, fly around on your zapd... beakon, enslave an army of lucar... anubis to produce ridiculous contraptions and use your fire gyarad... jormuntide ignis to bake ludicrous amounts of cake and watch gardevoir get absolutely railed by whatever monstrosity you desire in a virtual breeding prison. oh, and you can fight trainers or something. can't recommend this game enough"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"this is game is great. it's a fantastic combination of so many different games, like ark, pokemon, and breath of the wild. the game play loop is so fun, particularly in the beginning of the game. there's a lot of customization and amazing mod support so you can cater to your preferences. the game is definitely unpolished and janky though, but these generally don't detract from the fun of the game. in it's current state, the endgame is stale and grindy, but getting there is a lot of fun. i highly recommend this game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"other than a few glitches i've had like being sent flying while trying to climb and having a boss get stuck in the ceiling of a cave, this game is amazing. it has very creative combat mechanics, involving weapons along with pals and their abilities. the openworld and survival aspect also makes this game a lot more immersive and refreshing compared to other creature catching games you know what i'm talking about. i wish there was a little more freedom to the basebuilding mechanics, but the fact that it even has them in the first place and they're decent is definitely a positive for me."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"it's a very fun game, i really enjoyed it. the pals are great and i can't wait for more future contents. also, was just hoping for the pal ai to be more refined in the future"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"you start with fun little pals, in the end there are multiple factories forcing your pals to do what you want them to do"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,fantastic game ever since the new updates. cant wait to see what the future holds.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,its super fun and the fact that you can ride pal and shoot them out of a rocket launcher is crazy and you can catch humans
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,i have seen many survival building game but this is the best because it gives me freedom and the power i want
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"my husband and i love playing this game together. we've enjoyed building our bases, capturing pals and fighting bosses. exploring the world and finding new locations for bigger bases has also been enjoyable."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,great game that i can just turn off my brain and lose myself in. definitely recommend for relaxing a few hours to unwind.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"great friken game f pkmon. this is real adventure. i enjoy it and just as every game i get bored of it and never return. i have returned 5x just to try different things search, breed, anjoy the views. i love it glitches or crashes do get fixed noticeably. ive messed with hunter wilds to compare and i cant even get in 10min before complete crash and have fully lost hope in my pokemon files. keep itt up please all power and hope to this game and company, researchers and developers fr fr. arigato"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,incredible game! really hope they keep releasing more content for it!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"palworld is an ambitious game that blends monstercatching mechanics with survival, crafting, and openworld exploration. at first glance, it feels like a dream mix of pokmon, ark survival evolved, and automation games like factorio. the world is visually appealing, with a variety of biomes and a diverse roster of pals to collect, battle, and even put to work in factories. the combat is fluid, and the option to use pals as mounts or combat allies adds a fun twist. however, the game struggles with balance and polish. ai pathfinding is frustratingly poor, especially when managing pals in a base. they often get stuck or fail to perform tasks efficiently, making automation feel clunky rather than satisfying. the difficulty scaling is also unevensome areas feel trivial, while others suddenly spike in challenge with little warning. multiplayer, while a great idea in theory, suffers from connectivity issues and a lack of meaningful cooperative mechanics beyond basic resource sharing. palworld also raises ethical concerns with its mechanics, as pals are essentially used for forced labor, and the game does little to address the moral implications of its own systems. while this could be an interesting narrative choice, the game treats it with an awkward sense of humor that might not sit well with everyone. additionally, the content loop can feel repetitive after a while, with a limited variety of tasks beyond capturing pals, crafting, and fighting bosses. overall, palworld is an entertaining but flawed experience. it has a strong foundation and plenty of potential, but its ai issues, balance problems, and ethical dilemmas keep it from reaching greatness. if the developers continue to refine and expand the game, it could evolve into something truly special, but as it stands, it feels like an earlyaccess title that still needs significant work."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,expecting this to be a huge joke and massive rip and then it turns out to actually be one of the better survival crafting games with the creature collector twist was actually very refreshing
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"it's hard to get bored on this game. the game does a great job at giving you something to do at all times, whether it's progressing your pals and capturing new ones, or improving your bases and creating new items. on top of that, as long as you have the requirements to get something, nothing is ever extremely tedious to acquire. i do think the combat of some of the npcs could be fleshed out, but that will probably become better as the game comes out of early access. overall a great time, even in early access."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"este  um jogo incrvel e super divertido, perfeito para jogar com amigos ou at mesmo sozinho. eu tambm jogo na ps5 e, embora seja uma pena que ainda no tenha suporte para crossplay e servidores dedicados, acredito que, devido ao excelente trabalho dos desenvolvedores, essas funcionalidades podem ser implementadas em um futuro prximo. infelizmente, no consigo jogar to bem no pc, pois no tenho as especificaes adequadas. para aqueles que esto indecisos sobre comprar o jogo, no hesitem!  uma aventura como nenhuma outra e vale a pena experimentar!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,fun survival game you get pets to do some of your tasks around you bases and to help you battle. they have regular updates and work on improvements so it is worth a try.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"palworld is a more realistic creature collector game. enjoy aspects such as collecting a human being  forcing them to do what pals can. work or be more wholesome  give those adorable pals some needed pets  watch as they fluff up in a happier mood for those couple of seconds. recommendations include a friend in on the fun, ignore guidestutorials unless specifically needed, an example is perhaps a map which shows the locations of pals. another great inclusion is to enjoy a bottleglass of water while you collect all the pals.  rating 910"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"have only played on a personal dedicated server. game is great with friends , could easily struggle on solo play but other wise the game is great. seems like a great mixture of arksurvival and pokemon. the game gives solid instructions in beginning to help anyone get started ."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"love this game, the grinding, the pals are unique, the guns are fun i love this game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"had a great time until the dedicated server refused connect anyone through the public ip. better dedicated server support is badly required, maybe consider a gui with some self checks to ensure proper connectivity"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,love this game! continue this amazing work cant wait to see what you have next installed for the updates to come! thank you.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"fun game. throw ur balls, make them do ur work some things still needs balancing though. e.g xenolord raid breeding time slider when?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"yes, it's very similar to pokemon, in that you have to catch 'em all, and yes, the pals look very similar to the different kinds of pokemon we've come to know. but that's where the similarity ends. pokemon doesn't have the crafting and farming the building up from nothing. pokemon doesn't have the survival aspect, where you can actually drown, starve to death, die from falling, or from having enemies try to unalive you both human and pal enemies. this is quite a bit more immersive than that, and i like it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"its seems that people dumb down this game to 'a cheap ripoff of pokemon' or 'pokemon with guns.' however, in my experience, this game is an excellent stand alone experience. its fun, with interactive, explorative gameplay. as well as an excellent, subtle. but gripping story, and genuinely enjoyable play. i really appreciate the ability to change the difficulty with no penalty. not even to achievements. i don't feel pressured to grind, or think too hard about my choices, its a game that, if i choose to, can play as a way to unwind on a sunday afternoon, or, if i'm in the mood for riveting, soulslike combat, i can easily change my experience with the click of a button. the gameplay is also intuitive, with an excellent blend of combat, exploration, building, and automation. with a running gameplay loop throughout, that lets you know exactly what your doing, while also evolving and morphing as you gain knowledge, keeping the experience fresh, fun, and exiting. 1010, would recommend."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,on paper this game shouldnt work but in execution it completely does! some things need fleshing out but over all its a fun game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"this game is addicting, i love this, it's basically a new hobby, whenever i have free time i'm always tempted to boot his up instead of doing a previously known hobby of mine, it's always a coinflip! one thing i think should be added is maybe a trait opposite of 'alpha' or 'lucky' named mini or petite where the pal is half it's original size, preferably without negatives but i'm willing to deal with a 10 decrease in attack or defense. overall, a great survival game that has many many great aspects and a few things that could be improved on such as the models that have strange similarities to a certain other brand. i see that a few have been changed already so i have lots of hope for the future of this game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,legendary schematics are a pain to obtain but overall good game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i play this game with my family and my partner all the time. it was definitely worth the price for the amount of enjoyment we get out of it. i love collecting pets and exploring, they love the building up systems and hunting. its a pretty great game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"this is the game that made me fully realise i was the base organiser. there was a chest for everything, every category. my boyfriend is the opposite he just dumps his items wherever he pleases. i just put a chest beside the fast travel point so he can empty his inventory and i can take it all away and put it in its respective boxes. i quite enjoy this game. i will come back for the updates, check them out, play it for weeks, and then disappear. but it's nice to come back to. like when you come back to minecraft after a while, or the sims. its up there for me with replayability. having different pals tasked with different things is nice too, and i love decorating the base."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i really enjoy the open world concept of this game. along with the crafting capabilities, and the mount. it's a nice play through."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,best relaxing game i played ever! loved it! always enjoy the game like it's all real.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"for a 30 early access game there is a lot to enjoy. i like the progress they have made in their first year however there is a lot to be desired. base building  putting pals to work is the core here. the world feels void of life even with pals wondering we need weather effects, small noninteractive critters, points of interest, more detailed biomes. survival is very pg. temp wasn't a threat just a couple hours in. pals need their own inventory. combat is a buggysnooze fest. boss battles are tedious. traits need a overhaul. having to catch 1020 bushi's or breeding till i win the jackpot is not a fun experience. after a while the gameplay loop shows it's ugly mug, like any sandboxcraftsurvival. all that being said this is one of the best in it's genre."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,good stuff love the updates cant wait for level 100
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"this game is want pokemon needed to become, and hopefully once nintendo is done trying to push through lawsuits they use the competition to push themselves. palworld offers multiple ways to place and different objectives for you to work towards"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i have played this for 200 hours trying to breed a lovander with vampiric, remarkable craftmanship, hearth of immovable king, swift just to give it away to every newbie on the official server to send a message"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,love the base building and pal collecting and being able to combine the two. just want more options for base building
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,the game is fun to play with. but make sure you have a lot of time before buying .
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i've had so much fun with this game, whether i'm playing by myself or with friends. build bases, capture all the pals, face down the bossesit's a lot of fun and appropriate for pretty much any age player."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,a fun time to have with your friends. i look fwd to see what updates bring
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,ai is completely braindead half the time and it starts getting grindy past level 20 but still really fun
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,fun survival base building game with pokemon elements. better than it deserves to be.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"amazing survival game. combat is fun. the qol is insanely good, and the punishment when losing the game is fair."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,its a good game i highly recommend playing palworld its a good game i honestly see nothing bad about it sometimes it could be a grind tho it also has good updates as well like the chillet ignis
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,overall id say its a good game with many things to do but later on its more time consuming where you cant do much more stuff so things start to slow down and look around and question if u really want to continue playing this game and you either continue and do everything or you dont and the only way for you to start playing again is if their is something that you actually like it or if you get friend but with friends this game is really fun i cant wait for the pvp to come out where you and all your friends can battle it out and have full on battle with huge creatures like how ark is but overall id give it a 810 early 510 later on 45 but if they add pvp i think the game will be a 910 overall even high levels as theirs a goal and something you want to do
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"this is a creaturecapture game done right. the visuals are great, and i really enjoy being able to work and fight alongside my pals in an openworld environment. the world feels alive in a way that is difficult to pull off in games like this."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"one of the best games i've played to date. minor bugs, but nothing unexpected from a game that's still in early release. if you like monster collectors, you'll likely love this game!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"good start, needs a decent plot, better bosses and more appealing character designs."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"very easy to play. kind of a grind at first, but once you get the idea of how to make the pals work efficiantly, it's really fun"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"really great game! pacing is good, the game is fun both as singleplayer and just as great with frinds."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"very fun game, enjoying every update they put out and can't wait for it to be finished."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"wish it had a bit of story to it, but other than that the game is amazing. didn't even realize i truly like survival games till this game. nintendo eat your heart out!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,it is very fun especialy when you play friends the pals are super cool and would defently recomend to anybody who loves pokemon
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"this game is so fun. i went in thinking it was a pokemon knockoff when it released, but having played literally since day one, it is so much more. its continued to evolve since it released,and if you like pokemon and guns, this is the game for you. its honestly one of the best games ive played."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,the game is great just need to find some friends to play it with its not that fun alone and if anyone wants to play text me i'm down
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"okay girly pop, let's talk about palworld. its a pretty okay game all things considered. though i personally enjoy the early game much more than the late game. the power scaling feels a little bit awkward at times and it leads to the pacing being honestly not the best but i still found it fun despite its flaws. honestly late game turns into quite a grind as it feels like youre playing an impossible game of catchup against the bosses where there is no middle ground which is fine but can be a little bit infuriating at times. i achievement hunted this game as of february 26, 2025. i have all of the achievements this was a slog of an achievement hunt. theres a lot of what i can only describe as filler achievements that take a long time and dont feel particularly fulfilling in conclusion, this game is really fun to play casually and its great with friends, but its far from perfect  graphics   you forget what reality is  beautiful  good  decent  bad  dont look too long at it  msdos  gameplay   very good  good  it's just gameplay  mehh  watch paint dry instead  just don't  audio   eargasm  very good  good  not too bad  bad  i'm now deaf  audience   kids  teens  adults  grandma  pc requirements   check if you can run paint  potato  decent  fast  rich boi  ask nasa if they have a spare computer  game size   floppy disk  old fashioned  workable  big  will eat 10 of your 1tb hard drive  you will want an entire hard drive to hold it  you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data  difficulty   just press 'w'  easy  easy to learn  hard to master  significant brain usage  difficult  dark souls  grind   nothing to grind  only if u care about leaderboardsranks  isn't necessary to progress  average grind level  too much grind  you'll need a second life for grinding  story   no story  some lore  average  good  lovely  it'll replace your life  game time   long enough for a cup of coffee  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond  price   it's free!  worth the price  if it's on sale  if u have some spare money left  not recommended  you could also just burn your money  bugs   never heard of  minor bugs  can get annoying  ark survival evolved  the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs  ?  10   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  author   httpsvojtastruhar.github.iosteamreviewtemplate"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"this game was great with just playing with buddies, but do not do the 100 achievements unless you want to suffer a week long hard grind."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"this game is amazing, it for sure has some issues but its early access so its understandable. i love how this game is like a combination of a bunch of games, but just the best mechanics. its almost a combo of minecraft, ark, pokemon, zelda and more. i would 100 recommend this game. play with some friends and you will have a killer time."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"i was against it at first, because i just kept hearing pokemon with guns. i even told my partner to sell it back when he bought it for me. but after playing for a bit, i think it's a wonderful survival crafter. base building is great. pal designs are great. it's is very much its own game. is fun solo. is fun with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"definitelynotpokemon with guns, yes its very good, the bugs are worth it"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"i have been playing this a lot periodically with my wife. we have absolutely loved and enjoyed the game. we play on a very advanced world in which we have done so much testing it wouldn't fit in a comment. there are so many ways you can be super efficient in mining or catching your favorite pals. its pretty simple and super fun, and i think theres a chance it will beat out the pokemon world. and once they start making more super cool unique creatures, this game is just going to go sky high with players."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,ngl overall great game but breeding in this game is horrible and needs reworked it takes way too long to breed for certain traits.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,this game is great but for some reason the player can't work in the breeding farm. i've been trying to get kattress to lay an egg and it won't work even with cake. 1010 game overall.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"i honestly didn't expect this to be this good. i bought it on a whim, i hate survival crafting games and was never that into monster capture style games but this is amazing. beautiful graphics, gun's, breeding, strikeslaverystrike i mean monster crafting stations, bosses, dungeons, world bosses and super cool pal's! i cant stress just how cool some of these pal's really are spoilertombat 1spoiler! i'm having tons of fun just farming pal's, exploring and base building. this is so engaging that im actually trying to build proper bases instead of just tossing a ton of stuff in a heap and hope it works out haha palworld successfully made a game featuring tons of features i hate but doing it so well i actually really love them. absolute 1010"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,it is very addicting and fun to play i still have not nearly comleated the game
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,super fun game to play with friends or solo adventure! most fun i've had in gaming in a little while
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,still new and being worked on. so there are some bugs. its is fun though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,quite fun game for so low price n quite enjoyable with friends if u have
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,it's quite fun just let lose and enjoy don't get to stuck on story. make sure you move around every 25 to 50 days don't stay in one place for too long explore other locations try building new base designs. take your time enjoying the lower level pals don't skip over too many of theme i know it's tempting. this game is really fun and is slowing gaining a solid base structure it's not as hallow as it was on launch. this game is worth every cent you spend on it. 910
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"kudos to the devs for the awesome game. it is still early access so there are some bugs, but overall it is a great game to play with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,this game shouldn't be as fun as it is but here we are. totally addictive and more complex than i'd thought.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"good game play and replayability. devs have been updating fairly regularly. if this is the type of game you like, it's well done. still has it's issues but overall i've got my money's worth. my only gripe is the story isn't finished yet. what's the tree all about?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,best survival game out there but please add for prehistoric dino pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"the best intrusive purchase i have made last year, one of the best casual games that i have ever played, lot of content to tackle when you are doing a blind playthrough, definitely should give a shot for those who want to play a casual creature collector, hope for more content in the future"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,played this game since it first launched and took over the gaming industry by storm with its classic gameplay. palworld has earned a spot in my virtual happy places list with the little time that i have for gaming nowadays unless my hubby grinds for me. runs fine on steamdeck and rog ally too! thanks pocketpair for making the plike that vermin which must not be named game we've always wanted to play. 1010
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,abusive working conditions for pals? i could never abuse the working conditions. i love the working conditions.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,its a nice creative way to combine multiple game genres
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"i understand its not finished yet so here are mine suggestionsideas. please allow zooming in  out a bit especially during construction. when constructing storage, the information should also include how many items can be stored. so far everything is great! my only pet pevee is not having a free or release option for the pals. only option so far is to kill them. not very happy about that. but best of luck"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,super fun with friends! great progression experience so far!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,really fun to play and has a pretty good game play loop
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"this game includes so much stuff, in a simple and fun play style. this game is so worth it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,i love this game and would recommend it to anybody but if you loose a world there is no way to get it back which since i used to have the x box game pass and then when some one canncled it i lost all of the progress but other about that feature i love this game the pals are very cool and most of the mods are great especially for starters and other people.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"good game, too bad nintendo has to ruin our fun. a bit rough on the models thats about it worth playing"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,fun game with cool spin on capturing monsters and survival. cant wait to see what comes out for this game.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"silly and fun game!! totally worth it!! its a great mix of survival, crafting, and creature collecting that keeps you hooked. super existed for how the game will update in the future and waiting for the full release! p.s. pals are super cute  1010"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,this game combines several fun things together in a cute world with cute critters. i appreciate that i can customize the gameplay settings to be mild i like cozy games these days
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"sometimes i log in to just do some base things and end up playing for four hours. there are still some qol things that i hope for the full game, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. some days i just go exploring and hatch eggs, some days i redesign my base, and some days i go to the moon tower to die to saya."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"this is actually one of my favorite games. a lot of people assume it to just be pokemon with guns, but its more then that. it has lore, backstory, a story line, and is just good. it is more similar to ark then just pokemon. it has some unique and pretty designs, although some are very similar and obviously based or taken from regular pokemon, its still enjoyable! don't just think it's a knock off guys. try it yourself first! overall, id say it's worth the money. although it has plenty bugs, it is still out early. overall rating 1010 definitely recommend!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"it's everything nintendo had 3 decades to jump on, but didn't. better gunplay and ballistics than tarkov, more responsive devs than battlebit, fewer bugs than cyberpunk 2077, and it's still a better lovestory than twilight! shut up and take my money."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,this game contains elements from varies other games and and provided the best of all worlds.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"hesitated buying the game due to it's aesthetic, and liking or not, being heavily inspired on pokmon... truth is the game is extremely entertaining. very chill to play. you can build, farm, catch pals, fight, whatever you feel like to do that day."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"very fun game kinda like ark survival evolved which is a great game itself but this has a lot more depth to it and is grindy but in the end is very worth it because you get to have all these cool pals that have their own special moves and you can ride them and use them yourself too but the game isnt totally easy, you have to make sure you can beat or catch whatever your going for which is why this game is great and i recommend it heavily"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,if you progress you will be able to do more in the game and you have a lot of posibilitys
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"this game is amazing! it's like a mix of fortnite, pokemon and minecraft. fortnite building, minecraft survivalcrafting and battlingcatching different types of animals. i've never liked games that included hunger or survival mechanics, but i've played this for 10 hours 2 days in a row now. i physically have to restrains myself so i can do my job and school."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"its an amazing game. it looks like pokemon game and you can build a whole base. also the need to craft better gear is amazing. so much to do, think i will be playing much longer"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,great and fun game if you enjoy. survial with some monster hunting it is a ton of fun.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"even after the feybreak update, the game is still fun to play! i'll just say, i really enjoy it more than the early access launch and already during the initial launch it was already fun! still recommend!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,fun game that can be played over and over again. can play in relax mode and just enjoy the map and mild attacks which i enjoy.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"incredibly addicting, fun, and just the right amount of challenging... i also absolutely love the customization settings for selfmade worlds and the ability to play singleplayer all the way through the game i don't know if any of my friends would even be interested in joining me so i just played singleplayer  though some of the pals seem suspiciously close in design to pokemon, what they did with them exceeds every expectation i had. when it comes to the newer pals coming out i find it refreshing to see new designs! keep it up and don't let nintendo get you down because what you have here is better than any pokemon game thus far."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"its already been 300 hours, huh. anyway, i suppose its time for a review. this is one of those games, where you can feel the blood, sweat and tears the devs provide to make it the best possible experience for its players. the continuous updates, make this a game what you can continue to come back to, again and again, exploring the new content, unlocking new gear, to then leave it in hibernation again which is perfectly fine. one never really gets burnt out. amazing course the devs are taking currently, and i will continue to grind and play through future updates to come."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"fun game, though sort of grind heavy to level up and stuff"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"good game to fill the gap between games i really like. not a master piece, however, brings a lot of fun if you have friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"palworld is sooooooooo good you should definitely get it and you should catch jetdragon,anubis and kingpaca their like the best pals in the game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"so now that the controversy has died down, i did eventually break down and buy palworld on steam. are there pals that exist that are definitely legally distinct ripoffs of pokemon? yeah, absolutely. and honestly, this irks me even more now that ive played it, because some of the ones i saw nothing about were some the most unique. like this one, tarantriss! bug as a type doesnt exist, even if there are buglookin pals, so this one is thrown in with dark types. but it can serve as a mount, can double jump, and use webs to access difficulttoreach areas. is it pokemon with guns? absolutely it is, but what hooked me was the basebuilding and crafting.you can create a console pretty much anywhere on the admittedly pretty sizable map, and within a certain radius of that console is where you can buildpretty much whatever you want. im a sucker for customization in any game, and so that more than anything is whats kept me playing. once you get more bases, you can specialize them to be able to do different things, and the ability to create storage that shares supplies across every base you own makes streamlining each one that much easier. the game suffers from the elden ring style of storytelling, though, if theres any story to be had at all. in the sense that any story you get is through finding little journals left laying around the islands you travel through, and ill be real with you ive found like, 5. theres no real end goal, no super memorable characters. even the boss characters are only cool until you beat them, with no real explanation as to why theyre there or who they even are, which is disappointing because they all seem unique enough to warrant some exposition. setting aside the controversy regarding the makers of the game, the game itself is pretty ok, with some memorable monsters amidst a sea of blatant copies, but i wouldnt really be able to recommend it to anyone whos looking for any kind of engaging story. if youre looking to gun down  subjugate adorable creatures while having access to some expansive if a little fickle basebuilding, this one is pretty solid. ill hope for more updates allowing for more fleshed out storytelling, but given the developers history with other games being left in unfinished states, i wont hold my breath. 710 overall. low replayability unless id be starting a new save with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"this game is amazing and they deserve all the credit for the task of testing the waters against a certain company. while i will say there is plenty of bugs, please dont let that detract you from how fun this game is. its not about the details. its about the mechanics."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"honestly, this is my guilty pleasure game. just running around doing nothing is super fun in this not pokemon simulator. some pointers for maximum fun, once you get tired of the survival mechanic and feel yourself getting bored of the game. go turn off settings like deterioration, and over encumbrance, and up your experience gain and other settings. it brings a whole new life into the game. its so much fun just running around popping up fortnite towers and whipping them pals into shape."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"the game really is just an enjoyable experience. good pal designs, and really good update frequency. i came back after a year and there's just so much more content to digest that it feels like a new experience. i wish it would have a little more guidance through the use of interactive npcs to push your player through the different biomes more smoothly, but its a small dev team making an amazing and massive world. i expect this will eventually come out with future updates. unironically i think this game could benefit from a bit of the ubisoft method for open world games, where you have settlements to conquer and faction based progression the more you conquer the land. i cant wait for the fully fleshed out story, really."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"fun game, lots of content and updates"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"a fantastic monster capturing game. the aesthetics are awesome. base building feels a bit cluttered but it really is a joy to make your farm and watch your pals use it all effectively. if you love games like a certain nintendo franchise game, and base buildingresource management like rust, this is the game for you. i would love to see what the future updates for this game hold. and if they ever add mod support, may god have mercy on the pals because we all know what kinds of mods will be made first"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"single player is great with minimal issues other than the occasional falling through the map. multiplayer however has connection issues and lagging problems, at least for me. overall its a very fun game that plays like ark survival evolved with fortnite graphics and elements of pokemon."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"awesome game, lot of exploring, looting base building, everything is done perfectly. needs some optimization tho, i can handle it because i played games on low specs for years but many think this is a big deal, but it's only in some parts of the map tho, idk whats the deal with that."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"this game is fantastic for those who like base building, collecting, and exploration. the open world is huge with a ton of bosses and dungeons to complete. random exploration is encouraged with goodies hidden in tough to reach places."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"i'd reccomend this game to anyone just because how histerically funny it is at first to put pickaxes and guns into little cartoon characters hands, game is generally fun and i've got some good time playing it. it has some issues tho, its very chore heavy to a painful point, at first after you go to chop wood 10th time you think to yourself surley it gets better the futher i go. it gets worse. grind in this game is too much, you have to play on 'custom' to not lose your mind or to not give up on the game after first couple of hours, after that you honestly need mods that make you move faster. idk what makes developer think that making your character move at 3kph while sprinting is a good idea, i get that you should get high level pals to move around but to get jetragon you need endgame gear and at that point you should have most of the map explored. explored by low level pals that still move at ugh pace. love the game and its unapologetic humor, its a shame you need mods to fix basic gameplay issues tho."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"perfect blend of all the things i play videogames for. unfortunately, i don't have hardware that can handle it at this time. i really really hope they make a mobile version."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"i do not care what kind of games you usually play, get this one! it has brought me nothing but joy. 1. low lag 2. interesting gameplay dynamics 3. sandbox  given storyline 4. about as close to perfect as you can get in 2025 5. get it!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,jesus as my witness i am statistically the most unlucky man in the world as with a 33 chance it still takes 15 legendary spheres to catch anything on the new island. the percentage and the whole catch bonus is still so damn bugged i had to start over on easy because it requires so many damn resources. please just tell me its a 7 chance so i am not wildly overestimating my abilities.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,enjoyable with and without friends. developers are continually striving to make gameplay better and adding in more features. easy to pick up and put down.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,it's very fun to play and addictive. indeed it's a great game. i must admit that it's really worth it to try.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,this is a great game! love the exploration and building the fort. even making a rocket launcher that would make tf2 soldier proud! i don't care what nintendo or its fanatic fans think. this is better than pokemon !
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"pretty good, can play multiple times without getting stale, overall would recommend."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"even with all the bugs as it's not officially released, the game has so much to do and can keep me busy for hours."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"palworld is everything that people have been wishing the pokemon company would do in any pokemon game  even a spin off series  for at least a decade. the exploration features alone are the perfect example of what gen ix could have and should have been. as far as survival games go, palworld's integration of the monster collector subgenre is enormously effective and fun which lets this game stand out in a market where it feels like everything is a survival game similar to how everything was an mmo many years ago. you can really only appreciate just how fun palworld is by playing it for yourself, but once you do prepare to feel very betrayed by the pokemon company and question why one of the most successful franchises in history is churning out games with such poor polish compared to palworld. my only complaint is that the game lacks a catchy score. with better background music, truly i cannot see a reason to keep playing pokemon aside from instense nostalgia and an obsession with the rpg battle mechanics. i'm a huge fan of the action rpg elements of the game and the inclusion of survival game style combat. the combat in this game is everything that was missing in pokemon legends arceus, which i felt at the time was a very strong entry into the series. now that i've played palworld? pla is just a huge disappointment in every department except story, which wasn't all that great if we're being honest. features like the key items you can craft which allow for team ups with specific pals are all fun whether we're talking the harness that lets you use foxparks as a flamethrower or the saddles which allow you to roam the land, brave the sea, or soar across the sky."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"very cool game. i love the graphics on the game,i very much enjoy the creativity and defently recomend getting this game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,very fun much funner with freinds tho but its still very fun playing alone
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"like ark its a survival game, its just more of the characteristics i like in games, cutesy, challenging, and though provoking. one of my favorites by far!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,palworld is a blast. it's the perfect blend of survival and monster fighting. you really feel like a part of the fantastical world. i feel like a kid again
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"pals still get confused and dont attack. considering how the game came out, it is way better now. it runs about as well as a aaa game, but aaa games dont run perfect, so this still has some kinks to get ironed out. overall, it is a fun time sink that is worth the money."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"d very good and chill, but modding still kinda buggy d"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"gameplay highly enjoyable, containing a great blend of huntingexploring, simple battle strategy, base building and level up character building elements. can be quite grindy, recommend playing on a setting that boosts experience unless you want to spend hundreds of hours to get to top levelend of story. storyline fairly sparse, logs can be found to give a bit of flavour to the characters and society, but as far as i can tell there is no 'why' to the few quests that drive the gameplay forward. stylecontroversy obviously inspired from a certain ip, uniquely twisted in a way that ip would obviously not like. everyone is entitled to their opinion of whether this amounts to plagiarismsatireunique game sharing themes."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"there are still some bugs and issues but the palworld team has been working hard. i look forward to see future updates and this game grow, with more content and cross play. i already recommended the game to my friends and family. keep up the hard work! i also really like that i can take weak cute pals and make them strong or use at base rather than forgetting about them as i level up, makes me happy, and makes me want to draw fan art. cheers and catch you later!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,early access so limited end game stuff to do right now. great fun with the building great fun with the pets to tame. run into a few bugs build bases catch pals hunt bosses. hoping full release adds another map to explore and maybe a story to follow.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"i love creature collecting games, and i think that pal world is a unique spin on the genre. though the game is still early in development i've really been enjoying it and i cant wait for future updates."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"if anyone is thinking about this game and has played ark you'll love this title! especially if you enjoy pokemon titles! catching every pal in the game, creating op pals thru breeding, and setting challenges for yourself or your friends will keep you busy! if you wanna speed run the game, change the settings in the world menu to increase damage, exp, and catch rates.. etc. the game could honestly use a few updates with the pals building and getting stuck some times. for the most part this game is a 1010!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,its like that one game that shall not be mentioned but with guns and base building and forced slavery what else could you want
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"super fun open world basebuilder, so many cool and cute pals to catch, the landscape is beautiful and there is plenty to do!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"i have enjoyed palworld very much since i first tried it on xbox and rebought on steam. i have put many hours into my game and despite that i have yet to defeat the final raids and newest tower. i have goals in mind to make further progress and even though it's more of a grind now, i still want to finish this game. highly recommended."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"just play it! it is so much fun especially with friends. i enjoy playing solo as well. it has a lot of cool pals to collect, battle, and breed. i am an egg hunter myself and love hatching new pals."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"this game is fun to play with a partner. i don't think i would keep playing without someone to play it with, but my husband and i play it together a lot. it works great because i am more of a farm game person and i enjoy creature collectors, so i run around and gather pals and keep the base running. my husband loves shooters so he likes to fight bosses and dungeons, and focus on upgrading our base and gear."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"it's good and it makes nintendo angry! these are the games it mimics or borrows ideas from. elden ring, breath of the wild, pokemon legends arceus, ark. i'm sure there's a bunch more but that's pretty much the main ones. it is a game that is fun to sink hours into and it makes your pal's super useful! if you're on the fence and love all those other games, get it!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,lots of great content for only 30 and they constantly update the game whether it's patches or adding more content.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"great game nothing like pokemon, its more like ark survival evolved if taming the dino's was beating into mush and throwing a cryopod at it. also it's like a simulator for living in america"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,great and fun pokelike survival game. had a blast building my sla i mean production base.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-19,"good game. it's a grind, but it's fun to breed exceptional pals and explore the world, all while occasionally getting blown up by a boss."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"now, i'm not saying slavery is a good thing.... but. spoiler really though, this game is fun, worth the full price. spoiler"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"despite it's occasionally buggy gameplay, palworld has endlessly delighted me from the moment i started playing. it scratches my itch to build bases, catchtame monsters and explore an open world that almost 100 hours into the game i've still not fully explored. i get excited every time there's a patch or update and i truly hope these developers go far."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"its like a first person pokemon, with guns, slave labor, and you can build stuff lol its quite addicting, a little buggy but its early release, 20 hours in and havent found anything annoying enuff to make me stop, building a house and placing things inside is a bit of a pain, my main gripe im a sims kinda guy, ill spend half the night rebuilding my house lol"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"devs keep building out instead of up. played early on and cut it some slack with it's blank looking characters, nonexistent cities, blank empty rooms, assuming it would all be filled in over time. devs just keep expanding outward leaving a larger empty game. i know we all want that open world pokemon experience but this sadly just isn't it. even pokemon games feel more polished than this."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"enjoy this solo but moreso coop. recommend first base is build beside the river on the flat so the pal board is the middle of the field to include the surrounding resources in the base area. pals will then mine and log themselves. get a pal with the mercy trait, it means they'll get pals down to 1hp making them easier to catch and not die. coop works very easily."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,it's fun to play with music on in the background
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"i was addicted to this game for the longest time. but then with the update that extended max levels beyond 50 and up to 60 it all changed. this last stretch is beyond tedious and has felt like it put jetragon out of reach. sadly, i just can't be bothered with the postlvl 50 game. this is a shame because the game play up to that point is great."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"gets repetitive and boring wo frens. no couch coop. no crossplatform. can't play w console frends, can't play with wife. if they added these features i would start playing again."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"still too buggy and crude to be playable. i understand its an early access and will change this review once its closer to finished. so far it misses a better ui, more tipstutorials, a goal, a lot of refinement, and finish. after months after early access, some basic issues right when you start the game should have been resolved but they keep releasing more content while the existing content is buggy, doesn't seem good. they are riding the hype  remove the hype and curiosity of a pokemon ripoff, this is not worth it at all"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i've only played 4 hours and i'm already so happy with this, just playing single player. this is what actual pokemon is supposed to feel like and i literally cannot more highly reccommend this game. please, if you like pokemon, go buy this game right now. pokemon, pokemon llc, game freak, akira toriyama, mizu kudusai, naruto the manga. aufweidersehn"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,great game if you like survivle games and pokemon play it if you dont play it. its not like any other survivle games. if your wondering it runs on 25 to 50 fps on steam deck and even with 25 its great.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,i love the got day before previous update to today update that update i lost original save start over made huge progress i just built palspeare production line then today update came went check any problems with my save like last update only find my new game and all progress gone replace by original save file started besides set back great game could you look into why save files dispersed wouldn't the first i was ok its early access game issues are to occur but now im upset hours grinding gone in single update my disappointment is immeasurable but still recemend great6 game
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"well, despite all the controversy...this is what pok wish it could become and then some. if you like the concept of pok you will enjoy this game. base building seems nice, i did not personally bother that much with it myself as production takes priority and we are not playing satisfactory here to make it look epic. as long as someone is making iron ingots in the background or growing berries we are good. all you care about at the end of the day is that your massive dragon goes brrr! the graphics are great, optimisation of the world is great no lag, concept art for the pals is awesome and the game mechanic works smooth as butter in my opinion. the game contains some glitches but still the mechanics seem to run smooth. the battles are good, exp works, attacks work, skills work, crafting works. what else do you want?! jump in, catch yourself a lizard or a sheep and go to town on the world."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"this is the game that made me fully realise i was the base organiser. there was a chest for everything, every category. my boyfriend is the opposite he just dumps his items wherever he pleases. i just put a chest beside the fast travel point so he can empty his inventory and i can take it all away and put it in its respective boxes. i quite enjoy this game. i will come back for the updates, check them out, play it for weeks, and then disappear. but it's nice to come back to. like when you come back to minecraft after a while, or the sims. its up there for me with replayability. having different pals tasked with different things is nice too, and i love decorating the base."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"i had fun for the first 510 hours or so, but the game is extremely repetitive. it's heavily based on leveling and while the notpokemon have different skins they all share similar movesets. you as the player don't really make much of the choices other than bringing correctly typealigned notpokemon to fights. my wife loves this game and loves grinding for hours on end so i will be doomed to play it forever."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"palworld  pokmon with guns, but so much more hours played 67.2 palworld is an openworld survival game that blends elements of pokmonstyle creature collecting, crafting, basebuilding, and thirdperson shooter mechanics. while it started as a meme, it turned out to be one of the most addictive survival games in recent years. the good  huge open world full of pals  tons of creatures to catch, fight, and even work for you in bases. the variety is impressive.  basebuilding  automation  pals can gather resources, craft items, and even defend your base, making for a fun automation system.  surprisingly good combat  whether using guns, melee weapons, or pal abilities, the combat feels smooth and enjoyable.  coop  multiplayer options  playing with friends makes the experience even better, whether youre raiding dungeons or building a massive base together.  tons of things to do  hunting, crafting, breeding, raiding enemy bases, farming, dungeons, and even illegal pal trafficking yes, really.  active development  potential  the devs are actively working on new content, fixes, and pvp, so the future looks promising. the bad  some jank  bugs  as an early access game, expect some ai wonkiness, pathing issues, and occasional performance drops.  progression can feel grindheavy  upgrading gear, farming materials, and building bases can get repetitive over time.  balance issues  some pals are way stronger than others, and certain mechanics feel overpowered or underwhelming. final verdict with 67 hours, i can say palworld is way better than it has any right to be. its a mix of survival, monstercatching, and automation that just works. if you enjoy basebuilding, collecting creatures, and chaotic combat, this is a game worth playingespecially with friends. rating 8.510  a wildly fun, addicting survival game with huge potential."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"whilst the game itself is really cool, the bugs are simply put disgusting. my character keeps corrupting, my game keeps crashing for no reason. i teleport to a location and boom, my character is corrupted and i need to create a new one. until they fix this i will not recommend the game to anyone as it is incredibly unstable."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"cant play with friends, they get an error message 3215 i dont wanna play if i cant play with friends"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,friendship ended with pokemon especially nintendo  gamefreak. now palworld is my homie frfr no cap.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"i started this game thinking it was pokmon with guns. now i have a sweatshop full of pals mining ore 247 while i ride a flaming wolf into battle against a capitalist penguin mafia. at first, i felt bad making my little critters work. then i saw one of them refusing to sleep while hammering bullets for my assault rifle, and i knewi had built a family. a deeply exploited, unpaid family, but a family nonetheless. i gave a giant panda a minigun. it smiled. i dont know if it was happiness or fear. but it worked. one day, i raided an enemy base, stole their pals, forced them into my factory, then watched as their former owner stood outside my walls, helpless. thats when i realizedi was the villain all along. 1010. i need more materials. my pals need a union."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"an absolute masterpiece  726 hours in and still hooked! ive sunk 726 hours into palworld so far, and i can confidently say this is one of the most engaging and addictive survival games ive ever played. from the moment i jumped in, i was blown away by the vast open world, the deep basebuilding mechanics, and, of course, the incredible variety of pals that make every moment unique. the gameplay loop is perfectly balancedcapturing pals, exploring dungeons, farming resources, and defending your base never gets old. whether you're playing solo or with friends, there's always something new to do. and let's talk about the combatmixing traditional weapons with pals as both allies and tools of destruction creates an experience that's just pure fun. but what really sets palworld apart is the commitment from the developers at pocketpair. since launch, they've been incredibly active, pushing out updates, fixing issues, and listening to community feedback. its clear they care about making palworld the best it can be, and that level of dedication makes me even more excited for whats to come. if youre even remotely into survival, crafting, or creaturecollecting games, this is a mustplay. the sheer amount of content and the freedom to play how you want make it worth every second.  1010  worth every hour!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"why have pal slavery camp when you can have human slavery camp, you can also condense humans into one or just straight up butcher them."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"it's a more automated, less stressful, less risk version of ark with no pvp. most unofficial servers have terrible lag and the game gets kinda boring quick because there isn't as much to do. the risk is very low in this game and you never feel like you are about to lose it all. no dinos that will destroy your base and take everything you have, no high level wild dinos that will chase you till you die, and no people that will call you mean names because everyone is sensative and has there finger on the report button. if you only play on the weekends now and want a game that doesn't take every second of your day but played ark back in the day and want to relive some of that, this is a decent survival game. just sucks that talking  on video games is a thing of the past."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"just please stop breaking every single mod i have every tiny fucking update, and ill give a better thought review."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"premise is great. gameplay loop is solid. but i can't recommend it because it requires a weird and random amount of fixes and twiddles before it might be playable, and they won't work on your computer in particular yes, the one belonging to you, the reader. also, it's built on unoptimized unreal 5, and the gpus that can run that engine cost more than my car. when i finally got the game running, the early game grind became an early game grind. as in, to a halt. i was treated to a powerpoint slideshow of my character punching a tree to get crafting materials. with the graphical settings turned to minimum strain, i was essentially playing minecraft. slowly. also, the enemies did not move slowly, so i kept getting attacked by ninja sheep?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"neat game but it doesn't respect your time. endgame raids are obnoxiously overtuned and the core mechanic of getting stronger pals breeding is very boring. play through once but don't sweat the late game stuff, it feels like pocketpair were afraid people would run out of things to do so they set these insane milestones with late game bosses that one shot your entire base of rank 4 100 iv 60 soul pals. if you lose one of these fights, you've also lost a ton of resources you've accumalated for ammo so that's even more waiting. would not recommend this game is basically a phone game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,pals can't reach the object for work!! god damn annoying bug just fix this mf bug and i will give a positive review
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"i encountered an issue where the game screen goes black when i enter the game, and then it crashes back to the desktop. i have tried troubleshooting based on various sources and tried different fixes, but the problem still persists. my system specs are i713700hx and rtx4060."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,not playable in its current state. the last pat they introduced was a huge failure and should never allowed to happen. someone would be fired over this! its so embarrassing... the flying mobs are broken and sometimes you have to relog in order to get out of the flying mount. further more when you have to relog it often happens for me is that i spawn under the map... its crazy how people can be that incompetent!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"game crashes frequently for me, i have an intel i9 core and nvidia 3070 gpu, and i'm only trying to run the game at the standard graphics quility, i do not recommend this game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"absolutely horrid performance, with no ability to change resolution when fullscreen, no macpcxbox crossplay, no mac version available on steam only app store exclusive. don't get this game. just don't."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,there is no room to play all the worlds are at capacity i need my loot back
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"the game does not work. i have way above the required specs, have tried every online solution, reported the bugs for months on and after every update its the same thing. the game crashes on the character creation page when trying to create a game. it also crashes every time i try to join another game, sit waiting for it to load for ages then crash. let me actually play the game and i might change my review."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,the game sucks and has no content in some areas of the map and if you are reading this you are an idiot
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,love the creation and exploration of this game. can't wait for more updates.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,"pokemon but i can fking shoot people, i love this game but its still only the second open world pokemon rip off"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,games dumb fun and got many small details for the pals like modifiers and such to suit your needs and with the custom settings the game can be totally different and it will soon be getting crossplay
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,"i love making slave factories with a bonus of making them breed against there will to make their offspring also be my slaves...  910 but if bugs were fixed it would be perfect. and yes, i know the game is still in beta."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,"i have never found a game that lets me make slaves that work, fight and help me with things in a game. finally i can do that now. 1010"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,run around get blasted by pokimon get slaves make them build shit 1010 would reccomennd
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,great game. lots to love. cute creatures. still early access but plenty to enjoy as it is
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,dude this game is so fun and brutal at the same time i love it lol
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"great game, exploring the world is fun and rewarding! managing base is important in long run. your pals will help you with this auto farm so you don't have to keep doing some tedious resource collection and the base can be self sufficient if you manage it well. optimizing your pal collection is fun too! there are so many pals to collect with their unique abilities, animation, cute models, voice, skills and traits."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"palworld is a chaotic, glorious middle finger to nintendos pokmon, proving that a small team with a wild idea can outshine a juggernaut coasting on nostalgia. while pokmon plods along with turnbased battles and graphics that look like theyre stuck in 2005despite nintendos bottomless resources and decades to innovatepalworld delivers realtime combat, deep survival mechanics, and a vibrant open world that actually feels alive. youre not just collecting cute critters here youre arming them with guns, building bases, and laughing as your pals toil away like overworked interns. sure, the creature designs borrow heavily from pokmons playbook, but when the gameplays this addictive and the visuals this crisp, its hard to carenintendo had its chance to evolve, and instead, it gave us scarlet and violets glitchy mess. palworlds a fresh, irreverent triumph that leaves pokmon eating its dust, though its a bit light on story, lore, and worldcraftingbut for an early access gem, thats a nitpick we can happily ignore. lets hope the devs continue to improve the game in the future."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,"really addictive! i like this game. i really like it. i might keep playing it with every update launches for this game. i'm on fire for the final version, or the full release."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,"i wish the was a meh option instead of just thumbs up or down. the beginning is awesome. mid game is awesome. then you hit level 40ish and everything becomes a grind. i really hope they smooth end game out. right now, its a truly irritating grind fest locked behind base limitations and massive amount of endless breeding attempts. still fun, but in its current state, get it on sale."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,i love this game it the best to go and just lose yourself. very good game for people with adhd cause there is always something for when your brain wants to do 25 things at once.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,amazing it might be like ark and pokemon mixed but its awesome
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,i catch the man and make him perform labor i feed my friends their friends i run an oil farm and turn my friends parts into weapons a
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"despite this being early access, its amazing! this is literally the pokemon game ever has been waiting for and these guys executed it so well! nintendo can do one with their stupid lawsuit. just jealous because they couldnt be bothered to make what everyone had been asking for. excited to see what more is to come!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,more people should try this game out! such a satisfying gameplay loop
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,"love this game, ive put in so many hours from the launch date."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,this game one with the others. you could say this game is like pokemon on steroids or gta had zoos but overall this game is fun
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"its so much fun and a great starter game for learning pc controls for newer players, it is also very creative and allows for long game play"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"didnt expect to like this game but i was pleasantly surprised, lots of mechanics and exploration is so much fun"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"i'll be brief  this game is what pokmon games were always trying to be. nothing against nintendo, but this is bitheib definitive pokmon game. if you're unsure, download it from biratepay and try it for yourself. when you inevitably fall in love with this game, be a mensch and give the developers their due, though. nintendo shouldn't be suing palworld, they should be annexing it and updating their own franchise follow in palworld's footsteps. not even kidding. it really is, just ithati good."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"the players are so nice on the majority of the private servers. very helpful, and no griefing, i think its because it appeals to all ages ... kids teens, teenage grown ups"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,imagine if gamefreak was still capable of making a fun game and that you could shoot pikachu in the head. i look forward to seeing how this game looks like in 1.0.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,def a fun game to play and even put down and come back to
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"definitely enjoy the game its got a feel of you get a good streak of playing and the drop it to come back some time later. it's got some bugs, but overall not too bad for early access there's a lot to explore, do, levelup for to have some fun, maybe even with a couple of friends highly recommened, many laughs. i'd say overall so far, 7 outta 10 for me, but excited to see what is in store for this game in the future!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"yes!!! highly recommend this game! for an early access game, this graphics and quality are amazing!! i love all the pals in this game so much they all have such unique designs!! i also love how you can build in this game because i've been able to make some really cool builds in this game! another thing i like is how you can ride the pals to make travel much easier, that was a cool add. the fact that pals also have costumes too??? that's so adorable!!! all the areas in this game are highly detailed and there's so much to explore! i love the concept for this game so much! once i start playing it, i at least play it for a few hours each time because of how much there is to do in the game! please think about giving the game a try!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"hands down, one of the best games made to date. i look forward to the future development of this game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"guns, building, slavery, and guns! the game is fun unless you get stuck in terrain a lot then you can get annoyed. overall, a good game in my opinon."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"i know there's a lot of comparison of this game to another monster catching game, but it's really more similar to ark, tbh. your pals don't evolve, you explore a huge, beautiful map, you build bases, you craft items and tools, and you travel around collecting research notesjournal pagesgreen statues like easter eggs. it's nice. currently my favorite game. it's really very similar to ark if ark had cartoon like graphics, better progression, and better automation of resource gathering. it's a fantastic game. love it! once you get a base with pals, you can set them to gather resources for you so you don't have to do tedious mininglogging. this kept me playing where i would have stopped in other games. i don't have good patience if it's too repetitive. i do wish the blue prints you get were more helpful, but i think they're just random."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"if you like survival games with a touch of pkmn... youll love this game. i started playing when it first came to gamepass. i really havent stopped playing. once the big update came out, i played for 150 more hours. i also bought the game on ps5 and to the platinum trophy there too. its such a fun and satisfying game. and its still in early access. i highly recommend this game."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"needs a lot of optimization due to framerate going to 144 at dungeons and at feybreak and other more vibrant and lively areas otherwise 1010 i would recommend the developers to implement more indepth melee mechanics, as of now it is too shallow and only bullets and rockets are viable. i wish the pals would also utilize 3d movement as even the flying pals are on ground based tracking instead of flying straight to you to get you"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"frankly, i thought i was going to simply enjoy the gimmick of a arc meets pokemon for a bit and then get tired of it. i was wrong. my girlfriend and i are pretty much constantly playing this game whenever we have free time. it's surprisingly large and well made with a ton of variety with entertaining challenges. recommend highly."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"look, does it feel like a blatant rip off of another property or two? yeah man. that said, it's got decent building if you're into that sort of thing, the map is pretty fun to explore so far, the combat is fairly satisfying,  the flavor text is amusingly dark. i'm enjoying it!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"spoilers during the end of the review. this game is super cute, i love the pals and they give me joy in an otherwise empty life. for looter shooter enjoyers palworld may not be borderlands or warframe in terms of weapon and ability variety but it is really fun too, the pals give it some great variety instead. for more details the game starts lowkey but later on it becomes a really really fun resource management game, a simplified version of factorio but much more colorful, cute and in my personal opinion fun. highly recommended, 1010 game and also for people who tweak settings for maximum fps and or tweak settings in general. palworld is more gpu demanding at it's max settings than cpu, so i'd also suggest increasing your texture settings up to high and or epic if you can. the reason for this is easily visible if you have used glass for your base. it looks gorgeous! overall peak game 1010, for me one of my all time favorites up there with warframe, nioh 2, borderlands 3 and sekiro. spoilers ahead! small criticism ? don't know if you can really call it a criticism. the level 60 oil rig maximum level right now seems to be balanced for 4 people. the average enemy hp is around 50k. and the boss has 1.3mln. it's doable solo in vanilla without changing world settings but it requires a lot of resources. nonetheless if you are playing solo you can always tweak world settings but even if you don't condensed gobfins and mamorest curry will become your friends  can't wait for future updates!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"love the ability to build my own base and be as creative as i want. love the idea of having your farmbase essentially run itself with the pals that you catch on your journey. honestly, the whole game is a really well thought out idea that takes aspects of various monster hunter type games, and adds more than just fighting with those monsters. you actually feel a bond with your pals."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"not played much. it seems really cool, a lot of mechanics to learn right away and not much tutorial so slow going but enjoying everything about it. the world is stunningly beautiful, the creatures are cute and fun, and it is like minecraft meets pokemon meets skyrim."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"a bit buggy, however it's really impressive how engaging this game is. the survival aspect is pretty minimal as this game is about automation so grinding for resources isn't all that bad. going out and exploring is great. there is plenty to find between dungeons, pals, eggs, and other resources used to upgrade your pals and yourself. i'm really interested in what is in store for future updates as the roadmap looks very promising."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed palword! the game perfectly combines survival mechanics with a pokelike vibe, making it immersive and fun. the gun dynamics were especially unexpectedi usually dont enjoy shooters, but they fit really well within the games survival context and added an exciting twist. playing with a friend takes the experience to the next level, making everything more enjoyable and engaging. whether you're exploring, battling, or gathering resources, it's a great time with a friend by your side. overall, palword is a fantastic game id highly recommend!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,technically pokemon clones but honestly it's fun so who cares get off your high horse 3
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"there's something so wonderful about finding the cutest sweetest little round chicken thing. he skips up to you with boundless curiosity, with eyes full of childlike wonder and a certain existential fear that suggests he has visited the halls of god and heard nothing but his own mournful heartbeat echoing in the endless expanse. and then you beat him senseless with a stick. 1010"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,"palworld  pokmon with guns and a few growing pains palworld is as wild as it soundscatch adorable pals, have them fight, work, and yes, even wield firearms. its an openworld survival game that mixes creature collecting with basebuilding, crafting, and chaotic battles. the concept is brilliant, and the freedom to use pals however you want is both hilarious and surprisingly deep. but while the foundation is strong, the game still feels rough around the edges. ai can be janky, progression gets grindy, and the world, while huge, can feel a little empty at times. its fun, addictive, and full of potential, but it needs more polish to truly shine. still, if you love survival games and dont mind some earlyaccess jank, its worth a shotjust maybe wait for more updates.  final verdict 710, a fun but flawed creaturecatching chaos."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,i have 134 hours in this game on multiple worlds and still have not caught every pal or seen the whole game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,very fun and creative game reminds me of both pokemon and minecraft

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"superior in every way to recent pokemon games, minus the nostalgia that pokemon offers. to be fair, pokemon offers turnbased strategy, but as far as open world exploration, capturing, combat, innovation, and much more... this is a much better experience"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,easy to glitch but so fun if you play humens that are captuird are halairios
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"a chaotic mix of survival, basebuilding, and monster collecting, if you ever wanted to give pikachu an ak47, this is your game. funny how a small studio made palworld while nintendo sits on pokmons stagnant formula. maybe competition will finally push them to innovate."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,very fun to catch and kill pals but also level up and explore
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"i hesitate to say yes as this is the same company that has left craftopia in a state of incomplete garbage. there are okay parts and parts that are just too stupid to understand. still it is amusing and has a more real feel to how pals are used vs pokemon... anyway, if it is not too expensive this can be a pretty fun game. note that they say this is early access, but this is one of those companies that uses that as a means of avoiding accountability for its actions look at craftopia. never assume this game will be fully supported and there will always be more issues than solutions given this companies track record. expect that soon they will have another early access game and this one too will be given a minimal team and put on the back burner forever a early access just like craftopia and other titles..."

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"amazing pokemonlike game, but too big for one player i guess"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,addicting gameplay when leveling up your base and pals. summoned boss destroyed my whole base though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"overall i do like palworld and hope it survives nintendo suing the the living heck out of it. the good  the world is fun and pretty big with lots to explore and reasons to explore.  the game is beautiful and the cartoony pals are a nice counter balance to the more realistic anime style of the characters  character progression is nice and there are tons of skills to buy... and skill points to buy them  the various way to upgrade everything is cool  crafting is good the mid  the world is a set piece, but this is mitigated by size  could use better hooks to encourage capture and breeding of pals  adorable clockfighting  ability to manage chests is awesome but held back by wonky design choices the not so good  your character is server locked  the pals are the star of your combat not you  keyboard mapping is terrible overall i enjoy palworld. i am not sure how much fun it is solo, but multiplayer is a riot. if you and a few friends are looking for a game that is one part valheim, one part enshrouded and three parts pok3mon... this is the game for you. even if you dont dig pok3mon like me you'll enjoy it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"surprisingly a good game, would 100 recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a goofy yet good survival game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"gather resources. or catch creatures or fly around and explore or build and arrange things this game really has something for everyone. the first person shooter is when the raids happen in the middle of the night, and you're on the wrong side of the continent to get back and help in time!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,shooting animals and destroying the local ecosystem has never been so much fun.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"very cool and original world and game i like collecting all the pals with my pals still feels early access a year later but has come a long way, not bad investment of time plz add motorcycle and let us drive it in space"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,so much more than catching cute animals. there is a mystery to discover o
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"by the time you realize you're not having fun waiting for your nth ingot to smelt, it's long past refund applicability. you push yourself further, maybe just over this hill i'll find a pal i really like instead of some cheap fake off some forum in years gone by? all you find are the same copy paste unity assets you feel like you've seen dozens of hundreds of times and loot that sucks compared to stuff you've made. just one more ingot and i can smelt them slightly faster, maybe... has my research progressed enough to make it a little quicker? my weapon sucks, but the others are so excessive and expensive just to keep loaded... just... don't. after the initial shock wears off, you have a shallow halfbaked survival game clone that was coasting on said shock of a joke we've heard a thousand thousand times over."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"steam asks me if i suggest others to buy the game, the answer is nes, meaning yes and no. this is basically a mix between pokemon and ark, but while i like the things it takes from pokemon, it does poorly from the ark side. first of all, the world is not immersive. i'm not talking about the graphics but about everything else. pals rarely attack you, there is no sense of survival in this game, unless you try to fight stronger pals bosses. in ark, wherever you go is basically a struggle, you risk getting attacked by everything, which i feel should be something present even in palworld. second the number of crafting items is very limited. i'm not talking about the items you craft, but the materials. there are few of them, which are used to build multiple things. even the mining is pretty standard since you have to get either stones or metal. the ai is also pretty weird, the enemies sometime gets stuck, or just stare at you. something i didn't like is the base limit area. i had to build two rather large buildings, but i basically ended up all the space i had available, and was forced to choose between the two of them. there are also bugs. i wanted to build stuff inside the house i made, but if i did so with things the pals had to use, i simply decided to build it in the open, because the pals can't enter your house autonomously. you must summon them if you want to do it. for example, i had to smelt some metal, and placed the crucible inside a building. no pals managed to come inside, i had to summon them there. besides, why can i only bring 5 pals with me? and even if i could bring more, why just one at a time? the only pal i can have more at the same time is that dreamwhatever i don't remember the name, which through some collars can follow you. but it doesn't make sense. i mean, i get you wanted to get something similar to pokemon, but at least allow me to use 5 pals at the same time. now, this doesn't mean its a bad game, quite the opposite, but i still think that if you have to choose between palworld and ark, the latter always win. for me, it was mostly the fact that in ark you have to survive, you get attacked by dinos, and your life is everything but assured. here instead its pretty easy to avoid everything, and even if you don't try, pals won't attack you, and either humans, unless you get literally in front of them. so yes, buy the game, but a couple years from here, because its clear the game still needs a lot of work."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,i loved everything about the game and i am leveling up so much great game
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,very good game!!! 1.catch a pal 2.use pal to make tools and catch other pals 3.fight humens with pals and guns!!!!! awsome!!!!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,great game. needs work but so far so good.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,one of those games that feels like it'll always be there for you when you want to come back and just hang out. for an early access game there's so much to do. even better with friends
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,i adore this game. it has nearly everything that we've been asking for from pokemon for years and it's just a silly blast.gt
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"yeah, this game has sort of been a happy place for me as of late and has helped inspire my own creativity. i'm gonna keep playing it, great game even for early access."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,thought this game was guns mixed with pokemon. havent seen a gun and four hours in.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"the game is really good, over all a great game awesome with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,waited for years for a game like this to come out! even though its not exactly the same franchise i was hoping for i have been having the time of my life be the very best pal trainer like no one ever was!!!!!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"h1very good game, not a pokemon with guns game h1 so, i will just cut to the chase. this game 100 is a survival and base builder type game. if you're looking to play pokemon on pc, i would say this game very easily distinguishes itself from anything resembling the the nintendo pokemon games. my primary focus when playing is to build a optimally automated base and catch the best pals to accomplish this goal. i actually have very little focus on 'catching them all' or battling it out with other 'trainer's or boss pals. this has consumed 30 hours of my game time so far. i highly recommend giving this game a good 30 hour shot. drawbacks bugs, graphical problems, and pathing problems with your pals. the more you play, the more you look forward to the next patch hoping it fixes the issues you've discovered. all in all, this game will not be a waste of your time! enjoy!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,"honestly, i'm shocked pocketpair has committed to the bit as well as they did, given who they were parodying. building is basic and lacks a lot of options, at least on vanilla. the new island more like continent brings some extra challenge to the game. most importantly, it did what it said it'd do on the tin i got to run a work camp forcing monsters to assemble munitions for my ceaseless war on the other factions."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,dear palworld programmers i love your game and have a lot of fun with it but can you plaz make roof corners and either picet fences of railings like the ones that are on some stairs id be super happy .
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,this game is super addicting. if you have 2 decent pcs its a blast to play with friends
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,really good game when played in multiplayer mode with a friend... same cannot be said for single player though since it might get hectic and boring doing everything on your own.. so if you got a group or even 1 friend.. go for it
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"i hate pokemon. it was always one of those things that i couldn't get into or understand growing up. all my friends enjoyed it and talk about it and i get the gist of it i just couldn't stand it. honestly i don't think i'd ever enjoy pokemonlike games. this game is totally different! guns, economy, base building, monsters. this games a blast! the only weak spot i feel is the bases always feel kind of meh to me. the pal's don't have good pathing yet and that makes base biulding designed for their pathing instead of your enjoyment. still i'd give this game high marks. well done."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"enslaved a human and made it run on an exercise wheel to generate power, he didnt generate that much but it felt good"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"pretty poorly made game, when you put it next to a really well made survival game like soulmask. it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the player experience when making this game, only the money. literally the only thing interesting about this game is that it's a pokemon ripoff."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"awful game breaking bugs i have less than 7 hours in the game and have ran into countless bugs at this point, its one things if they dont mess with the actual gameplay alot, but when entire stacks of items are vanishing into thin air, multiple times in just a 30 minute span, for my entire playthrough, on an already tedious painful grinding game... it feels pointless to play or even want to play or progress because, what items are going to randomly be deleted just from trying to use them or pick them up. granted this issue has only been happening on a multiplayer world, a world with 2 people when they claim they can handle up to 16.... but the game is not that fun for me to play completely by myself, just because the game cant handle literally one base at a time and two people... and it wants to claim it can handle over a dozen with multiple bases around the map... this just feels like netcode issues and its why im mentioning the player numbers and base numbers, how can i even try to enjoy the game when at any point, any random piece of my inventory can just vanish.."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"good game, crashed after i played one week, i updated my stuff, and reinstalled the game. it keeps insta crashes"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,multiplayer is badly implemented with no cross save features. game itself is pretty lackluster and has far less depth than the games it's copying from. would have refunded if i could but took more than the 2 hours to see what was missing form the game.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"at first the game is very interesting, fun to run around and catch pals, upgrade your base and stuff, but gets boring really quickly, the more you play it the more you realize that this is just pokemon but american, there's barely anything to do after a little while of playtime, the world feels really plain and repetitive, so do pals, as you'll see that most of them resemble pokemon quite a lot. i do play a very similar game sometimes, satisfactory, but that game manages to keep itself entertaining with the graphics and a huge world to explore, even if there aren't lots of creatures there, palworld, on the other hand, has a very ctrlc ctrlv type world and creatures. you can buy this game for a few minutes of entertainment, then refund it when you get bored. not worth the money in my opinion."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,i never thought i would enjoy shooting a penguin from a rocket launcher until i played palword.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,nice game! beautifully designed. nice background. a wholesome entertainment game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,i like the game very much and love that you can go travel over a big map and play with other players but i would like more frequent updates so i can keep playing and it doesn't become boring over time but over all really good game.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"game is great for about 1st few hours , as you progress further into the game you start getting more and more pals , but boss fights are complete bs  they can hit you through wall so no way to hide from any of their attack , you are as slow as you can get  , as soon as you leave your base or log out your pals stop working or working half speed , they become depressed and to get them back to happiness it is a costly af . when its get dark in this game you will not see nothing , even with max brightness in settings it is complete darkness . crafting takes forever  i mean 25sec to craft 3 arrows  and gets even longer the higher level you are , example to craft a 500 ingots it will take approximately 200h if you are logged in , however if you are not probably twice as that or might not be done at all . building is a complete mess , everything you build is overlapping with everything  if you have ocd i feel sorry for you  , when you die you lose completely everything apart from your pals so if you died at the edge of the map , you have to run all they way there to pick it up it . as a solo player it is extremely hard game as you will die all the time . tons of bugs which it seems never had been fixed since start . overall  it is a fun to play game for first few levels but than it becomes a joke as more and more bugs and glitches appear , but at this time i can't recommend this game to anyone , game had some updates but nothing ground breaking to convince me to change my review ."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-23,"ive been playing palworld for a couple of days, and while i enjoy some aspects of it, i just cant recommend it. there are too many frustrating mechanics that make the experience more tedious than fun. first, setting up a base is a major hassle. the game doesnt give you much guidance on where to build, so you might pick a location that seems fineonly to realize later that its too small. as you progress, youre expected to capture over 40 pals and construct many things that will be placed on the base as well, which quickly eats up space. when you finally realize your base is too cramped, theres no simple way to move objects. instead, you have to completely disassemble everything. and if youre carrying too much weight, you move painfully slow, making the process even more frustrating. you can build a second base, but theres no continuity between them. items stored in one base arent accessible from the other, meaning you have to gather and craft materials all over again. this makes expanding feel like a chore rather than a natural progression. another issue is that certain structures, like ruins and castle debris, cant be removed or built over. if you unknowingly set up a base near these, they permanently take up valuable space. finally, crafting and object placement feel clunky. if you place something incorrectly, you cant simply move ityou have to destroy and rebuild it. plus, when dismantling storage, items often get dumped into your backpack, overloading you and slowing you down. it just gets frustrating, and then you don't play anymore. thankfully, palworld is still in early access, so these issues can be improved over time. but for now, i just cant recommend it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,why just why the hell you give a option to kill your pal why i just missed click it while playing with pal f you developer game is fun to play but f you developer
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"it's everything we needed in a game. shooter looter, adventure, pve, and it's all at your own pace."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"for all of the controversy surrounding its development, the game itself is weirdly safe. a single original idea surrounded by a hodgepodge of systems that do nothing to complement it, with no risks taken in design philosophy beyond a potential lawsuit. the very definition of a soulless experience."

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"i like the freedom to set buildings down wherever i want, and since the pathing fixes i've had a lot less trouble with pals getting stuck on rocks and passing out. i do wish i had either more bases or more space in each base. or for example a main base where i can fit all my production buildings plus then maybe a second one for building myself a mansion, and then i'd be fine with tiny numerous little outposts where i basically just have space for chests and exchanging pals. and i would hope the tiny outposts still act as teleport points. anyways i like the customization, the extensive tech tree, chasing pals while i miss all my shots, hoarding resources, and filling out my pal encyclopedia."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"its completely inhuman how they treat these pals. you beat them, you prison them, you exploit them, you work them to oblivion. yet you don't even have option to release them, instead, you can dismember them??!! sell them to dark merchants who probably dismember them too??"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,it is kind of boring alone but all in all a fun game.

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"i just want to say that i like the game, my daughter also likes it just to explore and catch pals, buttttttt!! man, please do a quality of life update, i literally spend more time trying to transfer resources and switch bases than exploring and hunting. one of my complains is there should be a way of bases being insync with each other meaning if you have resources on say base 1 and you are on base 2 and you need a stone you shouldn't have to gather stone for base 2 to build there, the stones mined on base 1 should be accessible for base 2 to use. you don't have to switch bases in order to get the stone and teleport again. its exhausting. please lets not waste time, its a great game but should focus on what the games objective is."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-28,"i'll be short. if nintendo is trying to find excuses and create patents and unleash their legion of lawyers against pocketpair, is because pocketpair has achieved something incredible. nintendo and gamefreak have been sitting on their laurels doing nothing for 20 years and nothing they release comes remotely close to this. take this from an old school pokemon fan comparing pokemon and palworld is an insult, palworld is just much more, much better. and this for the devs stay strong! stay focused! keep going! the community has your back!"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"this is the open work creature capture game gamefreak didn't have the courage or vision to make. i've played for countless hours with friends on a dedicated server because there are sizable new updates and many different ways to play the game. if you enjoy survival games or pokemon or anything in between, this game is for you."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,love enslaving the entire population of pals and humans to manual labour and unethical suicide fighting
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,"a promising but shallow basebuilding, stat mastering, grinding collectathon sadly ruined by heavily imitative game design and a vile community. every steam post is swarmed with antihuman rights and nintendo lawsuit messages. imagine if breath of the wild, ark and pokemon had a very homophobic child."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"yet another pve open world survival crafting adventure sandbox rpg soulslike action early access automation looter shooter hack and slash puzzle thirdperson shooter 3d indie game. the concept is nice, but everything else i've seen done better in other titles."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"have this on windows, but i will not recommend any game that does not run well on linux. many claim to have no issues, many more can not even get it to run, for me it runs slowly and after many tries i feel i will have to refund the second copy, planned on playing it with my children."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"in the pokemon games, they cook pokemon. so butchering my pals doesn't seem so bad so bad."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,this game is one of those games that got popular in the first 2 months then fell off. but this is still a good game in 2025. side note also why is this game still in beta after a year?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,it is not slavery they are geting paid in food and housing
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,fairly decent game. deciding to ship the mac version exclusively on the mac app store instead of making it available to existing users is a little anti consumer though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"so i bought this today on the steam sale after waiting for quite some time for the game to reach a price i found acceptable. i spent 90 of the 96 min i've played trying to find any information in game on how to make cloth. found zero explanation. had to finally close the game down to google the answer. the game should be called clothworld because apparently making cloth on an industrial scale is a huge deal in this game. not exactly the pinnacle of fun when a material is more of a focus than the games literal title. most survival games use fiber early game to make cloth to make basic armor, and the more advanced materials to make better armor. but its not so complicated that you have to leave the game to find the answer. specially the items you are asked to make in the freaking tutorial. i'm not going to get a refund because its early access, and they could fix such a blatant time waste of a mechanic. but i can't honestly say i will be returning to the game after wasting my time, on a seriously unnecessary mechanic to make basic gear in the tutorial, when i could be using my time playing something actually fun. so as it stands i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who values their time."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,this game gets better with every update. love it.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,me go fast on jetragon. vroom vroom across map. i can show you the world.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"thank you palworld, i have zero regret buying this game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"been plagued with the uepal crash error for over a year now. tried every fix out there and thought i had it beat finally, since i got to play for a few hours yesterday without a crash. today it is crashing constantly again. can't play at all. can't even stay on the game long enough to change any settings. all of the posts i read about other people having this issue are over a year old and i don't see anywhere where the creators have actually addressed it. this happens across multiple pcs for me and for others apparently and is the only game i have that does this. all of the stuff on my end is up to date, i have a clean install, i don't use mods, and i don't play multiplayer... i really enjoy the game, but the fact that i can't actually play it 99 of the time is a big negative. especially since the only help i have found came from youtube and the fix only lasted a day. c.c plus i have to completely wipe existing worlds to temporarily fix the crashing issue, so what little i get to play before it starts up again is basically the same few areas over and over again. edit after several attempts i managed to change the settings before it crashed and now it is working for the time being. yesterday i had to take it out of windowed mode to get it to work. today i had to put it back.  see how long it lasts this time..."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,i captured and butcherd someone 1010 laggy on my device tho doesnt matter tho you prolly got a better one
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,very nice for an open world craftsurvival game maybe in my top 5
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,"lacks polish, but not as much as every new pokemon game. is fun."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,got to shot a flower dino in the face with a exploding penguin. i thought there would be more blood but i was clearly wrong. 910
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,can be a little bit janky here and there but it is a wonderful mashup of what is great about pokemon and zelda breath of the wild.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,very fun game had me on for hours even though i thought i wouldnt like it fun to play with friends aswell
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"pretty fun. if you like ark, then you will probably like this. if you don't like ark because of the annoying things then you might like this because it has a lot of quality of life changes that make it much more enjoyable. if you don't like the concept at all then i don't think this is worth a try."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,"play with friends, it'll be much more fun!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,this is an epic survival game with cool monsters  an interesting story.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,a game where you can collect your own pets that have specials powers that live in your own custom base? yes please!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-06,"think pokemon, but with guns, capturing people, working in the mines, and tomfoolery"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,has a lot of bugs and cant seem to get into my multiplayer without a huge hassle!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-03,"all the pokkemon ripoff and all that tiresome blablabla aside i mean who cares... really? well nintendo obviously, but for you as a gamer.. who cares? we want a fun game worth out money yes? which is hard these days with crap aaa devs and hit n run ea's is palworld one of those games,,worth the money and time? i have to say yes, since i love basebuilding, goals to pursue and leveling up unlocking new fun stuff. if you do not like these things, palworld may not be for you. at 168h typing this i'm still not max lv and only started to really get in to minmaxing my pals, so i guess i got a few hours left to enjoy. bugs? seen no gamebreaking bugs, pal pathing in bases without an open solution can sometimes make them stuck and reset. besides that i'm having a pretty smooth ride. the mapworld is beautiful and large enough to feel lika an interesting openworld with freedom to explore biomes with a lot of variation. i can go on but i really only wanted to type a few words and get my thumbs up. imho  it's a fun game, lots to do and a smooth ride and thats all i care about, and i recommend it based on that. taste is subjective and should not be reviewed"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"i really love this game, but i need cross play i only have one friend but he plays on xbox i wish we could play."

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,a bundle of fun. it dont matter what your play style is. this game is for you
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,"i played this on xbox one because my laptop is too low end for a game of this scale but it was amazing! if you like pokemon, play this. if you like industrialisation, play this. either way, play this!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,its better the any capture creature game i've played... including pok mon... there i said it... hands down better!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-21,this game is great. i have not had crash issues. i have seen some bug issues while crafting items. like today ingots did not show up when they were crafted but i was able to craft the saddle. i also noticed when i crafted arrows it did not give the proper amount it gave much less.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,"just another stupid game. screen gfx gets so dark you can't see anything! no indication on screen about what resource you have the mouse over and some of them look very similar to each other, plus using a tool to gather the resource with make the tool less usable. flying along and suddenly with no warning at all, you are defeated. no messages about anything at all. just the defeated screen. wtf!!! level 40  grind! your pals will devote 100 of their time to being sick or worse! it is a world exploration type game, but the is no mini map. you will be constantly bringing up the main map, just to ensure you are still going in the right direction! inventory as usual is too small and no way to expand it. also it really needs a deposit all and withdraw all functionality. also how about a deposit same function as well. where if there is anything already in a chest, you use this to automatically deposit any items that are the same! almost everything requires ingots or bloody cake, which sucks, as you will never have enough!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,"its been released for 1 year and its still ea. its worth maybe 510  at most.  animations are really bad doesnt matter where, its choppy and its gliding.  the fighting between pals is boring  the fighting in general is boring  building is barebones and super boring, pals getting stuck eveywhere and start working in place  ocd on many things  buggy landscapes  buggy mechanics  sound design is i rolled my face over keyboard  i dont like it  technology and blueprints sucks ass  wow ye olde bow   2085  the grind is boring  rpg elements are slapped on not intended for the game  the dungeons are boring and empty and samey the trailer should be considered false advertisement."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-11,"it was ported to macos, and selling now in mac app store, but why you want to sell me this game twice, even if i purchased it?"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,so this game has been out for a year and i can't pick a male character and hear my footsteps? interesting..
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,"i refused to pay money for a rip off game of pokemon. however my friend bought this for me because she wanted me to play and since i wasn't paying money i decided why not, she looks happy about it. damn do i wish i played sooner. i work six days a week from 10pm to 630 am and when i tell you i have ignored sleeping to play this game i mean it. i get home in the morning and will play way past when i know i should be asleep. worst part about it is i have yet again fallen for the trope of i hate this and will never play itplays it and obsesses over it this is like one piece all over again and it was the same friend who got me into this game"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,"war crimes x pokemon x ark if you like enslavement, genocide, and torturing animals under harsh work conditions. you can even cut them up to get more loot! then this is the game for you."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,"really fun game, i enjoy ever bit of it. can't wait what's more to come."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-22,"i can't explain why i like this game, but i like pokemon. so uh, yeah good game 10 lamballs out of 5 bushi's"

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,very good can make them work for me
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,"i'll work on this later, its a good game and definitely worth the"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,its awesome! if you love ark and pokemon its basically like the most insane combo of the two.
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"i never posted a review when i played this game, but i was really glad to support an indie game developer. it was a lot of fun!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,"would recommend if you like pokemon and guns, you get an open world third person play through on multiple islands and can level up and get new things throughout, as well as getting pals and people to be in your party."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,"here because i wanted to see if pokemon ahh rpg game is worth it or not, after 1 year of not playing because i need to fix my monitor screen because how demanding the games are."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"what we expected from pokemon for years now, the guns are a meme but somehow fit in the game. thank you pocketpair and fck the big ncompany"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-12,if you like enslaving little monsters like when you were a kid on your gameboy then this game is for you!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,"it's like zelda botw mixed with stardew, mixed with pokemon. i can't stop playing. it's the right mix of action and coziness."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,a good hearted sandbox game quality choice great overall.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,this game is more fun than modern pokemon games imo

Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,i love how i can work towards the goals in my own time and the world feels massive and immersive.

Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"gotta love crossplatform dude. too many of my friends are stuck on console, so this is a big deal for me."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,this is best game i download and i dont know what time that but i know i played this game like 16hrs litrelly
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,have you ever wanted to ride an animal that shoots heat seeking missiles? have you ever wanted to turn the pal with the funniest name into the ultimate life form?
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,this is my favorite game. this is my first game which i have purchased for the first time.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-02,"this is one of the best games i have played in a while. if your looking for a game to spend your time on, try palword"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,pokemon meets a watered down ark. sounds like a bad thing....it's not. very very good game
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,large open world. easy to connect and play with friends.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,guns  pokemon  enslavery  fun game
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,game is amazing love it... once you get started its hard to get off. i played the game pass version but it wasn't cross play yet so i lost all my progress but with a little help from my friend were back in action.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,creature collector but with guns and slavery. 1010
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-16,"awesome, already very good and enjoyable game !!"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-13,im gonna lied this game is the most fun i have when farming a got kill by the boss and get kill by 20 gobfin come to me
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"peak gaming, it just needs some pokemon mods"
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-24,i feel like i payed less for the amount of entertainment i got in this game. 1010
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,its super fun but make sure you bump up some of the game settings unless you want a challenge
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,this is prob my favorite game ever. the devs listen and help and the game play is so good
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,one of the best in the open world survival craft genre despite the goofy premise
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-20,most entertaining and fun game i've played in weeks. definitely worth
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-21,glad we finally got ark 2. not sure how to catch a shiny vin diesel yet though.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-18,"sure the game looks like pokemon, but it plays like ark."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-14,vitun paska ei oo optimaalinen
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,thia is nice game and give best survival experience
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,great game prefect for unwinding after a workday.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"it's clearly unpolished and early access game, i really tried, but base scale and building is terrible, you capture pals left and right, no sense or point in any of it, you can play this game with your eyes closed and capture hundreds of pals. most of the content is just meaningless at this point. wait for deep deep sale if you really feel the itch, but honestly it's just a bunch of busy work"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-17,"it's an incredibly midtier game. lots of borrowed good ideas with a very rough implementation, but enough there to get it to a stage where you can see what they want to do pokemon in botw, hold the ethics. not many games you can ride a boar while a squirrel on your shoulder lets loose with an uzi. movement and exploration is pretty strong. the biggest let down for me is that pal pathfinding is pretty much nonexistent for navigating a base, particularly inside a building. absolutely crushes any ambitious base building."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,its a great game very fun and enjoyable to catch and fight with pals
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,this game is fun and a good family game.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-08,ery nioce game just dont under astimet maurest
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-07,i honestly enjoy this more than anything gamefreak put out in the last 4 years
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-04,a while to get used to but ultimately fun
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,i love lamball palworld is the exploration pokemon type game ive always wants and guns 1210 but i need that ending
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-26,"its amazing, i thought it would just be a funny haha pokemon with guns but its a really in depth game and i'm not ashamed to admit i iost a week of my life playing it after i bought it."
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-25,"so my best friend and i decided to play this one day when we were bored. we figured we would give it a try. well, trying became almost 300 hours. the game is a lot of fun. there is always something to do. the progression from low level pal master to the highest level is a lot of fun. even when you believe you hit the peak, you still have other challenges that need to be conquered. we are currently working on killing all the bosses on hard mode and learning it is a bit tougher then we thought. we still need to kill another two raid bosses too. highly recommend to anyone, it is not hard to understand or play, but there is another layer of mastery that comes later."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,super cute pal designs and love the decor building options!!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"shits pretty gas if you like minecraft, ark, rust typa games."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,"it's like pokemon, but with cooler pals and guns. oh, and they're essentially your slaves. this game is excellent. there's so much to do, and i feel like i've barely scraped the surface. since there's so much to do, you get sidetracked in a good way. def recommend."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-10,"super cute, lots of things to do. funnest when you can play with friends."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-05,200 hours in and i have already committed more war crimes compared to japan and germany during wwii combined.
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,you can give them rocket launchers which is cool
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-01,start the game by beating up cats with your bare fists
Survival,Palworld,2025-02-27,"awesome take on the survivalcraft genre, with a pokemon twist that feels original and fun."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-19,"if this game had nintendo's funding, this game would be unstoppable"
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-09,i absolutely love this game! catch pokemon and make them work and fight. awesome!
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-20,"really like this game, can't wait to see more of the game as it develops."
Survival,Palworld,2025-03-15,"this game, is awesome. i can tell you i gonna spend a lot of time in this!"
