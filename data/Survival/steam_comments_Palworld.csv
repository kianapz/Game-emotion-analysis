"At first its a fun and silly game. Your enjoying catching pals and progressing. 

Then one day you stop and look at what you have done. Multiple slave camps with innocent pals being forced to work for you. Mining camps, Factories, Farms and breeding camps. Your a monster!",True,85,47,2025-02-07 09:14:46
"Palworld is the 3D open-world creature collector game that Nintendo never managed to make, and it absolutely delivers on the fun. The world design is great, the Pals are all unique and interesting, and the mix of exploration, crafting, and combat keeps things fresh. Capturing and using Pals for base building and survival adds a new level of depth that other games in the genre are missing. The game really sucked me in, I played nonstop, just wanting to catch more Pals, build bigger bases, and explore every part of the map.

That said, the game still needs work, there’s no real story to tie everything together, and the balancing can feel off at times. Some Pals and weapons feel way too strong, while others feel useless. But despite that, Palworld is already a blast, and with some updates, it has the potential to be one of the best creature-collecting games out there. If you love open-world survival games and always wished Pokémon had more depth (and guns), this is definitely worth playing.",True,25,1,2025-01-29 20:19:22
"This is the adult version of Pokemon we all wanted for years. Screw Ninento and their lawsuit trying to stop a game that is objectively better than anything they have put out in over a decade. I can't wait for the full release of Palworld either, the early access is so much fun already and every big patch i am loving",True,11,1,2025-02-21 22:17:43
"Absolutely love this game, and unfortunately love pokemon as well. So to describe my love of this game, I have to say, if gamefreak manages to screw this game and studio over like they are working to do, i'm done with nintendo. I miss the idea of healthy competition rather than just creating legal nightmares for your competition if you're bigger than them.",True,5,0,2025-02-24 17:43:37
"So first I was on the fence about spending the 28€ for the game in case it gets taken down by nint3ndo soon. But after playing a ""demo"" version of the game I could not putting my steam deck down anymore and went ahead to purchase it on steam. Well Steam says I played 96 hours and it certainly feels like around 5. I am kind of addicted to the game and can only recommend others to play this absolute banger of a game. It combines so many aspects of different games and makes all the ticks for a game I love. It does everything better than pok3mon and adds even more depth with building a base and random events. I really hope it gets released completely at some point and will survive any lawsuits (tbh some pals are a blant copy...)

5/5 - can recommend and if you like pok3mon but with more things to explore and do - this will be giving you many hours of joy",True,10,0,2025-02-15 16:00:58
"I will start off by saying, my friend has set up a multiplayer game as its own dedicated server, so it is always up, and these are my findings as of ~350 hours of gameplay.

PROS
- The pals have nice designs.
- No connectivity issues.
- The progression mechanics do a good job of not letting you progress too fast, but you still feel like everything you do is progress.
- The map is fun to explore solo or with friends and there's a decent number of secrets and collectibles that actually help you along the way, not just collecting for collectings sake.
- The tower bosses are a good challenge.
- Breeding mechanics are fun to play with and breeding pals to get the best passive skills is not an insane grind, although you will grind for it.

CONS
- Building is ass. Everything overlaps with everything, meaning you can't place anything really anywhere. They've created really cool environment structures that would be amazing to tuck a base into, but you can't overlap with the ground or environment walls, so you're stuck building in open fields.
- Bases are still completely broken. If you leave your base, your pals stop working, stop eating, and will starve and depress themselves, making them works half speed, and costing you insane amounts of resources and time to get them back up to speed, only for them to essentially self-destruct as soon as you leave again.
- To piggy back on that point, once you get to a higher level, around 50-55, it can take literal real life DAYS to craft enough of some of the materials you need, meaning as soon as you log off, or leave your base, that stuff stops being made, so I'm currently waiting in my base, typing a review so that my pals (who are 132 hours into making 1000 pal metal ingots, and 300 plasteel ingots, and are still a few hundred away from being done) will continue to work so I can actually make balls (which will probably take a month) to catch the legendary pals.

FINAL RATING
I would give this game from levels 1-45 an 8/10. That being said with the ridiculousness that is the higher levels, and all the issues with bases, my total final ranking would have to be about a 3/10. If bases get fixed to where late game isn't just a waiting simulator, then I will adjust my rating. But as of now, the game isn't worth playing after a certain level, which kills the fun of the endgame.",False,26,1,2025-02-06 19:43:56
"I love this game. My only issue is if you have to start all over on a new server to play with someone, why can’t all multiplayers build up on the same base with everyone else? Like
A Village type of deal. Camping areas should be a bigger area of space depending the number of people in the server.",True,1,0,2025-02-27 05:44:05
This game combines Pokémon and Ark and those are two games I love. So this game is good,True,1,0,2025-02-25 00:27:42
"This game is the definition of perfect. İt's replayability is insane, İ almost made about 16 worlds and im still not bored. İt's been worth every second. İm in love with this game and i recommend it. İt's worth every single dollar.",True,1,0,2025-01-29 21:28:42
"It is still a bit buggy, and I wish the bases were larger.. But it's the ArkSurvival + Monster Tamer game I've come across in a long while.",True,1,0,2025-01-28 16:17:47
"Pocketpair's historically crazy stances aside, the game itself is pretty solid. I enjoy it more than I have the last 3 generations of Pokemon games at least. Despite what Nintendo is trying to say in court, Palworld innovates on some of the core concepts of Pokemon in fun new ways that we'd never get to see from Nintendo. That being said this game has about as much in common with Scarlet and Violet as Unreal Tournament has to do with Overwatch. Is there some common DNA and some common gameplay between the two? Absolutely, but no sane person would ever put UT and OW in the same category.

I have a lot of fun with it, but nowhere near as much fun as my wife does.",True,1,0,2025-02-21 15:55:32

"I really want to like this game, the gameplay and base building are so fun and I love all the Pals so much. But it crashes far too often, even at low settings on a newer PC, which really shouldn't be happening. I think I have had it for almost a year, but the crashes stopped me from playing for most of it, I recently decided to try playing again and it is STILL crashing even in single player on low graphics.

Sooo unless they release a patch that fixes this I probably won't play again.",False,1,0,2025-02-08 23:32:10
"The monsters are cool and is great to interact with, especially in bases. Lots to explore and do in this game, just as crafting specific items for Pals. It takes patience and a lot of gathering to get certain things, but it is very satisfying. Have not played multiplayer mode, but from others experience and videos, it makes the game even more fun with others. Depending on the settings, each world server is different. I really recommend this game to those that like taming monsters and/or survival mechanics. I do hope this game stays and thrive to greater heights.",True,1,0,2025-02-05 21:15:30
"Fun, addictive, time-consuming. 
At its surface, Palworld is simple and easy to get into. To actually succeed at later levels, it requires a great deal of team optimization. If you are into that kind of thing, this is for you. The breeding system is very Pokémon-like, and mastering it (and spending the time it takes) is necessary at later levels.",True,1,0,2025-01-28 15:35:55
"This game is essentially a better version of another very popular creature collecting game. This is way more effort put into and it shows. It has survival mechanics, base building, and exploring a vast open world to name a few. I've had way more fun with this game then the other game. Also worth noting that they have over 30 million players speaks to how popular the game is.",True,2,0,2025-02-20 05:43:13
"Palworld: Pokémon With Taxes and War Crimes

If you've ever played Pokémon and thought, ""This is great, but what if I could give Pikachu an assault rifle?""—congratulations, Palworld is your new favorite game.

This game has everything: catching adorable creatures, forcing them to work in your sweatshop—I mean, base—and engaging in full-on shootouts with rival factions while riding a fire-breathing deer. One moment, you're peacefully farming berries, and the next, you're dodging laser beams from an angry, overpowered owl.

Multiplayer is pure chaos. Your friend is building a nice house, you're out kidnapping Pals for unpaid labor, and someone else is leading a level 50 murder bird straight to the base. Also, let’s not talk about how quickly we all went from ""I love my Pals!"" to ""Get back to work, Jerry, or no food for you.""",True,2,3,2025-01-31 12:28:17
the game is great just need to find some friends to play it with its not that fun alone and if anyone wants to play text me I'm down,True,0,0,2025-02-27 18:10:46
"Okay girly pop, let's talk about Palworld. It’s a pretty okay game all things considered. Though I personally enjoy the early game much more than the late game. The power scaling feels a little bit awkward at times and it leads to the pacing being honestly not the best but I still found it fun despite its flaws. Honestly late game turns into quite a grind as it feels like you’re playing an impossible game of catch-up against the bosses where there is no middle ground which is fine but can be a little bit infuriating at times.

I achievement hunted this game as of February 26, 2025. I have all of the achievements… This was a slog of an achievement hunt. There’s a lot of what I can only describe as filler achievements that take a long time and don’t feel particularly fulfilling

In conclusion, this game is really fun to play casually and it’s great with friends, but it’s far from perfect

Bug as a type doesn’t exist, even if there are bug-lookin’ pals, so this one is thrown in with dark types. But it can serve as a mount, can double jump, and use webs to access difficult-to-reach areas.

Is it Pokemon with guns? Absolutely it is, but what hooked me was the base-building and crafting.You can create a console pretty much anywhere on the (admittedly pretty sizable) map, and within a certain radius of that console is where you can build…pretty much whatever you want. I’m a sucker for customization in any game, and so that more than anything is what’s kept me playing. Once you get more bases, you can specialize them to be able to do different things, and the ability to create storage that shares supplies across every base you own makes streamlining each one that much easier.

The game suffers from the Elden ring style of storytelling, though, if there’s any story to be had at all. In the sense that any story you get is through finding little journals left laying around the islands you travel through, and I’ll be real with you; I’ve found like, 5. There’s no real end goal, no super memorable characters. Even the boss characters are only cool until you beat them, with no real explanation as to why they’re there or who they even are, which is disappointing because they all seem unique enough to warrant some exposition. 

Setting aside the controversy regarding the makers of the game, the game itself is pretty OK, with some memorable monsters amidst a sea of blatant copies, but i wouldn’t really be able to recommend it to anyone who’s looking for any kind of engaging story. If you’re looking to gun down / subjugate adorable creatures while having access to some expansive (if a little fickle) base-building, this one is pretty solid.

I’ll hope for more updates allowing for more fleshed out storytelling, but given the developer’s history with other games being left in unfinished states, i won’t hold my breath. 

7/10 overall. Low replayability unless I’d be starting a new save with friends.",True,0,0,2025-02-23 03:57:20
"This game is amazing and they deserve all the credit for the task of testing the waters against a certain company. while i will say there is plenty of bugs, please dont let that detract you from how fun this game is. its not about the details. its about the mechanics.",True,0,0,2025-02-23 01:00:49
"Honestly, this is my guilty pleasure game. Just running around doing nothing is super fun in this NOT Pokemon simulator. 

Some pointers for maximum fun, once you get tired of the survival mechanic and feel yourself getting bored of the game. Go turn off settings like deterioration, and over encumbrance, and up your experience gain and other settings. It brings a whole new life into the game. Its so much fun just running around popping up Fortnite towers and whipping them pals into shape.",True,0,0,2025-02-23 00:52:15
"The game really is just an enjoyable experience. Good pal designs, and really good update frequency. I came back after a year and there's just so much more content to digest that it feels like a new experience.

I wish it would have a little more guidance through the use of interactive NPCs to push your player through the different biomes more smoothly, but its a small dev team making an amazing and massive world. I expect this will eventually come out with future updates. Unironically I think this game could benefit from a bit of the ubisoft method for open world games, where you have settlements to conquer and faction based progression the more you conquer the land. I cant wait for the fully fleshed out story, really.",True,0,0,2025-02-23 00:12:11

"A fantastic Monster Capturing game. The aesthetics are awesome. Base building feels a bit cluttered but it really is a joy to make your farm and watch your pals use it all effectively. 
If you love games like a certain Nintendo franchise game, and base building/resource management like Rust, this is the game for you.
I would love to see what the future updates for this game hold. And if they ever add mod support, may god have mercy on the pals because we all know what kinds of mods will be made first ;)",True,0,0,2025-02-22 22:15:17

"Awesome game, lot of exploring, looting base building, everything is done perfectly. Needs some optimization tho, i can handle it because i played games on low specs for years but many think this is a big deal, but it's only in some parts of the map tho, idk whats the deal with that.",True,0,0,2025-02-22 21:52:49
"This game is fantastic for those who like base building, collecting, and exploration. The open world is huge with a ton of bosses and dungeons to complete. Random exploration is encouraged with goodies hidden in tough to reach places.",True,0,0,2025-02-22 21:46:14
"I'd reccomend this game to anyone just because how histerically funny it is at first to put pickaxes and guns into little cartoon characters hands, game is generally fun and i've got some good time playing it. It has some issues tho, its very chore heavy to a painful point, at first after you go to chop wood 10th time you think to yourself ""surley it gets better the futher i go"". It gets worse.
Grind in this game is too much, you have to play on 'custom' to not lose your mind or to not give up on the game after first couple of hours, after that you honestly need mods that make you move faster. Idk what makes developer think that making your character move at 3kph while sprinting is a good idea, i get that you should get high level pals to move around but to get jetragon you need endgame gear and at that point you should have most of the map explored. Explored by low level pals that still move at ugh pace. 
Love the game and its unapologetic humor, its a shame you need mods to fix basic gameplay issues tho.",True,0,0,2025-02-22 12:28:23

"Jesus as my witness I am statistically the most unlucky man in the world as with a 33% chance it still takes 15 legendary spheres to catch anything on the new island. The percentage and the whole catch bonus is still so damn bugged I had to start over on Easy because it requires so many damn resources. Please just tell me its a 7% chance so I am not wildly overestimating my abilities.

Multiplayer is badly implemented with no cross save features. Game itself is pretty lackluster and has far less depth than the games it's copying from. Would have refunded if I could but took more than the 2 hours to see what was missing form the game.,False,0,0,2025-02-21 22:58:09

"Palworld is everything that people have been wishing The Pokemon Company would do in *any* Pokemon game - even a spin off series - for at least a decade. The exploration features alone are the perfect example of what Gen IX could have and *should* have been. As far as Survival Games go, Palworld's integration of the Monster Collector Sub-genre is enormously effective and fun which lets this game stand out in a market where it feels like *everything* is a Survival Game (similar to how everything was an MMO many years ago). You can really only appreciate just how fun Palworld is by playing it for yourself, but once you do prepare to feel very betrayed by The Pokemon Company and question why one of the most successful franchises in history is churning out games with such poor polish compared to Palworld.

My only complaint is that the game lacks a catchy score. With better background music, truly I cannot see a reason to keep playing Pokemon aside from instense nostalgia and an obsession with the RPG battle mechanics.

I'm a huge fan of the Action RPG elements of the game and the inclusion of Survival Game style combat. The combat in this game is everything that was missing in Pokemon Legends: Arceus, which I felt (at the time) was a very strong entry into the series. Now that I've played Palworld? PLA is just a huge disappointment in every department except Story, which wasn't all that great if we're being honest. Features like the key items you can craft which allow for team ups with specific Pals are all fun whether we're talking the harness that lets you use Foxparks as a flamethrower or the saddles which allow you to roam the land, brave the sea, or soar across the sky.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 23:36:58

"Pals still get confused and dont attack.  considering how the game came out, it is way better now.  it runs about as well as a AAA game, but AAA games dont run perfect, so this still has some kinks to get ironed out.  overall, it is a fun time sink that is worth the money.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 16:03:41

"Gameplay- highly enjoyable, containing a great blend of hunting/exploring, simple battle strategy, base building and level up character building elements. Can be quite grindy, recommend playing on a setting that boosts experience unless you want to spend hundreds of hours to get to top level/end of story.

Storyline- fairly sparse, logs can be found to give a bit of flavour to the characters and society, but as far as i can tell there is no 'why' to the few quests that drive the gameplay forward.

Style/Controversy- obviously inspired from a certain IP, uniquely twisted in a way that IP would obviously not like. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of whether this amounts to plagiarism/satire/unique game sharing themes.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 12:41:01
