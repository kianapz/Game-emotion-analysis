MzK,2025-01-20,20,Sevdiğim bir tür değil. Optimizasyon kötü ki ben yakın zamanda oynadım. Türü sevenlere bile bulaşmayın derim.
sex0fernandez,2024-11-27,80,"cagarme a piñas con dinosaurios es mi mathafakin pasion, asi que jueguen este juegazo mal optimizado"
zockerina,2024-11-11,80,"I’ve been playing this game for years, and I still love it. It’s just so much fun breeding the creepy creatures!"
Jt0429,2024-10-31,70,"Good- Comprehensive survival experience in a unique world, with interesting things to do like fighting and taming dinosaurs and exploring mysterious regions. Tons of stuff to craft, with steady progression that feels rewarding. Gorgeous visuals and details, coupled with solid quality-of-life features. Bad- Combat is still relatively average. Harvesting materials can get a bit grindy in the early going. Slightly choppy frame rate and annoying crashes. Fairly punishing when trying to get your bearings."
SemZemn,2024-10-09,90,"As buggy as this game can be and how scummy this company is now. The Original game is still really great imo. The lore, music, gameplay is still so insanely cool and fun. I totally get this is not for everyone."
Fran23200,2024-10-05,80,"Sin miedo pongo esta nota, muchas horas conociendo gente en serviidores aleatorios y haciendo tribus por discord. Si este juego llego a pillarlo con un pc mejor me lo hubiera pasado aún mejor, muchas horas de contenido y más si lo juegas en PVP y con mods. Juegazo"
JymmyQuidd,2024-08-24,40,"Beautiful idea ruined by clunky game mechanics, awful AI and a lack of gameplay common sense, hopefully ARK 2 does a better job."
Bam63,2024-07-26,60,"I put in over 1,000 hours in the last few years. Devs needed to fix many bugs, which, thankfully, modders put the work in for them. Modders were instrumental in fixing bugs such as building and snapping, which made the dino a lot more threatening and made the game fun. The whole moving from island to island thing kind of ****, as a lot of dinos got bugged or would have to leave stuff behind. Also, a few cave bugs and graphic bugs were big issues. The game took up ALL THE ROOM on your computer, but it's still a good game. Give it a try."
Tinblabm,2024-07-18,100,This game was very fun and actually better than expected so you might like it too.
RDCritic,2024-07-03,70,"Grande variedade de dinossauros. Os mapas poderiam ser melhor explorados, já que os melhores são expansões e não conteúdo do jogo base. Poucos jogadores exploram a história devido de falta de motivos para tal. O sistema online é mal trabalhado, muito difícil encontrar a sessão de um amigo. Distância entre jogadores e host da sessão muito baixa por padrão. A customização de personagem é muito limitada também."
tasctime,2024-05-24,90,I loved to hate this game. I would curse the PVP trolling every time but I was fascinated by the immersive game-play and mystery. Not everyone I met was a total dusche and I decided to commit time to it.
Markelore,2024-04-21,70,"This game is trash, let's be honest. The amount of bugs is insane. The basic movement mechanics are scuffed, dino AI and many other things. The other problem is its grinding concept. I literally finished the first map in 50+ hours which is an insane amount of time for a single map to me (By finished I mean beating all three bosses). You can change the settings or config of the game, but it's still feels like a job for the most part. If you play with standard rates, you are going to have a hard time completing this game. I wouldn't give this game anything higher than 2, if I didn't like the concept. I'm really into dinosaurs, but I still liked this game a lot. The amount of dinos you can tame, the whole process (even though it's a lot of grind), survival mechanics are almost perfect in this game. The map design is also on another level. Every map has at least 10 different biomes and the DLC maps add a lot more to the game, especially the ones you have to pay for. Definitely one of my favorite games, even though it has a lot of problems."
_Raven,2024-03-22,80,"This game holds a very special place in my heart. When you have fun in Ark, you really do. The problem with it is the amount of grind you need to do. Even if you boost the harvest rate in the game settings, it still feels like a lot. Personally, this was never a problem for me. I enjoy games like this."
NycoFox,2024-03-16,30,"375GB to install a game, are they insane? What kind of unoptimized crap is that?"
Penguin4057,2024-02-29,80,"Trash game, literally has no mechanic, no physics️. I Used to play this game but like I said this game has no mechanic phyisic etc. a dinosaurcan run same while at 1HP ️. Only good point is topic a Dino survival game"
CnPx98,2024-02-28,10,"This game is terrible in basically every way. Even as a survival game it makes literally no sense. So if you craft a campfire you need flint but then to light the camp fire you need to make spark powder from flint? So why did I use flint to make the camp fire? Or why do I need spark powder when I have a flaming torch in my hand? Just use that to light the fire. Or what about crafting and inventory management? As far as I could tell, there is no quick insert button. Every item needs to be dragged back and forth but even when you insert it, it doesn't go to the tile you want and instead the closest to the top left? So why do I need to drag it over when it just goes to top left? Or how when crafting, it has the option to bring up the crafting menu when in a storage box. But you still have to take stuff out the box to craft the item to but it all back in? Why? So many things are over complicated and not well explained. Overall its just not fun at all for me. I found it just doesn't get anything right. It runs badly, the graphics aren't great, the mechanics felt poorly designed and even smaller companies have shown that you don't need allot of devs and money to make a nice feeling game. You can see that the amount of people unlocking achievements isn't many. Survive 1 day has 30% of players unlocked and most of them only 5% so its clearly not performed well. The sad part is that a game like this could be good. If it was done properly and didn't feel so complicated to do something that should be simple. Like add some quality of life improvements. I should be able to craft an item within the storage box interface without taking the items out the box. If you have multiple crates you gotta go to each one to get each item out. This is annoying. Don't make things tedious for the sake of being tedious."
Fxy34,2024-01-28,90,"Muy buen juego de supervivencia, es muy difícil pero se compensa con la gran cantidad de cosas que tiene lo malo del juego es que esta muy mal optimizado"
Koukaburra,2024-01-27,70,This game is fun and you can make it as hard or as easy as you want. A great entry in the sandbox/survival genre with a unique premise. What holds it back is that some game mechanics become cumbersome and the push for players to buy the stream of DLCs that they produce. The game has a good progression system and unique mechanics that make it fun to play but has a lot of inherent grinding that needs to be done in game that slows games. This is less of a problem in multiplayer but I haven't had much experience playing online. For me it's a good game but reliance on grind and DLCs always pulls me away from the game.
Krook_pro,2024-01-19,100,Definitely one of the best Dinosaur games out there. A fun time for sure and super entertaining. Taming Dinosaurs is now my hobby
ShaneVerse,2024-01-07,60,"Ark is incredibly fun, and Ive never not had a good time playing it. But it is one of THE WORST DESIGNED GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED"
meprongl,2024-01-01,100,"Can't say much, best dino game out there it have its bugs bulding is kinda annoying with some structures due to potato wifi couldnt play the multiplayer, mods make a big part of the game the soundtrack is good, overall funi dino game."
TsukasaHiiragi,2023-12-21,40,"Multiplayer is pretty much full of cheaters/hackers and or griefers, playing on a PvE server is equally difficult with over-population. Singleplayer, the game is severely unbalanced and always has been - playing with mods is imperative to balance out some of the nonsense."
powwow,2023-11-19,20,"Currently in a non-playable state .... Created a char, next day server not found, create new char, server not found again .... forget this alpha"
evenlever,2023-11-15,100,"Buah el mejor juego de la historia de la humanidad tambien conocida como homo sapiens sapiens la cual es proveniente de los primates tales como los monos y chimpances,mas no somosdescendientes de los mismos, solo compartimos la familia primate, los susodichos monos y chimpances son solamente nuestros ""primos"" para decirlo de alguna manera familiarizada"
demoincookie,2023-11-08,90,i legit love this game if you can get the dlc it is so worth it i know its a lot of money but they are so fun and idk with friends cuz im alone :( kinda grindy tho :/
Thomas0520,2023-10-13,60,With Friend i will give it 8.
Wildyy,2023-10-06,80,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Hurkral13,2023-10-02,90,Best survival game ever
Malpa22,2023-09-27,80,i thought that rust takes a lot of time to play but this game consumes your real time with out limit
BaLtyr_,2023-09-23,30,this game....... exists
Excali22,2023-09-18,30,"This triple-A rated game may not be worth your time. There's a persistent bug that plagues the main game, causing you to lose all your hard-earned items suddenly. You could invest countless hours collecting items only for them to vanish unexpectedly. While it does offer a single-player mode for practice, this benefit is negated when your items disappear without reason.Comparing it to Rust, it falls short, despite having better graphics and improved gameplay due to the single-player option. However, this is marred by a game-breaking bug that jeopardizes your survival, especially given that items are crucial and time-consuming to acquire. It's concerning that this issue has persisted for five years without resolution. At its current price of £44.99, it might not be worth the investment in my honest opinion."
NatalieT,2023-09-18,0,"not even worth writing a proper review for, id be putting in more effort than the devs clearly did. for god's sake, the game is literally named ""Shootergame"" in the files. actually unbelievable."
Excali2,2023-08-25,100,"Even with its initial lack of performance (which improved with the passing of updates), I think it is one of the best Survivals ever created. You can play PVP, PVE and even change the whole experience with the use of Mods. Unlimited hours of fun (That it is in the Top 1 of my most played games on Steam proves it)."
aesirus96,2023-08-15,60,"Indo direto ao ponto: o jogo é bugado, principalmente no coop, mas isso não faz ele não ser divertido. A comunidade é bacana, os servidores não oficiais são bons (exceto no quesito conexão, quero dizer na experiência no geral) e a gameplay, mesmo que seja repetitiva, não chega a ser maçante. Com amigos vale a pena, sozinho não sei dizer."
PinkKitten,2023-08-04,0,"I use to love this game, then recently I heard about the cheaters of snail games, most of this is done on the official conquest servers, where you get wiped by the big bad publisher tribe "" Tea Tribe"" or get banned if you start to win, don't believe me ask 90+ of the Island Boys Tribe that got banned by simply raiding tea tribe fairly. well congratulations snail games and wild card play stupid games and win stupid prizes I'm putting this review everywhere I can even make a video of the same topic"

Rhex98,2023-07-09,70,"Buen videojuego, bastante divertido para jugar en cooperativo y lleno de bastantes cosas para interactuar, el mayor problema puede ser el bajo rendimiento, aun con un buen pc puede darte tirones, además de bugs constantes."
SouperKoopa,2023-06-26,40,"In the beginning it's fun, but it's way too grindy. Even with adjusting the settings. Also there are more bugs in ark than on earth and not to mention the optimization (which was totally forgotten). Also the graphics are meh. It's so pixely and just does not look right. Also, story aspect is neglectable. pros: - fun in the beginning - dinos - progression system cons: - dinos always aggressive - contless bugs (yes, game breaking ones) - very punishing gamplay - sooooo grindy - horrible performance - Dino AI is less intelligent than a minecraft zombie - Dinos are most of the time just pain Only reason why I have so many hours is just because I was a noob and its grind factor (adjusted the settings, still items too expensive)"
Azurgan,2023-06-18,0,"If you play this game and for some reason your on a server with the Guild TEA, your going to get Ban from the game if you and your guild member manage to overpower them. TEA is the Snail Games devs (some of them) Guild, the publisher of Ark and if you google it/youtube it you will find multiple cases of this happening and prove that this guild TEA should be disbanded and the devs helping them fired."
wolfnet18,2023-06-12,50,"I have to give ark a down the middle review. Graphics are nice The number of different dinosaurs is amazing. There are different maps to explore What hurts this game is the optimization. Single player is fine, but multiplayer, especially if you dont buy a server hurts a lot. Tether distance is something that should have never existed in the game, and all players getting pulled to someone just because they flew over or entered a cave ""forces"" you to buy a server or play online with friends. Unfortunately that is where things go downhill because there is currently a lot of controversy against the devs closing down servers, and even banning a lot of players. The game also still suffers from bugs that have existed for years and havent been fixed either because they cant or just choose not to. If you love dinosaurs, and breeding and raising them, building bases and what not, and are looking to play solo, pick this up. If you're ok with playing this online, and logging in one day to potentially everything just not being there it still might work for you, otherwise i'd probably wait a few years, and see if Ark2 fixes anything."
RockHobbit,2023-06-07,0,"This is a great game ruined by awful developers/ publisher and a crap ton of bugs with no support. You will lose dinos, you will lose your character, you will get ""Arked"" and support will NOT help you. There are bugs in this game, and lots of them. The game is janky, but it's fun. But the developers are scandalous. Faking steam reviews, lying to customers, playing on the servers and banning tribes that attack them (see h.o.d). They're closing the servers in August 2023 and forcing everyone to start over and pay full price (after being advertised as a free upgrade) for their remaster if they want to continue playing and supporting this awful company. I truly loved this game but with all the times this developer has pooped on it's supporters I cannot imagine this game succeeding after servers go down. And be aware of you buy this game, only single player will be available as of August."
tensioly,2023-06-06,80,"El ARK Survival Evolved es uno de los juegos más divertidos de supervivencia. Teniendo en cuenta las numerosas carencias que posee el juego, como son principalmente el apartado visual, la interfaz, la optimización (aunque con el tiempo la han ido mejorando bastante) y sus mediocres físicas; el juego sabe emular perfectamente la sensación de supervivencia y el ambiente prehistórico, a la vez que en cuanto a mecánicas y a cantidad de criaturas (cada una de ellas con un nivel de detalle excepcional) es de lo mejor que podemos encontrar en el género. Cabe destacar que la música es bastante buena y adecuada en cada contexto y situación en la que suena, y el lore que tiene es interesante. Por último debo recomendar, habiendo jugado los modos offline y online del juego, que este juego se juegue mejor online y a ser posible con amigos, ya que hace del ARK una experiencia realmente alucinante. 7,9/10 (10/2019)"
Dragamigh,2023-06-02,90,"Ark is a fantastic game. Yes it has many bugs and glitches, but everything else makes it so much better, and makes handling the bugs worth it. From the extremely active community that are constantly pumping out amazing mods, to the sheer amount of content, and the surprising amount of story and lore, I recommend trying Ark: Survival Evolved out!"
Farthas,2023-06-01,0,"I've been playing this game for about 4 years, its only getting worse and worse with their own company tribe that is playing the game called TEA , they are using every kind of cheat there is and not getting banned, while getting the best blueprints ect spawned in by their pocket dev..... This was the last season of conquest before ark 1,5 release, and its been the worst one in all the time i have been playing this game , this time everyone from 1x came to play on conquest servers and SO MUCH CHEATING is ruining this game so hard, and the admins that is soposed to protect the community and keep it a fair game dont really care at all about all the cheats, because NOTHING has changed in the 4 years ive been playing it only getting worse and worse every year.. This game is a total waste of time , you spend weeks or months building a base only to loose it to hackers and cheaters within days or even hours depending on the hack they are using...... 100% unfair fight and there is really no hope of even winning the game in any way vs these mega tribes and TEA (Snail games tribe) because of all the cheat they are using."
Triblue,2023-05-21,90,"Un jeu magnifique, original, fun, avec un gameplay cool. Le jeu devient juste vite répétitif si on joue pas en multi"
BoneSaw,2023-05-17,10,"Its an exploitative mess. The game is barely functional, takes up 400GB+ of space. To top it all off they are requiring long time players to pay an exorbitant amount ($40) of what is essentially a graphics upgrade, whilst also closing down its Official servers. Those who have paid for the legacy iteration, had to pay for this iteration of the game, and now will be required to shill another $40 for this coming iteration. If you are an addict of the game, just play offline... play on non-dedicated servers... don't be a patsy for the evil company that is Snail Games. Your money will be the only thing they will listen to as its clear they don't give a single care about the players who have been there to support them from the start. Fan boy and girls will be angry, and you should be, but not at me. Be mad at the people in charge who are going out of their way to strangle you for every $ they can."
realWhiteMan,2023-04-09,40,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
ZackH25,2023-03-23,70,Great game that is very detailed. So much stuff to do on it and if you want to get far in this game it is gonna be a grind especially if you are playing by yourself. The furthest I got was taming a Carno and making a sniper in the game. When you finally accomplish something it is very rewarding and that is the best part about the game. It is also quite fun surviving against a bunch of random dinosaurs and other creatures especially when some of them are really annoying to deal with especially the snakes and the bugs. This game is a bit effort to play by yourself and it can get very repetitive with the grind. Also quite laggy at times.
