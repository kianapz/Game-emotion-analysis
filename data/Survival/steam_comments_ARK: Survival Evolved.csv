"This game made me shed a tear, not because of the beauty of it, not because of the countless years of memories I have from playing this game with friends, no, it was not a single tear of joy, but a tear of sadness. Not because of the pain I feel when hackers destroy my base or when random players give me swamp fever, but I shed tears of sorrow when I looked at what was taking up my storage on my computer and I saw Ark, and it took up half of my storage space, half a terabyte, ""why?"" I asked as I looked up to the skies, almost as if I was asking God how such a thing could be, but nothing could be good enough of a reason. Painful, trapped inside my own misery, my own personal hell, a game to play that I find enjoyable, will stop me from playing any other game, because I will never have enough storage to play anything else, until I delete that. And that is the reason, ""it's genius"" I thought, their strategy is to take up your storage to the point where you have nothing left to be able to play, well played.",True,31,19,2025-02-15 23:18:15

Note* I'm in my 30's and don't have the time or patience to grind anymore and this game is GRINDY. I wanna build stuff and ride dinosaurs with the homies. If you're like me, I recommend turning all the XP gain, Taming, Harvesting, Breeding, Hatching, etc. settings all the way up. And not saying you NEED to, but the "" ~ "" key is the default Console Commands button. Type 'EnableCheats' right in there and hit Enter. Followed closely by ""cheat InfiniteStats""  (so you don't die every 9 seconds at the start) Be familiar with ""cheat ForceTame"" if you're cool like that.

"This game is a work of art. It may be a little rudimentary on graphics and overall mechanics, but what else are you gonna expect from a dinosaur involved survival game? I mean who cares about how the grass looks when you get to fly around and shoot rockets off of a quetzalcoatlus? or kill everything you can see with your very own giganotosaurus? or rule the open waters with a god damned mosasaurus? I think that even the base game is overlooked due to its honestly sub-par mechanics, such as the weird building system, or how confusing it is to find the exact temperature that you need to incubate an egg for example, rather than the true fleshed out beauty of making something that your proud of, no matter if its a mega sized landing pad for your quetzalcoatlus fleet, or a giant paddock for your arsenal of land-dwelling carnivores, or just a house that you can call your own. This game may look a little confusing or bad at a glance, but if you give it an honest chance to prove its worth, i think you can quickly discover that this game is not one the pushover that you may think it is.

"what can i say about this game? can i honestly recommend this?

on the one hand, i do enjoy it. i love prehistoric animals, and this game has a lot of them, even if they aren't paleoaccurate. there's lots to do in this game: creatures to tame, bases to build, wars to wage and bosses to fight. you can hatch baby dinosaurs, raise them, harvest materials with them, or take them into combat. mods are relatively easy to download and use. it's a fun game in both singleplayer and multiplayer, and there are multiple free dlc maps that have loads of new environments, creatures, etc if you tire of the original map. i think this game is a fair enough price for what it offers. the grind can be tough if you want, or you can tweak your world to be a bit easier. there are plenty of commands available to help you with spawning creatures, getting tools, etc if you want to skip the grind altogether. even outside of the game itself, there's a wiki if you're struggling to find something, and dododex is free, easy to use, and invaluable. if you like survival games, or games with prehistoric or fantasy creatures, then you will like this game.

on the other hand, this game sucks. there are tons of bugs, with some of them capable of killing you and your tames, and ruining your save. the game has basically been abandoned by wildcard & snailgames, meaning none of these bugs are going to be fixed, and the game will not be updated in the future. sometimes the game crashes or corrupts for no reason. the gameplay can be incredibly frustrating: sometimes you'll get spawncamped by something you have no hope of killing, sometimes you'll die and lose everything and have to start over, sometimes your favorite tame will die and there won't be anything you can do about it. some dlcs that add incredibly helpful tools, tames, and items are paid. if you have a low end computer or laptop, you will have a lot of trouble running this game. this game takes up a lot of storage space, even without dlcs. the graphics are mediocre, which doesn't matter much to me but may matter to some people. owning and running an online server costs money. if you join an online server, your tames/structures/etc will eventually despawn if you don't log in after a certain period of time, and your body will just be laying there on the ground when you're offline for anyone to kill or monkey around with. you can play on LAN with friends, but not very well; the game will lag and your friend has to be within a certain distance of you at all times. the companies behind the game have abandoned it specifically to make a revamped version that they promised would be free for anyone who already had the game (which was a lie), and that the code for this revamp would be completely rewritten (also a lie). said game, ark survival ascended, has a lot of the same bugs as this game, some of which are even worse, and these bugs aren't being fixed. there is also a big focus on microtransactions in asa, which is something i hate so much that it pisses me off even though i don't even own asa.

tldr; this game is good and bad. you might fall in love with it, or you might want a refund within 24 hours. i chose to recommend it because i enjoy it, but you might not enjoy it and i can't blame you. good luck!

one thing i do want to mention is that the devs get a lot of hate for the problems with this game. while i understand people being upset (i'm upset too), the devs probably don't have as much control over the game and how it works as we like to think. likely most of the issues with this game, including its abandonment, are the result of decisions made by the corporation who owns this game, snailgames. this doesn't mean the devs aren't at fault for the problems with ark, but they're not the only isssue here. go on youtube and google 'ark snailgames' for more information if you're interested.",True,0,0,2025-02-14 20:38:48

With [b]56 hours[/b] on Steam, [b]100+ hours[/b] on Epic, and [b]2500+ hours[/b] on PS4, I can confidently say: [i]ARK is an amazing game.[/i]

[b]Buggy?[/b] Yes.
[b]No official servers?[/b] Well… [i]not anymore.[/i] Since the launch of [b]ARK: Survival Ascended[/b], official server support for ARK: Survival Evolved has ended. If you still want that experience with official servers (or just enjoy the Unreal Engine 5 remaster), check out [b]ARK: Survival Ascended[/b].

[*]✅ [b]Friendships will be made.[/b]
  [*] Surviving the first night together.
  [*] Taming a high-level dino and naming it something dumb.
  [*] Pulling off a perfect raid with flawless teamwork.
  [*] Defending the base against waves of enemies at 3 AM.
  [*] Reviving an old friend’s love for the game by dragging them into a fresh wipe.

[*]✅ [b]Friendships will be destroyed.[/b]
  [*] Accusations of insiding.
  [*] Logging in to find half the base mysteriously missing.
  [*] “I was just borrowing your Rex for a sec, bro.”
  [*] That one friend who [i]swears[/i] they’re neutral but actually allied with your enemies.
  [*] Rage-quitting after getting offline raided for the third time in a row.

[*]✅ [b]That one no-life friend who raids everyone?[/b] Totally not me. ([i]It’s me.[/i])
[/list]

[b]10/10[/b], because after getting accused of insiding (again), betrayed (again), and kicked out (again)…

 [*] Start a solo tribe.
 [*] Grind like a madman in the shadows.
 [*] Tame a ridiculously strong dino army.
 [*] Launch raids on everyone out of pure spite.
 [*] Watch their bases burn.
 [*] Laugh maniacally as they realize it was me.
 [*] Eventually get caught and wiped.
 [*] Somehow get invited back into the tribe.
 [*] Repeat.

"I have played a lot of open world games. The game is brutal to start. Everything is out to kill you. And you will die and die often. But, I think the challenge is what brings me back.

"its very good and fun loudest menu music ever made anyway lets change topic to the The F-22 Raptor: A Flying Masterpiece
The F-22 Raptor is not just a fighter jet; it's a technological marvel, a symbol of American airpower, and a testament to human ingenuity. This sleek, powerful aircraft has dominated the skies since its introduction, leaving its mark on the world of military aviation.

Born from the Ashes of the Cold War:

The F-22's story begins in the late 1980s, as the Cold War was winding down. The United States Air Force recognized the need for a next-generation air superiority fighter, one that could outmaneuver and outgun any potential adversary. The result was the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, a fierce competition between Lockheed and Northrop. Lockheed emerged victorious, and their design, the Y-22, evolved into the F-22 Raptor.

A Symphony of Innovation:

The F-22 is a masterpiece of engineering. It boasts a unique ""supercruise"" capability, allowing it to fly faster than Mach 1 without using afterburners, significantly extending its range and endurance. Its advanced stealth technology makes it incredibly difficult to detect by radar, while its powerful twin turbofan engines provide unmatched acceleration and maneuverability.

The Raptor's Arsenal:

The F-22 is armed with a formidable array of weapons, including:

Air-to-air missiles: The AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM, designed for close-in and long-range engagements respectively.
A 20mm cannon: For close-range combat and ground attack.
Beyond the Battlefield:

The F-22 is not just a weapon; it's a symbol of American technological prowess. Its development and deployment have pushed the boundaries of aerospace engineering, leading to advancements in areas like materials science, avionics, and stealth technology.

A Legacy of Excellence:

The F-22 Raptor has a proven track record of success. It has been deployed in numerous operations, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it has demonstrated its superior capabilities. The F-22 remains the world's most advanced air superiority fighter, a testament to its exceptional design and engineering.

But what about the future? The F-22 is a remarkable aircraft, but it's not immune to the relentless march of technological progress. What challenges and opportunities lie ahead for this iconic fighter?",True,0,0,2025-02-04 21:36:27
"I've played the game on and off for several years now on multiple consoles. On paper, it has absolutely everything you could want out of it. A sandbox survival with extremely interesting biomes, creatures, structures, and mechanics. If you want to sink hours into exploring a fun and rich world with fun animal companions, ARK should be a perfect game. In practice though, it's a complete nightmare. The gameplay is hours of dull grinding with annoying limitations, and only small highlights to reward you. Everything you could want to do in this game is a complete chore unless you tweak the settings to make it more bearable. Taming Dinos, for example, can take hours without including prep time and actually hunting for the dino itself. All this could be forgiven though, if it wasn't for the gamebreaking glitches that seem commonplace. I've lost countless hours of progress to glitches, including an entire single player save being deleted. If you insist on getting the game anyways, I highly reccomend waiting for a sale to avoid paying full price.",False,0,0,2025-02-04 19:05:25
