"This game is not perfect by any means. Programming wise, not particularly well omtimized. Bugs still happen, creatures do weird stuff etc. With that in mind, I fucking love this game. I have met so many great people and communities with this. Been with it since before breeding was a thing. I've had laughs, cries, love and heartbreak. And all the dinosaurs. All the adventures. The long nights fooling around in this world. Many hours, such worth, very good. Absolutely worth it.",True,49,8

this is the buggiest mess i have played in a very long time. cant connect to a friend most of the time and when you can have the stuff doesn't work like its supposed too. you've never sure if your doing something wrong or if its just one of 10000 bugs your going to encounter.,False,6,1
"This game made me shed a tear, not because of the beauty of it, not because of the countless years of memories I have from playing this game with friends, no, it was not a single tear of joy, but a tear of sadness. Not because of the pain I feel when hackers destroy my base or when random players give me swamp fever, but I shed tears of sorrow when I looked at what was taking up my storage on my computer and I saw Ark, and it took up half of my storage space, half a terabyte, ""why?"" I asked as I looked up to the skies, almost as if I was asking God how such a thing could be, but nothing could be good enough of a reason. Painful, trapped inside my own misery, my own personal hell, a game to play that I find enjoyable, will stop me from playing any other game, because I will never have enough storage to play anything else, until I delete that. And that is the reason, ""it's genius"" I thought, their strategy is to take up your storage to the point where you have nothing left to be able to play, well played.",True,3,0
"TLDR: Game could be good, lots of crashing issues, a bit grindy and building doesn't feel good.

This game could be really good if not for all the crashing. I've tried looking up solutions and almost all the comments are just ""Because it's Ark"". With graphics turned up, the game looks incredible but I can't even run it on the high settings because it crashes so much. Running it on the lowest graphics, which makes the game look very dated, helps a little bit with the crashing but not by much. The game constantly just freezes randomly and then your get some shooter game error. The game is also a bit of a grind fest. If you don't mind grinding hard for resources it shouldn't be a big deal. Building system in this game is pretty bad in my opinion. It's pretty hard to build any structures that look remotely nice, sometimes you can build parts in the same exact spot as another piece so they just end up overlapping. Building across water by making a bridge is incredibly frustrating as well.",False,2,0

Like the building mechanics are horrible, I just gave up making my base, it was bad, to put it mildly.

"what can i say about this game? can i honestly recommend this?

on the one hand, i do enjoy it. i love prehistoric animals, and this game has a lot of them, even if they aren't paleoaccurate. there's lots to do in this game: creatures to tame, bases to build, wars to wage and bosses to fight. you can hatch baby dinosaurs, raise them, harvest materials with them, or take them into combat. mods are relatively easy to download and use. it's a fun game in both singleplayer and multiplayer, and there are multiple free dlc maps that have loads of new environments, creatures, etc if you tire of the original map. i think this game is a fair enough price for what it offers. the grind can be tough if you want, or you can tweak your world to be a bit easier. there are plenty of commands available to help you with spawning creatures, getting tools, etc if you want to skip the grind altogether. even outside of the game itself, there's a wiki if you're struggling to find something, and dododex is free, easy to use, and invaluable. if you like survival games, or games with prehistoric or fantasy creatures, then you will like this game.

on the other hand, this game sucks. there are tons of bugs, with some of them capable of killing you and your tames, and ruining your save. the game has basically been abandoned by wildcard & snailgames, meaning none of these bugs are going to be fixed, and the game will not be updated in the future. sometimes the game crashes or corrupts for no reason. the gameplay can be incredibly frustrating: sometimes you'll get spawncamped by something you have no hope of killing, sometimes you'll die and lose everything and have to start over, sometimes your favorite tame will die and there won't be anything you can do about it. some dlcs that add incredibly helpful tools, tames, and items are paid. if you have a low end computer or laptop, you will have a lot of trouble running this game. this game takes up a lot of storage space, even without dlcs. the graphics are mediocre, which doesn't matter much to me but may matter to some people. owning and running an online server costs money. if you join an online server, your tames/structures/etc will eventually despawn if you don't log in after a certain period of time, and your body will just be laying there on the ground when you're offline for anyone to kill or monkey around with. you can play on LAN with friends, but not very well; the game will lag and your friend has to be within a certain distance of you at all times. the companies behind the game have abandoned it specifically to make a revamped version that they promised would be free for anyone who already had the game (which was a lie), and that the code for this revamp would be completely rewritten (also a lie). said game, ark survival ascended, has a lot of the same bugs as this game, some of which are even worse, and these bugs aren't being fixed. there is also a big focus on microtransactions in asa, which is something i hate so much that it pisses me off even though i don't even own asa.

tldr; this game is good and bad. you might fall in love with it, or you might want a refund within 24 hours. i chose to recommend it because i enjoy it, but you might not enjoy it and i can't blame you. good luck!

one thing i do want to mention is that the devs get a lot of hate for the problems with this game. while i understand people being upset (i'm upset too), the devs probably don't have as much control over the game and how it works as we like to think. likely most of the issues with this game, including its abandonment, are the result of decisions made by the corporation who owns this game, snailgames. this doesn't mean the devs aren't at fault for the problems with ark, but they're not the only isssue here. go on youtube and google 'ark snailgames' for more information if you're interested.",True,0,0

"its very good and fun loudest menu music ever made anyway lets change topic to the The F-22 Raptor: A Flying Masterpiece
The F-22 Raptor is not just a fighter jet; it's a technological marvel, a symbol of American airpower, and a testament to human ingenuity. This sleek, powerful aircraft has dominated the skies since its introduction, leaving its mark on the world of military aviation.

Born from the Ashes of the Cold War:

The F-22's story begins in the late 1980s, as the Cold War was winding down. The United States Air Force recognized the need for a next-generation air superiority fighter, one that could outmaneuver and outgun any potential adversary. The result was the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, a fierce competition between Lockheed and Northrop. Lockheed emerged victorious, and their design, the Y-22, evolved into the F-22 Raptor.

A Symphony of Innovation:

The F-22 is a masterpiece of engineering. It boasts a unique ""supercruise"" capability, allowing it to fly faster than Mach 1 without using afterburners, significantly extending its range and endurance. Its advanced stealth technology makes it incredibly difficult to detect by radar, while its powerful twin turbofan engines provide unmatched acceleration and maneuverability.

The Raptor's Arsenal:

The F-22 is armed with a formidable array of weapons, including:

Air-to-air missiles: The AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM, designed for close-in and long-range engagements respectively.
A 20mm cannon: For close-range combat and ground attack.
Beyond the Battlefield:

The F-22 is not just a weapon; it's a symbol of American technological prowess. Its development and deployment have pushed the boundaries of aerospace engineering, leading to advancements in areas like materials science, avionics, and stealth technology.

A Legacy of Excellence:

The F-22 Raptor has a proven track record of success. It has been deployed in numerous operations, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it has demonstrated its superior capabilities. The F-22 remains the world's most advanced air superiority fighter, a testament to its exceptional design and engineering.

But what about the future? The F-22 is a remarkable aircraft, but it's not immune to the relentless march of technological progress. What challenges and opportunities lie ahead for this iconic fighter?",True,0,0
"I've played the game on and off for several years now on multiple consoles. On paper, it has absolutely everything you could want out of it. A sandbox survival with extremely interesting biomes, creatures, structures, and mechanics. If you want to sink hours into exploring a fun and rich world with fun animal companions, ARK should be a perfect game. In practice though, it's a complete nightmare. The gameplay is hours of dull grinding with annoying limitations, and only small highlights to reward you. Everything you could want to do in this game is a complete chore unless you tweak the settings to make it more bearable. Taming Dinos, for example, can take hours without including prep time and actually hunting for the dino itself. All this could be forgiven though, if it wasn't for the gamebreaking glitches that seem commonplace. I've lost countless hours of progress to glitches, including an entire single player save being deleted.

The optimisation is quite bad and therefore the graphics are lacking. There is no story since it's more of a sandbox survival game, and therefore you set your own goals. If this isn't something you like doing then this probably isn't the game for you.

////Features:
You can build a castle, ride a dinosaur, explore tons of maps, download mods, explore ruins, discover lore, and yes, you can even poop (there's a button for that)! You can tame dinosaurs, breed them, battle them—DINOSAURS!
////Amazing mods:
Play as a dinosaur, survive as one, and experience over 160-170 dinosaurs and an ape, and have a dino family.
////Multiplayer:
Up to 170 players on a single server, even more with mods.  

/////[CONS]/////
////Bugs:
There are some bugs that can be annoying, such as being stuck in the map or baby dinos spawning inside buildings. Most of the time, you can fix these bugs by turning on creative mode in the settings.
////Developers:

Graphics in this are amazing and it's also very fun to play with mods as they make it much more enjoyable. 10/10👍,True,0,0
"I really love this game, but hate the developers. They leave Ark as an unfinished and buggy mess and release the SAME game with just better graphics instead of working on the bugs. I would love to recommend this game, but its so frustating at some points, that i just cant. U die randomly because of some bugs and lose all ur stuff, the worst building mechanics..... just dont buy this game at full price.",False,0,0

"After more extensive thought, one would assume that one of the most advanced and comprehensive creations that has ever been thought up by the Human race, especially in the 21st century due to fierce competition such as popular media like ‘The Big Bang Theory’ and ‘Rick and Morty’, would be the development of the video game commonly referred to as Ark Survival Evolved which is renown for inspiring a childlike wonder in all who play. God bless Ark Survival Evolved. Similarly, there would be a hint of irony and it would be very hypocritical for oneself to ignore the fact that although such historical work like Ark Survival Evolved does have a place in all of our hearts, from its engaging characters, advanced mechanics, varying terrain and a complex ecosystem that teaches you from very early on that this isn’t a normal game. This game is designed for gamers, particularly those who practise against minorities. Ark Survival Evolved is more than a video game, it is the foundation for many strong relationships where love is cherished. This is where E-girlfriends are most common. E-girlfriends, E-girlfriends as far as the eye can see. Even the most experienced and battle tested veterans that have graced the immersive and welcoming community that resides within Ark Survival Evolved will spend days searching for the perfect E-girlfriend which has loyalty and a keen sense of respect. They even remember important dates and anniversaries such as Birthdays and they are often prone to assembling cucks from far and wide in order to appease their Boyfriends from yonder lands through parties which mostly take place at the Centre Arena on Friday nights around 8:00PM PST.",True,0,0
Playing this game as single player is fun. I have been playing this game for 4 years and I still like it. But I think it will be a whole lot better if I joined a team. It gets very lonely as a single player and it takes forever to make any progress.,True,0,0
It's one of those survival games that really show that your character is getting stronger... or maybe just your dinosaurs but yeah.,True,0,0
"behind all these years and hours of playing ark, it was just a kid that loved dinosaurs. even now i am know differnt from back then in 2017. i really have seen this game evolve over it life time from the start to end i was here though it all.",True,0,0
