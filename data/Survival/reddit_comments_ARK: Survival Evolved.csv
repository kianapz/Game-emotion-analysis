x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I wish ARKs performance wasn't complete ass on console
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Me seeing stuff like this: ""maybe I should try Ark again""

Ark, 3 minutes into spawning me in an Easy location: ""Say hello to a level 934 psychoraptor"""
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Last time I played ARK I set up a massive parasaur breading farm that crashed the server when I accidentally whistled for all to follow. I was not invited back.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Damn thats sick. Makes me wanna play ark again.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I really wish ARK's development team would work on actually improving their game's performance. I know it's complicated but I can still always dream.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I really want to play this game again, but I can't overcome the trauma of losing my single-player savegame after spending over 500 hours building my dream base...

&#x200B;

ARK would be a near-perfect survival game if it weren't for those horrible bugs, glitches, and terrible optimization."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Makes me want to play ARK again. Building shit like that is basically all I did, especially with the CKFR mod, it's awesome."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,And then someone knocks out one foundation and it all collapses.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Great Stronghold castle! ‚ÄúThe people worship you me Lord!‚Äù
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Lol and 6+ fps anywhere near the thing
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Magnificent
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Leaked pics of Assassin's Creed Mirage
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,If Ark had better file management systems in place instead of duplicating the files for each dlc (which is apparently why they're all multi-gig downloads) then I'd consider downloading again
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,And here I am getting frustrated after trying to get like 3 stories worth of walls to line up properly. How on earth do you get the snapping to play nice for a build this size?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Now decorate it! Good job, though looks great. ( I never can decorate my castles either)"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,This is the most epic build I've ever seen. The build limits on console suck so bad :(
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Damn. Here I thought Ark was just about taking random dumps in the ocean and banging rocks together until you‚Äôre eaten by a Dino
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"How did you build that?? Every single time I play this game I get knocked unconscious, handcuffed, and dragged to an outpost where I wake up locked up."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,If this was Rust... your TC would be expansive more then real rent!!!
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,i would never imagine this is ARK.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,That central tower is very Red Keep. I like it.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I thought this game is about dinosaur
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"I'm just waiting for the AITA subreddit post from OP's mom in a few months where she deletes the save files as punishment for not getting up for school on time.

Edit: (There was a story like that recently about a Minecraft server, FYI, just making a joke)."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Lol 100+ hours??? More like a 1 Month minimum!
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Ur names not matrix is it
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Oh! Anyway
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"At my job if I clocked 100 hours I'd have earned just shy of $6000. 

Well done."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,[deleted]
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Very impressive.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Having sunk at least 4k hours into this game‚Ä¶I am impressed. And shuddering at the cost of upkeep that thing must have. Impressive OP
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Very impressive! I can‚Äôt build like this in games anymore.. I‚Äôve spent so many hours building things in games like this and KSP only to realise that they will either get broken by updates or the fact that I can‚Äôt actually hold the things in my hands.. maybe I‚Äôm just getting old..
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Wholy hell, good job."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Yes,  but does it have blackjack?"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Is that fortnite
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Mods?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,thats not ark that camelot! where is the Arthur?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Ah the joys of private servers
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Wow someone actually managed to build anything in ark, jesus that game had so many flaws"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,How its not crashing ark has worst optimisation
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"What is this, Minecraft?"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Genuinely wondering how you got the view distance so high? I have all settings on ultra and my base still pops in 250m
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Offline raiding intensifies
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Now do this on a raft and make it portable!
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I see a lot of you are put off from previous experiences in ARK. My friends came across Myth of Empires, which is a medieval era survival game and has been one of the best online experiences I have had in years. [https://www.mythofempires.com/](https://www.mythofempires.com/) $25

re: the grind, the Seasonal Servers have 6x to 20x leveling speed, it take less than an hour to get from 0 to max lvl 60 with pull pvp stats. 

(the devs realized the grind scared away players so they got rid of it, meaning less grind and more pvp!)"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Aw finally my build is done ‚Äúlogs off and gets wiped by a Asian clan‚Äù.... the story of Arc every time I play
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Jesus.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I'mma knock it down.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,By oblivion
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I really wish more survival games were like this, about creating efficient and awesome looking bases, but from the short time ive played all i see are giant squares and giant platforms on cliffs or tall rocks, same with connan.

I feel more intimidated by buildings like this, than giant squares."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Is there supposed to be an extra 0 in there or something? 100 hours doesn‚Äôt seem even remotely enough time to get to this point haha. Unless you mean 100 hours explicitly spent on this one build, but even then that sounds fast as hell"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,On any server it can be destroyed in 5 minutes.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I just make a big square.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Most finnicky build mechanics I've ever run into. If you care about stuff aligning that is. Props mate. Also fuck this game I love it.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I easy have over 1000 hours clocked in ARK and I never once made a massive base like this. Super cool! Hope you‚Äôre excited for ARK 2
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I used to play on NA servers for years and this would‚Äôve taken us 6 months with the gathering rates lol
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,PS4 be like brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,So glad that someone else uses CKF Remastered
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Don't get raided now
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Beautiful stuff. Well done.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Now time for the sequel.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,How do you even get past the starting beach??
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Never played this game, don't know what it's about, but I'm gonna go ahead and assume you survived, possibly even evolved a little. Doesn't look much like an ark but I like your style. Good job!"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,ARK: Sur-thriving Evolved
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"So beautiful yet, so fragile."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,I‚Äôm trying to resist the urge to reinstall. Currently addicted to Space Engineers and Cities Skylines.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Now come back after 1000+ hours!
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Only 100 hours that is worth a lifetime...
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,That is so cool. I wish I had an imagination and was able to build stuff. I always just put a a few stone battlements and build a stone hut and call it good.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,[deleted]
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"So you basically made your 25 FPS game run in 10 by choice? No hate tho, incredible work!"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"Looks amazing!

Do you have a video that can give us a tour inside?"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,i've seen bigger fortresses on Ark.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,[deleted]
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Wow that looks amazing.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-04,If you need arch game hacks like TOM hit me up
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-11,This makes me want to play Lost Ark again. =p
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-14,"You crazy ash, but I respect it‚Ä¶ Plus I took that same amount of time and proceeded to tame every tamable creature on the Ark and mutated them just for an achievement ü•≤üôÉüò≠"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I had to build basically a super computer to effectively run builds like this. A few grand in.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Not even just console
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Don't worry it's ass on everything
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Only on consoles? My guy I have a 2080 super and a 9400f and my rig turns into a molten mess of solder and aluminium when I load ark for more than 5 minutes.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I wish ARK wasn't 165 fucking GB to install.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,That's just Ark.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I wish I could play on a public server without it feeing like inner city detroit. Otherwise its just a massive solo game and i already have a ton of those that are more engaging
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Yeah, a few of my friends really enjoyed it on console but once the map gets pretty full performance falls off a cliff."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Right? I played it on the Xbox one and it ran like dog shit, when I got my series X and it got the enhancement I tried it again and it still ran like dog shit"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I don't get why they don't go back to early 2000s programming with modern engines, keep pushing the bleeding age and computers just can't do it"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,ARK as a game is sadly bad.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"And the split screen part in sooo bad there‚Äôs so many glitches, the fps is the worst thing I‚Äôm lucky if I get 20 fps, LIKE FIX YOUR GAME ARK!!"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Yeah‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt believe I played for so long on Xbox one. Tried again recently and it‚Äôs just unplayable
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"It's interesting how much Rust overtook Ark in performance. Modern Rust runs at like 120-150fps on my PC (1440p mediumish settings). Don't play it as much anymore, but I remember when it ran very poorly, like around 40fps, it wasn't fun."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,It's complete ass on everything. Not sure if it's poor optimization or it's just *that* resource intensive.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,I'm very interested to see if the new UE5 engine will handle games like this much better with the new rendering tech they've developed for it.  It sure would be nice to be able to play a high graphical fidelity survival and building game and be able to build large structures like this without it becoming a slideshow and setting your PC on fire.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"The beauty of Ark is that if you don't like something, you can change it. Hate getting spawn camped by raptors? Make your move speed a little faster. Hate how long it takes to level up? Make the xp rates higher. Night time take too long at the beginning? Change the day night cycle for awhile."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Rule 1 of ark: Never ever trust the recomended spawn regions
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Raptors can be managed... fuck everything about troodons though. No matter armor, they will torpor and peck you to death."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I didn't even know parasuars could bake, let alone that they could be farmed for it! Ark really is an amazing game"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"On me and my friends server years ago I made a 2x1 house and filled it with over a hundred dodos, my buddy was pissed at the noise and led a trex to eat them all when I was offline. 

In retaliation I force fed him tranq berries when he was offline til he had a week timer"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"That's amazing, lol"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Friend did that that Archaeopteryx, dozen and dozen if not hundreds of them.  Just on roam in a huge building with breeding happening at all hours. It was just a frame killer."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I know that feeling man, but then you play for 6 hours straight and remember it is ark and give up again."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I'm really hoping the second game is more optimized. I think I read somewhere that the game is so poorly optimized because they're using the game engine in a way that it wasn't originally designed for, or something like that. They would have to rework a ton of core aspects  of the game at this point and it would be an insane amount of work."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Same here, the game lost my save and it was super depressing. 

I tried to use cheat codes to build what I had before, but it wasn't the same and the whole feeling of earning and working with specific dino is lost.

Also logging out while on a flying dino and logging back in to falling to your death, far away from base and losing said dino was always thr worst."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I keep trying other games with good build mechanics  but CKFR always brings me back to ark
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Took me a solid minute to realize you did not in fact have a typo. Stronghold was a solid series.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,It's about building too.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I don't think so
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Envious gamers be like
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,So is it safe to assume you have no hobbies or leisure time? How sad
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,What‚Äôs it like being a $60 hooker?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,So free Time to enjoy yourself is wasted time for you? Yikes‚Ä¶
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,You're on /r/gaming and you've never spent 100 hours playing a game?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Must suck not to have free time.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"The building parts he used are actually from a mod called CKFR - Castles, Forts and Keeps Remastered. They aren't in the base game."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I used a mod through steam for the building materials called Castles Keeps Forts: Remastered (CKFR)
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,This was the only angle I could find that actually showed everything. Ark render range is bunk
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,If I can't have an army of dinosaurs what's the point
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Myth of Empires looks really cool, but the whole lawsuit is sketchy.  Looks like it‚Äôs been ongoing for a while now, and the game hasn‚Äôt returned to Steam."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"But square bases are what you get when you want efficient bases in ark. You're probably the first person to look at this impressive castle and think ""efficient""."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Render range and fps
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Best I can do is 23 frames. And your CPU will be on fire the entire time.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I literally have 32gb of ram, a 3060 and a 10400f yet when I see a big metal box someone made I get 30 fps :("
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Specs?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Me playing ark mobile ‚ÄúI could totally build that.‚Äù
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,A few grand in for ARK.. wow
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Oof. Sounds like that game needs some better optimization.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Go on then, I'll bite


What's the specs? Spare no detail, oc and all lmao go for it"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,[removed]
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,It should be playable on default settings. Which it just isn't
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Yeah that was my experience with the game, but I took it too far. One hitting high level Dino‚Äôs, and a full inventory in seconds."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I only play with other people on their servers so it's never in my control lol. I'm not too interested in playing alone.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,So like you have to make your own server with your own rules?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Rule #2 of Ark:

Prepare to lose more loved ones than a George R.R. Martin novel"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"No, no. He was making dino nuggets"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,breading doesnt mean 'making bread'
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Me once a year.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,[removed]
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Same! In fact I just might start a new project tonight thanks to this post. Awesome work. Out of all the games I've tried though, ARK just has the best building mechanic in my opinion."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,":( main reason I don't play as much anymore, it's so immersion breaking"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"Rhino, elephants, and bears are suitable replacements."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"As someone who enjoys to RP i dont take efficient in consideration (unless you can hide it), i prefeer awesome looking builds over efficient but boring ones, but is just because i enjoy building cool looking stuff more than anything."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,23 frames... per week?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Next time dont get an F processor.  Not saying its hindering your performance on this, but think of it like this, Intel doesn't have a fab that makes video-less CPUs, they have 1 fab and they just take the failed GPU portion of it and disable it, and call it an F. Just get a K next time and allow the gpu to be disabled when you put in a video card."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"A few grand these days probably equals a build with at least 32 gig ram and

cpu - 5800x3D/5950x/12900k

gpu - 6800xt/6900xt variant or 3080/3090 variant"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Except the low fps
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Those settings are intentionally arduous to discourage official server use. Lots of private servers means less official ones needed and that's $$$$
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,It‚Äôs meant to be played with large group servers on default settings. If you are playing solo or even with just 2 people on default you are going to have a bad time.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I've played ARK on and off since it was in alpha or whatever and I've never found it to be all that unplayable like some claim. Sure, over time the ""beach bob"" experience becomes easier as your get more skilled - but it's just a game with a learning curve imo. A lot of the ""Bad experiences"" can simply be attributed to bad luck/spawning in a hard-rate zone."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"If you just go with the recommended spawn locations, it's not very hard. Dinosaurs have very specific regions they're in."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"It definitely is, I've got hundreds of hours on each map on default."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Cries in playing official and 100% imprinting multiple Wayverns.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Lmao we've all been there.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,You don't have to. It's just designed to be played with larger groups. So if you want to have the best experience for solo or you and a couple friends you'll want to change some things.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Rule #3 of ark: If it should work it probably wont. vice versa
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,Yeah and parasuars can't operate modern cooking utensils... Nor do they actively exist. Don't read too much into it.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"The goddamn game executable is *still* just ShooterGame.exe.  I love Ark, but holy cow do I hate Wildcard."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Yeah, that sounds about right. I'm sure they probably have a whole giant list of things to do differently for the second game. It'll probably make maintenance on the game so much easier for them too."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"I agree, only with regards to the well developed mods though. I'm so glad I could inspire you to build something new! You should totally post what you build. C:"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"""efficient and awesome"" was your language"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,look at Mr. Richpants achieving 23FPWs over there.. im sure you have your *choffeur* make air waves at your PC

x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"It made me remember my old laptop. It was able to run fortnite at 20spf (seconds per frame). But hey, if it is able to open the game, it runs it!"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,What about kf?
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"I actually do know how it works, I opted for it cus it was cheaper."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,What are you on about? They have a 3060 and an F series processor so there is no way they're using an iGPU. The bad frame rate is probably related to poor optimization. The only reason to get a K series Intel processor is if they want to overclock. Having an F is completely fine for the vast majority of users even for gaming. Especially for gaming in fact since it requires you to get a dedicated GPU. They're totally fine with an F series CPU. Your argument sounds like they should get a better process just to disable a feature of that better processor. *Insert confused Jackie Chan face*
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,You might be on to something
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"It's still pretty bad. 2XP and 2 taming rate servers are very common for that reason.

Obviously aside from the fact that it's just by design a huge timesink of a game"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"It's not even about difficulty, it's about the stupid amount of time you need to invest and the relative ease at which you can lose it. Double on pvp servers"
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"This always blew my mind. If you can't change your project name, you could at least change the compiled binary name, or just add a post-compilation ""rename"" step. It's crazy."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"Yeah the vanilla parts are meh. Mods are where it's at. 

I have a couple of pictures lying around of previous projects but I'm not sure if I should post them."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Kids so spoiled today... (and this next part is true) we used to get 1-2 frames per day doing ray-traced images on an Amiga back in the 80s. GPUs these days are f'ing insane.
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,Dudes so poor he can't even spell chauffeur
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"They're the same thing really, KF is just a K without the graphics processor."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"Again i said it wasn't affecting their performance. You should almost always buy a K, it has higher clocks and allows for higher sustained clock speeds when coupled with the proper motherboard.  Not just for over clocking but for everyday usage the turbo speed is higher than the non K version. Again an F series processor is cheaper BECAUSE its a failed regular series processor or K varient, if you dont understand why thats true, read what i said before, there isn't 3 lines of manufacturing, there is 1, and if it fails to meet a standard in the iGPU it is disabled and called an F. If it meets a higher standard its a K, thats the way intel has done it for over a decade."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"back in the day you'd tame a max level rex and it would take like 2 hours of frantic farming.  that's not reasonably gameplay.

and i just looked it up again and that hasn't really changed, they just added a few things you could do to speed it up but it's still about an hour but much less of it active.

but the breeding is still stupid long.  5 hours to hatch an egg (doesn't fit in an average play session)  9h15m baby time where you need to feed it by hand.

that's ridiculous.

no wonder you get multiplier servers."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,I played it for about a month pretty intensively with 2 other friends and we *barely* were able to manage at default. There were some insanely great moments scattered in there but so much just stupid crap you gotta deal with. On console public server at least. Like the big Trex thing that wipes your first weeks worth of progress. And the fact that if you take a month long break from the game all your stuff despawns lol that really was the nail in the coffin. We hopped back on and there was nothing left. I also accidentally killed our only dragon cause I didn't realize they take fall damage hahaha. Killed any and all motivation to return to the game

x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-03,"Changing the project name in visual studio is generally trivial. It will modify your namespace and references for you, then you clean build and call it a day. If anything there may be some minor hand reworking but if it is causing major problems you've probably hard coded shit that you shouldn't have hard coded, and if that's the case you deserve the bugs it causes and the time it takes to fix them. The Assembly and Application classes should have all the properties you need without having to even pinvoke anything nowadays. That's all assuming you want to actually change the project name and not just the executable."
x3vwcj,2022-09-02,2022-09-02,"LOL, floating _reflective_ spheres!

I remember playing Guild Wars 1 for the first time, and after playing awhile realizing THE CUT SCENES ARE BEING RENDERED IN REAL TIME!!!

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"That's a really nice build, what mods are you using? Or has Ark actually added THAT much to vanilla since I last played?

The windows, pillar/posts and the roof all look like they must be mods?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,100% Thought this was Skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I hope your on a fairly friendly server because it would be pretty shity if that got ruined by some breaking it to steal stuff or just to break it and be an ass hole

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,This looks exactly like the cabin from the Fable 2 dlc expansion
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Reminds me slightly of the cabin in Until Dawn :D

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yeah there‚Äôs pvp or pve servers. The pvp are where all the assholes are but in pve you can‚Äôt tame the dino‚Äôs so it‚Äôs kinda a rock and a hard place, either deal with the assholes or basically play mine craft extreme lol."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Reminds me COD, don‚Äôt remember which one"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"So many comments mentioning Skyrim, but honestly I thought it was Kirrito and Asuna's house from Sword Art Online."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I was just about to ask for a skyrim nexusmods link..
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Dude it looks like the COD MW II cabin
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Fuck those railings off. Glitchey mofos
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Looks nice, I miss this game"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks cozy as hell
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"It gives me skyrim vibes, nice."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Pretty cool? It looks awesome!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks like a cabin from RDR2 in Tall Trees.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Are you Todd?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thought this was a Skyrim post at first glance
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,We want a tour inside.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Ark is a severely underrated game
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Reminds me of the cabin at the end of the movie shooter.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Bob Ross liked it.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,What mods did you use for this?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Holy shit, I keep dying like after level 10-15..."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I first thought of that one cod mission in mw2
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It‚Äôs ‚Äútodd howard‚Äù of a brain. We all see installed Skyrim on a refrigerator but how about installing Skyrim inside a totally another game?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Woah! Looks straight out of Skyrim.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Syrian vibes

Edit: Skyrim vibes mr autocorrect, its Skyrim vibes..."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Look like Skyrim btw
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,POG
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You need to learn to MIND YOUR SURROUNDINGS
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"That‚Äôs all fine and dandy, but is it a boathouse?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Do you won‚Äôt to rent it out I need a holiday it looks awesome üò≥üò¨üòÉüëçüèº
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"You gotta have skill to build shit in this game. That looks amazing, great job dude..."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"That's really nice looking, reminds me of when I used to play Skyrim with my son"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,So many logs..... lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,i see some geared Rust gamers running towards it right now
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Is Ark a hard game to get into? I love games that let me build a base
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,My base is literally just a box
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Wait this isn‚Äôt Skyrim?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"""Just tying up some Loose Ends."""
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"damn, its looks nice, not good for protection but it looks nice"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"That is a ton of effort for a house in a survival game, well done!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Until the alpha tribe comes along
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I want it
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Sick skills man
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I've really wanted to play this game, but it looks like every time you die or log out, you loose most of your stuff. I don't know how i could beat the game."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Burn baby burn
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Damn that is dope.  I want to move there
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I‚Äôve been wanting to play ark but I don‚Äôt have any friends that play video games and idk the game well enough to try and join someones group. I‚Äôve always wanted to play rust and it looks very similar.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I struggel making a 10x10 box
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Reminds me of the MW2 map ‚Äúestate‚Äù very well done.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Non PVP I hope haha
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Looks nice, unless on a private map itll most likely be raided"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Dude, if I see a house like that, I ain't raiding it"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I‚Äôm sure the assholes offline raiding you will think so too
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You can build?!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,My dad plays this game....have you looked at atlas? It‚Äôs pretty much ark but pirates and you can build your own boat...this looks crazy good you did an awesome job
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I want interior pictures
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I can't even figure out how to place a sloped roof piece properly.  Well done
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I am getting fucking PVP PTSD triggered reading these comments.

I do not miss online gaming."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,One would say your an arkitect
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I hope your on a PVE server üòÄ
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,wow i thought this game was dead i am glad its still kicking
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"This looks amazing, I have played ark a lot (280 hr) but I have never been capable to build something like this I just get carried away with the game lol."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It's beautiful
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Have you considered building a retaining wall?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"So how is this game? Every time I see it, it looks amazing, but I keep hearing people complain about it so often."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,lol how is this not skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Nice build
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Great job dude!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,first i saw the skyrim building and thinking about playing that but now i know it's ark so thanks for that now i wanna play ark with my friends who never have played ark never before and being the trade from snow plot because i have played 400 hours it :3
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That looks great!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,wow good job („ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ)
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You can build stuff? I thought ARK was a Dino feeding sim.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"BRB, grabbing my tek armor for completely unrelated reasons. ;)"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I haven‚Äôt played this game since the first three months after it came out and this doesn‚Äôt even look like the same game. They must have made it so cool. I miss my dinos...I was on a friends server with him and my college boyfriend. He hasn‚Äôt been online in 3 years and my boyfriend died irl 4 year ago. That server is packed with memories.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Danm that looks good I thought this was rdr for a second
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,i thought it was Fortnite
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,looks cozy
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Really cozy!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Skyrim!!!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Wow, that's breathtaking"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,This reminds me of the book Summer Frost by Blake Crouch üòÖ well done!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,If that‚Äôs a public server man are you gonna need turrets
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Nice try, you can‚Äôt get away with posting a real picture 
!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Damn that looks like it's strait out of Skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I would try to play more of that online, but I find it hard to get into a clan."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks like the [Cabin](https://www.google.com/search?q=udalryk+family+cabin&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiFzrCKjaXsAhVEIt8KHXRkDg0Q2-cCegQIABAC&oq=udalryk+family+cabin&gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzIECCMQJzoHCCMQsAIQJ1CXYliSZGDUZWgAcAB4AIABVogBpAGSAQEymAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&ei=JxR_X8WeMMTE_Ab0yLlo&bih=783&biw=412&client=ms-android-verizon&prmd=imsvn#imgrc=MHVLRl8FNMQR8M) in Skellige when you help Cerys with Udalryk.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Expecting the Dovhakin to walk out onto the porch and shout at me.

Really impressive though, good job man, looks like a fully developed asset from Skyrim."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Are these building options (ie. pillars with diagonal supports) available in the regular game now or is this a mod? I know they add things periodically, but I haven't been on in quite some time."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Hope it's on a private server or map, otherwise people gon raid that"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That‚Äôs makarov‚Äôs safe house from MW2
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It looks almost *exactly* like one you can get in the houses dlc for Elder Scrolls IV
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,This isn't Skyrim?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I wish there was a way to have a private server  on pc without paying money
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Any mods? Playing in aberration with a friend on a private server, would totally use this as inspiration for my next build"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Reminds me of the place in the movie Inception when he's trying to get to that bad guy...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Wait I've never played this. YOU CAN BUILD?!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Looks awesome.  
I'd probably give up halfway through because it won't snap properly and just keeps misaligning."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You play with friend's?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,u/repostsleuthbot
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"you build cabins, I shit on a Spinosaurus. isn't ark beautiful"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Reminds me of a role play server I used to play on. The Viking clan had buildings similar to this. Fun times
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Really cool! Kinda looks like a Skyrim house.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Hey everyone! I really appreciate all the love this build is getting! 

If you would like to see more, give me I follow, I post exclusively creative build content :D"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I'd live there in real life if I could. Reminds me of the first little cabin I built in Ark when I made it to the winter biome. It wasn't nearly as cool as yours, but the fireplace inside it saved my butt 100 times when it started getting dark on me"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I loveee Ark, but man is the building clunky and difficult sometimes. This looks amazing!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,cabin? that's a mansion
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It looks like a default asset in a AAA game. Good job!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,i thought it is skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Do you play cross platform? I haven‚Äôt played it in a good while, I‚Äôm flat out grinding Rocket league at the minute haha"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Damn! That looks awesome
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Wow that destroys mine! How did you get the fence to work on the wood foundation!?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks great! Reminded me of one of the R6 maps :]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Snow region isn't very nice so wooden structure there probably doesn't do very well but it looks good.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,you're finally awake :D hahaha
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I find it hard to play games like this because i dont want to have to make an agreement with my neighbors (clan of 12 year olds that dont work) everytime i log off to make sure i dont lose everything.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,pfft u didn't even build a cloud district good thing because u wouldn't even go there often smart thinking.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That straight up looks like something out of skyrim. Pretty neato
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,How did you find somewhere flat enough for a place like that? Impressive.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks really nice! What map?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Oh man I miss ARK.  My clan was breeding ultra-powerful Quetzals (if you breed two perfect tames with different stats, you can end up with the best of both.  Keep repeating anytime you can find a perfect tame with a stat higher than your superbreed).  So much Quetzal-eugenics to get that perfect baby haha."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,S+?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought this was skyrim tbh. Nice job!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,For the limited building creation in that game compared to conan exiles it looks like a masterpiece
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Can someone who never played the game start now or will I just be destroyed by other players
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Bro I love it. Looks amazing. This is my problem, I‚Äôll want to play a pvp server for the fun of fighting but then build some shit like this and get pissed off when it‚Äôs wrecked a week later"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,Thats fucking sick but goddamn do I hate this game lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,This is stunning! Exactly what I had hoped to build!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,Until the offline raid...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,It looks so dang cozy I love it!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,it kind of looks like Kiritos and Asunas cabin in Sword art online.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-11,Ark Creative Build
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-30,Is that prim+ or base game?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I legit thought it was skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Hi. Skyrim would like to get their house back. Nice work tough!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Jarl is proud son.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Skyrim vibes
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That just seems like skyrim with extra steps.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"No, sir. This is a house in Skyrim and you can't convince me otherwise"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks like Skyrim.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You mean Skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You mean Skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I almost thought this was in Skyrim.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought this was skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It reminds me of skyrim
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thought this was a Skyrim screen shot for a sec
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I honestly thought this was some Skyrim mod when I first saw it so wow, good job  


you can have one cookie  


here you go \*gives cookie\*"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I litterally thought this was skyrim lmao
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Ark is a cool concept for a game. The community is absolute garbage and completely turned me off ever playing it, though."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Which Skyrim hold did you build it in?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought it was Skyrim at first
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Downvoted cus of the ""im different than everyone else"" emoji in your title. It looks fucking stupid like some fucking clown"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-12-11,Building mods make ark just do much better
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same I thought it was Morthal
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Looks a lot like 7dtd
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Best compliment OP could get.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,My literal first thought was that this was in skyrim and was just gonna comment saying it
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Aye, it's the new Elder Scrolls"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Pretty sure I saw this on my way to the college of winterhold.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Hey your finally awake!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I love you all. Thank you for existing and making me think we may be closer to hive mind.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thought it was x
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I was certain this was the inn where you kill the real Gourmet.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Bruh same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Came here to comment this. Glad we have all wasted too many hours into that game
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,Same. Thought it was a skurim mod house for a moment.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought it was Red Dead Redemption 2
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You‚Äôre finally awake
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Either that or something like a Rex or a titanosaur is going to aggro onto the building
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I stopped playing ark because of the people who play online.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"That's why I stopped playing. The server we were on got raided by a host of Chinese players, and everything that couldn't be stolen was razed. It's been years, but I'm still too salty to pick ARK up again."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Is Ark like Rust?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"And guns, don't forget the guns"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"As much as I've enjoyed ARK, I WISH it was Skyrim with dinosaurs.  My absolute dream game would be a Bethesda-style single player RPG in an ARK-esque setting."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Oh god. Pvp trauma is real though.

Eventually discovered never owning property is the best option, with different 1x3x3 stone camouflaged crafting stations hidden in the trees, scattered around, and a vault hidden in the coral that you update with valuables/mats etc constantly.

Because you will be a poor man come sun up."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Luckily its pve. Or I hope it is...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Ah yes, the Rust effect."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thanks! Check out my profile. All I do is creative builds on ark lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Nah. Definitely using mods from the steam workshop. 

All of what you see here is the 'Castles, Keeps, and forts: Remastered' mod"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,">Ark actually added 

Ha!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I‚Äôm with ya
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Lol. Yeah. PvE only when I'm building creative
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,*the Theri isn't real. The Theri can't hurt you
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yup, that mission is a rush. I love all of the guns you can choose from in the basement, but hate babysitting that damn NAS thing."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thought the exact same thing!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Sorry, but... where do you do WHAT?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I would hold off, is promising but there are a lot of game breaking bugs atm. The devs are very active though"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Atlas has a pseudoquestline, with actual quests, as opposed to ARK's 'Minecraft' style 'main quest'.  But it's real draw is being 'pirate ARK'."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Scattered throughout the surrounding forest, and set to kill all dinos lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I'll be posting a walkthrough or photoset tomorrow on r/ark, including the 2 other buildings from this build. 

Gimme a follow if you like. I post purely creative build content"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"ARK is fun in small-group play, or singleplayer.  Big group play or quasi-MMO it gets too frantic and deadly."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"So, the vanilla building materials can be kinda weird, but my guess is that the top of the door is too low to walk through regularly. You might need to try crouching, or rebuild the doorway to fix the problem"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That's where the 'evolved' comes in lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-11-12,Thanks so much! Put alot of love into it lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Just an architecture nerd who loves gaming lol

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You don't 'beat' games like this.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Hehe, ""a lot"" in Ark starts after 3000+ hours. 280h is not even scratching the surface."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Do...do you think that's real life?  \*Motions for an orderly and some thorazine!\*
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yes. I highly recommend the mod 'Castles, Keeps and Forts: remastered'.

Everything you see here is from that mod"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Lol yup, that's pretty much all I do in it. Check out my profile to see some of the other things I've made on ARK. I have added building materials with mods, but the building feature has always been really cool C:"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Thanks!
Getting the grid points just right is a CONSTANT war of attrition lol. 

Happy Cake Day!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Nah everyone else stopped playing ark lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Brings a tear to my eye xD
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Lol it is ark. I'm using the Castles, Keeps, and Forts: Remastered mod on PC.

And adding more structures to the game is exactly what that mod does. Step back and take a breath xD"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Take a look at my profile for tons of ""not"" ark creative content using the same mod as previously mentioned"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You can set up your own server and only invite people you trust. I don't know anything about hosting game servers but ark server manager made it quite simple.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"There‚Äôs lots of flat spots around. I think it‚Äôs the pilgrims project on YouTube even have some videos that show off locations of big flats areas on maps perfect for bigger builds. Just search for ark flat base locations.

I‚Äôve found that by going into creative mode and moving around really fast it makes it hard for all of the details to load in at the same speed. So I use the lag time to find the spots that, once everything‚Äôs been cut down, will be the flattest to build on. Mind you, I‚Äôm in single player, not sure if it would work on multiplayer."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"I‚Äôm thinking it must be (or another mod) as I‚Äôve not come across a decorative railing like this playing on ps4. Same goes for the decorative triangle supports beneath the decking.

Beautifully simple and understated build. Even the location adds to its beauty. Very, very nice work, hope we get to see more in the future."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,Yeah me too. But nobody hates ark more than the people who play it religiously xD
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,That's why I'm PvE lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It looks similar to an emoji even tho it‚Äôs not so you downvote it. r/redditmoment
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It's called an emoticon. And get over yourself lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-12-11,Without a doubt. I could do without a dino tlc if they could add more building mat.s to the vanilla game
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Not depressing enough.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought it was buck hunt 4
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,i thought it was minecraft 4K
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought the same thing!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Aren't they all basically interchangable games at this point? Just replace Zombies wtih Dinosaurs/Other Players etc.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Why would you want to be hive mind?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Being in PvE, the Dinos are my real fear lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I got it some time ago but I still have to fire it up once. I'm just really hesitant because I've seen so many people complaining about the toxic players / griefers. 
As far as I know it's server based, so are there servers were griefing etc is forbidden? Kinda like minecraft free build back in the days."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I just play on with friends only, pretty fun for a while but inevitably we tame enough dinos and gather enough resources that there is nothing left to do"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Like Rust with dinosaurs
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Oof, too soon?...

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"A friend of mine has played Ark for over 9,200hrs. Over a year of her life spent playing one game. Crazy."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,If you play on single-player with enough mods...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"There are pvp ones with solid mods on it and rules that limit what can be done.

I used to play a server with prevent offline damage on, and where you are not allowed to do more damage then neccasary. Obviously that's a bit of a grey area, but in general it meant no destroying of foundations and all that. Rebuilding would take lile a day at most, because 80% would still be standing."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I REALLY loved the building mechanics of Ark. I too enjoy busing over anything else.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"~~Have you use Castles, Keeps, Fortresses mod?  The castles that you can build are incredible.~~

I saw elsewhere that it is the CKF mod.  that one is EPIC."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I was about to ask how you got the parts to click together so well without gaps. I'm definitely going to check out that mod.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Same
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I don't see any pillars littering the surrounding area claiming the territory. Must be fake :p.  
  
Looks real nice tho."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Dear God, I've lost too many Rexes and shoulder pets because a tickle chicken got mad at me for breathing."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Are they birds are they real?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Don't worry, it's actually just a stillborn that you dug up from their back yard."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Well it doesn't actually... Ehm... It's complicated, ok?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Not going to spoil it.  Just YouTube it to understand if you want.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,ammo for dayssssssss
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Thanks for your answer but i already tried and it didnt work out is it maybe bc i build  on specific ground (like sand )?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Now thats epic, using gaming for architecture needs are good too. Maybe u can be a personal builder if u feel like it :)"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Nabbed it while it was free during quarantine actually! Its just been sitting in my library needing a reason to play
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I remember watching on youtube, there's a final boss and story and everything. It looks so cool but if i die or log out once I'm back to square one."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Thought so! Were using that, plus the science fiction one of the same maker. Looking good, survivor"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That sucks :c
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Ok but wheres the fun in that? I want a more fair experience, not a boring one."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"Okay cool, so far I've just played on a server I've made with a friend on ark server manager. We've just been running around figuring it out and at one point we made it to the swamp and had to keep running up the mountain for metal. We kept running into T-rexes and hyanas on this run so we built a bridge from the swamp to the mountain base. It is the jankest four lane bridge ever due to arks building rules."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,I definitely see your point lolol. Seriously good work on this though!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"So very, very true. 

‚ÄúI love playing fortnite‚Äù Hours played 200

‚ÄúI HATE Ark‚Äù Hours played 2842.  LOL"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"thought it was....  nvm, Its too soon.."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,">level

Thought it was Falkreath"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Too much life.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I thought it was Until Dawn
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yup... Years ago I spent so much time figuring everything out solo, grinding, taming... Making a base...PvE

One day I logged in and everything was completely fucked and looted... Looked like a dino agroed on something and passer bys finished the rest. Never logged in again dude. I miss the idea of the game, but fuck that shit."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Then there is my family approach.  Start a dedicated server on our gaming server, password protect it, and load the mods we want and the multipliers that we want"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Thats why I have 3 bases atm. 

The first on the southern beaches made of wood, but protected by a stone wall, that cuts off the entire peninsula. 

Second one is also made of wood, but its on such a steep plateau, that without ladders of flying mounts its inaccessible, and anything near the ground is a stone structure. 

Third one is up in the snow and finally made fully of stone and I am yet to see any damage worth repairing. 

Then again I only play local multiplayer with a friend of mine and not on public servers. Much less headache due to griefing or dinos while Im offline."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,If youre on steam you should come build cool things on my PaD server
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"If you find one, let me know. In my experience its always the server owners that grief the most."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"singleplayer is an option.  Also non-dedicated sessions (which use the host's SP save, so be warned).

There's no way to prevent griefing.  I've heard of people luring T-rex alphas and running them halfway across the map to tear up some guy's place in PVE.  That's Atlas's biggest advantage over ARK--you aren't luring a stone-destroying mob across an ocean to someone's base two islands away, so if you set up house on a safe-ish island, and build from stone, you're pretty much set in PVE."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Do you not do the dungeons?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,What the fuck? I didn't even knew that quote
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Is nowhere safe from this news? :(
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"It is by far the most addicting, grindy game I have ever played."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,HIGH key you should. One major aspect of them that goes unused alot is the [Structure Variants]. Make sure you check the options on the building materials after you place them
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I wish console could have at least this one mod :(
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,They always come out of nowhere too xD completely empty clearing for 30mins. Turn around. The tickle chicken wants to play
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Ah, cool. Typical Sunday morning activity"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Thanks for the advice and for not spoiling it. I think I‚Äôll refrain from searching ‚Äúput baby in oven‚Äù in YouTube. You know, just in case."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"It's boosted, so it may not be too impressive. But somewhere around 250k bullets"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"If you're up on a foundation, the terrain shouldn't matter"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Oh, I thought it was just an endless sandbox of violence and toxicity like rust. My b"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Thanks! The science fiction one looks really cool, haven't build with it yet but I'm fixin' to reacreate a mini jurassic park with it lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Well I set the server up with a friend and then invited people via Discord for us all to work together on building a base etc. which was fun. Plus being able to tweak certain aspects of the game in terms of quality of life was nice, though that is totally optional."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"Tame yourself up a pteranodon. They‚Äôre one of the easiest tames in the game and once you are airborne the entire map opens up to you. 

When one lands just throw a bola at it and then shoot it with tranq arrows til it goes to sleep. I‚Äôve even seen people use a slingshot to knock one out. Then feed it a bunch of meat. You can craft the saddle from your inventory and it doesn‚Äôt require much.

Mind you, you‚Äôll need to put a lot of points into weight to be able to move metal, but even so, it will mean you can reach all corners of the map quite easily. Just remain aware of the stamina at all times. Nothing worse than running out of stamina right in the path of a pissed off rex lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,Thanks dude!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,Exactly bahahaha
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,what....
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yeahh. I was in the same boat. Built an awesome base and had all my dinos. Then poof. 

ARK pvp doesn't permit you to sleep lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Games great until you run into the many mechanics that require you to minmax the game to not be totally fucked. Between the permastun dinos, the no-counterplay-without-parachute spiders, and the alphas that seem to require traveling with a horde of assistants it really does spoil the fun doesnt it."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"They do a terrible job at managing social interactions in the game.  You're just as likely to get an aggroed animal opening your base as you are to find acres and acres of perfectly settle-able land, occupied by thousands of single fence-posts."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,People just kite dinos to your base with flying dinos. I stopped playing when they nerfed the flying speed.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,I absolutely adore ark but every single time I get anywhere the next day everything is gone from people coming by but I just can‚Äôt play PvE because I feel like thats just being a chicken and admitting I lost so therefore o have dumped hundreds of hours into ark trying to make a stable base and to this day I have yet to make an actual base
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"XD m8 try playing 1x pvp, shit takes hours to get a small wood hut and the next day if you are a fucking idiot it is raided, you have to hide yo shit in Ark"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,PM discord details. I'll play
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Single Player or non dedicated servers for the win. Don't even have to worry about Base or dino management very much.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Playing on a private server with my friend now. A few great mods, multipliers are increased, no assholes (except the packs of raptors). Life is good, until I log back on to find a spino slipped by defenses lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Having admins god-mode my tribe because they got bored, while at the same time having a contrasting rule that you couldn't raid them after months of us being there promoting the server was my final straw. Best part was them denying up and down it didn't happen as if tribe logs don't exist - come to find out they do this every few months to the alpha from the past two alphas.

I'm sure there are good admins out there, but I've yet to see it."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Yeah, like what is this? Someone from r/OutOfTheLoop tl;dr?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Honestly, if the game worked better and didn't have rubber band-ing issues I probably would have put a lot more than 500hrs in."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Ok i try again later but thanks for the help
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Oh, heck yea! That'll look great, for sure :) that's what I'm going with for my fences/gates, not as patient with the home building as you or my cohort, he's got a whole village going on lol"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,Oh we've upgraded since then. We have a hoard of rexes and a few argentavis.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Must be Kvatch... 
*War helicopters flow through mind*"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"When playing alone with no clan, I had an amazing strategy. I made hundreds of little buildings all over the place. Each with a bed, and a chest. About 90% had nothing in them, but the few select buildings had my cache in them. Sometimes people would try wasting resources to break in, but after a few buildings of getting nothing they would give up.... that is until the great purge. That is when I learned about massive multi server clans that would pool resources, and move to other servers to establish dominance. A dude came in on a fucking Griffin and dropped 20+ c-4 charges, and carpet bombed my beautiful strat into the wind. I quit that day for good. Terrible community in that game."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"No it doesn‚Äôt , many pve servers aren‚Äôt much better. Lotta people just lure alphas to you‚Äôre base and watch em stomp through it."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Playing pvp is something you have to learn. It's a completely different game. It's like when you finish the singleplayer version of a game and move onto multiplayer (I'm thinking of like halo 3 Era when people actually still played campaigns). Once you know how to survive against the ai dinos you can move on to learning how to survive against other players. It's of course not for everyone but unless you are trying to build a massive fort in the open you can definitely find time for other things in life.

For example everything valuable I own in pvp is in a 1 foundation 'base'. It's nothing you would call a base but it works. It's only 1 ceiling high and has a bed inside. There's a vault placed on the ceiling but this whole thing is in a little nook underwater. Also I have about 3 or 4 of these 'bases' set up, one other with a vault and one that's stashed near an obelisk on land that just has a bed, smithy, and pestle all crammed into the one foundation. If I log on and my most valuable stuff is miss it's unlikely that my backup and backup's backup bases will also be gone. Each one has flak and some basic tools. Luckily the auto decay timer on metal structures is high so I could probably get away with playing once a week but I'm on every weekend and usually once during the week to check on things and really just reset the decay timers. The base on land has been broken into and relocated a few times but I don't think anyone has found my underwater spot. 

I'm definitely straying from my point but at least on a pvp server everyone agrees that they can be assholes. I'm really hesitant on pve servers because of the players that think it's some kind of competition and block off crap or get your stuff killed."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You can transfer your character and some stuff to a PVP server after you get established in PVE with those obelisks in the sky.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I've definitely done it back in the day. I remember spending multiple nights between a rock and a fire, so I don't get killed. It took me so much work to get a 2x2 hut with a bed and I felt so accomplished lmao"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Single player with boosted rates is very chill.  After the initial survival experience and you get a good base established, I kick on a podcast and basically just play dinosaur rancher.

Then I take my babies into a boss and weep openly as they all die horrible deaths."

j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Adam Kovic got catfished and pics/videos of him sexting, masturbating, and having sex with his wife were leaked online. Some of the pictures were of him masturbating at the workplace. Also, it seems like his wife was unaware of him sharing their personal sex tape.

So, he stepped down from his job at FunHaus and is currently trying to erase his social media accounts and step away from the internet."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That's what I'm working on here lol. There's actually 2 other cabins and a nice fish & tackle shack by the lake
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"I kind of figured you may have, but not until after I‚Äôd typed all that so I hit send anyways lol 

I love argys. I love taking my army and anky to the top of the hill opposite the volcano for metal runs. Collect crazy amounts.

Cryo balls totally revolutionised metal runs"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Tribe I was in cleared all the bobs off the server every couple of weeks, reckoned they attracted trolls. I always thought we should nurture em like a militia."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Ark is one of my all time favorites.  I played exclusively on private PVE servers.  Good times.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Its like that with every pvp survival game, rust, ark, even stuff like minecraft factions. In my opinion the best way to play a game like ark is to host a pve server yourself for your friends and you to have fun on. Of course if you love the pop and stuff like that then you'll have a completely different opinion."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,That's why I have dozens of dinos only turrets in the surrounding forest. Lol. I don't wanna see any dino within 5 clicks of this cabin
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It's crap like that which keeps me off of 'official' servers.  I stick to singleplayer or to servers set up with my gaming clanmates.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"XD, yea, what map you play, i play rag and i go hide in canyon with Dillo's on turret mode"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"XD pretty much this, yup"

Wow.....that's your take?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,Ooh now cryoballs is something I haven't gotten to. Ark has unfortunately taken a backseat to my research. But thanks for the good advice anyhow!
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Bobs?
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Honestly, your tribe (and probably every other like it) sounds like it's absolutely terrible to the health of the game if you just keep killing off any new players that try to play"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"My tribe tried to do that but they did keep attracting trolls, doing stupid shit and getting wiped they ended up costing us to much to keep helping them build we just let them die out"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I enjoyed PvE, until my game crashed when trying to go cave diving... basically never was able to check out certain parts of the game. There is a lot I like about Ark, but ultimately it's just not for me."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Ice got a weird modded server looking for cool peeps. I run weekly events
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I have not, nor will I. From what I've heard it is torture porn."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Nice. I miss ark. I‚Äôve spent over 3000 hrs in game, the community just got to me in the end. I hope you enjoy your time surviving!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"You may have said elsewhere, but about how long to complete it?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"I'm on PC and looking for a good server, I've got one with me. We've been burnt badly but love the game itself - if you're every interested in growing your population by two let me know!"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,When memes go bad
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,You just gonna carpet bomb a comment and leave or you gonna provide some context as to why that isn‚Äôt accurate? Geez...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-12,"Cryoballs are awesome. I was away from the game when they were introduced so I was blown away when I got to try them. I especially love the way you can use them to get your Dino out of a spot where they are thoroughly stuck. Where once you simply lost your tame, now you cryo pod them and throw them out a few feet away. Also very handy for getting them past choke points in caves. But best of all I think is the ability to transport multiple tames without losing them. 

By far the best change to Ark in recent years imho"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"New players are often called bobs in ark, since many of them forget to name themselves."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Bob stands for Born on Beach, it describes noobs who have just started. Most tribes will leave them alone for awhile to get a bit established then raid them for resources."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,"Yep, totally agree. Unfortunately the only way to last is spend real money and flatten everyone except your allies. 
I quit a few months ago, awesome game but the most toxic thing I‚Äôve played by far."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Just being non toxic on home server would do it. Never worked anyway. As soon as people see a quiet server you get all the solos looking to find a spot. It just happens in cycles. Better the bobs you know maybe.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,It's probably the most horrifically coded game I've ever played.  One of the servers I played on my buddy used Linux instead of Windows and you just couldn't go in caves on Linux.  I haven't played in a year or so but I'd bet money your axe still reflects on the ocean... That's... not how light works.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,The PvE community is alot less toxic lol
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,2900 hours of those were just taming alone I bet ;p
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,The community is even worse than For Honor...
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Not gonna waste my time when there are a hundred articles about the dude just so some salty neckbeards can come and brigade for their hero.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Bob = born on beach
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,"Lol no, pre release the default male name was bob. New players who built on the beach were called beach bobs. Bob stuck as an insult."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Been thinking about trying it.  Done everything from solo official, small group of friends, all sorts of unofficial servers, and was even an officer in a mega-tribe (never again...  the chores they give are so shitty and it's like a second job pretty much.  The PvP fights were fucking insane).

But the one thing I've never tried is PvE.  Do you do it on official, or unofficial?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Mostly building turret towers and farming mats for me. Also setting up boss fights for people. Thats mainly what I liked to do, run caves, get artifacts and fight bosses."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Bah, you‚Äôre already wasting time. GG"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Could at least link one lmao.

Did you ever cite resources in school? Or just tel the teacher to find them?"
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,[deleted]
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"Unofficial modded is the best. 

So many amazing quality of life mods created by the community - and then Dino overhauls that make it a better experience than just traditional Ark. I can‚Äôt even imagine playing Vanilla outside of my iPad when I‚Äôm just relaxing, when on a computer the overhauls make it so much better. Tiered progression, utility elemental dinosaurs that have different abilities, and alt attacks with their element, and then aesthetic building mods. Of course this isn‚Äôt for everyone, but if you can find a server with a good overhaul using battlemetrics and has S+ since the improvements in building are so good. 

Also one with a decent binocular set. 

If you want a list of mods to look out for let me know."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Unofficial is the way to go.
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,Here's one of the salty neckbeards now........
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,"For sure! I'll definitely take that list, I want to get that DLC and start playing again soon.  It's amazing to see how far the game has come with all the mods now.

Most modded servers I've played on had very little, just some QOL mods - most of which I think have been added to the game, it was some machine stuff that I can't recall because it was long ago.  The only building mod we had was some glass stuff that was supposed to be as strong as metal (it was greenish-tint, two-way, can't recall the name of the mod)."
j75it6,2020-10-08,2020-10-09,"Chrons servers are great. Great community that I've been playing with for years. Lots of mods but he and his team spend hours balancing many things manually and he stays involved with the community some what. Discord is fairly active and others are extremely helpful.

Edit: just look up ""chrons"" on arkservers(dot)net."

xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Wait, so ARK is Minecraft with dinosaurs?"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I have fallen down a similar bridge many times in winterhold‚Ä¶
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Heavily modded private servers are like Minecraft, you can build some wild stuff"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Herbivore island? Think I tried building a giant wall / gate in that same spot once.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Looks like a brutalist monstrosity 

Love it"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,It looks like the pont du Gard in the south of France. https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/56bc41ddc58da4aa0494897c4915679c-pont-du-gard.jpg?auto=format&q=40&ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=center&fm=auto&w=1075
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I got ark for free from epic, but have not played it in part due to the size. 

how long does it take to build a bridge like this? what kind of server do you play on? Are there PvE servers you can join? Can others destroy your bridge?"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Really like that Medici style middle section. üòé
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,That looks fucking amazing. As someone who used to be completely addicted to building crazy shit in ark I love this and I‚Äôm very impressed.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,What a great job
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Ark on the front page? Be still my giga heart. Looks awesome dude.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,And it only took 12 trillion stone right?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I would play this game if I had enough space for it
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Is there a game where you can recreate or make bridges, castles, urban sprawl to space station with this type of graphics and physics? These days, I spend my time wanting to build/farm things than shoot things."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Nah, bro building Segovia in Ark üíÄ"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Mother russia is looking for your ability to build bridge !
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,You must've had a Roman architect as an ancestor.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,That's really cool!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"bro this is fucking great , really really really great , nice job"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Bruh you are evolved
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,About to re download...I hate that game so much but I can't stop üò≠
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Bridge or viaduct?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Guild Wars 1 :)
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Time for a Bridge Review.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I can feel the lag thru the non moving screenshot
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,How much lag and or glitches did you run into will building it
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Reminds me of a bridge in The Last Guardian
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,You‚Äôre a shadow of the colossus fan?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Building in ark is just so terrible tho how do you have the patience
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Man i had so much hope that this game was gonna be good
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Impressive
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Nice arks
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,In the process of downloading that game right now. I can‚Äôt wait to play!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Looks like the bridge from the new top gun
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Nice abutments, bro."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Haven‚Äôt played in yrs
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Beauty bridge, god forbid you go to sleep though because it'll probably get wrecked :(."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I hope a T. rex doesn‚Äôt come running through‚Ä¶.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Are you an architect or?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Dudes out here in the world of shadow of the colossus
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Getting Dark Souls PTSD looking at this
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Ark still exists?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"When I saw this, I first thought of Akkala Pass in BotW."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Who would approach the bloody gate?!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Look at Isambard Kingdom Brunel here! This is incredible.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Wait, you can build things other than wooden/thatch rectangles in Ark?"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Gondor answers your call
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Jeez I was excited when I started incorporating sloped roofs onto my boxes‚Ä¶
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"this looks awesome!

but is it still weighing like 80 gbs on disk?

man I really really miss ARK if only i could fit it, i would tame so many parasaurs"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Is there a way to mod the game like this if I‚Äôm a console player? I pay for a server on Nitrado and am curious if I can just add mods to that?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Putin is on the phone for you
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Pov: Rome
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"So will this bridge stay built forever? Or are there server resets that just destroys your work? 

I‚Äôve never played the game, but I‚Äôve heard about it."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Holly Jesus, this is amazing!"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Am I the only one who thinks this looks just like the bridge from shadow of colossus???

Nvm it‚Äôs been a while since I played shadow of colossus üòÖ"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Would play this game is it wasn't 350 gb lol
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Anyone else thinking Jak 3?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,For a moment I thought this was Minecraft with some shaders and a texture pack. Just a small moment.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,And WHAT have the Romans EVER given US in return?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Is this game good? I‚Äôve seen it but it looked a little cheaply made for some reason
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"Now cover it in dodos, it is it's true purpose."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Holy fuck this is insane
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,pokemon sword and shield reference?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,The amount of stone that had to be harvested for this endeavor... I'm pretty sure I just heard the ghosts of my Ankylosauruses wailing from the great beyond.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Creative or survival ether one is just fine
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,keep the Ukrainians away from it
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-28,That's sick
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-12-04,How just how
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-12-07,I like it
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-12-29,This is awesome but maybe touch some of that delici- I meant soft grass
xynfol,2022-10-08,2023-03-14,Is this with structures+?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,This is def with mods (Castles and Keeps i think?) but Ark allows for some crazy building even vanilla
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"As I recall, my usual mainstay was a box on a boat."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Like the other comment said its CKF mod

But depending on when u last last played we got the building mechanics from structure plus into the basegame when orionsun joined studio wildcard"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Makes two of us.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I usually just do ramps with roofs because I can't build anything in this game. O and large boxes
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Came here to say this. Visions of bridge üò¢
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,That one fucking rat always ruined my day
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,That's immediately what I saw.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"ahhh, here I go, linking the Fire again"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Yeah it gives me total Shadow Of Colossus vibes too.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Boss required ahead and then merchant
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Thanks! The frame is based on roman aqueducts and the design is totally gothic victorian!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Victorian architecture was already using suspension technology and wider load bearing arches. This is ancient. Looks more Gothic or Roman.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,[removed]
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Don't all your creations get destroyed every week at reset or am I thinking of another game.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Believe it or not, the GPU is rarely the bottleneck in Ark. It‚Äôs the fact that Ark only can use two CPU cores and is constantly fetching which drags most peoples frame rate down around large builds. If you check your GPU utilization you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs rarely pegged, and your CPU utilization is almost fully maxing out exactly two cores but nothing more. 

Fix I just found recently was the 5800X3D. That extra L3 cache was exactly what Ark needed. I was blitzing around on some random servers on Gen 2 this morning, trying to find the biggest builds I could just to see what it would take to tank then frame rate. But so far nothing has crippled me like when I was rocking a Ryzen 5600X, 3600 or 7th gen i7 before that."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I feel like looking at this screen shot is an actual representation of the FPS I'd get if I played this on my PC
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Dude I love that channel. I would LOVE for him to review my bridges

Edit: I am now having fanciful dreams of a regular gig where I send him bridges I make. Ahhh. Good times lol"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,This is EXACTLY what we need right now. When even was the last bridge review
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Was hoping someone else already asked for a bridge review :D.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I was thinking of him as well. This might be another 9+ that's not made by Matt.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Nah. The Kerch bridge can stay down for now
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Lmao I knew I was gonna find this
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I saw this right under video of the bridge strike and had to laugh. Bad day to be proud of bridges, OP."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Nice bridge you got there, would be a shame if you connect it to the east side of Crimea"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"The insanely toxic community was really the saving grace of that game. I had a huge tribe called 'The Grimey D's' with about 7 guys I know IRL and a bunch of random English, Scottish, and Australian guys. Sometimes we'd be on for days at a time taking 15 minute naps here and there to get perfect bred tames. That game was like a God damn drug addiction but it was without a doubt my favorite gaming experience of my life. I'll always miss the long nights of arguing, grinding, and wiping other tribes. I also used to go around and perform Joe and Bob inspections of small tribes bases. I'd make them open their chests and delete a section of their floor to verify they were not harboring any Joe's or bobs. We came to the conclusion if people didn't care enough to change their name from the pre generated Joe or Bob that they didn't deserve to be on our server."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Ark really is a game you never get good at, you just go a little longer between losing everything, sometimes."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"on many modded servers, the dinos are barely an inconvenience. 

i've played servers where you get 600 player levels and each point in a stat gives an increase of 100 or 1000. imagine playing with 50,000 health and 500% speed

i've fist-fought gigas and won. 

that's an extreme example, but my point is - this guy did not do this on anything like a vanilla server. it would take months just to gather the mats. you could put this up in a few hours on many community servers."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"It isn't exactly ""story mode"" but you can definitely play it single player locally with all of the difficulty sliders adjusted to your liking"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Hope you have the 500gb of free space of whatever obscene number it is these days.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"If youre wanting to creative build, hit TAB then type in GCM and hit enter. GCM stands for ""Give Creative Mode"""
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I'm trying my best :(
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"You're probably better off. But in case you feel the need, just be aware that this game desperately wants to devour your entire life."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Same. I played it once and didn‚Äôt really get it which is disappointing because it looks like a lot of fun
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Is it that one divine tower?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"""easy"" start, let's drop you right in the middle of a herd of veloraptors... Or maybe terror birds..."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,There are roman aqueducts that look almost exactly like that. But it makes sense because I think Trajan was a big fan of Ark: Survival Evolved.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Literally had to dump a couple thousand into my PC to handle my builds lol
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Have you played their DLCs ARK: Hackers Involved
& ARK: Under The Mesh  tho they're kinda cool"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Very much inspired by these structures
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Just looks so damn good
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,its done with a mod. also they built into the terrain/mesh which isnt possible.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Yeah, hi, do you think you could maybe clean up after yourself? I was wondering who was leaving all the piles of crap on the beach.

Some people want a clean beach for their wooden houses and their metal pickaxes thank you."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"You might be on official servers. Try unofficial, much more freedom and less toxicity."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,There‚Äôs no way he did this on a public server lol
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"The two Genesis DLCs have little missions, more like tasks you need to accomplish. Some of them are just fighting off waves of dinos, or a time trial race on the back of a manta, a basketball game played with a dodo as the ball, etc"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Crrative mode gives you unlimited resources
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"It can be. Even without modding you can do wild stuff, and with mods you can do even more."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I don't think you can mod the Epic version, only the Ssteam version.

You can play solo (offline), PVE official (no mods, vanilla rates), PVE modded (hosted and maintained by other players), PVP official, or PVP modded. If you've no interest in playing with non-friends, you can host your own instance and have friends join (you need to be playing for them to play) or you can rent your own server and have friends join you there too (they can play when you're not).

In PVE, this bridge cannot be destroyed by others outside of a few very niche ways (joining your tribe and them dismantling it or leading a powerful dinosaur over who is capable of destroying that tier material). It took at least a couple hours to build this but many hours to understand all the cool stuff you're able to do with the building.

I would recommend trying Epic but ultimately buying on Steam in the long run.

Rates are also able to be adjusted. Taming a Rex with ""vanilla"" rates will take you >4 hours. The rates I play at reduce that to just under an hour. Pretty much, any rate can be changed (harvest amount, health points per level, breeding time, max level, etc)."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"If you're grinding resources on a public server it would take forever. If playing solo, there's a creative mode that lets you build without any resources.

There are definitely PVE servers, and you can also play PVE solo. On PVP servers, your stuff can be destroyed, but on PVE it can only be destroyed if your tribe agrees to a tribe war with another."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"Has it's bugs but certainly not cheaply made. Huge player base. Some prefer Official servers with standard rates, some prefer unofficial servers with boosted rates. I prefer single player so i can use creative mode"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Brilliant. Will start using Dodos for my NPCs
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,Haven't played that one. Curious what you're referring to
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"Between this bridge and the castle (not pictured) that it's leading to, it's probably about 1million stone if you were to build it on survival. Thankfully. I build on creative lol"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-12-29,Are you secretly a goat?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2023-03-14,This was done primarily with the CKF:R mod
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Correct  it's built with the CKFR mod. Does not offer prefab structures but the building materials look alot nicer
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Yeah if you've got the patience for it. I love the building system and have created some cool buildings. Nothing as cool as this though.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Reminds me of the bridge I made when the game was young and I still played. It was quite massive and had a under section that was my armory, complete with multiple stations for building guns, ammo, armor and everything I might need for war.

Then there was the lag inducing pyramid I constructed. Took a long time to amass all the stone I needed, but it was worth it. Combined with the bridge nearby, it would nearly crash the game when flying over my base."

xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Totally reminds me of the bridge at [Ronda](https://imgur.io/gallery/VHrWiha) and the [aqueduct of Segovia. ](https://i.imgur.com/dN0SJqW_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)

xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I've never played the game, but my first thought was to wonder if it's possible to make the aqueduct functional."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,The first thing that came to my mind was indeed the Roman aqueducts. Beautiful.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"It made me think of the Roman aqueduct of Segovia, Spain."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Yep, came here to say the same."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Depends on server settings. Officials pretty much never wipe. Unofficials and single player worlds are entirely at the discretion of the owner
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I love the 5800x3d. Total game changer.

xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I think it was a few videos ago - he had a sponsored video where he showed a picture of the devs, two of whom were posed up like a bridge.

so, obviously, he did it in the following video."

Honestly I don't even need mods that alter leveling or difficulty of fighting; I just don't like the severe death penalty that discourages me from exploring far.  I'm not super into building either, so basically I need mods that kinda negate the two primary aspects of these games lol.  I saw another comment about prefab building mods; would love that and something that keeps me from losing all my shit when dying, or at least offers an alternative, more reliable, way to get it back when my body is extremely dangerous to get to.  I loooove exploring in these games, but the other mechanics get in the way of that for me and I lose interest very fast."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,It's perfectly possible on something with just boosted rates. Once you get a doed and a argy you're good to go.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"oh damn, thanks for the info, I'll take a look at that!"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Bout 250-300 depending on mods and what map ur playing on lol.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"da fk, abort mission, I just saw it now in install info, damn it"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,And you are completely worth it!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,It's so true. I put 2000 hours in that game and I still don't know if I love it or hate it.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Yeaaaah I already have plenty of unfinished games (subnautica, the entire dark souls and Bioshock trilogies) so I think i'll leave it alone for now"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"there is certainly a learning curve. when i first started playing years ago. it was so frustrating. spent more time dead than alive. It takes time but youll get it eventually, just take it slow. and try starting on an unofficial server with boosted rates. helps alot to learn the game"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,It's that gate with the first giant pretty early on
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,a lot of the early broken bridges near Stormveil Castle
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I think there's a setting which lets you build into the mesh. You can disable structure collision detection, iirc"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Ok making sure..yah it is..but  ant make $$ on private servers..I was just wondering..always see. Massive builds..and I can barely make a box with out going over the limit

xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,What is the meaning for prefab?
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,also does the terrain prevent you from building? you gotta have a mod that lets you build in the mesh.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,How do you play with mods? I have access through steam and the Xbox app. I‚Äôve never played on pc before though. Lol. Am a noob to pc.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,be a real shame if a ukrainian truck drove upon it
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,1st thing i thought seeing the bridge.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Or Ronda, Spain"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Segovia was my first thought! This is fantastic.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Nah water travels only through dedicated pipe pieces.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"There‚Äôs really no excuse for it other than the devs gross incompetence. By the time they actually brought some talent on board, the project was too far gone to save without being totally gutted. 

If it weren‚Äôt for Vin Diesel‚Äôs money, I highly doubt Ark 2 would be coming out next year."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,absolutely!
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"Clearly that is not enough



/s"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"That's assuming single player though, at which you can beat the game with far less then a giga. Online is nuts unless you're in an alpha tribe and even then those can be wiped."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"well, here's a little helpful info then -

ark's server browser is terrible for downloading mods. you'll time-out before you can finish downloading, and you have to keep clicking join to continue. most good servers will instead have a steam workshop page with their mod list. so use the ark browser to find a server, and then google ""server-name workshop"" and hopefully you can download all needed mods through steam workshop with ark closed. sometimes there's still more mods that have been added since they built the workshop page, so you'll still need to do the join rejoin thing on the ark browser. it's a real hassle to join a heavily modded server, but it's just one-time cost. 

also, if you want to play on a modded map (recommended, some are awesome) you'll usually need to individually subscribe to that map, again through steam. just use the search box on the store page, they're free downloads. and then right click on ark in steam, go to properties, dlc, and enable those maps

however, even once they're downloaded it can take 5-15 minutes for your game to load those mods to join, every time you join. if it takes longer than that, i usually find another server; some are poorly built. 

and yea, there's mods for everything, my favorite is servers that include ""awesome teleporters."" not only are they low-cost lightweight teleporters that you can use without power (place one by metal, pearls, whatever) but there's a ""corpse recovery"" option on the action wheel. it will just teleport your body's inventory to yourself. spawn at base, recover corpse, boom. it's like your death didn't happen. those are usually PVE servers though, but many of them (primal fear) have actually terrifying dinos, so you're fighting the world and not the players. but that's just one example. 

structures+ mod (or S+, an earlier fork) is crucial on any server, too many benefits to list. 

and watch your level points when you distribute - some servers are smart, you put one point into weight, and it shoots up to 1000, but one point in health only gives another 50 or w/e. crafting is often insta-maxed; one point into crafting will give you like 1000000% craft speed.

edit: added a couple things"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"actually early Limgrave near Stormveil Castle, a lot of broken bridge arches with enemies underneath sometimes"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Me too, my days of going to work then starting my second shift on ark are long done"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"I dont think it will work as a link, so you make need to copy and paste"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"I love building defensively on boosted pvp servers, but those builds are much more akin to a modern military complex. 

Considering how many people talk about how easy it'd be to blow up, I'd never build these on public servers lol"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,pre fabricated
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,prefabricated structures. so structures that you just place and usually look good already
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Prefabricated.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Pretty fabulous
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Prefabricated man, incase the other 3 replies weren't enough"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Essentially fully built stuff like placing a full house for example
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Pre fab, the fab before the actual fab"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"like the others said, like you craft an item you place it and its a house, the mod only adds walls/foundations/..."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Prefabricated.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Previously Fabricated structures, as in pre-made so you can just put down a nice looking house"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Structures you can plop down without designing yourself
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Pre-designed crenelations and such.  Some mods allow for you to plop down some pretty complicated-looking structures.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"You want a castle? Then I have some fabulous news for you!

Instead of struggling to build one, simply select your favorite and drop the thing wherever it fits!"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-09,"He wasn't asking the definition of prefab. He's irate at the idea of prefab, ""What is the meaning of this!?"""
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,You can turn that on as host using Ark Server Manager.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"In single player, it's just an on/off option that allows you to build things that clip into surrounding terrain. I presume it would be that easy for server settings too."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Either add them to your single player or find a server with mods you like. They're in the workshop part of steam. I don't play ark without mods anymore. As for the mods themselves, it depends on what you want out of the game tbh. I love building so I typically have a bunch of building and decor mods with a few quality of life ones for when I'm not building."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"just think, it was meant to come out sooner but they delayed it :P"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Multicore programming is a pain in the ass so I'm not surprised when developers don't really want to implement it especially if there isn't a need for it.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Yes if we are talking about the official servers then you have to get a little more creative and look into where you can hide storage crates or if you have been playing for a while when you could hide boats in rocks. Its doable just probably not for your average person but i personally dont think the official ark servers are for anything but the most dedicated.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Thanks for all this info!  I've never enjoyed PvP, so def would be going for PvE servers and I like the idea of really challenging dinos to fight but not being worried about losing my shit when taking on such a challenge and inevitably dying.

If I do get into, I'd probably go the route of setting up my own server for myself and friends"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Biprefurcated.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Previously Fabulous, but now there's better stuff in mods."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Yeah, prefabricated!"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"There was prefab, fab, and then of course post-fab leading up to WW2, but the movement largely died out. You'll still find some elderly adherents living amongst the Redwoods in California."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,I‚Äôve never ran any mods before. Looks like I‚Äôve got some learning to do. Lol
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,There is a need for it though and honestly it doesn‚Äôt even need to be simultaneous if they just put object and Dino loading on a separate thread from the world thread. The fact that they had to stagger each object and dino and reduce the draw distance to the point of egregious pop in tells me it‚Äôs on the main world thread. Separating that should not be difficult if you plan for it. And 4 cores was quite common when Ark began development
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,Your almost to the circling point where my original statement stands my dude.
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"couple other things - a lot of community servers have free kits, like a set of tools and flak for noobs. try the home key, f1,or f2 (and READ the join message, it's only up for a few secs but there's sometimes critical info in there) when you join to pull up a mod overlay with rules and a points shop, you earn points on some servers by time spent online, or can donate to buy points (save your money...) 

and expect to spend a whole day finding a server you like. maybe more. it can take hours to get all the big popular mods installed, and every server has different ones, and you may find that server still sucks, for whatever reason. be ready to abandon several servers to get what you're after. 


you're welcome, and good luck!"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"Small piece of advice before you start on it: don't go to deep immediately. I've had games I really wanted to play, but of course it needs some mods. 6 hours of installing and troubleshooting anywhere from a few dozen to a hundred mods later, I don't actually end up playing the game all that much. 


Don't get me wrong, mods are amazing. They can reinvigorate a game, extend it's lifespan and totally change your experience. Just remember that not everything has to be perfect, and that you having fun is the most important thing."
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I used to play ark a ton. Big on pvp. The friend group has dissolved though, and I always liked building. I didn‚Äôt know there were mods for that. I definitely want to check that out. Any recommendations on what specifically to download?"
xynfol,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"I never played enough Ark to start modding, but there's a ton of 'best mods' lists around. You can also just check Steam Workshop to see what's popular."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Meanwhile I struggle to build a square house lol
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I tried ark in the past, and could never get into it because someone else would kill me with in 2 hours, and id loose everything. I got sick of constantly restarting. Is survival evolved different?  How were you able to do this without getting mercd the entire time?"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I have a feeling that a lot of people don‚Äôt know that you can play Ark single player and adjust basically all settings you can think of.

Tired of spending time on gathering resources? Increase harvest multiplier. Taming takes too long? Increase taming speed. And so on. And then I haven‚Äôt even started telling you about mods.

It‚Äôs incredible how much more I enjoy playing Ark after finding out about the above.

I don‚Äôt have a need to play with others to enjoy this game. And I definitely won‚Äôt join a PvP server and see my base raided. Yet that‚Äôs what most Ark content on Reddit seems to be about."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"How did you get the game to show it all? My base always disappears halfway, when I want to get a full picture"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,This must be on computer. How were you able to build so perfect. I can never build like that unless perfectly flat land
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Ark is really a beautiful game even though it might look abit dated now but the world immersion is still one of the best. Biomes feel distinct and feels really good to explore with friends to find the perfect place to build a base. 

Playing PvE or own server is the best if you're afraid of being raided."

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Wow that looks amazing. I actually got ark for free on epic games launcher however I got a bad laptop so I can't play it.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,The builds from ark a conan tend to look a lot alike.  Without the title and from this distance I could not have told you which game this was.

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,This is brilliant

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Looks like you.used some CKS structures?  Those arches look interesting
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Thought this was minecraft by the photo. Ill look into Ark.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Now you can finally play the game

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I never got around to playing ARK. Is it worth jumping in this late in the game? Can this game be played casually, or is it something that you need to keep up with?"

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Awesome!  One of my favorite games, specifically the building.  I always find myself coming back to it to check out the latest mods."

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,What's your strategy going in to building something like this? Do you draw it out on paper? Or just start? I can never manage anything above a simple cottage or something of the sort.

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,My buddy and I just setup our own server and password protected it.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,don't play on official servers
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2021-01-04,"I watched my buddies play this game constantly and I never got it. It was always sooo incredibly boring to watch and they never seemed to really achieve anything and then they get raided while offline or something. I remember the day they told me there was an end boss and I was like, ‚Äúok let‚Äôs see that!!!‚Äù Still never saw that boss lol. Game isn‚Äôt for me at all"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I always felt the need to play online because a few years ago i played in this amazing community server. Recently i realized that now that that server is gone i have no reason to play multiplayer anymore, since i don't even talk to others on new servers.

Took me a few hundred hours of aimlessly hopping from server to server but i have finally realized single player is the way to go."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"As much as it sucks to get rolled in games like this, single player kind of defeats a large point of the game for me."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Isn't there a setting for draw distance?

That said, it's been years since I last played the game, but having that whole base on screen would probably make the game unplayable."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Mods, I know structures+ allows this.

It allow items to clip in the wall, allowing a straight foundation anywhere you want."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"It's a shame really, the official servers were AMAZING to play on back in the early days, before server transferring was a thing each server had kinda it's own communities, and it was still VERY much playable solo, but then they added transferring and any groups large enough just hid everything off-server so they could freely grief people and not have to worry about retaliation, it changed the game from dozens of small factions and alliances, and tons of solo players per server to really one big ""controlling"" group on each server you're forced to join if you want to play at all.  Then instead of fixing that they add things like wyverns as a giant f-you to any group without hundreds of players on 24/7, and instead of at least only having them on the new map they allowed them to be pulled to all the existing servers, so base defenses were meaningless since wyverns could torch metal walls from outside turret range and only groups with players on 24/7 could keep walls standing."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"PVE is near impossible to play in as most servers are at their tame limit. I was 20 hours into a server when I first discovered this. I even asked on chat if anyone would mind getting rid of their 32nd dodo or something and was told to try another server.

Felt really unfair as I nearly crashed the game walking past enormous bases with rows of every animal in every colour visible as walls loaded in.

Also I ended up building a tower as I was only able to find a small patch of land free to build on."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I will never forgive then for blatantly misleading customers funding their development and using that money on another project donates never agreed to and then charging for it, personally. It's a damn shame because I generally liked the game."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Stone? I'm thinking of how long it took to align one block alone!

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"If you get on the right unofficial server you could casually play. You could even keep a single player game to play that freezes when you're not in it.

I'm on a good unofficial server 6 map cluster with just the right balance of mods and boosts to make.thw game not grindy, but still some.challenge. 

Also the game is on an extreme discount right now. You can buy the explorer edition for $20 which is normally $90. Steam sale ends on the 5th"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,"I kinda map out the fortification walls, and design building bases/foundations that work with the shape  then I build up!"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Yea it's all about the dinosaurs. I gave up a while back to because of taming time but maybe I'll get back into it with a server with much faster taming. The ankylosaurus is what you want.  You could use a pick on a boulder and get 20 stone or the ankylosaurus on the same boulder and get 500. Those numbers aren't accurate since I haven't played in forever but most mounts had some specialty resource they could gather mass amounts of.  

I really need to get back into SE. I loved starting in the small yellow escape pod ship and building up.  I always wished there was a map with both planets and a lot of asteroids. Last time I played had to pretty much pick one or the other."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Tip: the game is balanced around the assumption of multiple people. Don't feel bad tweaking the resource balance when you play by yourself.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,I didn't know there was a single player option. I might take another look at this game.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Not in private server with unlimited resources?
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I highly recommend a PvE server if you‚Äôre wanting to get started. People can be more helpful there since they aren‚Äôt competing against you for things. PvE lends itself more towards creativity as other players aren‚Äôt out to grief or steal from you. You can go full Noah‚Äôs Ark for taming every animal; play evil mastermind to breed for colors/mutation between a mom and her 50th offspring; or be like the 3 little pigs and make mansions out of thatch or wood cuz it looks nicer. If you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff, PvE ark is the way to experience the game."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"In my experience, you get killed by dinos instead of players.  I built a section of floor once and died three times to do it.  I feel like I'm missing something."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Isnt it just possible to look for people who want to startup a private server with rnd people with some set rules? Seen lots of posts for it a while back where people essentially tried create their own little communities.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"That was my buddies and I. We only play on this one server cluster but back in March or so they shut the servers down due to COVID. But they recently brought it back so we went back to it, though the population is basically dead right now so we are doing the things we haven't done in the past such as ascending on every map and doing all the bosses we haven't bothered to do since it's a PvP server."

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Isn't S+ included as part of the game now?
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,You can also disable structure clipping on consoles so this castle can be built on any platform
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Yup looks to be done with S+ and a few other mods, you can turn snapping on and off as you wish but sometimes that doesn't work. Case in point I was laying out spiked walls around the edge of my floating island I took over on Crystal Isles and would turn snapping off to try and put the spikes where I wanted them but they'd just immediately snap to the closest spike to it. Leads to some interesting issues such as spikey tendrils that I can't be bothered to fix."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,Can you get it for xbox?
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"that's just the way these game go, the most toxic player gang up and drive away everyone whom don't join them; then with the hordes of menial laborer in their rank they scoop up all the end game content until whole servers become locked by them.

this happens everywhere wether there's incentive or not (see also: people on discord playing among us)

idk why company don't recognize the pattern early and preserve their community instead of letting these mock kill them, but I bet they have no incentive once the game is bought to get people to play."

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,Unofficial PvE servers are the best place to play. Official servers are just grief fests regardless of PvE or PvP.

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Why the hell do you have 93 downvotes for THIS?
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"I dunno about that, last time I tried PvE people would just block huge sections of the map so new players wouldn't have anywhere safe to build. Then on the odd occasion you'd find a spot they'd just lead some big dinos towards your base and get rid of you that way.
Granted it's been a while since then so maybe they've added features to prevent that."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,Is PvE better now? Last I played it which was like a year ago people would put down foundations everywhere to prevent others from building in decent places.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Maybe you just weren't in a safe place ? I find the beaches tend to be safer with lower level dinos/non aggro ones. And it helps to tame a dino or two as soon as you can for protection, even if they're just a distraction long enough for you to get out of range of the aggro dino"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"You can still get killed by players if you are offline, if you log off out of a house or shelter players can drag your body and drown you. **Always log off in a house or with no items on your person**"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,My buddy and I setup a private server just for us and a friend or two. Password protected it and we have a blast.
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Yeah.

I always end up quitting these types of games, too, because I don't no-life the game and don't want to be an indentured servant for some streamer in a mega-clan who does. 

But you still need the *threat* of PvP to keep things lively, IMO. 

I would love it if one of these games could somehow bridge the gap between ""shit has consequences"" and ""I keep getting rolled by a 30 person no-life megaclan in the middle of the night when nobody in my smaller clan is even online"" but I have no idea how they'd go about it."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"No clue, be awesome if it does."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,"It is not. The ""Homestead"" update added some s+ strutcures to the base game like triangles, doubledoors, and large walls but the game still lacks most of the basic improvements s+ made to the game."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"That's cool. Honestly this should just be standard. Made building early on so much harder.

Played day 2 of open beta btw, but haven't played in years."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"> that's just the way these game go, the most toxic player gang up and drive away everyone whom don't join them; then with the hordes of menial laborer in their rank they scoop up all the end game content until whole servers become locked by them.

Eh, only if the game design allows that, pre-server transfer where they couldn't hide anything if they pissed off enough people on server they'd start losing dinos so the main gameplay was more of defense, building up, and mounting an actual strike, led to a lot of actual interesting battles.  I honestly can't remember a single ACTUAL fight post-transfer, the only one I even was a part of even my own group abandoned us and the base and quickly hid all the dinos and loot in the transfer pillar, and that's really how it goes, instead of fights it's just a scramble to hide things where nobody can get it, and just rejoin later and rebuild.  Being able to hide dino's/resources somewhere where they're 100% invulnerable...but only if you're a large enough and high enough level group broke the game badly and just destroyed the ability to play solo or in small groups.  They just kept doubling down over and over again making the game worse for small groups and favoring large groups."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Good chance they were debuffed since then from what you say, could have sworn they damaged the walls themselves but honestly that's a secondary issue anyways, their breath attacks WEREN'T STOPPED by walls and especially the lightning ones could AOE destroy generators and turrets without even being in range to be shot, they actually instantly destroyed cables in an AOE so the turrets would be shut down even if not destroyed! When they were added it essentially made offline base defenses useless, a single wyvern could very easily take out all the turrets and power letting the bigger physical hitters come in close and break in.  Prior to them a decent mid-sized base for a 5-10 person group would be ""moderately"" safe offline with some plants and turrets guarding it and actually assaulting it took resources, risk, and some actual time, post wyvern you could just hit and run and the AOE was so strong you could blow base defenses quickly, it really sucked all the fun out of base assault/defense.


Honestly they're pretty trash in an actual fight though, they're extremely easy to take down by online players, they actually felt like something who's only purpose was to AOE grief bases of people who were offline.


Edit: looks like in the past few years since I quit ark they've been nerfed to almost 50% of their old hp and the lightning wyvern isn't quite the flying base-melter it used to be, it still destroys defenses in AOE but at least it no longer blows up walls and structures along with the turrets.  The last few private servers I played on all had wyverns disabled for a reason, they're just too game-breaking and the only counters are such massive time-sinks they turn the game into a day job."

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,"There is also the Genesis season pass on sale for $25 which has 1 new map, and another really interesting looking map that will be out in a few months. It will be the last expansion before Ark 2, and is the endgame..

 buying both is about $45 which is still less than half of what everything altogether would cost at full price. At full price the game + all DLC would cost over $120. So now before the January 5th is the time to buy the game and all dlc for the best price it will be. 

Ark 2 is not slotted to be released till sometime 2022. So you have over a year of gametime before it starts to fade"

kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Yeah. The toxicity in PvE servers was even worse when I played for the same reasons.

People would spam foundations all over to claim sections of the map that noone else could build on afterwards, and you had no recourse as you couldn't attack/destroy their foundations on a PvE server."
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"In pve servers i used to drag people‚Äôs bodies into the water and watch them drown then steal whatever they had on them and chop up their body for meat

Edit: spelling"
kmst0e,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"From reading the replies, I guess it really depends on the type of server you join. For me, I gravitate towards PvE servers with a dedicated community, one run by admins/owners that have a FB page or a discord server rather than just picking a random server on the PvE list ingame. I‚Äôve rarely had issues of other players griefing there as admins would be on top of things. And with those servers there‚Äôs more of an ingame economy for trading and stuff along with events here and there which really appeals to me. 

When I first started, I joined from the ingame server list and found both PvP and PvE terrible and one of the worst experiences. But doing a bit of searching for an established server really saved Ark for me. Experiences may vary as you can see from the replies of people who have seen the other side of the coin, but as in any multiplayer game, people will be people."

I really don't understand all the crying about it being another EA survival game, frankly i've enjoyed most of the new survival games because it's something new, despite people saying it's been done to death but really it hasn't and i think we're just scratching the surface, the game itself looks really creative and fun."

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Can people try to stop being ""excited"" for survival games that inevitably will get early access for ages ?

When will the general public learn ? Dayz, H1Z1, Reign Of Kings, Rust, 7 Days to die, Stranded Deep, Space engineers, Grim Dawn, medieval engineers, beast of prey, subnautica, savage lands and the list goes on and on....

Yet how many have actually delivered on their promises and are near officially release ?

Let's take DayZ as a example, since it's early access success is a (if not THE) reason why we have this issue.

They announced development back when they were still working on the mod, so that is years ago. It's early access has been on steam for a good two years now ? And they are miles behind of delivering the experience that they so much talked about on streams and announcements ect.

Let alone how far that they are to surpass the mods that were made for dayz mod (inception-esque).

Yet that didn't stop Dean Hall (the dev that people trusted) to take a load of money and bail from the project, he's now in NZ on retirement at the age of 35 i believe, while trying to start up a new game studio (Rocketwerkz).

And while the other early access games are not in the same league of ""shadiness"" as Dayz, many are barely receiving any updates.

Why ? one could argue it's because one of the largest incentives that pushes game studios to deliver a proper product is now gone with early access a.k.a. they got your money already.

So please, go easy on the ""excitement"""

Think I will give this one a miss."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"I like how people cry that it's going to be in early access forever without even looking into it.

All their developers are Veterans and have been in the gaming market for more than 10 years.

The game is to be released on both consoles when it releases, meaning that they have made a deal with both sony and microsoft to get their game released on them and have given them a ""date"" on when it will be done.

They expect the game to be in early access for about one year.

They're going to update the game minimum every second day.

They're going to try to communicate with the playerbase and the fans to give them the best experience they can somewhat like rust have done."

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,Nice advertising. Honestly this game looks exactly like [The Stomping Land](http://www.pcgamer.com/the-stomping-lands-dinosaur-modeler-gives-up-moves-to-a-new-game/) aka the poster child for early access shills. 
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"To the people judging this solely on the streams; those people have barely experienced 5% of the game in their little straw huts. Cave systems, flying, leveling, all that shit. Updates every other day and constant dev talk, PS4/Xbone release, it's going to be good. Wait and see. "

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,So far it seems like one of the best survival games out there so far (though that isn't saying much). The thing is that it has major performance issues compared to other survival games that are already known for poor performance. I will definitely wait on buying this one for now and actually control myself lol.

Next early access survival game comes out!
#
And the previous one's development stops, because they've amassed free profit, from hyped up crowd and they can move on to new projects. Repeat!
#
**if nobody that is not interested in testing/bug reporting would buy these games, then developers would actually take effort to finish the game earlier, but why hurry when people are brainwashed by hype and buying unfinished products for full price?**

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,It weirdly feels like they are trying to re-invent sandbox MMOs. Every new survival game I see in development adds some new features that adds to the feeling.

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"The UI is terrible, the character customization makes the game look like a joke, and there were quite a few bugs I noticed in the limited amount of time I viewed the streams.

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"yea... maybe the games just not for him and he doesn't want to accept that. My brother and friend have been playing closed beta the past week and the only complaint from them is the performance issues. Other than that, they seem to really enjoy the game. Also no micro transactions, $25 up-front cost and then done. We've put probably thousands of hours into games of the same genre and have seen the worst and the best. I think this game with performance optimization will be really good."

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-08,"Hey man, I'm stating my own opinion and you can agree or disagree. If you have fun, good for you! But you can't say its a really original game in terms of gameplay. Also I just went to check out some streams about it and the graphics still look horrible, the UI looks incredible bad and yes they can still update them but as it stands this is the case."

Didn't Rust go all crazy and start again from scratch?

Well they have every single early access survival game.. That is all their library consists I'm not being funny they have every. single. one.

They hop on H1Z1 and so I volunteer to play with them because why the fuck not I'm off today because I had an undiagnosed hemorrhoid and thought it was ass cancer (different story for a different time).

Anyway I really like just surviving in the wilderness and I noticed H1Z1 had some PvE servers... Every single one was empty. Not a single fucking person on any of those servers. The most I seen in a PvE server was like 10 people right.

I bring it to the two dude's attention and they straight told me that they only play those games to fuck with people so PvE is boring.

Now I ask you, FieryDog. Why are these PvE servers empty? You can still get into zany interactions, you can still build a base, go hunting, jerk off, what ever. The only difference is that you cannot kill each other. That difference alone has turned off the entire H1Z1 community from visiting these servers.

I'll suck your cock if you can explain that without bringing up the idea that people only play these games to grief and kill other players (which they do)."

I've always sort of noticed that lesser graphics with more static animations are more acceptable but once you start getting into more realism it just looks ridiculous.  How come no one who gets into early access knows how to animate anything?  We get realistic graphics... we get sometimes even complex scripting, like in Terraria.  But animation?  Almost always is god awful.

The gameplay has little point and seems rather shallow right now.  Things also don't properly react to anything, attacks, pushes, shoves, etc.  The deaths also just rely on engine physics, which feels lazy and looks goofy especially with the larger dinosaurs.  Maybe if they can alleviate some of these things... then maybe."

It tries to be fun and doesn't worry about graphics. They pushed out 3 major updates, adding in 2 (3?) maps and a fuck load of new content before they worked on goatZ and charged *a couple fucking dollars* for it.  They deserve some money for making an original idea and making it fun for their customers. There's no micro transactions or anything like that. As is the case with any development, small or big, if you want more to come out from it, it needs money first. Since fucking everyone and their mother owns goat simulator already, the only way they were going to continue funding future development is by releasing a small expansion for only a couple of dollars.

A big factor that makes the game fun is coop, if you don't have anyone to play with I'd suggest heading over to r/playdate. The game gets harder every week in game so even if you didn't have to worry the first week or so you'll start having to face a lot more angrier zombies later. The game does focus a lot around base building but unlike most other zombie games it's out of necessity. Even if you make your base out of the toughest materials all blocks are breakable so if you start to skimp on maintenance the zombies will eat right through anything.

I would suggest if you're ever getting back into it to check r/playdate  play co-op and set the zombie count slightly higher. Things can get hectic really quick and you'll want everyone to be working."

I don't understand, if they wanted players to work together more, wouldn't they make survival harder instead of easier ? I mean, if you can't survive without the help of another player, it makes you think before killing him just to steal his rock.

On the opposite, if survival is piss easy (seriously, DayZ / H1Z1 are already games where surviving alone is really easy, the only threat are other bored players), the game will deviate into an open-world deathmatch.

The problem is that DayZ has great atmosphere, while H1Z1 has hardly any at all. 

Maybe by 2020 we'll finally have a true DayZ replacement, but I doubt DayZ will ever not be a buggy pile of dog shit. It's amazing seeing all of these brand new early access games that accomplish things that DayZ simply can't given any amount of time. "

But the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games don't need that immediatly. They ARE survival games. Instead of ""you're naked and have a rock, good luck"" here everything wants your ass on a platter. Be it bandits, fellow stalkers, the military, zealot Monoliths, mutants or even The Zone itself. Seriously. At random times the sky darkens, alarms go off and you have to get your radiated butt inside a building ASAP or face a literal Red Emission Wall of Death that absolutely murders everything. So you think you're safe in that shithole you just sheltered in? WRONG. Mutant doglike men, mini-Cthulhu's, prototype hulks and more could be right behind you breathing down your neck.  
  
Oh and don't forget to eat, sleep, drink and de-radiate yourself.  
  
In TES RPG's questgivers and such are in godmode 24/7. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl they're killable. Not just minor questgivers, no, even people essential to the main story can end up in a ditch. Does this screw up the ending? NO. There are 7 different endings.

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Yes this is true. There is also something to be said about how long they remain in early access/alpha. By the time something like DayZ finally ""releases"" how long will it have been out I wonder. Will the genre even be interesting at that point? I think some people are just weary anymore of the early access model and paying for something with potential issues that can take an extremely long time to become more stable."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-03,People want a non-early access survival game already. Minecraft started a trend that may never end.
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"> People want early access games to be release ready. They're idiots. They're buying a pre-alpha game. They should expect bugs and shit.

Some of us just simply expect a little lower quality than what was shown as gameplay footage. That's really not unfair to want.

...but it's never what get's released as Early-Access.

Every single Early-Access developer, seems to have some sort of ""over the top Ultra build"" (near finished version, it seems, compared to the EA releases) that they then show footage of and tend to release a fairly mediocre version of that when it launches (Not talking about bugs and what not, at all) with added features that makes the game look and feel worse than it was shown initially.

""Ark: Survival Evolved"" is a fairly good example of that."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Yeah it has some truth but I think EA games should be playable. *cough* DayZ SA*cough* But at least it is now getting better. Still, the mod is better :P"

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"And I understand him. 

Firstly, with a Titan X, I will not decrease the resolution, I will just close the game and play something else if I don't get good framerate. I'll play the game when it's working passably at least.

Secondly, when you have a 1440p screen, decreasing the resolution to 1080p looks terrible. I know that that may sound elitist compared to all people who play at 1080p (which is the majority), but the problem is that 1080p isn't a multiple of 1440p, so you get blurriness and aproximations in the rendering that looks ugly. A lot of the times decreasing to 720p can look better. A 1080p resolution on a 1440p screen looks far worse than a 1080p resolution on a 1080p screen.

And again, to be fair, I play at 1440p with a GTX 690 and an old processor and I'm fine for most of the current releases (of course not always in full ultra settings), I don't see why a Titan X should make concessions to a completely unoptimized game (which is normal for alpha / beta, but if you charge for it, basic optimization so that it is playable should be required)"
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Yeah but if you are from the US and 8$ an hour is not a lot where i live i used to work for about 5$ for 8 hours in a shop that sold ""water pipes"" wink wink. And when the prices of parts are the same you can see the problem in saving for a pc."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"The two sentences that you quoted from that Wikipedia article directly contradict each other. The first one states that the human eye can process 10-12 separate images per second, while the other one states that we can perceive differences in a display of about 16ms or longer, which would put the number of different images we can see per second at 62.5. 

The problem with this theory is that it's very hard to test, simply because the human eye doesn't see in frames. Different tests have shown a huge variety of results ranging from 15fps to 220fps.

It severely changed the cost of raiding to a point where it is, more often than not, far too expensive, without also altering the explosives economy significantly to justify it.

There is no set time for how long alpha or beta lasts. There is no enforced rule where a developer has to release a game within a certain time frame. You are paying them to play the game and give them the money to keep going to update the game.

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Every single Early Access game is like that though, and it's coming to PS4 so it will be finished. Have you played killing floor 2 yet? That game has so little content right now and glitches it's not worth playing. But in a few months it will be fantastic just like the first game was.

The simple solution here is just not to buy the game until it develops further. And if you do buy the game, acknowledge that it's still in Alpha and will not be a full game at launch and not to get angry at the developers for your careless spending"

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"I did not buy it - It's not available for purchase either.

I really don't think I'm gonna buy it either.

I was **very much hyped** about the game, when they initially showed it with a little gameplay footage.

When they then removed the NDA and streamers started showing it; I pretty much lost interest. The game is very much different from what was shown - too much for me to still be hyped about it.

That might change in a year or so, when they probably get closer to a final release - but now; it's pretty much gone.."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"What's sad is that guy is totally against publishers such as EA and Shitisoft. I can agree to some extent, but there is a reason for deadlines.

385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"You are really bent on justifying this game in its current state, well to ease your mind. 

DayZ developer Dean Hall took all the money from initial launch and went on vacation in Switzerland FOR 6 MONTHS... It gets more interesting, after he gets back he is not interested in developing this game any further and wants to open his own studio in NewZealand... Cant blame him, he has the money from the early access game that started with a mod. Now bohemia interactive is stuck with broken piece of shit without its original developer and have no idea what to do with it. To keep its customers from starting a revolution they occasionally push an update saying "" don't worry guys we are working on it"" when in reality this game is OVER. Its never coming out of early access bubba...have fun. 

Just google "" dayz dev left """
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,">and it's coming to PS4 so it will be finished

Are you suggesting no console game has ever been scrapped before release?

>The simple solution here is just not to buy the game until it develops further. And if you do buy the game, acknowledge that it's still in Alpha and will not be a full game at launch and not to get angry at the developers for your careless spending

You support the idea of early access but are telling people not to buy into it. What?
"
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"I think the point people are trying to make is that it looks like most Early Access Survival games on the market right now (Rust, theHunter: Primal, DayZ, Stranded Deep, H1Z1, The Forest). Those games don't have the best reputation right now. Just look at Rust for a second; it was originally released in December 2013 and it's **still** in Early Access. I doubt it will even be out of Early Access 2 years after the initial launch due to the ""reboot"" releases they've been doing. Or DayZ for example which was also released in late 2013 and many people have migrated away from due to slow development and other issues. 

So what makes Ark different? Is it going to be the one survival game that makes it out of Early Access in a timely manner? Does it have such amazing features that it's worth stomaching poor performance and unpolished gameplay? For me it's an resounding **No** to all the above.

The indie game scene is so crowded with Early Access Survival games it's ridiculous. It reminds me of when the AAA industry flooded the market with WW2 Shooters in the early 2000s, but worse, because these games are unfinished. I like reading the mentality of most of the comments on here because it looks like people are coming to their senses. I don't think games like these should be coming out every month with the expectation of being a hit in Early Access, it's only lowering our standards of what a game should be when we pay $30 for it.

TL;DR Vote with your wallets people and don't support another generic Early Access Survival game. Or for another TL;DR watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz3OSSpopzY)

Also I can't believe this game has so many Streamer/Viewers on Twitch, it mostly looks boring and unpolished."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"No, I've played Rust. Not sure how it is now, but it used to have people starting out naked and with a rock. Well, I mean, they had pants, but it was possible to take them off via the console."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-03,"They'll be finished eventually or they won't. 

Either way, you wouldn't have had a game anyway, so why worry about it? If they can't afford to finish with early release, they certainly weren't going to have the funds to otherwise."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"Yea, I'm definitely interested, but I'm gonna wait a while to purchase. 

Silly to get early access at launch. They're gonna be too buggy, and I'm still enjoying reign of kings (which is very playable for early release). "
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"No source for anything you just posted. Excellent job.

I'm not bent on justifying the game. I'm just trying to make the point that the game is in, and is labeled as, Early Access. That means the game isn't finished and is probably buggy. OH LOOK THATS WHAT DAYZ IS. "
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,Yeah h1z1 is people in tidy whities. They strip off cloths as fresh spawns to make a bow and starter pouch for storage. So its obvious who just spawned and has no gear. But people shoot you on sight in that game no matter what and they yell racial slurs over the mic and run off. It's horrible you should try it
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-03,And it seems to be going over your head that gaming has entered the Kickstart Era and people just wish for once we could get a survival game that's ready to ship instead of a 3 year or more alpha.
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"I specifically mentioned google it. First link you get is dean hall no longer working on dayz, what more do you need? Seems like you dont want to admit this game is bad and we all got burned or may be you are a dev defending this game...are you dean hall? "
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-02,"You know you could just look it up right? He left and climbed Everest or something like that. You could even look at his Twitter if you were so inclined and document day by day the amount of time he just said fuck it about Day Z. He used to have a Reddit account but stopped using it as he ran out of excuses for us on the dayz subreddit and left the company within 2 weeks of that.
What you have to understand in the 9 hours you played buddy? The mod was more playable than that 3 years ago. What you played has been pretty much the same since it first came out in early access albeit with some added weapons and such. There's a timing window for when you can release a product, and unfortunately for them I think it's past now."
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-03,"Video games take about 2-3 years to complete. 

Instead of gaining access at year 3, you're getting it very early in the process. Crowd funding doesn't need to be dirty. It's new, so it's tough knowing which developers to trust, and on unproven developers don't take a risk if you don't wan to. Problem solved.

Your impatience is noted, but it's not really an argument. "
385fym,2015-06-02,2015-06-03,"Except how many of then have actually released? Starbound, Cube World, DayZ, H1Z1, Rust, Reign of Kings, 7 Days to Die, now throw Ark into the mix? I, among many are simply tired of waiting for a game to get good and wish we could get a good game instead of empty promises."

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"So there's this great survival game called Stranded 2, where you can grow hemp and other things.

In the final mission you have to survive a week while waiting for a thing to happen to be saved, and I was done with the game at this point, just wanted it to end.

Turns out, if you smoke the hemp, not only do you get trippy vision, but you also get sleepy - and can sleep to pass the time.

But you can't sleep if you're high, or something stupid like that.

But on the last island are plums. Which, for some ungodly european reason, make you poop instantly.

And eating poop making you vomit.

Curing your high status instantly.

So I survived a week by waking up, getting stoned off my ass, eating a solid mass of plums until I shat myself inside out, eating said shit to stop being high, and passing out - in the space of a few minutes."

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"I feel it's underrated because of how hard it is to start out as a new player. It's incredibly unforgiving. Everything wants to eat you, you can't do much in the beginning without starving to death (unless you understand how the stats work and try to keep them balanced), you have very limited tools to start with, and you can't really leave the beach for a long time until you gain some levels.

Oh, and as soon as you think you're doing good and have a remotely-stable setup going.... the game spawns a pack of Carno's, Rex's, or Raptors to utterly fuck your day up, destroy your home, and eat your body. Then they'll camp the area for 30-45min to make sure you can't recover anything you lost.

The amount of frustration this game causes new players is hilarious to observe, and heartbreaking to experience."

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"There's no point playing alone. It's designed as a team game. The more people on your team, the more experience you get, because everyone gets a bonus share of your experience (50% I believe) for anything you do. The more people you have on your team, the faster you all level up.

Plus, it's impossible for you to unlock the whole tech tree. You really need someone to focus on building, while someone focuses on weapons, and someone else focus on misc (clothing, agriculture, saddle-making, etc).

To say nothing of taking on actual dinosaurs. A few mid-level players can take down a Rex much easier than a single high-level player."

It is fucking brutal, but I think that getting over that hurdle is what makes the game fun. A lot of games give you a decent challenge in the beginning, and then you ride that for the rest of the game, and never feel challenged again. With Ark, one dino can totally end you. No matter how high your health, or what kind of gun you have, you're never truly safe.

It's a hell of a challenge, but once you get used to it, it's pretty damn fun."

Also smaller meant less bullshit like raids. There were 2 warring tribes, but we only got raided once, and even then they didnt do too much bullshit. Most tribes were neutral to each other."

They're scarier than the Rexes in my opinion because you can at least outmaneuver a Rex, you can't outswim a Megalodon. "

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"My friends and I joined a server with a particularly aggressive ""alpha"" tribe when we first played the game. Being the stubborn fucks we were, we vowed revenge after they destroyed our three-story thatch house. We built a boat and opted to live on the ocean until such a time that we could stockpile supplies to set up a good base.

Any Ark player knows that riding on a boat as a passenger can be an extremely dangerous task. You basically have to keep your feet on the ground 100% of the time the boat is in motion or you go flying off. We figured this out pretty quickly. It had already happened a few times but my dumbass decided to climb a ladder while we were in motion, and found myself swimming. As I did a 360-degree spin trying to find the boat again all I see is a massive fucking shark in the distance turn and start coming towards me. I freaked the fuck out, it was on the same level as the first time I played Depth as a diver. Literally started screaming while swimming to the boat. I made it onto the ramp but it was like the chum scene from Jaws as this massive shark just swims along the boat waiting for one of our dumbasses to fall in again. We had no idea that there were sharks in the game until then and every time someone flew off the boat from then on it was a panicked rush to get back on for fear that one would show up for a snack."

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"Learned this the hard way. We raided a tribe that had raided us, killed their people, destroyed their base, killed their dinos, full nine yards.

The next night while we were offline they came back and completely demolished our base. Turns out they had a second base hidden in the caves, so they all just respawned there and came right back at us.

We ended up building prisons into our bases from then on, so when we raided a tribe we could imprison them instead of killing them."
5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"How do you force feed and water them?

Smaller sharks, like Blues and Makos, can go faster, with the Mako in particular being noteworthy for jumping as high as 20 feet."

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,"At least it wasn't a mesosaur. I don't know if those are fully in the game yet, when I played it was available to spawn but not in the game on its own. It wouldn't be animated until you tamed it. So my friend/server host, spawned it and tamed it, and dropped it in the ocean. After having some fun riding it, he got bored, and decided it would be a cool idea to let it roam. He essentially set it free and set its aggression to the max. It cleared the ocean of all life within like 30 minutes. This thing is the size of like 10 megalodons combined."
5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,Yea but at least in prison you can commit suicide. Theres no kill command in Ark.

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,Didn't you just see higher up where they said you could commit suicide in the game by eating your poo? 
5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,Follow-up since Steam wants me to go broke during their sale. Is the frustration worth it to pick up this game and be brand new?

5jm904,2016-12-21,2016-12-22,The game is fun. It just has a hefty learning curve like any survival game does.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Wait till it actually unzips itself. The ark devs believe in ""seek-free"" content, which means every update of the game is there. Since the game came out. I've been playing since 2016 watching it's file size just bloat and bloat lmao. It's atrocious and unnecessary."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,329GB is insane wtf
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Got to love developers thinking they have zero limitations, and deciding not to optimize or compress their games."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Manage DLCs -> Disable all the map DLCs and it'll go down to like 100gb\~ I think. Some map DLCs aren't as big and you can even install them without too much issue iirc.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"AFAIR that's all the maps combined, you should be able to set which DLCs to install, when I'd play with friends we would just install the map we wanted."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I had to buy a new SSD for my son to install all of ARK on lol. Ridiculous.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,The main reason I stopped playing it. I don't have space for that much trash on my hard drive.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Soon in the future, Ark Remake Part 1, space required 999 GB"

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"100 GB game, 230gb of non-optimized spaghetti and game breaking bugs.

Spend many an hour, only to lose all the effort on some defect portal, losing inventory getting yeeted across the map for no reason etc.

Worst thing was to go fully prepped into a portal for a boss fight, only to find that the dinos we had spent hours breeding and leveling _failed to transfer with us_. And the portal activation itself cost me multiple hours of collection and other boss fights.

Never. Again."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,the game is terrible too so that 300gb is just wasted space
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"One of the reasons it's so large is because you have all the DLC. If you can't afford to sacrifice that much storage you can uncheck any expansions you don't plan on playing under the ""Manage My # DLC"" window to the bottom right. This should lower the space required to around 100GB if I recall.

Can't wait to download 800GB of uncompressed textures with Ark 2 üëç"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Similar thing happened to me with sea of thieves. Overhauled the game and now it pushes 100GB but barely any changes I‚Äôve seen that added on so much. They even removed certain features like the ranked combat mode afaik. Prob just another example of publishers getting lazy and not optimising
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Meanwhile Game developers are really keen on putting all your save files on the C: drive which for the past decade has typically been a tiny solid state partition for your critical system files.  It works fine for a month or two, then everything crashes and you can't save your documents.  Clean it up, game updates, out of space again."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Idk if it was said before but you can go into the game and uncheck DLC maps so u don‚Äôt have to install them alongside the game, also make sure ur not trying to install with a bunch of mods as that would also increase the size of the game. Either way hope u get on and play as the game is still great."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Ark devs are the laziest people in the world they dropped an optimized version of the game for the same price but it has barely any content in it yet and it‚Äôs just as buggy

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ark is straight up garbage i dont care, fully fucking unoptimized garbage, its like seeing those videos of a guy running shadow of the colossus on 4k60fps emulator, but the his specs are

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,For people who bought the new updated version (ark: survival ascended) is it the same size? Or did the new engine allow them to make it smaller even though its the same game?

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This should be fineable. Fucking bloating the internet unnecessarily.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And here I am. Playing and loving the games under 1GB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I wish I can live in a time where I don't need a terabyte sized storage to keep 5 games
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I haven't seen anyone else mention this so I'll save you some pain. If you're wanting to play online, you're SOL. They took the servers down for it so that they could re-release it as the exact same game but under the name ""ARK: Survival ASCENDED"" and make people have to pay for it all over again in order to play online.

No, I'm not joking. That's why everyone I know stopped playing. That and the fact that the servers are absolute dogshit. Which, by the way, apparently hasn't changed at all during this migration to the ""new game"" (which again, is the old game, but with updated graphics and minor adjustments).

So yea, don't bother. And they've already said ARK2 is going to be a very different game or something along those lines so, just enjoy the memories like fond days of unreal tournament or something. 

Ark is dead."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Don't they understand that anything above 100GB means that we will think twice about installing it? Below 100GB i will keep a game nstalled for the occasional situation where i will feel like playing but above i will make sure it's only installed when needed. And since it takes a little while to download and install that amount of data this will never happen or rately when i really am about to play for a longer period.

Now 300GB? I would give that space up only for DCS World and GTA 6"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I have multiple 1TB SSDs and I wouldn't even wanna fuck with where I'd put this lol I got too much other shit downloaded all the time to wanna have to think about a game that's over 300 gigs lol

Did you end up attempting the download? Is it actually that big LOL"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Scrolled pretty far and didn't see it mentioned but this all.the DLC you own plus maybe workshop mods you have picked out. You can't uncheck DLC you aren't playing to save a ton of space already
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You might have mods subscribed or dlc maps in the install list. For me it's 150gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just a reminder that GTA San Andreas is a 4GB game.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,its a true WTF indeed lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Poor optimisation worsened by just dropping extra content on top of it.l before fixing it.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And to create a server to play with friends is a pain.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I remenergie my ark being around 500gb then decided to reinstall
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I have never played it, but once watched a video where guy was mentioning that this game have several ""guilds"" that force new players to join one of them or they gonna make they experience completely unplayable. Hunting them down constantly making them unable to progress and so on. 

Is that true?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And then I went to Reddit!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I installed it today and it said 130gb.. tf?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's with all the maps downloaded. There are many maps and every map takes months to complete. Download just what you mean to play and it's like 90gb to start with.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Oh, just wait until you get the add-ons and texture packs. I've seen that game take up 2tb of storage space."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,they literally just smacked the whole call of duty pack inside to their game
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ark: ""im the HDD/SSD now.""  *Gives death stare*"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,23gb of game and 300gb of meshed bases.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yet when I uninstalled it, it only freed up ~130gb"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's listed as Steam Deck Verified. As we saying it's not even installable on the 64/256 GB Steam Decks?

Not sure what that Verified check mark is even for at this point..."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Remove dlcs first
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"would stop buying games that are unoptimized like this, that'll speak louder than anything else"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I've got 12TB of SSD storage, still wouldn't download that lol"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Holy uncompression, Batman."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's because of DLCs you have active, the base game is ""only"" 120 gigs iirc"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,300GB for a game that looks worse than san andreas
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They are indirectly telling me to never buy this game
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Windows + shift + s brother
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I wonder how many players just gave up on trying this game just for the file size( I‚Äôm one of them too)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,150+ on Xbox. Not worth in the slightest
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs because of dlcs mainly. If u click install it will install all the dlcs you had when you deleted it
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Not worth it. Also dont support them they are clearly milking their player base.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's because they made all the files uncompressed
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"When I uninstalled it after 1500~hrs of playing, it was 750GB+. It increases storage size based on: how many dlc maps you have installed, how many characters you have, how many official/unofficial servers you're in, how many mods you have, etc... I had every map (besides genesis 1&2, and the newest 1 or 2 maps that came out after I stopped) and had toons across ~12x servers? Most of them official pve. Shit's WILDLY unoptimized. I used to say that ""ARK is THE WORST-OPTIMIZED game I've ever heard of/played."" Until, well of course, ARK: ascended came out lmfaooo now my NEW beast of a pc can't even run it on low despite meeting most of its requirements. Fucking hell"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,dont install the DLCs then......
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Disable the dlc's you don't intend to use like huge maps and such.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"wtf, that's a huge space requirement. I'm not going to dump such a massive game in my drive. I want to play other games too. I wish SSDs were as cheap here in the Philippines as in the US."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I think maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre also downloading a bunch of maps???
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I started playing week 1 summer of 2015 when it was in super early alpha. When I finally quit some 5-6 years later, the total size it took up was over 800GB. ARK is an extreme space hog. Had a dedicated SSD just for it. Bonkers"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,PS5 was lieing on the store page about the size too. Went to download what I thought was a quick 16gig game and the download page said it was about 70+gigs instead.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Depends also in the dlcs you want to install
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,What in the holy fuck
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It only gets worse when you start adding mods!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-31,I was about to buy this game too...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,This is the exact reason i refunded it
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,That‚Äôs when I would mark it as hidden and never play it again üòÇ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And my friends wonder why I don't play this game with them anymore. It's so big.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,A game does NOT need to be this fucking big
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Hey! Here's some friendly advice if you're on PC; use Win+Shift+S to take a screenshot and have it added to the clipboard! Infinitely higher quality than taking a photo.

You can also drag over an area to crop before it copies the picture, and it's easy to open and edit if you wish!

You can take a screenshot of a selected area, freehand draw, a specific window, or your entire desktop!

Then just paste it right into Reddit, discord or save it locally!

*Also please stop mentioning print screen, this isn't 2010. Win+Shift+S is superior and has more functions than print screen, making it easier to use and more versatile, including cropping before taking the picture and not copying what's on all your monitors.*"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,It seems the file size had... evolved...???
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That‚Äôs just the bug size the actual game is a little less

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,All that for a subpar game too
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I got this game for free and still can't even be bothered to play it. It must be absolute dogshit.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,bad devs. bad game. move on
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It was around 100 for me about a month ago
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wait until you need to download the other maps and textures... Hope you have twice that available.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My playstation version is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 150
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Awful game
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"The game reserves space for the DLCs even if you're not installing them

You can delete the bloat files after downloading, but steam won't let you install it without initially having the space

This however doesn't include the size of save files"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This is where cloud gaming shines.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Lmao this is so funny. Playing Valheim currently, and it only has 1 GB. But it has more content than some AAA-titles....with 1 GB so much content. I am really amazed"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,330gb wtf
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Hi, you're probably looking for a useful nugget of information to fix a niche problem, or some enjoyable content I posted sometime in the last 11 years. Well, after 11 years and over 330k combined, organic karma, a cowardly, pathetic and facist minded moderator filed a false harassment report and had my account suspended, after threatening to do so which is a clear violation of the #1 rule of reddit's content policy. However, after filing a ticket before this even happened, my account was permanently banned within 12 hours and the spineless moderator is still allowed to operate in one of the top reddits, after having clearly used intimidation against me to silence someone with a differing opinion on their conflicting, poorly thought out rules. Every appeal method gets nothing but bot replies, zendesk tickets are unanswered for a month, clearly showing that reddit voluntarily supports the facist, cowardly and pathetic abuse of power by moderators, and only enforces the content policy against regular users while allowing the blatant violation of rules by moderators and their sock puppet accounts managing every top sub on the site. Also, due to the rapist mentality of reddit's administration, spez and it's moderators, you can't delete all of your content, if you delete your account, reddit will restore your comments to maintain SEO rankings and earn money from your content without your permission. So, I've used power delete suite to delete everything that I have ever contributed, to say a giant fuck you to reddit, it's moderators, and it's shareholders. From your friends at reddit following every bot message, and an account suspension after over a decade in good standing is a slap in the face and shows how rotten reddit is to the very fucking core."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"lol wtf

- signed, a software dev"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Stadia was such a glory. You clicked buy, paid, and a minute later you played Ark.

There is no way I will ever install such badly programmed game on my Steamdeck."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That‚Äôs including all the DLC, I installed the game for the first time ever just a few days ago (¬£14.99, figured why not) and the base install is only 128GB. Once you add the free DLC to your library it naturally goes up to more than double that but you can just as easily disable the DLC before you install the game."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Garbage game by garbage devs.

Not worth your time, or disk space."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"All of the dinos, textures sounds, and effects. All the skins, emotes, structures, weapons, tools, etc. from events and from 8 years of updates are in the base game of around 70gb - 90gb. i can't remember what size currently. It used to be much smaller. They have to do this pretty much, so anyone visiting the base map from other maps or later in the game can be seen without issues by players who dont have the dlc installed because otherwise you'd just be seeing glitches all over like garrysmod. The rest of it is dlc maps their textures, sounds meshes bosses, and so on. Which varies. Some are way larger and better than the island but are like 60gb alone, others dont introduce any new stuff and can be smaller due to using the base games pool of assets."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"One of my favorite games of all time and I'm in the same boat.  I kind of want to play it, but I also want to finish Rogue Trader and my 2nd run of BG3 1st.  I cannot jump to the next beast as my 6gb GTX1070 is literally the cut off point of who can play it. It was a damn good run, this card.  Finally glimpsing the light at the end of the tunnel."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"If you do wind up playing again, check out the Ragnarok map if you haven't already! Adds a whole new level of depth to the game."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Don't, this game is terrible."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Says 161.2GB on mine - Mibbe you have lots of DLC? - just don't install all the DLC :)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"At this point if you're still playing Ark you deserve what you're getting. Its ass, its been ass, itll always be ass."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Storage is quite cheap. So the sizes will keep going up for large games.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can choose which dlcs you download. This size is all dlcs together.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I got 3-game Uncharted bundle for free with my CPU last year and it was about 200 GB. I was flabbergasted

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Do you still remember the early 2000 or 1990's, where you could have lots of fun with games that don't get old, and sometimes didn't even need to be installed to be played?

it is really dumb, how the developers of today compromise through data volume on your hard drive for games that sometimes get old or repetetive after just a few hours of playtime."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Bro this game is the trashiest of trash, what is that size and for what? Last time i played that piece of shit it was 150Gb"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Freaking joke of game
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Garbage game anyways, flying gigas and mesh raiding"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's such a dogwater game too
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's garbage anyway
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's been out for like 8 years and they've still done zero optimisation, honestly they go down as some of the shittiest developers and/or publishers in the world.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,DONT!!!!! The version you have will be shit down soon to make way for the unreal 3 one. NOTHING you did or payed for is saved start from nothing again. Go play grounded it‚Äôs leagues better
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Why didn‚Äôt these devs learn to code better?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,Glad I stopped playing before early access ended and was able to get a refund. Still bitter about them releasing paid dlc during the EA period.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,The lazy cunts don't bother deleting anything. I can play most games on high and ultra but not this turd
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,As a psa if you have free maps installed they take a huge amount if you uninstall them it will come all the way down to about 120 or 140 total

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Played it, it's shit, went downhill since Chinese bought it in 2017. They started putting random shit like jetpacks, in a game about dynos. Half of the fun was collecting pokemon and fly around or ride with them, now it is a suboptimal way to play the game. My little boy is not what I bought anymore, and I cannot refund it because I played 400 hours when it was good.

They put like crates with equipment on the map, and you can find end game gear in it, so the whole game is a loot-box luck fest."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It‚Äôs funny you mention this, I just purchased ASE with all the DLC and the install size was about 100 GB less than yours shows."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I mean ok but also storage is like dirt cheap these days
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Space is ridiculously cheap.  4tb drives were on sale for 100$ or less over Christmas.  14tb+ physical drives are also cheap for games that dont need instant access.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Dont be a broke bitsh then and buy a real HD... its almost 2024 u retred
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,gawd damn
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Isn't every DLC included like 560gigs?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs as big as it gets? I wanna say you‚Äôre missing DLC üíÄ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I am currently downloading this and all add ons. Hopefully I get to play it tonight at a decent hour
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,luckely the download is only like 75 gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"and with mods and dlcs you get it up to 500gigs, truly most inefficient devs of all time."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"That's insane. But on the other hand, storage isn't really that expensive anymore."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,That's like modded Skyrim. Mine was nearly 500 lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,That‚Äôs a terrible optimization on developers part. RDR2 had waaaay less and game is packed
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Would have needed about 100h just over a week ago. Now I would need around 1 hour.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,ark's made worse than the new forza motorsport game. I've been playing since 2015 and it's barely changed from the barebones dinosaur survival shooter. It's literally just called 'shootergame' in the official taskbar name. It's bad. Super duper unoptimized and the dinosaur scales are NOWHERE near right. People just like the sweaty pvp and building mechanics.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,What the actual‚Ä¶.?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,What the hell üòÖüòÖ With my internet and Lan port it would take 15 hours to download üòÇüòÇ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,I had the same thought quite a while back and it was around 220 GB then.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Just ark‚Ä¶
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,i had ark about a year ago and with all dlcs installed it was only about 200gb although it was the windows version steam version buggin
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,DCS is the only thing on Steam that I could excuse for taking up that much. Ark is so fucking bloated.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That's insane, I was not interested in Ark but now I will definitely never play it.

I already think Baldur's Gate 3 is huge. I haven't played it, I assume its worth the space given all the accolades =)"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"if I‚Äôm not wrong ark, is the video game with the largest file size ever"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Ahh Ark my first ever PC game. Also the first and hopefully last game to take up a terabyte of storage.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I remember when the game was 70 gbs ü§ß
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's crazy
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Yowza. That's about 1/4 of my monthly data cap in one download
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Unreal Engine moment
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I had to buy another SSD just from seeing this
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I'm pretty sure this is the world record for biggest game file size
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,StarCraft was 258 mb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Disgo
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Do you have any mods that you are subscribed to in the workshop. After my years of ark modded servers the file to download is near 500gb (assuming because all of the mods it redownloads)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"JESUS 

IM HAVING A STROKE LOOKING AT THIS GOD DAM"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"What's worse is with all dlc and if you join a fairly heavily modded server, the install size can get up to 500gb fairly easily."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,you can toggle the dlcs off so it goes down to about 100ish gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Definitely not getting Ark.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You don't even have all of the DLC
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That would take me approximately 12 hours to download. Just like the old days lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Way no way bru
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,All of this and it's still lighter than your mom
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I got it for free and never played it because why would install 300gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Haha, thats ark in a nutshell. Absolutely no optimization, runs very badly and buggy asf."

But only download the map you're planning to play on"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Check and make sure you aren‚Äôt subbed to any mods, I had my ark up to 500+ gbs at one point, even if you uninstalled it in the past with mods if you are still subbed to them it‚Äôll count it in its total dl size."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Do people still play this game?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The unoptimized pos is that big?!?!!!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"330 GB? I know that games are getting bigger and optimization is hard, but holy cow!"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I literally bought a ssd just for ark. That game is ridiculous
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And I thought destiny 2 was bad üòÇ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I love ark. I made sure when I got my new laptop that I had a 2tb ssd just for it. Should last a few more updates and mods before I need a 4tb.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Get the new one
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I don't get how this mess got so popular
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's absolutely ridiculous. They can't be bothered to spend a week or two optimizing the size.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"This is because you‚Äôre installing every DLC and likely every mod you‚Äôre subscribed to. If you uncheck all of the DLC maps except the ones you actually want to use, and unsubscribe from a bunch of mods you aren‚Äôt gonna use, it‚Äôll drastically reduce the size.

My ARK is at max, half that size, and I‚Äôm only installing Ragnarok and Aberration and a handful of sizable mods. Without any of that, it winds up even smaller."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You last played on my 15th birthday.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That is ridiculously excessive.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It also runs and looks like crap!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Weird, [here is 435 GB](https://imgur.com/fGptvKx), I guess you are missing some DLCs"

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,How big is ASAscended?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"As someone with about 2000 hours on this game, it saved you, find a better game"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I don't think that's gonna fit on a Chromebook
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Holly shii thats bigger than my d*ck
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This is the reason I put a 2tb drive in my ps5
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Nobody is talking about how maps are the biggest thing. There are tons of maps and if you don't download them all, it's not THAT big. Still a little big bdxuass you have to have all creature data from all the expansions in case someone transfers one in to a map its not usually on."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Back when I still played, Ark and Red Dead 2 almost ate up an entire hard drive by themselves."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If you don't want to play certain maps you can disable them in the DLC section, it saves a ton of space. Game do be ridiculously large tho"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"And you haven't even installed the dlc yet. Just wait, you will be given the opportunity to pay $40+ to increase the file size by another 100 - 150GB."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,God damn! That‚Äôs a lot of Gigs! üëÄ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Devs of warframe came up to a similar issue where the game was nearing 80gb. So what they did is just compressed the textures and dropped it down by nearly half. At around 35-40gb back when they did it.

So i know for a fact they can do things to fix the immense file size."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,On console it was normal to get a 100gb update.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My PC literally can‚Äôt fit that
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"They had to fit all the dinos in there somehow.... jokes aside, that is a massive file size!"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,for me it's like 500 something gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"imagine downloading this in the 00's, not just the speed but also the cost."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It is stupid large. It is a good game though but I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so huge.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,What the hell??? Why is it that big?!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The game is an unoptimized nightmare.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Might aswell install BO1, 2, and 3"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Welcome to the life of someone who bought an Xbox S. I just installed MW3 and had to delete 2k to do so. How can a company make an Xbox that only holds 1 game .

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Will it works, if you install it on external hard drive (like 1 TB)? I‚Äôm not familiar with technology. Thank you!"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Yeah the game has a gigantic amount of content and very poor optimization
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,While Ready or Not reduced its size from 100gb to 60gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yeah, it's gross, but if you do a custom install and don't install the maps you're not going to play, it's less WHATINTHEACTUALFUCKISTHIS and more fuck this is stupid, lol.  The DLC maps are ginormous, and you can reduce the install size down to like 100gb instead of the 330gb size it lists."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Time to get a drive just for Ark. As well as COD.

These games are starting to become ridiculous.. Lol"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"You can also just turn off maps you won't play to massively reduce the game size, but yeah the way they went about updates has just made it super bloated"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"mines only 128 gigs, why?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,mines at 143 with no dlc god damn
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,WT Fuck
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Don‚Äôt download all the dlc
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That‚Äôs basically a ps5 hard drive. I‚Äôd never buy a game this big. It‚Äôs absurd. Especially when you play massive games with 100s of hours of content and they are like 82 gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just need to turn off dlc that you don't want (game itself is ‚âà100GB and rest are DLCs)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My SSD health dropped 1% just looking at this post.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"One of the benefits of cloud gaming haha, but seriously this has to be compressible, this is nuts"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"One of my PC's hard drive's isn't that large, and I bought it like 5 years ago."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That‚Äôs cause of all the DLC‚Äôs you have but yeah, still massive. üò¨"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The install size depends on every additional content you have enabled (the paid DLCs, free map expansions, etc.) If I disable everything and only install the base game, it's ""only"" 130 GB. If I enable everything, then it jumps to 380 GB. I have every DLC except Genesis and Primitive+

Some months ago, I wanted to revisit Ark as well and started the download in the morning, so it‚Äòs done by midnight, but the download size was something like 60-90 GB (can‚Äòt remember if it‚Äòs only the base game or everything, might check tomorrow, if anyone cares)"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Holy shit. That's disgusting and super unreasonable.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The consequence of low-quality development with 0 interest in optimization
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Is ark survival ascended as bloated prnis the size of that game more well managed?
I almost feel like survival evolved was the longest beta test ever"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Base game is 148gb with additional maps/dlcs being extra
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The definition of feature creep. Honestly some of the worst devs in game development today that somehow managed to shit out a playable game. They are incredibly incompetent from my experience speaking with one early on about their terrible optimization. For years they fully rendered inaccessible features underneath the terrain which ate up tons of resources.

Now they went and released the same game with an engine update and capitalized on the FOMO that Call of Duty devs exploit year after year, by forcing people to pay again for the same game to continue playing with their friends."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,If you only download the map you're going to use and don't bother downloading all the other dlc then it goes down to about 150gb (in my own experience with like no mods)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I knowed a time in the past...my Games had ~350MB and i played them houndred hours.. i'm old
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Never understood the appeal around this game it's so bad...!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's to accommodate the giant ego of family man Vin Diesel.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's its own hard disk.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,smallest AAA game in 2024
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Makes me wonder how big the dev project is
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Each map is 20 - 60 GB, so you can drastically reduce that by only ticking the map you intend to play. But it'll still be close to 140 GB that way."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Maybe on PC it‚Äôs that big‚Ä¶.
On Xbox I can GUARANTEE it‚Äôs nothing over 100GBS. Maybe 70ish?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I don't understand why people are still surprised, this is after all Wildcard we are talking about."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"With all DLCs, ***ShooterGame*** creeps up to 450-ish Gb"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Not everyone has 4tb ssds installed but ok
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"""Check it out -- It's a mess!""   -Devs, probably."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wait. This is real?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Helllll no.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"You can turn off the dlc which are the maps, just enable the one(s) you want to play, it‚Äôll shrink. Still 100+ GB but hey, little miracles"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Brace yourself. The first 1TB game is not that many years away.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"This game is the only reason I began paying geforce now, I wish they had Warzone and GTA V tho."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"also tekken 8 and mortal kombat 1 are 100GB+

i can understand a massive game like Ark to be that size, but fighting games?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,29gb game 300gb of spying virus XD
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to go back there. I wasted so many hours on that shit game. It‚Äôs for the best."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It may be a hassle since you need to download it first, but if you have the opportunity to download it then you can reduce the file size almost by half using [CompactGUI](https://github.com/IridiumIO/CompactGUI). I used this a few years ago and reduced it almost by 50%. It's still around 100GB, but it's much better than 300. I would recommend using that!"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Honestly. I considered trying Ark out recently and didn't for whatever reason. With my Australian 50mbps internet if I saw this download after purchasing that woulda been a insta refund üòÇ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It was 170GB last time I installed it which was like February 2022 üíÄ where did the other 160 come from ü•≤
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"As someone who hasn't played it, only ever seen the briefest of glimpses and never even looked at any reviews or guides at all, can someone explain WHY is the game so large? Like, you get new models/Skyboxes/skins added or new game modes/mechanics?

I'm quirky like that, never played certain games but would watch content on it. Case in point, PoE, played maybe once only til first player hub area 4 years back, but love watching Ziz."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,WTF.gif
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I had been wanting to play this for a while, but... yeah, guess that's not happening lol I could probably spare the hard drive space, but that's just wrong on principle."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,File size Evolved. It will keep evolving... Makes Sense...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's like Myst. They pre-rendered everything.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Tis but a scratch
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,So when are going to get the option to use (for a price) Xbox Cloud Gaming style streaming for our Steam Games? Could be really useful.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,All just to not get into a server the first 35x you try to access.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yes, the devs are not very good at programming or making their own models or deleting unused files in the game install."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,What am I missing?  Mine shows 128 which is absurd in itself.  I assume he's downloaded all expansion packs?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,A lot of bugs are still in ark ascended
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It's worse on PS mine was like 430 GB or something like that
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Greedy dev
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My install is 440GB with every DLC
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"My wife and I tried this game last night on the PS5. The game is pretty much unplayable in splitscreen unless you sit right up against the screen. 

Wild that a game with so many customization options on server and game play that it takes you 10 minutes to select through doesn't have a viable option to increase text size. 

And for the record, tv isn't the issue as we have a 65""  OLED."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My ark with mods 900 GB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Pshhhh that‚Äôs just basic modded Bethesda games right there
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's almost half a terabyte. Dayum!!!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Pretty happy I asked for a 4tb nvme for Christmas. The 1tb game drive was not cutting it at anymore. This should do the trick for now.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If ARK 2 isn't significantly more optimized and unbloated, it won't be successful. Not to mention if it still looks like there's seventeen suns next to anything with a metal finish, I have no plans to play it. Love the game, hate the execution."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Can‚Äôt you reduce it by unchecking the dlc during installation or whatever? Don‚Äôt think base game is that size
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just play asa
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Survival Ascended is 75GB... but only ""the island"""

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Remember when they released Atlas and you could hack the files to launch the ark main menu? I wonder if atlas files are in there too somewhere even for the regular game.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That's like 3/4 of the total storage I have, I'd have to sacrifice all other games to install it"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Maybe there's a Call of Duty game or two hidden in there? :)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's literally insane! The raw Unreal Engine project files for my game are like 42gb and the packaged game is 2.2gb. There are other variables to consider such as textures but if it were remotely close to that scale imagine how monumental their unpackaged project is!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wtf i thought that how much time you played üòÇ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,uncheck the DLCs first. you will automatically download every DLC map if they are checked and they bloat up the installation extremely.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,How
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Is nothing for my nasa pc
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I just bought Baldur's Gate. It's 137gb. It's gonna take me days to install it. Feels bad
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I have a 2tb ssd and I still won‚Äôt install that. Taking up 15% of my drive for one game is ridiculous
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They don't know how to optimize  and compress files
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I remember 2017 when I first downloaded the game. It took a weekend and then there was some error at like 92% and I cried because of it. The more frustrating part was playing the game and my PC barley running the game. I think back then the game was only 12gb big
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,We need to halt new game development until game developers realize the average SSD in a gaming computer is only 1TB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Whatever you do. 

Do.
Not.
Revisit.

That game is way too addictive ü•πüò≠"

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Holy mother of malicious malarkey that's a ridiculous install!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I hate this. I really do. But I like this more than Bungie literally removing content from the game that people paid for.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can play another game.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Jesus fuck! No way! That's a third of my gaming ssd. I'm not about to upgrade just to play one game lol. Sure 2TB+ good gen4 NVMe is pretty cheap right now but I'd rather just play other games until I really need the space.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I feel the same when I think of playing GTA 5 again, but the damn game doubles in size every year, and I don't even play online."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just wait for ark 2 should be much smaller at the start. I heard they wanted to have anew starry because they didn‚Äôt want to continue adding on more to this already massive game.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I still have a 1TB/mo limit. There's no goddamned way.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"can someone explain to me what you do in ark, i was given it and didnt play it much but if its interesting i definately will"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,uninstall maps you aren't playing. this will save space
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Bruh I downloaded couple games like this and my landlord send me a text saying you running outta internet

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Highly recommend never supporting the arc devs in any matter at all. They're hilariously incompetent and genuinely do not care.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This is because all the DLC... Dinos and other entities from the DLCs can be spawned thru console commands even though you only have the main game and none of the DLCs purchased...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just use compact gui it really helps
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"this is one of the reasons i don't play it.

 it spams basically half of my SSD with trash data i will never experience or use - which means i have to deinstall games i actually enjoy - it is not optimized in any way (also seen by the file size - a bit of compiling would do good but ehhh who cares), it is clunky and for all that doesn't even look good"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Is this real???
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Ditto. I had more time to play games recently and I thought I would go back to Ark... when I started it was around 90gb to 120gb when i stopped. Gahk dang it's more than tripled after 8 years.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My ark is at like 500-600 gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I remember early on when it first came out a friend of mine that knew one of the devs said they knew it was unoptimized but instead of taking two steps back and giving it a good foundation they just kept building on the crap base they started so it just got worse and worse.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I'm fixing to revisit Cyberpunk, but with considerable trepidation.  When I played it three years ago, I was able to get a basically flat 4K60 with DLSS ""Quality"".  Yes, I do get that it's actually 1440p but it was honestly quite tolerable.  ""Balanced"" look so awful that I would never have been able to stand it.

The problem is that I've been reading that unlike most games, whose performance improves as they get new patches, Cyberpunk's performance actually dipped lower and lower, and now there's no realistic chance I can get the 4K60 I did at launch.  I'll have to spend over 60GB just to find out if it's all a waste of time."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,With my internet speed it would take me a month to download that.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Bro then don't install all dlc maps.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Right click on it, properties and uncheck every dlc. It should be around 130GB."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Off all the dlc packs and woala thank me later
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The size is not the only problem of that game. It is also awfully optimized (I've played and it runs worse than Cyberpunk 2077) but the thing which made me drop the game was the ammount of shimmering and jaggies the game has (at leas in 1080p) to the point of being distracting and the devs haven't even bothered to implement TAA/DLAA which are standards in the last years for adressing this problem.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Why's it so bloated??
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Every time I think about reinstalling I ask myself ‚Äúdo I really want to uninstall every game I own to download this or not‚Äù
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I am playing Ark on my ps5 so i guess it affects it because the game for me is only like 100 GB. I can't wait to buy Ark Ascended.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs 400 with all the dlcs. The remaster is apparently bigger based on game wise.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You should want to revisit it yesterday üòÅ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,just dont download all  the expansions and it will be way lower
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,can someone explain what game is this  ?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The installation size is that big because of how many workshop files you're subscribed to. 

Navigate to your workshop select Ark, check how many you are subscribed to, and unsubscribe to your leisure. 

source: Chronic Ark player with way too many mods. At one point my installation size was around 800 GB"

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wut
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And i thought Forza Horizon 5 was big at 169 GB jeez...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ark has always been incredibly poorly optimised, it honestly upsets me how popular it is despite how little the devs give a fuck.

They fell into completely undeserved success and with their more recent bullshit I hope more people realise it."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Wait, I'm confused. Why don't you have it downloaded already if you played it before? Why did you uninstall?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I remember when this game was just over 200 gigs and I still thought that was ridiculous. I could not imagine sitting and waiting ALL DAY for a game to install that I will play for 15 hours.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The base game is about 60 gig.

Every additional map is another 30 to 80 gig."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The game is god awful anyway
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's a whole computer's worth of storage my man

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ahhhh... I have 4k hours in Ark, always nice to see someone new see the file size."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,so from reading the comments that game is horribly optimized... but they've since made like.. sequels to the game or something? are the sequels better optimized? or is it a giant mess too? i mean the trailer vid on the steam page makes the game look pretty crazy. but jesus christ... that size is ridiculous. load times must be insane.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The storage requirements are ridiculous.. but it was worth it for me. I think i am somewhere near 1200h playtime.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,ARk: Bloatware evolved.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It probably wasn't.  But this is what I call AAA bloat.  (Whether ark is AAA or not doesn't really matter).  Basically gamers have ignore or defended larger games for so long that it's no longer a problem when games grow in size.  

People accept 100 GB sizes for files, but the problem is games like ARK, Warzone, even Genshin Impact constantly update, but there's no effort to optimize, they just image they can just take up more space and more space.  That's why when Genshin impact used to be able to run on almost any phone, now it's 32GB, which kind of pushes it out of lower end phones (But that's also 32 GB JUST for it.  Which most people probably won't want to use).  

Warzone is over 100 GB.  It kind of boggles my mind, because Ark is a paid game, but both Genshin Impact and Warzone is trying to be ""F2P"" But they seem to just lop off entire parts of their market with this shit. 

I have a feeling a big part of this is that these companies keep adding to the game with out ever taking things away, and that means there's outdated textures models and more living on your hard drive that you'll never see but probably remains there because the engines either can't remove them or the developers are afraid to. 

Then I see something like Fortnite which somehow is under 30GB or so and under 3 gigs on mobile?  Damn.(I don't have it, I don't play it so maybe what I see online is incorrect) That's pretty impressive compared to these behemoths

But the idea that we have infinite hard drive space and developers can bloat their game up as big as they want really has to end and it only ends when people call them on it... or rather when people stop buying their shit until they fix this shit."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Game needs a clean up, 300 Gb is just to much"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Poorly optimised game inside and outside of gameplay
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wait untill you see DLC too. It was well over 500GB for me at one point

Just checked after turning off all the dlc/maps i have its 128gb. still quite large but reasonable.  
But lets be real you gotta get all the maps/dlcs and dont forget he mods OHHH THE MODSSSSSS.  
God i had like 900gb on workshop items on gmod."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Same lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,But is the game any good? Been thinking about buying it but just see a lot of negative comments about bugs?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,you probably need more 4tb

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,dont install all the DLCs (maps). You can untick them and safe download / storage space.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The game title is the hint. Survival... Of your computer.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I think if I factory reset my computer and only downloaded steam I might be able to download it and get 15 frames a sec
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And only 2 years ago I thought 135 gigs was insane with the Cod game . . .
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I may be an idiot, but I think one of the reasons it‚Äôs size varies so heavily across systems is that it includes workshop content to which you are subscribed. So any maps and mods you had downloaded previously will download with the game, but if you unsubscribe to the content you won‚Äôt be using I think you can get the download size down quite a bit."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"We are evolving, just backwards"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Just below that in my Stream library: The binding of Isaac, 46 mb (yes, megabytes)."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Mine is around 140gb maybe because I don't have all the expansion maps downloaded?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Im glad I dont bother with modern gaming.  Imagine having to buy TB drives in bulk....
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Those triangles are becoming pentagons lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,60GB was like 60ish million years ago. Evolution strikes hard
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,With all DLC will be 500
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"When installing, you can manually select which maps you want to install. Installing every map is the default so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such a large download size."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Having games this big is just pure devs laziness example. Fk them and their game. I would erase that instantly!
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Last I remember when playing, it was around 500gb fully installed without W10 compression."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,ARK should be studied for how poorly executed it is but also how it works? Like why are you allocating memory for DLC people don‚Äôt even own? Beautiful.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can choose which maps to install and significantly lower the install size.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Last time i played summer of 2022 was 100smth
Wtf?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,wtf
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,it takes up 130GB on my pc
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Mine is 433gb üòÅüëç
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Mine says 400 GB required lmao, don't even play it anymore because it's a full time job and the performance only managed to get worse."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,lol I wonder how much ASA in 4 years.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Evolved is like 200gb on Xbox. Ascended is 30gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I had to buy a m.2 to play the game lol
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Has anyone said that you can de select which dlcs you do and don't wanna download. I had the same amount but you can select less dlc packs so it gets quite alot smaller üòÅ
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And that's just the RAM requirement
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,OK
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I see ARK is doing the rounds again.

Great concept but terribly executed‚Ä¶"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I uninstalled it to install ghostwire tokyo
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I found this is also because of mods and saves.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"So ex COD devs are working on Ark now, got it"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's with all the dlc installed. ASE base game is 120gb.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Yeah it's crazy. Lazy programming...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,And not even worth it.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I added all the expansions recently and I‚Äôm sure it was bigger than that.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"it‚Äôs not as bad but i bought MSFS yesterday and was shook when it was 1gb download, thought wow idk how they did it but boy they did it‚Ä¶ then i opened the game and was treated with ‚Äúdownload 150gb update‚Äù and on top of that there‚Äôs free dlc that adds up to another 30ish GB"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You might have the free dlc. Uncheck them in the steam properties of the game.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"You can just uncheck the dlcs you're not playing and it goes ""down"" to 128 GB"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's because of all the maps, if you go to manage DLC's you can turn of the maps you're not gonna play. Steam enables all the maps by default. 
If you have all the maps the required space is more then 400GB."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Isn't that with all the DLC, and the size goes down a ton if you tag it to only install the base game? Mine says 128GB."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Same; I don‚Äôt recall it being that great for that size
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"If I remember correctly, that is with all the DLC's"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Could this include workshop items or server required mods?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"There is no excuse for this. If you game legitimately is so ground-breakingly large and next-gen then fine, but it's not. Every time you see a huge size like this it's just lazy optimization. Sad to see."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Don't download every single DLC at the same time if you don't want the max filesize XD
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Someone probably said it but the dlc's use up over 150gb of storage, you can remove the dlc's and it should go to around 120gb"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Microsoft flight simulator has the entire world and it still takes less space than ARK
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I see you don‚Äôt have all the DLC‚Ä¶
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Lazy programming
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,With all the mods I play with I'm around 1.6TB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You can just untick whatever dlc‚Äôs you don‚Äôt wanna play and it‚Äôll be just over 100gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I think it's with all the DLCs
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I thought MW3 was bad. That just seems wrong.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Mine says 128GB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"You shouldnt need to have a gpu with this, all of the graphics come pre-rendered in memory"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You clearly play moded. Those are all the mods that you have cached
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's even bigger with all of the DLC, about 430 GB the last time I checked."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Are you joking???? I got ark in a bundle of games I bought a while ago and saw a few clips that looked really fun so I wanted to play it. That's an insane amount of space wth.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Super lazy developers who are not doing anything for optimization. Even the server code is piss poor. Each map you want to run has to have its own server instance. Meaning that as you progress you have to spin up more and more servers.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This is true next-gen game made to be released in era of PS6 and Xbox series z
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,crossing some warzone limits lmao
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I prefer companies that actually know what optimization is
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Requirements like these should not be a thing.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I actualy have a 1 Terrabyte evo ssd just for Ark. Its about 750 gb now because i own a lot of the dlcs and additionaly there is about 25 mods i consider a must have..
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,My frorza horizon 5 took like 4 hours for 128gb imagine that
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Wtf
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Just disable the DLC maps you don't intend to play FFS.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's what I'm talking about man Cmon Ark
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,All maps and some mods are easy 500 GB+
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I have only installed base game and that is still about 130 gb...
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"More like

ARK System Requirements Devolved"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I didn't see anyone tackling this in the comments, but the install size reflects all the DLC and maps. If you want, you can choose some to not install (like if you're not gonna play on a certain map, or like me you don't have genesis or extinction). That will cut like 50-100gb off right there, maybe more. 

Im in no way defending the shitty design, but if you, like me, just wanted to play with your dinosaurs without downloading 300gb, that may solve your problem."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The whole game doesn‚Äôt fit in single SSDü§£ü§£
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Because you download real dinos duh
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"There's a lot of dlc in that download size, I think it's actually more dlc in size than the base game."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ark has some of the worst developers, they have Great ideas that make the gameplay very fun. However the way the game is built is horrendous, terrible UI, terrible performance, and horrible optimization in general."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I wanted to like Ark, they should‚Äôve finished one game instead of releasing multiple unfinished ones."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Only reason I‚Äôve never tried the game. No game is worth that much storage.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Keep it in 2017 brother
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That is massive! Recently I wanted to download one and saw it was 105Gb and took a pass.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,WTF
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,On mine is says 128.12 gb
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,What a godawful waste of space haha
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's ridiculous ü§Ø
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I got it in one of the Epic Stores freebies. No joke the game broke my laptop. The Epic Store wouldn‚Äôt load. The launcher was like boot looping. Each time it opened a new instance. My memory was being filled up with Epic launcher. Nothing I tried worked. It wasn‚Äôt till a year later with a major Windows Update that the launcher started working. It‚Äôs funny now but I was so mad I couldn‚Äôt play the games.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Seems to have grown over time
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Its the expansions. Each one adds a map and the maps are huge. I'd bet the base game with the first map probably was around 60GB.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,RIP PLAYSTATION OWNERS WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL SSD
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The base game is 60GB, but that doesn't include any free or paid DLCs."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Thats the base game.

Op is trying to download thebase game and all DLCs. Each DLC has an entirely new map, new crafting, new ressources, new dinos, new bosses, new everything.

OP is pretty much trying to download the game x5

Ark:SE is certainly unoptimized as fuck, but lets not make it worse than it already is lol"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,OPs shot is with DLCs installed. To which there are 14 available maps to download.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The full game with all ezpansions is a little more than half a terrabyte
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Mine says 128gb.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I'm a programmer and paleontologist and this checks out.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I think you're right. I played horizon zero dawn, it also had dinosaurs but they were kind of robots so they require way less storage cuz electronics are small you know. The one in the above game looks like real dinosaurs and they have real organs which requires much larger space than tiny transistors."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The arms can be compressed very effectively, though."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Each Giganotsaurus is a gig of storage.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This comment is fantastic
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,i like dinosaurs
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They must be using archaic code.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This is why I read the comments. For the real facts
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,There is a time I thought 20gb on maple story is ridiculous. It was like only  300mb when I first played.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I dunno, Game Freak put 40+ of every NPC under every map in the Sun and Moon games. 

For some reason."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Escape from Tarkov can be a good competitor too.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I dunno man, Cities Skylines 2 just launched with no LOD."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Depends on how you look at it, from the CPU/GPU side having the raw assets available is a net benefit to performance at the cost of storage, *if your storage is fast enough* . You can see the converse effect in games with over-archived assets where it will cause FPS stuttering trying to load zones with a lower end CPU and it can't keep up.

Now if you are trying to run this off an old 5400 rpm drive, you're going to be in for a really bad time.

IMO only - If you have a rig that can play games at medium/high settings, you shouldn't even be considering anything less than SATA SSD, and their cost is so...so cheap by comparison. Just got some 4TB Samsungs for $190 on Black Friday and I saw similar pricing on boxing day. Platter drives are for storage, not gaming.

Edit - And don't get me wrong, Ark is not optimized, but there is benefits to having non-archived assets."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Bethesda is a close contender for that title tho (cough cough fallout 3-76)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"No.. That's Blade and Soul. 

I can tell you hands down, BnS was the worst running online game I have ever played. Bar none."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Bought it for my ps4 on a whim. Right away the thing looked blurry and like it was made for the N64. Haven‚Äôt really played since.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Yandere sim.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Uhm, cod /wz"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,COD Cold War on Xbox series is like 390 GB. Who got this much space for one game ?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Call of duty is fucking shite too
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,No kidding! I thought COD MW2 was bad but this one definitely tops it.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I feel tht, i was on a 10mbps plan until recently, 500mbps now i had no idea wat i was missing"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"With my old internet (500kB/süò¨) i would need just over a week of non stop downloading. I remember gta v would take me 5 days to download, because i could only download it at night when i didn't need to use the internet. Im so glad i moved, got 900mb/s now."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,But what if someone needs to use the phone?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"Also hilariously the main game executable is named ""shooter-game.exe"" which is the default name for a game project in their development software. And nobody bothered to ever change it. Probably hardcoded in too many places now. Some of the laziest developers I've ever seen that happened to come up with a pretty decent game despite numerous long standing flaws and bugs."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,**Space Required**: Yes
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I discovered that you can reduce the size when owning the DLCs and turning them off in steam before installing, which makes it smaller by 40GB per map, and it's hilarious."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"You'd figure a game developer would understand how hard drives work, but maybe not."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"So they don't replace or remove old files, they just keep layering new files on top of the old ones?

If that's how it works its incredibly disrespectful towards people's space, yes."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,because its apparently too hard to keep it as sepparate beta branches?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"‚ÄúWait till it actually unzips itself‚Äù

HOW BIG DOES IT GET?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"how does ""seek-free"" = every update is there? 

is it possible to play old builds of the game?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"But why?? Like, if you want to keep compatibility with servers on all versions you can force a DLC download for the version the server needs. I have so many questions."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,And at least it's still in game content? Damn game must be huge
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"wait, really? I thought this was a joke lol. Is there a reason they can't just make every update a beta branch on steam or something?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They also strongly believe in zero QA testing and  bugs are features.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Funnily enough, Destiny 2 vaulted the base campaign and the first 3 DLC‚Äôs for this exact reason. People were furious and Bungie caught a load of stick for it

It just shows that there‚Äôs no winning option. If they keep everything in, the file size is ridiculous. If they remove content, people complain they‚Äôre being denied content they paid for 3+ years ago"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The size alone doesn't even paint the full picture. I have a 1000 Mb connection and the fastests on board (NVM) SSDs that was availible at the time I build my PC and yet it took me ages to install ARK. For some reason when downloading through Steam the Ark download stops every 5 seconds to write on the disk for like a solid minute. 

And then when you finally get to launch the game after you've waited an eternaty for the download to finish the devs have a final fuck you for you in store. Because the absurdly large base install size doesn't even include all the free dlc maps."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It gets worse, mine is at 450gb"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I have absolutely no respect for these devs.  Probably more a management problem, to be honest.  But I've never ONCE heard anything positive about them.  Every news story about Ark is one insanely stupid, greedy, or lazy detail after another."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,"Had the scroll way too long to see this. Thanks, this saved me a LOT of waiting."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Still well over 100gb with base install.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"The games install reserves the space for the DLCs even if you don't own it install them

You can delete the bloat file after but can't initiate the install without the space available"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I mean, shit, I have a 1 TB SSD and I don‚Äôt think I could even install this game and BG3 simultaneously. And while I have a 7 TB HDD, new games run like shit off of it. Companies do not care about optimizing anymore."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I have 4 m.2 drives. A 4TB I got recently which I will be migrating my Steam directory to. A 2TB that‚Äôs almost full of nothing but Steam/Epic/Ubisoft. The 1TB I got to upgrade my OS drive. And the 500GB one that was my first OS drive in this computer. It has one job now. Having a drive labeled ARK seems like overkill until it‚Äôs full.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,">Original Size: 435.6 GB
>Repack Size: 40.5~42.3 GB

Couldn't find the note on her page, but the space savings is incredible."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Damn
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"We should really do a games award show for the biggest shit of the year. Something like :

- least optimize game
- most buggy release

- Biggest piece of shit of the year"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,FAILURE CONTINUE?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I would recommend looking into GeForce Now. Play any game you own (that's on the service) without using the space.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I haven't played in years, and I'm not really a super fan of the survival genre (so my opinion will reflect that), but I quit after a month or so because the game wanted me to dedicate my life to it.

I played with a buddy and a friend of his, they both loved the genre.

There were some really cool aspects, like riding the dinos (and shortly before I stopped you could even ride flying dino!) and I did enjoy the building aspects.

But, if you quit, your body just dropped in place and stayed there. You could be eaten or robbed the entire time you were logged off. Even if you were on a private server, it didn't matter. I had a baby so I couldn't just go ""oh, he's crying! Let me just take 15 minutes to make it back to base so I can check on him!""

And, even if you were in your base, it could also be overrun at any moment even if no one was logged into the server. So, if you left it alone for more than a day, it might get destroyed and all your progress eliminated.

You had to be always playing.

That's not fun for me, that's just a job with cool dinosaurs.

No idea what it's like now, this was years ago, but I have no interest in going back."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Piss poor developers who can't streamline their code and a stupid amount of bloat they never cleaned up like they said they would, lol.  Love the game, but the devs lack a lot of basic design philosophies in software development, lol."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Probably maps, think there like 5 of them, all decent sized."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I had it installed not long ago, the base game without any dlc is ~130 GB. It is also a game that has been updated constantly in the past 6 years, it got more content in updates that it came out with as far as I can tell."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Console versions need less space, in this case it‚Äôs about a 1/3"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Except that's not even the size with all the DLC maps... its way more than 500 I'm sure if u downloaded them all.

Also let's not pretend that the maps are some niche DLC. Lots of the dinos are locked behind different maps and you are literally supposed to travel between maps as you progress. You literally can't play the game properly past the beginning without additional maps.

This game is completely ridiculous in file size"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"They don't have all DLC though, the full thing is like 550gb on my pc. The game is definitely terribly optimised"

game is 20 gb exactly

update is 1gb

updater downloads the entire new 21gb version of the game in the temp files

after it takes up 41gb of hard drive space and it completes without error or interruption, will it then delete the original 20gb files and move the 21gb files from temp to the maplestory folder

i know this because i would always have a nearly full hdd and even though i had like 10gb free, the new update would never install no matter how small."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,A lot of games will spawn mobiles and objects outside of render to load things into memory (or even hidden inside render distance). All in preparation for spawning as the player moves around. But I do not know if that is what Sun and Moon is doing.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Yeah... For the same reason I have only used single digit ethers and elixirs in the 25 years I've been playing the games. **They might need them later**.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"sounds like the devs have some shitty way of sending eachother code for review/bug fixes that makes a copy of the last version the same way replying to emails makes a copy of the last reply and then replying to THAT email makes a copy of the last 2 replies, etc etc. or like when people start quoting a quote with a quote in bulletin boards every time they comment.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Lol yeah it might be forgivable if it was big but ran well. But it absolutely doesn't
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"We've had plenty of techniques to compensate for the load time for ages. Pre-load low level of detail models and textures in at first and start loading the full size ones as players approach

Honestly I feel things like unity are part of the equation here. They've significantly decreased the barrier to entry so less techy people can make games. And that's a great thing! But I also feel pretty confident that a lot of these new devs would have no idea what occlusion culling or lod optimizations involve. Someone did some investigating on cities skylines II and it was literally loading in extremely high detail models that would render as just a handful of pixels(if it did at all because there  was also no occlusion culling) which is why it runs so terribly.

It's kinda a weird place to be because now we have the tech to make things easier to make and now newer hardware is the only thing allowing those games to look like games that ran fine 10 years ago on moderate hardware"

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's basically the definition of bloatware and scope creep. The devs discovered they could sell it as a ""Beta"" and people would pay full money for an incomplete project. So they just worked on it, produced content updates, and people were happy, but holy shit is it ever a game glued together from bits and pieces."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I remember when their second game (the pirate one) came out, if you hit a specific key in the options menu it would bring up the Ark options menu lol"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ark pretty much started out as an UE4 asset flip.

And then they accidentally made a gameplay loop that was actually fun enough to become popular.

But to this day it seems their best programmer is John from Accounting who did an IT night course because the money was better."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Atlas also had the actual Ark settings menu on launch. It was just hidden but accessible.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They released DLC for it before they exited Early Access. It was always a cash grab anyways lol. Expecting any quality out of a company like that makes no sense to me
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Hardcoded in the sense that it's tied to the project's root folder name and in some target and build files for Unreal Engine, which is the normal behaviour for UE Projects. So it probably wasn't hard to change initially, but never as easy as it is in Unity."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Spaghetti code and organized chaos. This type of wacky stuff is more common in games than you think.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"same with survival ascended, went to set a software configuration for it and the exe was called 'shooter game' lmao"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Cant you rename the exe and load it and then see if the World explodes
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's worse than that. Shooter Game is the Unreal 4 FPS preset map, they literally couldn't be fucked to rename it.

To be fair, I worked at a studio where the branch and executable for the project was called ""new IP"". We were already working on the sequel of that new IP."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It‚Äôs wild they tried to re-release it as Ark 2, what were they thinking?"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,This game and those devs unironically inspired me to learn game development. It's a good game idea and can be fun if executed correctly. I now know what is required to make a game like this and sadly lack the funding and resources but one day I hope to be fortunate enough to give it a try. Maybe just as a side project for a while.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Yeah quite literally it's insane. When I was playing it a lot I had bought a 2TB nvme ssd JUST for ark. Thing was like 700GB
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,">Space Required

ALLLLL"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"You can also compress it to about half the size after the fact with something like CompactGUI, with no performance loss.

Why they don‚Äôt do that on their end, the world may never know."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"They know completely how a hard drive works. The general consensus since about 2018 has been that they are just entirely lazy. Because typically when you quote unquote update a game it tends to keep all the older stuff in there, and then your normal average dev takes all the older stuff out. These guys do not never have and never will"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"""Seek-free"" would actually be a pretty good understanding of how hard drives work, if they just have a ton of duplicated content across the disk so that, say, you could load a level in a single sequential read. Some devs used to play similar games with PS3 discs, because there was so much more space on a blu-ray disc than you actually needed for the game.

...but it's a poor understanding of how SSDs or filesystem caches work. If this is actually something the devs believe, instead of just an excuse, then they could add an SSD to the system requirements and drop the game to a reasonable size."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I think this is why tech jobs ask if you know git.  It‚Äôs to weed out these guys

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Maybe ""seek-free"" just refers to their company backup policy. If anything goes wrong, they don't have to look for the backups, they just redownload the whole company from Steam or get it from anyone who downloaded the game.

Check and see if there're HR records or email backups in there."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The old content should at least be downloadable somewhere, because what destiny does is FOMO tactics."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"By chance, do you have windows disk compression enabled via the my computer window? I had this exact same issue and had to turn off full disk compression."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That just prepares you for how the game hangs every 20 minutes when it saves!

It's been years since I played, but that drove me crazy until I figured out what was going on. I played in my own sandbox. Maybe it doesn't do that when you play on a dedicated server."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Hey don't forget about the pirate game they made that was also extremely lazy and stupid.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"nah modern devs are just that incompetent

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That's how I felt about Rust. Every time I think about it I am like ""damn I wanna play that"" cause it sounds like a cool ass concept but I get on and remember that a lot of people do absolutely nothing but play Rust and I WILL get raided without fail and lose everything."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,The aspect of having all of your hard work raided or destroyed while you're away on top of the ludicrously long times to tame dinosaurs is what caused me to drop Ark. Game has such potential that is marred by terrible management and a gameplay loop akin to a Free-to-Play title.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Those are really only issues if you play on public PvP servers. There are private PvP servers that have ""offline raid protection"" where your dinos and structure are invincible if no one in your tribe is online (so your character is vulnerable, but if you lock yourself in your base then you're safe). In PvE, dinos won't attack you and your structures unless they have a direct line of sight on you - if you close windows and doors, and have dinos stored in a complete base (not just out in the open), then they're also safe."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"One of the first things I heard about this game was exactly that: the game keeps going without you.

And I remember seeing articles about other players essentially trapping newer players so when they signed back in they were just stuck.

After that, I immediately lost any interest in the game. It's crazy to me so many people still play it."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"No, it's because they've added many more maps, and due to the inefficiency of this game's code, the maps take up at least 20 gigs each probably closer to 50 for most of them"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Aren't these the same devs who made an MMO but left all the Ark shit in?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's actually because ARK forces you to download all the expansions and DLC, even if you haven't bought them."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"""Devs are very lazy"" fits this game well."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs because they introduced a lot of new maps and dinosaurs and other things to the game

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I mean, I agree, but 40+ copies of *every NPC* in *every map* makes no sense. There's 40 Lillies in every zone under the map. There's 40 Mallows. 40 Kiawe. Etc etc. 

IIRC when the game was finally un-obfuscated back in 2019 (I think), people found out that the extra models took up nearly a third of the game's filesize."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"People just throw around the word 'optimized' for no reason it seems. The internet is also obsessed with bashing anything Bethesda, except when it's been out for like 4-5 years with updates. Even Fallout: NV was awful at launch, so was FO:3 and 4.

The common person has no idea how much effort goes into developing a game or anything for that matter. Not to mention the crunch they get from their publishers and investors."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Why does Germany have such slow internet?
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,That's insane. 1gbps is available almost across the whole country of Ireland and for a reasonable price too.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I'm in NYC and they just started rolling out 8gigabit Internet absolutely insane
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Damn, 25 Mbps, thats kinda harsh for Germany. Im living in small village and we have access to Fiber, i have 500/100 Mbps and thats success for village in Slovakia"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Laughed my ass off. Living in a german village im happy with constant 1mbps :)
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Huh, where in Germany?

I'm British, but I lived/worked in Germany for a few years pre-brexit (mothers family are native German and still live there, plus I have friends there). I never had problems finding decent internet speeds when moving / contract expiry.

1gb cable was 30‚Ç¨ a month, and cheaper DSL was 8‚Ç¨ for 125mbps. Telekom, Vodafone, 1&1 all similar prices. This was mostly at a small village about an hours drive from Cologne & Wuppertal.

Phone speeds were pretty mediocre, though, and reception in more rural areas wasn't great (on an O2 sim). Unlimited data plans were really freaking expensive too."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"That‚Äôs very surprising to me, years ago I was in Germany and stayed in an apartment for a couple days, did a speed test and got something like 600 or 800mbps down. I‚Äôd never seen such high speeds on my laptop before."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,You're talking about MBit/s not Mbps.

When it released and the price tag went up to full price, I did kind of expect them to actually start fixing bugs and optimizing it. Boy am I a fool."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Tbf it was selling for like $20 while it was in early access
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I played really early on and instantly uninstalled and asked Valve for a refund when, while it was still in beta, they took content promised for the main game and shifted it to a fucking DLC. 

I‚Äôm not about telling people what to spend their money on but I‚Äôll be damned if those devs ever see a cent from me. Don‚Äôt care how fun the game is- I‚Äôve got plenty of others to play."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Nope. I also turned off device encryption. I've had this issue every time I've installed ARK across multiple PCs. I've talked to some RL friends about it and they have the same issue. I've read a few reddit/steam threads about this issue but haven't found a way to fix it.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Can you tell me more about your issue? I am facing this download stopping on hdd only, on steam especially for months now. And even with good internet, my downloads take a lot of time"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Hard disagree, most modern devs at least try, maybe they aren't great at it, but they try.

The Ark devs don't give a shit."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Ahh I see, I thought you meant 40 npcs under, not 40 of each npc. That is quite baffling. Only explanation I can think of is all variants, but it would be an insane way to do it."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"The copies will have nothing to do with filesize... 30% of the CPU,GPU, or RAM usage maybe, but those models will be duplicated and created at runtime. The games total size ""filesize"" is determined by the games assets (textures, meshes, sound, meta-data) and the code (which is usually pretty small as it's only text)"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Duplicate instances don't really take up filesize. You're probably thinking of memory load.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"So they were both under the map, and as duplicated assets? 

You do know spawning the same NPC like 20 times is not the same as having 20 copies of their data in the assets, right?

Hell, I remember when duplicating the assets was actually beneficial! Not on the DS probably, mind you, but on games on discs, having a level load be streamable (and not having to zoom the reader back and forth) is beneficial to load times."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Not an excuse for Bethesda using `GetTickCount()` instead of `Time.GetTime()` for Gamebryo tho. For multiple games. When people have pointed it out to them over and over **and over** again.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"It's... complicated. The main issue is the christian democratic party which reigned for the vast majority of the past 74 years. In the late 1980s, Germany had the option to build massive networks of fibre optic systems across the country, but then Chancellor Helmut Kohl said ""that's not gonna last, we need copper cables for Television!""

In the following decades, none of the reigning parties managed to fix that issue even when it was very obvious that the Internet was gonna last.

That led to a famous quote from Angela Merkel in *2013*: Das Internet ist f√ºr uns alle Neuland (the internet is something new to all of us), which is just a perfect description of what's wrong. 

Germany tends to be run by people who don't want to change things. They wait until a problem solves itself (it usually doesn't), then blame the previous government or the opposition and claim that they would have never done that (even if they were the ones who did it).

It doesn't help that almost 60% of the population is older than 40 and also more than 60% of voters are 50+, who grew up with CDU (that christian democrstic party) and always vote the same for some reason, no matter how much they fucked up this time."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Short: Bureaucracy and corruption.

Long example:
Here in my area we have telekom, who was first and has fiber going towards their dslams. But their dslams are old and would require upgrading, which wouldnt be worth it for the company without state financing.

Because of poor speeds and multiple complaints, local government had a ""bidding"" (dunno what it is called correctly in english).
Telekom would have done up to 250/40 for 55‚Ç¨/month including a free phone flat and other benefits like free disney+, free netflix, other free stuff like this year I got a free christmas tree and free disney 100 year anniversary hoodie, 60‚Ç¨ worth in gift cards of choice - i chose amazon. And the monthly price can be had a lot cheaper with rebates like 5‚Ç¨ off under 28, 5‚Ç¨ off for corporate benefits, 5‚Ç¨ off for mobile contract with them plus like 30‚Ç¨ off for first 6 months upon contract extension - down to an average of like 30‚Ç¨-35‚Ç¨/month from what I know.
Also other companies would have been able to rent those lines and offer their own internet at potentially lower prices.

Meanwhile our municipal utilities, partnered with another new local company, offered 50/5 for 60‚Ç¨/month without any rebates or benefits and without a phone flat (that would cost an additional 5‚Ç¨/month) for laying completly new cables, tearing open like 10km+ of road and placing completly new dslams. Oh and no other company is allowed to rent those lines, so they have a monopoly in our area.

Guess who got to build their stuff with government funding. Worst part isnt even them having worse internet for higher prices with no benefits or rebates. Worst part was we were with them for 2 years and their service would simply collapse at least once every single month for multiple days. You can imagine not having a phone or internet for multiple days in a row every month can be frustrating, especially when youre in an IT school, so if you want to do anything, you either stay in school to leech their network there or stay at home using mobile data. (Which was incredibly expensive back then, like 5‚Ç¨+ per gb)

Now eventually our municipal utilities founded a new company, who also build new dslams recently. And again nobody else can rent those lines. On top they only offer 25/4 for 60‚Ç¨ month, again with additional 5‚Ç¨ for a phone flatrate and no benefits or rebates possible. And they are even less reliable from what ive heard from others who are with them.

Now luckily telekom offers 5G hybrid in our area for a while now. While I only have a 2k line connection, I am getting 300/50 over 5G and only paying 40‚Ç¨/month while getting free phone flatrate, free disney+, free netflix and other free stuff every year. Also they are extremely more reliable. I joined during the beta test and last like 2 years theur service only collapsed once for 4 hours from literally 2am to 6am, which I wouldnt have known if my server didnt complain that it didnt have internet during that time.

Still its funny and frustrating our government spend millions on small local companies, effectively delivering a lot less for a higher monthly cost than telekom now delivers for free and way lower monthly cost.

Ofcourse I would still like to get 550/90 combing a decent line with 5G or even getting gigabit eventually in 50 years, when I retire."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Australia's internet has been slow forever due to politics as well. Our last political party stated that better internet was unnecessary, while we had sub 10mbps in a majority of the country, while those having better, was restricted to the richest areas."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"I used to live in smaller towns around Cologne, too. That's exactly where I encountered this and all of my friends had the same limitations. 

Bigger cities and more densely populated areas tend to get the vetter end of this, but your prices absolutely boggle my mind. I used to pay 35‚Ç¨ for 5mbps just a year ago and it was already the fastest speed they could offer (the infrastructure simply didn't allow for more in the area). It wasn't even a rural area. 

Idk where this haven of yours is in Germany. I could think of a handful of places that do have them because of businesses and research facilities there, but really nothing more than a handful of them."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Thats actually the same thing.

Mbps = Mbit/s = Mb/s

MBps = Mbyte/s = MB/s"
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Megabyte (often abbreviated as MB) is about 1/8 of Megabit (often abbreviated as mb). When calculating download speeds in MBps based on connection speed  in Mbps it usually comes out to 1/10 due to overheads. This 1/8 relationship comes from 1 byte having 8 bits.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,Need someone on r/theydidthemath to calculate how long it would take to download ark using the internet at that speed
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,I feel fairly confident that physics would have something to say about that.
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"It's really not though. The fact that Starlink is at the mercy of ""Space X Executives"" to decide at any time that they don't want internet to operate in certain areas is pretty terrifying. I would rather my money go to a local, or at least a National company than Space X."

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Actually, it got to the point where getting rid of it was easier to deal with when a new update came out because to install an update it needed roughly twice the total install space of the entire game... while the game was already installed.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Yeah, I ain't trying to have a whole ass SSD dedicated to Ark."
18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Its because ark is not compressed making it easy to compress.
Steam downloads are compressed so when you download 100MB of compressed ark from steam servers, steam needs to return it to original files (uncompressed) and the size can grow more than 10x
So you need to write 1000MB to the disk for every 100 MB downloaded, which can take time, especially when your SSD cache fills up.
Also it can be a CPU problem if it's too slow.

EDIT: steamdb says main content (no dlcs) is 128GB, but the download size is 44GB
Not 10x but still plenty

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"Depends on what ""unused"" actually means.Those assets might be referenced in many places, but the associated items/characters etc never actually spawn.

One of our prime ministers famously said (ALSO in 2013 amusingly) that he firmly believed 25mbps is more than enough for the average household when his party botched the fibre rollout and kept copper halfway to the house, saying it would be far too expensive to replace all of it.

Eight to ten years later, we are replacing all of it. And it's even more expensive than it would have been originally."

She declined because she liked having the luxury of moving.

I've been connected to a 100/100 line since 2008, and to DSL before that, down to dial up in the early 00's.

Had only a handful of internet outages in 15 years. One time they were upgrading the hardware from copper to fiber, the rest was just random bs like a neighbor damaging the cable or a strong storm doing damage to the communications. Oh, and one time I couldn't work because russia decided to strike a powerplant in Ukraine and caused a power surge in our combined grid leading to a large-scale country-wide blackout last year.

But. And I can't stress it enough, you are leaps and bounds ahead of us in everything else.

You knew exactly what you were getting with the base game - take it or leave it, and it was a complete, albeit simple game.

It worked because of the kind of goal-less ""mine, build, explore, fight"" game it was, and that what *was* there was fully functional for its core game loop to be enjoyable. While the updates were nice, they weren't essential to have a lot of fun with it in its initial state.

18saubo,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"> but it's the best way to do it.

No, it's not. It really, really, *really* very emphatically is not. For the record, I'm a game dev for a living myself. I certainly can't say I've ever built a software delivery platform that's as successful as Steam, but I can confidently say I've built an update system that's better than Steam's.

Maybe Steam's method is better when bandwidth is extraordinarily limited (I'm talking 90s internet or a fucking Mars colony or something, not ""I have a relatively sensible bandwidth cap on my connection"") and storage space is plentiful. Generally though, you can very roughly just 

* Check CRCs to make sure the files you're starting with are what the update expects. If not, give up and basically do a fresh install (which is what would end up happening if a ""regular"" Steam update failed), ideally just of the files changed by the update if your CDN setup allows it.

* Do what you can to signal to the game it's in the middle of updating and shouldn't run (the user can run it half-update anyway if they really try, but it's not really a big deal, worst case game crashes or something)

* Ensure you will have enough space to work with before starting (nobody likes updates that randomly fail in the middle, just append blank data/create blank files up to the size needed as your first step, and grab file handlers with write-permission to all of it ahead of time, easy to undo if it turns out there isn't enough space)

* Download the diff files, apply them directly to the original copy

* Check the CRCs or whatever, if anything's wrong just... delete the faulty file(s), and re-download them (whole, not diff, and ideally individually and not the whole package) directly from your CDN (a partial fresh install, essentially)

* Done.

It's really not rocket science. In an age where bandwidth is relatively plentiful, you can worry about replacing a corrupt file (a rare occurrence) when it actually happens. And ""always have the game folder in a runnable state"" is a nice philosophy in theory, but I'd much rather save hundreds of GBs in disk space (and disk lifetime!) than have some intangible theoretical benefit. Which isn't absolute, anyway, it's not like Steam's system doesn't also momentarily break the install once it decides patching has succeeded."

People keep saying stuff like this like it was an achievement but it was actually the norm at the time. Most games in the 90's and practically all games from the 80's and before were written in assembly.

Everyone learned Assembly so it wasn't that daunting to do, compilers weren't as good as today so writing games in a compiled language even like C wasn't going to be fast enough and let's not even talk about interpreted languages (which continue to suck till this day when it comes to performance). I also remember reading about an undocumented CPU instruction on the NES that people discovered and found that it was super useful but since it's undocumented none of the few C compilers for the 6502 supported it at the time which is another reason for using assembly on those systems. Finally, computers at the time were not as complicated as now. Certainly, printing ""hello world"" in python is still easier than in any assembly language but it was far less difficult than today. Couple this with the simplicity of the games of the time and you can see how writing games in assembly for the SNES or the amstrad CPC wasn't that big of a challenge.

Worth noting that some people still write hobby games for the Sega Mega Drive (genesis) and other platforms till this day."

Maybe that's just what happens if you try to sell additional content while your main game isn't done yet.  
 
Or you know, just exit Early Access, but no, then you can't point at the ""Early Access"" sign whenever someone criticises your game."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I bought this game expecting added content to be given to me because I ""invested"" in it early and knew it wasn't finished. How can dlc be added to an early access? Makes no sense to me, it's so sad to see dlc to an early access game and they aren't the first game to do it either. Rivals of aether was an early access fighter and they added characters as dlc, so basically early access doesn't promise additional patches or content later it'd just a bad excuse to avoid judgement."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Steam shouldn't even allow this.  EA is so abused lately, they need to add more rules to what you're allowed to do or risk being removed from it. "

Don't release a second Kickstarter if your first Kickstarter project isn't complete yet, don't release DLC for your unfinished Early Access game, don't release a game that has an entry fee with DLC already available for it on the first day, don't lock content already on the disc via a DLC paywall, don't intentionally release an unfinished game at its full price tag, don't have more than one season pass, don't have hundreds of dollars worth of DLC within a short amount of time, don't release 5 special editions of your game especially when none of them actually have all of the content in one package, don't lie about the features your game has before it comes out, don't shoehorn microtransactions into full paid games, don't put free-to-play elements into a full paid game, don't offer exclusive pre-order bonuses, don't treat your staff like garbage, and for the love of God don't expect that doing **any** of these things isn't going to affect at least some portion of your potential audience's decision to buy your product in a negative way."

wut"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"This probably happened because the developer (Wildcard) had to settle a lawsuit to the tune of $40 million earlier in the year. The owner's former employer sued them for $600 million in a claim that Wildcard poached employees and secretly worked on Ark while under non-compete restrictions.

Having to settle for 40 million in 2016 would certainly be a reason to encourage them to seek additional revenue after the initially strong early access purchases of Ark.

I think this is a cash grab, but not for greed. I think its a cash grab out of desperation."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Shame that people buy DLCs for unfinished game and then take it for granted that games are unfinished on realease because they just wave their hands and say ""They¬¥ll fix it later.""

Ahh! Stop supporting this nonsense.

And yeah. Early access went from ""help us fix the game"" to ""buy our game so we dont have to finish it"""
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Seems like a pretty moronic thing to state without a back story. For example, PayDay2 suffered horrible ratings because they stated they would never do micro-transactions, then they did.

Only a 16% drop is pretty good, if they are going back on a word they gave their fans. Most will rate you into the dirt if you say one thing, then do another."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I'm gonna admit, it really makes me sad to see this. I personally love ARK, the DLC looks great, and the game looked to have a bright future, but because of the devs getting their priorities out of line the whole game is going to be bombarded with negative reviews *solely because of their disagreement with the DLC being released* as opposed to anything about whether or not it's actually fun or worth the money.

C'mon, Wildcard. Don't do this to me, you have a great thing going if you can hold onto it."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,They're releasing paid DLC for an unfinished game? What the fuck?

This game will give you cancer.

Not because it's bad, but because it is really good, with countless bugs and glitches devs are completely ignoring.

This game is a monument to wasted potential."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"The game is is still in a broken, unpolished state. Content / features promised OVER a year ago - are still not in the game. Even though they said they would be coming within a few weeks...over a year ago. Since then, silence. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,How about instead of adding new shit they finish the base game and optimize it. I wish I could refund it. No more early access games.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,I'm just going to wait for their early access complete edition.

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I like this game, but considering its still early access - as in not finished yet - I think the focus should be on bug fixing and stability, not nickel and diming content just because the game is more expensive than you thought to create"

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Games like this are why I think there should be a hard limit on how long a game can be Early Access. Like, you get one year from the point it's released as Early Access to release a full game or move into a timed beta phase. If you don't release or move on within that period, then the game gets changed to free-2-play or gets dropped from Early Access. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"My friend and I wanted to buy this game. After seeing that they'll probably be releasing paid DLCs every few months, we're going to avoid it now."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"If this were a full release game I'd be cool with it - But calling it ""early access"" and having the audacity to release content outside the scope of that early access seems really messed up."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Who heads their marketing? ""Let's release an incomplete game and release DLC before finishing the original product."" That's a good way to ruin hopes for the future of your property and company. ARK has been in *early access* since June of last year. I didn't think early access could get worse than DayZ but Studio Wildcard managed to set a lower example. I'd give them applause but it's just too shameful."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"To people saying ""well the game is big so its like its done"" you are missing the point. They promised x-y-z to people who paid full price over a year ago, they promised x-y-z by June 2016. 

They have not delivered on their promise.. they have not finished the game and instead of delivering what they promised people who already paid they are instead putting their resources into producing DLC. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"No way I'm buying the DLC. I don't give a fuck if they're out 40 million dollars. I purchased this game and enjoyed it, then got burned out on it. But to put out a dlc before it's finished? That's a whole new level of fuckery right there. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"I ALMOST bought this game for early access, have to say seeing this I'm very very glad I didn't.  What a low move.  NMS/The Division,WTF is the gaming world coming to."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"The Ark reddit is FULL of people who attack you if you say the devs made a mistake..Pretty gross place. 500+ hrs into the game, would have donated in a heartbeat if they asked...absolutely will not pay for the DLC or support them after this shit-show. Seen some scummy shit through gaming (looking at you Sean and Aventurine), but this is most definitely top 3 for me."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,if the game isnt finished... isnt dlc the rest of the game??
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,Anyone that paid for DLC for an early access game really needs to re-evaluate their life choices.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"No one will give a shit. But I have 1500 hours played in Ark.

- I have never seen an EA game with a Dev group as great as ark. There content release cadence is incredible. Their patching and response time for critical bugs is measured mostly in hours.
- the amount of added content (Dinos, biomes, tech, mats, system mechanics) is truly staggering since EA launch until now
- their responsiveness to community needs and desires is admirable (landing flying Dinos, prioritizing doedicurus and frog release for soothing stone and CP needs
- Any content created not immediately towards the end goal of hitting release date has generally served the overall game (community pissed their pants in rage over first holiday event - they explained that something like Halloween Jackolanterns give them a way to implement new lighting)
- Original game is something like 30$. Given constant sales getting it for 20$ is common.
- this expansion features 10 Dinos most with a heavy fantasy focus. So i view it as tangential but still underlying core Ark. Appropriate to be an expansion rather than add-on (center, prim+) from my POV. To me this is a far cry blood dragon.
- the content price is not outrageous for amount of content IMO.
- performance has improved staggeringly overtime. Additionally this game features a staggering amount of graphical configurations. I have a decent rig with a gtx970. Certain features when turned up or down can swing my average FPS sometimes by 30-40 frames (resolution scale slider, sky box detail). I agree ideally it's graphics and perf still have a ways to go, but it has gone a long way already and with the right settings I play with most things on ultra at 60.

So crusading just on the principal that game is not officially out of EA, therefore DLC is inappropriate seems so... Snap judgement to me. Everyone's opinions can be varied, but trying to crusade like this is ""another example of cash grab by shitheads"" feels really unfair (especially considering how many comments came from people with 4 hours of play...)just a thought.

P.S. Assuming no technical gains or perf increase were, will or are taking place because content team made a neat side expansion is unfounded. Teams have different functions. So someone working on new textures or Dinos are not the same people working on how to streamline memory usage or getting better perf from video cards."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"This got review bombed harder than No Man's Sky. Kind of shitty though, charging for DLC when you haven't even finished the main game."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,I think it's weird but Ark is still fun
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"paid dlc? i just got the 245.9 verison from extratorrent online catalog that comes with 2, some primitive stufff and a new map, there is a new one? mmmm i will check the catalog in a week to see if its on sale."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"The game was ""early access"" for well over a year.  This is what happens when you do that kind of nonsense.  Beta is not final product, yet so many games on Steam and such never ever make it beyond beta"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"WildCard pisses me off so much. I have like 2k hours played on Xbox for Survival Evolved and the game is fantastic. All they need to do is continue supporting it with better stability updates and it would be perfect. Once they officially exit early access they can bring it to PS4 as well. Also, they need to bring SOTF to consoles like they promised. Literally noone knew about this paid DLC ""Expansion"" and noone asked for it. We want SOTF not this scorched earth garbage. Why can't they focus on finishing their main 2 titles first? They have so much potential with SE and SOTF but they keep losing track. It's like the entire dev team has ADHD. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"good and well deserved. 
"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I think the new rule should be that if you want to sell a game, it's no longer considered in ""beta"" once it goes to market.

Just getting rid of that ""its in beta"" mindset will create a more realistic ideal for the consumer.

I've bought games on steam in ""beta"" that we're online only and folded within months, meanwhile im sitting there assuming things will turn out one day... eventually... stupid Repopulation"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,It's not just early access DLC. It's also total P2W DLC. You can use the shit you get from the DLC to crush people who don't have the DLC (who have to download it anyway)
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,How many of these survival games have actually made it to the release stage?
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"16% of todays 0 revenue, vs 84% of paid revenue, so all in all, they've done good. "

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"For the record, their release of this was warranted - if not necessarily a good idea. They recently suffered a pretty hefty lawsuit, so this is their means of making back the money they lost on that. I do agree that it was a bad idea to release it first instead of launching the game, however they weren't left with a lot of choice in this case. It does help their case a little that this was already planned to be released after ARK leaves Early Access, but they had to push it early. "

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"To be fair, for an indie game to go a full year and provide countless bug fixes and those two free DLC before going for a money injection involving new creatures, a new environment, and new items is still pretty solid.  Considering I doubt they have any up they can drop back on I'm sure this is a way to identify public interest (considering concurrent players doesn't take into account players that are merely waiting for more content).  It sounds sizeable enough that I wouldn't mind paying the 20 dollars for more content and to support the devs for another year.

Keep in mind the only game I remember ever seeing leave EA was Starbound."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,Honestly couldn't care less. The poor quality of the game itself is what drove me away in the first place.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"Did they really released a paid DLC for a game that's not officially released? Cuz that's hard to believe, even harder when you see that media didn't talk about it"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"My take on it is that yes, they should've really devoted more resources to finishing the game, or at least improving it in a way to where they could take it out of Early Access and move it into some sort of open beta. But regardless, my experiences so far show the game to be a lot less glitchy than most reviews will say, and they have been devoting some of their resources to bug fixing. That being said, ignoring the Early Access title on the game, the DLC does look good."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"It's a shame to see all the early access survivals fall like this, one after another. I've promised myself to never buy early access because usually the devs/publishers end up revealing their ugly true self in some point of the process. 

ARK was on my radar for such a long time because everything seemed perfect and now this shit... argh. Makes me mad. No. Actually just disappointed. Just one more survival game to my ""avoid""-list."

The game has been ""out"" for over a year.  They release new creatures and items all the time.  They released a HUGE new map (The Center) with more content on that map all the time... FOR FREE.  They allow 3rd party maps (such as Valhalla).  So now they are coming out with a new map that will have NO impact on players on The Island/The Center/Valhalla... and people are crying foul?  Especially those who play this game religiously.  Hundreds of hours into a game you probably bought on steam sale for 18 bucks and you QQ about a paid map because the free ones aren't good enough?

I honestly understand the hate against most DLC.  But I don't hate this DLC."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"They sold DLC because they're lacking funds after losing a $40 million dollar lawsuit.

That being said the $20 DLC is worth the cost, it adds a full new map, dozens of new animals/dinos, more craftable gear, and the ability to transfer all of the 'new' DLC stuff to old servers/maps.

Reddit/Steam Users get so butthurt over the littlest thing.


ARK is a game that costs less than No Mans Sky and is a lot funner. Hell ARK costs less than almost every release title and it's funner than all of them."

Money keeps the lights on, so that they can keep working on more DLC.

It seems that game sales are no longer enough to keep the dev team paid. This is kind of step 1 for a downward spiral, no? Spend time making DLC for a cash infusion, burn cash making the next DLC for the next cash infusion, repeat until everyone wises up?"

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,I actually thought the main point of early access downsides was that Steam wouldn't give high visibility to an Early Access game. But I know Ark has been on the front page...
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,watch the DLC be early access too
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,I wonder if someone made it as a third party dev and demanded compensation but stated they could put it into the game permanently. Doubtful but a possibility. 
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,I didn't know they did this when I uninstalled it last night.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I would argue that ARK is an example of the the ""Early Access"" line being blurred. The game has been ""out"" for a long time, without any release of additional paid content. They've gone on for ages now, adding swaths of new content for free. The game is in a condition that it is playable, with about as many bugs and balance issues as you would expect a title of its kind to have if it were fully released. It is basically a complete game with an active development team adding new content consistently and frequently.

This is not a survivable business model. So they made some additional content for people to purchase if you chose to. They even made the original game 40% off for the release of this new content.

Now people are mad because they want to argue semantics. This is a non-issue, and people need to get some perspective. They could have removed ""Early Access"" status ages ago and people would still be complaining that they have to pay for new content."

Obviously their game wasn't selling well because it's an Early Access game in an overly saturated market for survival crafting games. So to continue to fund their game they decided to make DLC which I think is going to hurt them in the long run. It says to the customer ""We used your money for funding our base game to fund our next expansion so we can make more money"". It's deceptive and makes people feel cheated of the product they purchased.

This is going to upset their community. Future customers, like myself, isn't going to touch their game. The only people they will benefit from are those unaware or apathetic about this situation."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,Very good point about steam. Seems like a lot of people are ignoring the fact that they are complicit with this type of money grubbing behavior.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"My marketing professor used to point this out.  You really can't call these things unethical; as what is ethical is widely considered to be whatever the normal behavioral practice is in society.  So, as this has become the norm it's not unethical. It is, however, corrupt. I realize the thin line this treads but I think the important thing is to recognize that they are different and that that the line, particularly how thin it is, is the real issue to be discussed.  You say Steam deserves some heat for allowing these practices, but I'd go so far as to say that so does everyone who paid for an unfinished game in the first place. Those people enabled and encouraged this kind of business practice even more than Steam. It doesn't matter if you *feel* like you're supporting something.  Ultimately it boils down to the fact that you live in a consumer society and you know this and giving people money for promises is just stupid; you wait until you have a finished product in one hand before you let go of your cash with the other one."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"They released a paid DLC for their game which is still unfinished and early access.  Some of the content in the paid DLC was on the ""coming soon"" list, which had always been free and had assumed to be always free.

You might think ""well maybe the content will make it to the base game eventually"" but they actually removed the content from their ""coming soon"" list.

Interesting thing of note:

80% of 592 reviews are positive for their DLC. It's probably great, but when you look at 'recent' reviews for the base game ark you get 44% of 6,285 reviews are positive in the last 30 days. So by appearances, the paid DLC doesn't seem to be doing well, and they're killing their potential sales for the base game (during a sale no less) due to bad recent reviews."

Genuinely curious, what is the difference between ""Early Access"" and ""full game"" anyways? How does the being in ""Early Access"" negatively affect the players? If they just announced ""ok guys it's done"" and removed the ""Early Access"" label, would nobody would have given a fuss?"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-06,"Well to be FAIR... they didn't finish the fucking game. DLC implies that the game is finished. 

I've got some hours, but not near 1500. I don't care what the game in question is... that practice is not okay. They promised a full game; that's what early access is, a promise. Selling us an ""expansion"" for a game that is not finished makes no logical sense. 

What the fuck is it an expansion for? You mean an update? If the game isn't completed then that's just an update. You can have separate teams work on updates just like you can ""expansions."" This is shady by default. Nothing makes them a separate entity other than their words as the game sellers.

You can't expect them to make a game, and update it continually forever based solely on the initial sales. That's not how this works. There are only so many people who are every going to buy a particular game. Even Minecraft is probably mostly funded by Realms servers and licensing profits at this point.

I paid $15 for Ark in a humble bundle if I remember correctly. I will probably buy the DLC if/when I get back into playing it more regularly. 

I don't expect something for nothing, and by my stanards, Ark has been well above average on updating the game and adding new content, and I don't mind supporting that. 

I'd rather buy occasional DLC for a game that is forever listed as ""Early Access"" and continually updated than a released game that is never updated again. 

Isn't that essentially what WoW is? We pay like $15 a month, plus the $40-$60 DLC every 1-2 years for a game that is continually updated? "

The game is in a condition that it is playable, with about as many bugs and balance issues as you would expect a title of its kind to have if it were fully released. It is basically a complete game with an active development team adding new content consistently and frequently.

Three things here:

* The developers are still under the Early Access disclaimer, which means they can hide behind any issues of their game under the claim that it's being worked on. A lot of released games get skewered by the media for being broken at release, at least this way, the developers can avoid being skewered while reaping the benefits of Early Access (including Early Access funding).

* The game is only playable if you consider significant performance issues as acceptable, and let me tell you, most people don't consider crashing acceptable when thousands of dollars are being poured into this game. They made promises that x content would be released and that content hasn't been released, so by definition, the game isn't finished.

* You're justifying their actions by claiming they're basically releasing free content because you find the game personally acceptable, under your opinion. When they started this game development project and released the game under early access, they made an investment. If they can't continue to release content they promised based on the expectations they had of their investment, then they've failed to properly assess their game development business and they deserve to fail, just like any other business owner who plans poorly and lacks the funds to operate.

> This is not a survivable business model. So they made some additional content for people to purchase if you chose to. They even made the original game 40% off for the release of this new content.

Sucks to suck. I don't hand money to my local sandwich shop just because they're going out of business because they can't make enough money because they're failing to properly acquire business contracts for their meat. They thrive or fail, like any other business. If they can't properly assess the market they wish to compete in and they can't determine a profitable business model by which to operate then they deserve to fail. It isn't my responsibility to pay their bills if they can't provide the product I paid for.


> Now people are mad because they want to argue semantics. This is a non-issue, and people need to get some perspective. They could have removed ""Early Access"" status ages ago and people would still be complaining that they have to pay for new content.

Semantics? You need to acquire some perspective. If they ""could have"" removed Early Access status ages ago, then why didn't they? Because they wish to reap all the benefits of Early Access status while avoiding all of the negatives of traditional game development. Early Access is a cornerstone by which smaller companies can develop while actively receiving funds to pay for those developments. When those development costs exceed the funds appropriated then their game is deemed either too ambitious to complete or poorly managed, neither of which should be the burden of the consumer or continued at the expense of the consumer."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I don¬¥t buy early access games because I have no intention of paying to be alpha/beta tester. 

So.. after release early access game, I expect fixed game without bugs and good optimalization after such a long time in early access with so many people ""testing it"" (I wish if they were really testing it and reporting bugs instead of playing it and taking it for full release) and if you release buggy unfinished game after such a long time with SOOOOOO many people testing it, prepare for hate.

Why should it bother me that they were adding content for free before release? If they are adding something, that means that they want it to be in finished game! Or do you expect me to pay for the game and shitload of pre-game dlc¬¥s because they added them there why you were testing it? Oh, no. 

Everything till point of realease is in means of early access free stuff. Early access literally means EARLY access. You can play it before release with all of its unfinished and buggy features and help creators to release a better product. Give them ideas, report bugs, give them response. Help them.

What many people gets wrong is that early access is not for you to enjoy, but to polish. But it¬¥s starting to change into ""buy our product early, so we have excuse for game not being working"".

So, releasing paid DLC before the game is even finished is d*u*ck move and nothing else. "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"I feel like that's a pretty good explanation, but I already know that if they dropped the Early Access bit of their title, there would still be backlash because of people claiming how buggy it is and trying to argue that it's in no way fixed enough to warrant a full release."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"Yeah but...No one gives a flying fuck about those games. I have never heard of this ""Situation"" before other than free to plays."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,I'm pretty sure no paid games are early access and have DLC.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"Probably something preventing them from doing that, legally. I'm not a lawyer though, and I'm just assuming because it sounds like something that could be the case.

(Also, I'm not supporting the paid dlc for an early access game)"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"The community of rust kills it for me. Every time i try to play, i get trolled to death or insta killed with a gun when all i have is a rock. As a former EVE player, i get harsh communities, but rust players take it a step further for sure."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"If it wasn't for the DLC my review would have stayed positive. Was disappointed that the PvP was mostly griefing or offline raiding but I liked the building aspect. If the game had left EA with a day 1 DLC, some folks would have griped but most wouldn't have even cared and life would continue. But staying in EA and releasing a DLC, almost the same price as the base game? Sorry but no thanks."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,But it encourages this type of behavior to continue. Its just like preordering. You may have had a few fun anecdotal experiences but 99% of it is garbage made to make a quick buck.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"Early Access means it's not complete, yes. It implies that you are getting access to the game before it is fully released. If the game is complete they should move out of EA to avoid misunderstandings. If it's not complete then no one should argue that it's 'basically complete' and therefore paid DLC is fine. Adding free content to a fully released game is in no way made problematic by moving out of early access, so that is no excuse to stay in it.

Pretty simple. If they had moved the game out of early access then they would have avoided this severe backlash. I'd like to know why they are still using it."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"What the actual fuck. ~80% positive reviews, when it doesn't even work for most people, the servers are down, and it's all of the things mentioned above. Do they have the Clinton campaign working for them?"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Actually, I wasn't going to. I have no plans to. Heck, I didn't even buy Ark, I was trying it using family sharing when it was gifted to me."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,Me. Cause I've spent 84 days of playtime on it and now this new DLC will give me and my friends another 20+ days of playtime. Which is easily worth $20 bucks. 
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"How does one ""release"" a game though?  It's already out there.  All they have to do is say ""Hey, it's out now."""
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"It would be one thing if they said ""the final game is intended to have 2 playable maps and x creatures, which will be released in the coming months"".  They don't have a ""done"" state.  They are continually adding to an already playable game.  Nothing separates Ark from any other game on Steam that is ""released"" than them saying it's not done yet.  You can pay for it, you can download it, install it, and play it, just like every other game.  Plus, if you think it's unfair that's fine.  Just don't buy it.  It won't affect you negatively.  

I just think this whole thing is being overblown.  The amount of content in this DLC is huge.  I can understand why they would charge for it.  "
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"OK let's remove the fact that this game is called ""early access"".  What sets it apart from any other game out there?  It's on steam.  It's worth money.  You buy it, you download it, you play it.  For all intents and purposes, it's out.

>People buying into this leads to shittier methods from devs

Well if men can marry other men, what's next?  Men marrying *goats*?  Slippery slope arguments don't fly with me, buster brown.

Besides the transfer system allowing you to bring back DLC to play amongst non DLC owning players, I see no issue with this.  They have already released a lot of content and listened to their player base.  I played Ark for quite a while and the only thing I feel they should retract or apologize for is Official Servers."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,Fair because I bought Halo 5 for $60 and spent 20 something days of playtime on it. Now that I bought this DLC I've spent $55 on Ark. Yet I have 84 days worth of playtime on it. 64 more days of playtime is worth paying for DLC for an early access game. Sorry that I enjoy what the developers make and want to support them.
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"The difference between Ark and every game you mentioned is that none of them were in alpha status when they were selling extras...

you might have something in your argument if the progress hadnt been steady and awesome for the entire time its been out. early access just means that it was still fun to play even when they only had less than half of what they have now. if it was a quick cashin it would still be sitting like it was, but reading the patchnotes make you look like a moron when you claim its a lame cash-in."

When in reality all games tend to be some level of unfinished these days whether it be paid DLC, free content patches, bug fixes, and any number other possible updates after a game is released.

These butthurt people want to try and pretend that games that you can fully play and enjoy with an ""early access"" tag are some how not an actual game until they remove that tag.  The core game is pretty solid and lots of people are playing it regularly for many hours.  Them removing the tag would be interpreted in completely different ways.  Regardless, no one is forcing you to buy the OPTIONAL content, nor does them releasing this automatically mean they are not working on finishing the core game.  "

People are ostensibly walking into something that has been growing and changing multiple times a week for a year and just crying ""fuck these guys will never play it"". No context of the game, the content etc.

And I don't feel bad saying I'm fan boying on their behalf. I am. Because I cannot emphasize how staggeringly good this game as an EA has been. It is the gold standard for EA. Their communication, content pipeline and feedback loop has been beyond a gamers wildest dreams.

Lol. If there isn't a ""done"" state, then why don't they just kick the game out of early access hmm? If people keep buying this shit it's no wonder why they'll never be done. 

If they do that, it means they can no longer hide behind the early access shield couple that with the fact that their game would be open to critic reviews which would tear them a new asshole for how poorly optimized and/ or buggy it is. "

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"This is directly from the games early access description on steam. So there goes your claim to the game never having a clear goal for ending EA.

How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
‚ÄúWhile we have the foundation of our game at Early Access launch, there are many currently-planned features and content additions we will be adding over the year from EA to full release. Beyond such planned features, will be adding TONS of aspects suggested or iterated on by the community, hence the point of Early Access! 

Planned Core Features include, among many other things:

- Mac and Linux versions
- Procedurally Generated ARK's
- 40+ more creatures to reach well over 100, with essentially every major category of extinct animal represented in some way
- More saddle types including saddle armor tiers and saddles with powerful weapons mounted on them
- Gas-powered Vehicles
- Human/Dino Body-Paints
- Enhanced building mechanics to evolve ARK into one of the best straight-up builder games out there
- More underwater biome/ecosystem complexity, including support for vacuum-sealed underwater bases
- Lots more items, weapons, armors and further advanced tech tiers
- More item skins, limited run event skins
- More bosses and the end-game cycle including the Ultimate Life Form & Ascension
- More biome types, including deserts, snow regions, swamps, and more.
- Steam Economy Support for Statistical Items (Need some Steam API functionality for this from Valve!)
- Way more plants and more detailed plant biology systems/farming systems
- More statistical modelling of status illnesses/diseases (both player and creature)
- Better SFX, more Music, Better UI's, Better Gamepad support (i.e. UI button shortcut callouts), Better VR support (i.e. HMD gun-aim option)

In addition to zillions of bug fixes, intensive performance improvements, mega iterative polishing, and what have you. The game will sparkle like a shiny diamond before it is considered ready for Full Release, and even then we plan on a long-term post-Release content lifecycle, with specialized ARK's on the drawing board.‚Äù"

That's how ridiculous your claim sounds to me. You can't simply tell people to ignore the fact the game is still in early access, and that they should not think about that when talking about this DLC.


>>People buying into this leads to shittier methods from devs

Being blind to the fact that this is nothing but a blatant cash grab isn't going to fly with me either, bucko. This is some horse armor 2.0 level of bullshit that will set a precedence for other devs to do the same.

There are tons of issues with this but let's focus on the big one, the game hasn't even left alpha/beta stages! This should have been worked on after the game completes. If the game is as you say, for all intents and purposes ""complete"", then they need to remove the early access tag pronto. You can't hide behind early access protection and sell extra content. let alone stuff that costs almost as much as the base game. 
"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Look at Starbound.

It's one of the few games that did EA-to-full release correctly.

If you had known how extremely lackluster SB was in its early days, and then played the complete, 1.0 version, you'd understand how big of a difference a game can be between a EA title, and the completed version.

When you say ""For all intents and purposes, it's out"", you're pretty wrong. A game like Starbound changed MASSIVELY over the time it was in its diapers, up till full release. It might as well be an entirely different game, just using the same visual assets.

And the game turned out great! But here's the deal right; 

It coulda easily turned out bad, too. Imagine a world - for example - where the game was going to end up being terrible at full release, but the game showed potential. Imagine that they decided to release EA DLC, promising that the game would be much better when it's complete, only for it to turn out that it wasn't.

So you paid DLC for a game under the premise that you're *hoping* it turns out being worth your while.

Hell; this can happen in reverse too. Which is arguably even worse; going from a decent or good game in early access, then having it snowball down a hill of shit; pulling your money with its EA DLC along for the ride.

And this is precisely why you don't support EA DLC. It's the same kind of pseudo-gambling that you have with pre-ordering and season passes. It's terrible for consumers and allows developers to cash in on hype, rather than actual effort in their product.

I really don't get how you defend this to be honest.

And just to cap this all off;

If your game is in Early Access, that means it is incomplete. DLC is reserved for after a game's completion. Why the hell are you taking man-hours away from *actually finishing the game*, and dumping it into a DLC?

""Well, they could have a team dedicated to the main game and this isn't slowing down their progress!""

That's crap. The more people they have working on the base game, the better. And besides; designing your DLC off of your game in its EA status is a *terrible* idea."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,You have a point. But I still think DLC for a game not finished is total bullshit. 
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,And this falls back onto you spend your money how you want. But not everyone share the same views. Enjoy the DLC. 
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"But I've played released games that are in far worse shape that Ark is currently. Alpha and Beta are kind of arbitrary distinctions at this point in the gaming world, since games are continually updated before, during, and after release, so I don't see why that is such an important distinction. 

If we went by the proper technical descriptions of release stages, even Minecraft isn't technically ""launched"", since it isn't feature locked and they are still adding content to the game. That is supposed to be in the Alpha stage. 

Would you have been mad if they changed the status to ""Released"" 3 months ago, in the status it was in, updated it just as they have been, and offered DLC yesterday?"

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"If your original point, and the subsequent reply you get don't matter, what the fuck is the point of your contribution to this thread?"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-03,"Three main reasons:

* First, the player base is much smaller, therefore it's safe to say that the few people actually playing it are pretty big fans of the game and thus the kind of people who wouldn't complain about this kinda thing anyway.
* Secondly, even if they did rage about it there is much lower chance of it being seen anyway as it's not a popular game, anyone can tell that if something isn't as popular, people's opinions on it won't matter nearly as much and the opinions won't be seen as much, that's just basic news stuff.
* Thirdly, there is a huge pricing difference between the two, ARK base price is ¬£23 and the DLC is another ¬£15 on top of that, you're paying almost a AAA game price at this point for an unfinished game and it's DLC, whereas the other game is less for the game and DLC (¬£21) than ARK's base game, small amounts of money is gonna get cried about a lot less.
* Fourth, have you actually looked at the reviews of said dlc? 25% of the reviews are already bad which is pretty bad considering there is only 40 total reviews, getting a pretty mediocre % with such a small player base is pretty damn bad, as it basically says that 1/4 of your dedicated players even hate the dlc.
* Fifth, the size of the DLCs is pretty different, the one you linked is a pretty small thing, should have been part of the base game but probably didn't take them too long to put together and pump out for the cash in but at the same time is just a small bonus thing that doesn't actually affect the gameplay, the ARK one is meant to be a pretty big DLC that locks previously promised content behind a new paywall while the DLC is also pretty damn big so many will easily see it as them working on the DLC instead of finishing the game and adding stuff to the DLC that they should have gotten with the base game.
* Finally, the game you mentioned isn't late coming out of early access on top of everything else, which leaves a pretty sour taste in the mouth before pulling this shit on the people, as someone else said, ARK was promised to release June 2016, but didn't, the one you linked has just an early 2017 release date, not even a set time.

I could go on but I'm sure you get the main ideas by now as to why there's such a disparity in the outrage."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Either way, they don't give a shit, and therefore, neither do i"
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"If customers are playing it, it's not an alpha."
50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"The thing about Ark, is a lot of people pay them to rent servers to play on. They have their whole own server farm thing you can rent space on just for the game, so you don't have to run a server yourself. An actual maintenance cost, for dedicated teams to keep going on, 24x7.

Right now, the game is at its 24-hour peak (early in the afternoon), and is still climbing. Since launch, it's only lost about 60% of its peak player base (80k to 35k on average). The game has remained a strong seller on Steam any time it has a big content patch, even if they don't push a sale out for it.

In short: They're not hurting for money. Even after losing a 40 Million dollar lawsuit. They still have a warchest that can pay for a long time to come, and very stable income.

Even their community managers on the steam forum thought the expansion would be free, would be an extension of the core gameplay (AS IT IS!), and basically function as the entire endgame content after ascending from the main island. Instead, you now need to PAY for the other half of the game, in something that hasn't even left Alpha status (still adding core gameplay mechanics, only doing bugfixing and optimizations when they're high urgency and blocking).

They had 2 other expansions, both of them starting out as mod overhauls and both of them being released as free. The developers were even hired on and maintaining their mods is their primary job. Now, we have the ARK developers turning around and showing that they split their dev team into fractions, doing up the console launch, doing up the expansion internally, and they still haven't even officially pushed the game into Beta status, yet alone to 1.0. And that's on top of any other projects they've decided to do as spinoffs.

And to top it off, here's some actual numbers: http://steamspy.com/app/346110 - 3.5 million users, at 30 dollars a pop. Even if Steam were to take 1/3 of the sale price, and then adjust for sales, they've brought in 50-70 Million dollars, just in sales, for themselves."

 The big updates this year have mostly just been making some mods official and hiring their creators to work on them. The game is unoptimized, full of serious bugs, and they have outright said they lack the talent to do some of the promised features, like develop more for linux despite being sold as ""optimized for Steam OS"" for a very long time."

the game isnt finished because im constantly getting additions to the game for no charge. a completed game is not going to add new content like that unless its subscription based. its been constantly worked on for the entire year... i would consider it released when im not constantly getting new content that fleshes out the game.  they've never stopped adding to it. just because the game was still fun to play when it only had half the content didnt mean it was released."

Now imagine that instead of finishing the game, they've been working on additional **paid** content. You just don't do that.

Its already messed up enough. If you're fine with this, then you're part of the problem why game developers can get away with just about anything.

Yes, and again, I think you are missing the distinction. However you feel about the game is cool, you do you. But the developer is calling this an alpha stage, the game has not launched, and is still part of Steam's Early Access program.

The distinction between alpha and continued support after release aren't arbitrary. Diablo 2 isn't an easy access/alpha game just because Blizzard released some new stuff a few months back."

50sg7x,2016-09-02,2016-09-02,"Yea, I'm just putting into context that the company and fanboys will hide behind the game being in alpha, except when that fact is convenient to ignore.

For instance: the almost non-existent optimization affecting even high end computers, the dinosaurs you spend many hours taming falling through the map, the lag whenever the server saves, the almost complete lack of attention to balance, the complete irrelevance of 80+% of the dinosaurs, things teleporting to the center of the map, things getting stuck in unbreakable terrain, the new dinosaurs for the base game that have yet to be added, the fleshing out of older and newer mechanics, the way the gameplay fails to translate when comparing the high rate servers the devs play on to the official servers.

All of it's fine because for the last year the ""game is in alpha"" and ""they are focusing on content,"" except now when they aren't finishing the base game and are charging for a brand new add-on to a product they have not and may never finish."

You should care what some idiot who actually buys his does because then they'll just keep doing it and doing it. If the majority of us don't buy it, better yet no one does, then they realize it doesn't work . They will listen to us if we give  them a reason to too by not supporting this crap.

People have certainly played the game for a very long time, but to find out a whole slew of new content (with the corresponding crapload of development time/money) went into a new expansion while updates and fixes for the base game were pushed back for months has left a rightfully sour taste in many players' mouths.

Not unlike the debacle that was No Man's Sky, there are a great number of things they could have done differently that would have prevented the backlash and even got them overall praise despite releasing the expansion during early access (particularly if there hadn't been a very long period of time where the base game was essentially ignored while the expansion was worked on), but they did it this way and the outrage should not be surprising, it was a shitty move on all counts.

They've been on this content and new gamemode kick for a long time, and while they passed most of it off as free DLC I think they just realized that bug fixing and optimization is boring, hard work, and new content is fun to add and fun to talk about.  It doesn't help that they've built up a ridiculous amount of technical debt by following this dumb content-first development meme.  Unfortunately a game with a world's worth of content that you can't play is... not much of a game."

Exactly. i've sunk more then 1,000 hours into the game and was on their side when i heard about the lawsuit. if they'd have asked for donations i've happily given them about $20. but this dlc was unannounced, unwanted, and contains things that where promised for the base game. ntm someone can now just drag their 120+ overpowered wyvern through any server they want a demolish it in no time. the people who don't have the dlc don't have acess to this kind of power. even the new low tame herbivore that the dossier writer stats ""wouldn't take it into combat"" wrecks anything smaller then a t-rex. im ashamed and i likely will just abandon the game."

ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,My Graphics card is already screaming.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-25,"Obviously this was done with some kind of a free build mod of some sort, but all I could think about looking at this image is, ""My God, how long did it take to farm all that cementing paste?"""
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,I hate when that happens. And then I‚Äôll accidentally post it on Reddit.

This is the remastered CKF. used another mod for some of the decorating"

ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"""such an old game"" üíÄüíÄüíÄ"
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Performance in ARK is so bad I wouldn't be surprised if this post was actually a video
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,The game size is incredible
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Tried the game when I bought a brand new GTX 980ti and i7 4790k. It ran at a whopping 15fps at medium settings. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever refunded a game quicker in my life.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-30,I had built something similar.. but on the PS4 version... It hurts me that I put so many hours into something that became literally unplayable because it was too much for the poor console to handle.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Don‚Äôt waste the bandwidth. Gameplay is meh and the performance even on high end rigs is atrocious.

ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Mods
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,thats pretty much the whole difference so far as i see it. just different creatures
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Nope probably too grindy if you only want to build
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"Yes, it is. Play singleplayer or with some friends, it's awesome to slowly discover the game and do what you want. The maps are AWESOME and the bosses can be quite fun.   
The default settings are balanced for big tribes so it is really important to tweak your settings tho. DO NOT USE the ""singleplayer mode"" that tweak then for you. It will limit the difficulty to 0.2 instead of 1.0. Non-intuitively it will make the game a lot harder and grindy because it actually just lower the dinos levels, with lower level dinos you won't be able defeat bosses, it will be slower to gather resources and even pass through terrain because they will have less stamina, trust me on that one, keep your difficulty in 1.0.  


 You can also change time consuming things, but that you can change to your taste as you play. Those would be taming time, egg hatching time etc."
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-25,"It was built entirely on creative mode, as much as I would respect it, I'd never take the time to farm my resources for builds like there. All told, it's 37,567 structures and took 30+ dedicated hours to build"
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-25,"It's a struggle. There I am playing Forza H5, then suddenly, I have a town built. Might need to look for help"
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,From a technical standpoint I wanna personally murder whoever implemented this shit and who don't use certain things cus they're lazy. From a gameplay standpoint? Yeah pretty fun with friends ngl.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"I think it‚Äôs popularity rose in part, because of jank, and the fact you could do hilarious shit like, tranq dart someone and throw them in a cage"
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,I played it just fine on medium settings with my GTX970. Now with my RTX3060 I can even run two instances with NucleusCoop on medium settings with 50fps for both instances.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"I've only upgraded my rig to rtx3080 earlier this year, but before that I've played Ark fine on I7 -4790k and GTX 980, upwards of up to 60-80 fps on medium settings."
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"Nah they are completely different games.  


 In Ark you can keep your base for a long time (months), in both PvE and PvP, it has a lot of pure PvE content and it's really great to play single player or with an group of friends in your own server. The PvP is a lot less optimized and accessible then Rust but  it can be fun if you know what you are doing. If you like creating your base and build an army of dinos to fight bosses, choose ark.   


In Rust it only makes sense to play in a PvP or RP server, there is no pure PvE content, only PvEvP. It works in wipes, where the server is completely wiped and everyone starts at the same time, these wipes normally last for a week or two but a lot of people just play the wipe for a few days. If you like really good and balanced PvP in short wipes, choose rust."
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,They're really not even remotely similar.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,"Rust is more pvp/ skill based, while ark is better played pve or with friends. Pvp ark is just not good. Very different games but a lot of people think they are similar because of the base building/raiding."
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-25,"Hey, well it's really cool.  Good job OP!  Def one of the coolest things I've seen built in Ark.

I used to play waaaay back in the day.  Had some great fun, but the game just had too many issues for myself and friends to keep playing long term.  We played for around a year or so back in the early days.  We had some really good times trying to secretly build up and compete with other clans.  It was a lot of fun dealing with the other clans and the politics of our little Island.  We had some really egregious Chinese hackers come in and almost spoiled all the fun, but we were eventually able to outsmart them and push them off.  They tried to sneak back on with an underwater base, but we found them farming and were able to kill that in the crib.  Some really good memories, but the time investment just wasn't realistically sustainable.  We had an engineer almost get fired because he was taming dinos at work, just to give an example."
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,Good and balanced omegalul
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-24,There is PvE content that comes in the form of plugins.  There is a lot more going on in custom Rust servers than people realize.
ww1qqe,2022-08-23,2022-08-25,Games like these polish their mechanics more and more year after year. I've been playing since tor predrop In 2016. And it's come so far in the past 6 years. This game has gona from an unpolished platform to (imo) the best survival game outbthere
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"They'll refund Ark but they won't refund Star Forge after the Devs just abandoned the game, leaving it ia buggy POS mess and released the entire game for free...and a lot of us bought $80USD founder packs for it."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"keep in mind abuse of the refund system is why we have shitty steam sales.  We all know what we are buying in an early access, shouldn't be a surprise if shit gets abandoned or isn't what we expected. That's the gamble with early access. "

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,If you have played it for tens of hours then it's kind of a dick move to refund it.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,What happened to ark?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Didn't work for me
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Welp, can't refund it despite having 15 minutes in it. Guess that's another strike against EA.

Edit: steam support refunded it."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Dick move if you've pumped tens of hours or more into the game

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I love the concept of the game, and I have it myself, but it needs over 50gb. Pair that with 500kb/s internet speed at best. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I love that I can refund ARK with 6 hours in it but still am not allowed to refund The Stomping Land. The game was even taken off Steam and I only have 3 hours in it.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,So basically you're being as douche?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,After hearing how shit this game is the devs probably deserve it
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Kind of scummy, if you play the game for 20+ hours, you obviously enjoyed it to some degree. To refund it is just being a dick. I can understand 5 hours, but 20+ no way."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"IMO it plays fairly well on my pc now when, before, i had to either run it on low memory or that nvidia setting. i usually play single player and dont really have any issues with it. Worth $60? probably not, worth the $15 i paid for it on sale? absolutely. im pleased to see it finally left EA. a rarity for the survival genre."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I seriously wonder how the fuck could they mess up a dinosaur game. It's freaking horrible! The only enjoyment I got out of the game was watching all the pooping evolved server YouTubers.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,the game is really fun if you got started when it was easy

You really shouldn't be telling people that it is possible when so many people are commenting that they were refused just like me."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Is this possible on PS4....
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I played for 7 minutes but bought it in November 2016. They denied my request

They declined my refund because its outside the 14 days. So not sure about this. http://imgur.com/a/PWK2b"

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"
I have 515 hours on ARK before they completely killed PVP by allowing people to transfer to your server with dinos, wipe your shit, then fuck off back to their home server without you even having a clue who they were or where they came from. What kind of dumb fucking decision was that. I doubt they will let me refund it at this point.

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,God Bless you! I'm tired of have this anchor of a game (both in enjoyment and in harddrive space) sitting in my steam list. Gonna refund it and grab some ~~CSGO Skins~~ games that I'll actually enjoy! 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,What about games that went F2P?  Would love a $60 refund for Brink from years ago... ;P
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"They really need to rework the EA terms for devs so they *have* to put in work. Something along the lines of ""X amount of months without (noticeable) updates for a game priced between Y-Z amounts becomes eligible for refund like any non-EA game."" Just to encourage devs to actually *finish* their crap. It'll keep honest devs honest and make it *that* much harder for the scummy ones to just grab the cash and run."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Ah yes, Star Forge is why I don't buy early access games anymore unless a friend recommends it after playing it.  It still stings..."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Early access is garbage. Why would you expect any more from them? You paid already.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,That all happened a long time before the refund system was added. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,they wouldnt refund me
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Ah yeah.. I was so hyped for this game... speaking of which anyone want the extra cd key I got with the founders kit? Anyone?.... no?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Same for The Stomping Land, refunds came a while after it came out but the game was released in 2014, and subsequently removed from being purchasable on Steam after no/little updates post release, but no refunds were allowed for it. Disappointing."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"man that game looked fun, and now it doesnt sitting in my library with 13 hours on it. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Happened with The Stomping Land too. We had like two months of updates and then the project lead went awol and it was removed off of Steam. You can't refund it despite the guy literally ran away with thousands of dollars. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"This is exactly why early access is cancer. It's a legal scam. I have no idea how did we get to this point but this shit is unacceptable and infuriating. Hell, releasing unfinished games just to meet the deadlines with mindset ""we'll finish this and that later with patches""  was already fucking unacceptable, but early access is a whole new level of disrespect. Sure there might be one or two devs with morals, but the amount of never ending betas is astonishing."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Steam sales have been shitty for a while even before the refund days. Long gone are the‚Äã beautiful publisher pack deals
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"ark is different though. you don't release DLC to a unfinished, unreleased game. their game should be removed from the service."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Oh please, the refunds were just a convenient excuse for Valve to raise the prices during a sale so that they''ll receive more money from their 30% cuts."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,We should be surprised by a game being released while still playing like an early access game though.  ARK is not a complete game.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,idk about you but I love guarding an unconscious dinosaur for 2 hours while feeding it berries so it will follow me and get killed by a dragonfly I never saw
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,You can still submit the request. It's just not an instant refund you have to wait for the e-mail. Also ask for store credit not cash.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Same. Tried this and was denied. OP full of it.

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"It's actually a dick move to release DLC for a game that is in early access, meaning it's still in development therefore that content should have just been in the game."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Some would also consider it a dick move to charge for DLC that has come out for a game that still is not complete.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"You don't understand ARK. It's played the game for almost 300 hours. I'm not sure I've have 2 hours of fun in that whole time. The game is just an oppressive grind and the devs are making it more and more that way everyday, and constantly breaking the game and causing you to lose thing that you spent hours trying to get."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I'm still waiting for it to drop lower than **$60**.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,It's a good game? Has it's issue but in no way does it earn a title of shitty.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,From who? The whiny minority that come to reddit only to complain? I've been playing for a week or two and have no issues with the game. Maybe stop taking people on reddit's word for it and try it for yourself.

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I bought it when it released on EA and sunk around 135 hours into it on a server playing mostly solo and I had a good time. I think I got my money out of it but I didn't stick with it more than a month.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Shit? It runs better than most complete games. The hell you on about?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"In all fairness, 20+ hours in Ark is the requirement to get the bare minimum of the game settled.

Sounds like you're just another person caught up in the circlejerk of complaining. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,There is no Dinosaur game that comes even close to Ark. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,">how could they fuck up a dinosaur game?

Hundreds of character models, hundreds if not thousands of audio files, spawn points, leveling systems, building and crafting systems, terrain, the map itself, servers, textures, etc. That's a lot of stuff any company could ""fuck up."" The biggest fuck up with the game is the community."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Too many devs are jumping on board the 'open survival battlefield' genre with no intention of actually doing a good job of it or doing anything meaningful with the premise. It's the hot new genre and some developers just abuse it.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yes, it needs to be fully released for it to be eligible for a refund."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"You can't refund it if it was bought from outside of steam apparently, i'll edit my post to include that right now."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"i looked at mine too, same activation after refunding it before on my account. I believe we got this for free from somewhere. Or maybe from Humble Monthly?"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"After it releases, yes."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,They have the nerve because you can spend thousands of hours on it with more content than most other games charged at 60.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I tried refunding it a month or so ago and got denied.

I've owned it 4 years but have only played 8 hours of it. Those 8 hours come from logging in once every few months to see if it's fun yet, finding out it's not fun yet, and logging back off.

They said since I've owned it longer than 2 weeks and have played more than 2 hours, I can't get a refund.

"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I think you're only able to do it once they leave EA. ARK just left recently so now we can. I'm 90% sure that's *why* DayZ hasn't left EA; they don't want to have to pay back all the refunds that will inevitably hit them.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Why?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"When Killing Floor 2 came out of EA you could for like a few days if you played less than 2 hours from the launch. I messed up by trying the game again and left it on the main menu for an hour and a half without realizing it and had already played about half an hour, so I went JUST over the 2 hour limit and wasn't allowed to refund anymore.

I still regret that purchase despite all the fanboys saying how amazing it is.

At least maybe I can get a refund for ARK but it seems everyone is being denied either because of a bug or Valve is seeing alot of people ask for refunds and doesn't want to lose alot of money so they are denying the rest now."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Glad to hear it worked! 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I know this sounds crazy, but you can still say puppy, anytime, everytime, all the time. It's an additional word, not a replacement word."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Like a special refund policy for early access games?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,See the issue is by the time the game is abandoned the devs run out of money usually. There's no money to take back.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I think a better policy would be the devs providing proof to Valve that they're actually working on the game. Otherwise, an update that legitimately takes a long time to work on could get them screwed over. Of course, then the process couldn't be automated, so it would be more work on Valve's part."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Ok, I get it, but at what point do we continuously milk our customers? "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I have 5 hours on record and they won't refund me because of it. I was waiting for it to be finished lol.... what a waste. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I only noticed them going to shit after the refund. I always liked the daily deals. I did only catch a couple sales with decent publisher packs. I think I got into steam after the peak you're talking about.  My favorite part of the sales wasn't even the deals but the atmosphere. By far the best I ever experienced was the steamsaledetectives busting ass trying to find hidden clues that were and were not there, such a good year.  Even the few years after where those of us that were into it were still trying to find what the connections were because they used the same characters for each sale over and over again.  Even then Steam couldn't give two shits to even bother continuing with it. After that big Christmas mystery that everyone got involved in they decided to not even continue even though it was something that would take minimal effort to keep going that got everyone pumped. Instead they focused on maintaining a bland steam sale instead of getting people pumped up for something big or fun."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Steam refunds meant the end of the great flash sales that they had.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I agree, that isn't right when you have so many people that backed your game early on. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I agree, that isn't right when you have so many people that backed your game early on. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I've only heard this thru other discussions on this but my understanding was that the refunds were a legal issue.  I think Australia was one of the country's that it became a problem which forced them into making refunds if they wanted to operate in those country's.  I don't think it's something anyone at valve wanted to implement I think it was a forced issue and as a result that limited them during steam sales with what they could offer since people could buy a game and an hour later if it went cheaper they would then refund the game and buy it at the better price.  I'd like to know if steam sale revenue is up or down since introducing the refund system because I haven't bought more then 2 games at a time whereas before I'd end up with 10+ each sale and I've seen others say the same.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I believe they only ""released"" it because they were getting a ton of flak for having paid DLC in a game that wasn't even released yet.

Now they have a Season Pass."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,True but I think the best recourse is then making the names attached to that game famous.  There's great developers and there's absolute con men.  I've seen a few times where people did make certain names known as scams I think that's the best recourse for fucking over the people that invested early.  Make sure any new game they are attached to that people are aware they abondoned other games. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,That is why my friends and I played on a private server and increased taming speed be a few hundred percent.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"It was both easier and tougher in the first month of the games release. Harder because Dino aggro was pretty wide and when the Ants were added, every tamer feared for their Dinos.

Easier, because people were so friendly. So many helpful people protecting each other while taming. Then the Asians invaded every server."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"2 hours if you are using the incredible annoying to make kibble, those first few tames where you have to use basic shit you can easily spend a full day cramming berries down a dinos gullet to keep it asleep long enough to tame."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Credit as in steam wallet? Or credit as in to a credit card? 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I will stand up for OP, [it worked for me.](http://imgur.com/a/J2KFd)"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Hopefully this can get sorted out so I can make a much more useful investiment in CSGO skins haha. Nice steam name btw
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Maybe *thats* why no progress is being made.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,does it only work because it recently came out of early access?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,What's the policy? If a early access game comes out?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,What's wrong with rust? Haven't played it for a long while but it was fun
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Prob along the lines of EA is seen as a gamble and they can change many things before making it 1.0 that could be game breaking so once game is fully released you have the ability to refund it if it wasn't what was promised? 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,My playtime is 1 minute. No joke. I couldn't even open the game as it crashed my comp every time. Still got denied the refund. :( 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,It's just came out of ea
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Oh
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"There is no content in the DLC that should have been in the original game.  The DLC is just another map with different creatures and resources.  If you prefer the dinosaur map without all the fantasy creatures, there is literally nothing in the DLC that you'd be missing out on."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Even worse is when they put a gun to my children's heads and forced me to purchase it 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Oh I hate Ark.  I've played like eight hours and I'll never touch it again.

But if you spent 300 hours playing that game you got your monies worth and making a charge back is a douche move."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Don't get me started on the fucking roll backs üò°. Despite all the bullshit, I've definitely got my ¬£17 out of the game."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah, I have to agree with you. I played back when it did run shitty, vs now which is worlds of improvement.

With hours spent playing in the triple digits, I cant justify to myself to refund the game, even if its an option."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Looking up base raiding in youtube would yield mostly Rust or Minecraft videos, with maybe two or three Ark videos. It was never that popular, especially after a lot of the players got angry for them releasing paid DLC instead of fixing the base game and leaving the base game to drown in bugs."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"> You'd look up the word ""raid"" and get nothing but hits for ARK. 

That's bullshit and you know it "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Pretty sure you are gonna get WoW links with raid and raiding
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Simple, people often get into a game because their favorite YouTubers play it. The game could be shit, but as long as Pewds is playing it, everyone seems to not care about the quality of the game."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"You can think whatever you want buddy, I don't care. lol"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,lol i'll never get my DayZ money back...
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I bought it within Steam and couldn't refund it.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I honestly don't remember how I bought it. :/
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,What exactly did you say to them? Because I got denied like a lot of other people in this thread as well.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,[deleted]
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Now I only need $13 to buy Battlegrounds haha.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Sure, *I* can say it. But who else? No one else says it. I feel like I'm speaking gibberish when I say anyways. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah, like once a game has for certain been abandoned or is updating so slowly your *grandkids* will be in school before it releases, you can refund it. Maybe mark an EA game as ""refundable"" in the steam store so people can see it? I dunno, just spit-balling ideas."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Exactly. Big updates like that could be handled with an ""appeal"" of sorts where they show Valve their WIP stuff to prove ""hey, we're working on it, stuff takes time because we're a small team"", and then the ""abandoned"" tag could be removed. Of course if they *do* have a big update like that, communicating it with players and the people who *have* bought their game will minimize returns even if they get the tag. Ideally it would be less ""you must refund"" and more ""seems like the devs died. You *can* get your money back now."" Good communication will prevent mass refunding, and the dicks that *insist* on refunding it would probably have refunded the moment the game left Early Access anyway."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I'm fairly sure I read reasoning that the steam sales were shitty due to the refund feature now as Devs were losing money due to people buying games at low prices, playing for 2 hours then refunding, I'm not sure about a source tho but it seems like legitimate reasoning to me"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Correct. The ACCC won a lawsuit against Valve on the grounds they weren't doing enough to protect their consumers. One of those being not allowing refunds within a certain time period.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"So they did shady shit, got called on it, and that drove them to do more shady shit?

Fuck these guys, the game runs like shit still and instead of fixing the problems with the game they are focusing on paid dlc.

Refunded."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Sure, but that doesn't mean you can't also get refunded for lack of getting what was promised.  Get a refund for the devs not fulfilling the promised product *and* warn people to stay away from future project from them.  It's not an abuse of the system, this fall right into the guidelines and its perfectly normal to be refunded due to false advertising.  This is what the refund system was *designed* for."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Steam Wallet
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Doubt it, seems to be no way to even query the decision. Can't find anything in their T&C to submit a new one with it either. Oh well. Glad some people go it."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah I don't think so, People complaining should be a reason for Devs to step up their game not give up on it."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,[deleted]
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,You mean to say ea published its official release ? Well here comes pay to play sigh. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,....dude... I just looked.... There's a Season Pass...... for a game that's on Early Access...... this isn't a good thing.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"> another map with different creatures and resources

> there is literally nothing in the DLC that you'd be missing out on.

like.....really? lol
"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Purchasing it isn't even the issue. Its that during the development of an incomplete product they had content for the game in development with intent to sell it before completion of the base game. It proved that manpower was taken off of the base game to make something to charge people for. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Tbh I've gotta disagree, I've got tons of time in ark, and the fact that alpha tribes on the server will wait till you're offline to completely wipe you, never even giving you a chance to build up, is a lot of bullshit."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah it's completely dishonest to refund the game with any decent amount of time on it. It's ridiculous.

I've only got about 80 hours and haven't played it in a long time, but still wouldn't refund it."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"They had to because of a lawsuit costing them a lot. Either release paid DLC or shut down the company, easy option.

The DLC does look great though, never had the money to buy it but really hoping to asap."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,How dare they charge for making new content for a game that could easily get you hundreds of hours of gameplay without it?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-31,"Too bad they're basically the entire game. Once you turn off or speed up the annoying grind of Ark, it becomes a game devoid of everything to do.

The entire focus of the game is ""Grind X so you can grind Y so you can grind Z. If you die you start over from X.""
The dinos are just for show, the game is ridiculously bland once you remove the grind."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,pretty sure i wouldnt have gotten it again if it wasnt free or included in something. So feel free to feel good about more than likely not paying for it :D
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,It runs smoothly on consoles and the silent majority's PCs. They have a big audience so why care about the vocal people who are complaining that their old hardware isn't running it or they aren't getting 100+ fps at max settings?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I don't know the details of early access contracts, but what I would consider fair would be a limited period of time for the game to exit early access, and the necessity that substantial progress on content and optimization be made in the mean time. Players have to keep in mind that paying for early access is helping the devs in exchange for a promise that the game will be driven into the standards of an actual release quality level. We're not paying for the game to remain broken and empty.

This thread just prompted me to make a refund request for DayZ that was gathering dust in the depths of my steam library, wonder how it will turn out."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I heard that too. I think they also end up owing money when a game is refunded. Its something like they still owe steam the 30% on a refunded game. This should be fact checked before anyone believes this though I'm only going off memory from other steam sale talk.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Reminds me of spore. Still never got to finish that.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,I'm going to disagree. I really don't like the refund process.  For myself I know if I buy an early access game and I get a turd then I feel that's on me. The developer is an asshole for not following thru but I made the choice to risk an early access and I should live with the consequences of wanting to get that early access I don't think it's right to start requesting refunds because it didn't live up or it turns out the whole thing was a scam. I think buyer beware should be enough.

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"In which case they got their money so why should they care?  There are a LOT of cash grabs in early access, they don't care about their reputation, they care about their money."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-31,"The first one I sent didn't have any notes. I sent a second one also, with notes on how bad the game was, that it crashed every time I attempted to open it, hence why it only has a 1 minute play time. Result? Another rejection. I don't even know and OP is not posting the policy he is talking about so I can't quote anything. I guess I'll just have to live with this mistake. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Early access my dude.
"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"My point was that there is nothing that should have been in the game to begin in the DLC, which is what the person I was replying to claimed.  The DLC is a completely different experience with fantasy creatures."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah, I think outrage culture made it too far into PC gaming. 

Paid Expansion while early access? Well, lets respond in a reasonable logical fashion that is warranted by the event: ""Obviously we don't buy the expansion for this fun as shit game we've been playing... Instead, lets try to ruin it as much as possible, because it seems the developers targeted specifically me and are trying to smite me. We have no course of action except mass down voting, bad reviews and general complaining!""

This kind of thing makes me wish for the return of gaming days, when the players didn't hate gaming so much. And sure my ""Example"" is a sarcastic exaggeration but it feels like this is becoming the norm for virtually any actions Developers take... Evil or not."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I just recently got back into a month ago on a private PVE server with some friends. Much more enjoyable for me than when it first came out. I've been on nearly every day for about 4 hours at a time. There's about 5 of us on it now working together on materials, taming, boss fights, breeding, base building ideas. After my first experience with the game I never thought I'd enjoy it as much as I am now. I haven't even touched the DLC yet. Still on the standard island map. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"The game was in early access. Before it was completed and was still in early access with new features/etc being added, they also released separate DLC, which they charged early access users for. 

The DLC was out before the game was completed."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"how dare they spending developing time on a cash grab, while the base game is still riddled with bugs."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Ohh! Do let me know how that goes! 

As for EA stuff, the limited period might end up giving us stuff like Sonic '06, where it's rushed just to be put out on time and isn't really a good product, even if technically ""finished"". Plus it would stop projects like RimWorld, that plays perfectly fine as-is, but uses Early Access as an excuse to keep expanding the scope without having to answer ""why not just make it an expansion pack?"" since it's still in EA.

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I actually enjoyed Spore, at least the first stage and last stage anyway, but it sure as hell was not what they said it was going to be. 

So much potential there, but I guess they rushed the release or something and we ended up with a really disjointed series of essentially minigames haphazardly mushed together."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"See, they way I see it is a bit different.  As an early access buyer I am doing a favor to the developer by beta testing their game (something that people usually/used to be PAID for) in order to help them improve the quality of their product, while also giving them funds to accomplish this end.  Now, if a game doesn't live up to the hype, that's one thing.  Scams and other things?  Fair game.  In ARKs case they proved to spend resources on stuff like DLC and console releases for an unfinished game and eventually said ""Fuck it, release it as is"".  As a consumer I was promised they would release a full game, they failed to deliver on that part, so yeah I want my money back.

The way I see it is there's two options, refund it and get my money back, or live with it and stop using early access.  Being more careful with what games you buy in EA isn't enough, its still a gamble even with that, and EA should never be a gamble.  First option punished developers for shitty practices, second option punishes *all developers using early access*.  I see no reason why a system that could honestly do a lot of good for fledgling game developers should be tarnished by shitty practices when you can instead just punish those who choose to abuse the system?  Otherwise other developers will also abuse the system until eventually people give up on early access altogether, which many people already have."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"same, except for more then 2 hours "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"haha, let me know how it goes. I'm pretty sure valve doesn't even have real CS people. They sit refunds on a 2 hour timer to give the impression of a real human looking at it. My guess is some people got it because the release reset the playtime and purchase date timers, but then it got fixed after people started to notice."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Because they can still get money from their reputation, new games, dlcs and etcs, they ain't going to live forever out of the money of a single game if no one spends anything on their products anymore."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Wait, so EA just released it as early access vs. whom ever was producing it before early access ??"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"You have no idea what you are talking about. Ragnarok is the community mod that became free dlc with fantasy creatures and a new map.

Scorched earth is the dessert biome of ark, locked behind a paywall, and there are a ton of tools and items people can only make by purchaseing and traveling to a scorched earth server."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"It's not like they were doing it just for the extra cash as well, they were sued and lost millions and released the expansion to help costs."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,They're a company who intends to make money.  I see no problem with them releasing paid DLC.  It's not like you're required to buy it.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yep, raid gets me bug spray."

6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Yeah, I replied on a public forum that was made for conversation. Then you replied with ""you can think whatever you want buddy, I don't care"". My issue with your post was that you complained about something without any reasoning behind your opinion. Of course you're going to get replies defending a game if you're going to shit on it without explaining why. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Why do people have such a hard time understanding this? You're going to hear complaints more than praises. If someone's game is working correctly they're not going to go rage about it on a forum. Then you use the fact that you haven't talked to anyone on console about it and jump to the conclusion that PC is being neglected because of consoles. Seriously?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"As I understand it, Rimworld would be (mostly) fine under such a system - sure, there aren't plans to move out of Early Access soon, but there's *clear work being done in that direction* - it's not just ""we're staying in EA because reasons"", it's actual ""we're staying in EA because there are features <x>, <y>, <z> (and probably more afterwards) that we want to add""."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Dayz wasn't refunded for me.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Apparently, they are close to beta, and they have been working mostly on the engine. **Apparently**"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-09-03,"I still would have enjoyed it immensely, if only I could have gotten it to run on my computers. It constantly shut itself down."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,EA should never be a gamble? I don't think you understand how much work is required for software/game development.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Fair enough, I never really considered the beta testing part of it. It does make sense though when you put it that way. We're not only buying access to the game but we're contributing thru data and feedback"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,[deleted]
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I agree with you with the ""favor"" part, as in, you are investing in their project. However you are certainly not beta testing anything and whatever you are doing inside the game nobody would get paid to do that. You are playing (having fun) with an unfinished software. Unless you are actually making checklists, bug checking JIRA for the latest build push or trying to reproduce the crash on the latest boss on hard mode that happens 1/5 times on a full playthrough, nope, you're just playing."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I was assuming it was a glitch myself. But who knows, maybe Valve will read the one email out of millions and give me a pardon! (Not Likely) "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"So?  Most of the games that go through with these shifty practices are simply looking for a quick buck.  Do you honestly think every dev, or heck at this point even a majority of the devs in early access is trying to create a successful business?  A good portion of the games in early access are there so the dev can attempt to make some quick cash.  If they need to try it again its a simple as using a new development studio name.  The studios that actually care about their reputation are probably not going to fuck over their players in the first place.  If the game is a scam, however, they probably don't care."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,EA means early access
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I know exactly what I'm talking about because I own the game and the DLC.  Scorched Earth has Rock Gollums and Wyverns, which are fantasy creatures.  It's just a map with a few different items.  There is nothing in it that you need and there are no features in it that are not available in the base game.  I don't even like Scorched Earth and I can't understand why people feel so hurt that they can't access it for free.

This thread is full of completely unreasonable people so this is the last reply I'll be making here.  You all just want to justify getting your money back for the game while having already played it a ton.  "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,Shouldn't have been sued in the first place. The guy violated a non-compete clause and was poaching employees. Pretty scummy.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I also think its rare these days for devs to release Expansions with levels of content worthy of a separate purchase. The expansion in question was huge and had lots of content. And had they not still been early access, the expansion would have been praised not scorned."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,they made money from people who paid them to develop the game and fix bugs. They spent that money to develop paid DLC and not fix the bugs. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"Youtube IS google, and is also customized based on past searches."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"I can shit on anything I want because not everyone has the same taste as you. I find the combat mediocre, the creature AI simple. the building system needs improvement, the human models and animations are shit, bugs everywhere and don't get me started on the expansion pack and all their other side projects they're working on instead of finishing the damn game. Are those good enough reasons for me to have a separate opinion of the game that you have?"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,I'm going to be honest I JUST realized that EA means early access and not the game company.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"In that case, shouldn't you get your money back if it falls through??"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"No, I do understand.  But if a developer says that they are going to deliver a product, they are saying that they will put in that work.  *All* of that work.  If they are not willing to do so and delver on their promises and quite halfway through, why should I let them keep my money?"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,">  They released massive amounts of new content repeatedly.

That they *charge you for*.  So they took time away from working on the game that people already bought so they could instead release something they could get more money for.  The general idea of early access is that you pay the devs money early so that cash can go towards finishing a game and making it better.  For Ark your money funded an expansion pack while leaving the base game unfinished (and lets face it, the game is *still* unfinished.)

If I wanted a bunch of buggy, unfinished content I would just download a bunch of mods.  At least all that stuff is free."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Any luck?
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"Oh my bad, I was thinking the company. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"i cant even get my money back, but im not about to support any shitty dev who makes a DLC for a game that isnt even finished yet. The Ark devs have a shit reputation for a reason. And its not because of us."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"So a dev releasing extra paid content instead of finishing the main game is ok with you? 

See people like you are the reason the game industry is a greedy steaming pile of shit now"
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"I don't disagree with that sentiment, and understand some people feel that way, but the way I look at it is:  I bought Ark for $20, I played for about 1400 hours.   I think more than got my money's worth."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,See everything is just shit with no reason why. You're just saying things are bad without saying why they're bad. Sounds like this just isn't the game for you. And I don't mind someone having a separate opinion of the game. It's just poorly explained opinions that only seek to damage a game's reputation that bother me. 
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,[deleted]
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Nope. Valve has actually come out and said that this was a glitch and all future attempts are refunding the game will not work. :(
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,"No matter what I say I won't satisfy you, so this is the last comment I'm sending your way. "
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,"> I'm talking about the countless free updates they pushed out. 

Thats not something special though.  The game is in early access and incomplete, these updates are just them working on the game.  If they *didn't* update the game with patches like this then the game would have been a flat out scam."
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-30,Guess they confirms refunds are fully automated.
6wsmzh,2017-08-29,2017-08-29,/r/folded

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Hey everyone,

We understand that the track record on Early Access games in general and in particular, Dinosaur games, isn't great. However we're set on being an exception. We want to be the team that does it right. The developers and the team behind ARK actually have quite a bit of veteran experience creating various well-known titles, so we're fully aware and committed as to what we're getting into! 

We plan to bring the game not only to PCs, but also to the console world. The expected release is Summer of 2016 and we'll definitely make sure to take advantage and use Early Access to the best of our ability to prepare for this. This coupled with the support we receive from our partners, we plan to make a great game. 

Hopefully you'll stick around and give us a shot and we can construct a fantastic world together.

Cheers,

Jat"

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,This looks like a dream game that's too good to be true so i'm a little concerned. There hasn't been a truly great dinosaur game since dino crisis 2. 
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,I loved the trailer. Still I am skeptical. 
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,oh my fucking jesus christ god
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,I want to believe.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,Hope it doesn't end up like Stomping lands
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Holy shit, i've been a fan of Dinotopia since I was 8! Im definitely going to check this game out. "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"What stood out to me, aside from watching guys majestically riding stegosauruses over mountain ridges, which I don't think will ever leave my mind, was the music. Around the one minute mark it sounded like the main theme from Fallout 3. Starting at 1:30 it sounded a bit like Hans Zimmer's Man of Steel score, at least the drum bit. And riding the teradactyls (with the slight Evey Reborn note there), god that looks amazing."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,This reminds me so much of the stomping lands.....please don't mess this up :)
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,I hope there's Megalodon!
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,any subreddit for this yet?

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Looks neat, but like all other large scale multiplayer survival games, will just turn into pvp for 99% of the player base, and no one will work together. "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"If you can deliver on just what is in this video, with stability and low buggyness, you'd already be ahead of most EA games that have been out for years."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,looks awesome. gonna wait for release though
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,Is this coming to consoles? Please tell me it is.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,This looks like everything I wanted B.C. to be plus more! I am very interested. 
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,Looks like it already has more dinosaurs in this than the 5 in The Hunt: Primal
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,I want to play this game just for the D&D: Dodos and Dragons. 
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,I think everyone including myself are very skeptical but at the same time everyone wants a game like this done really well so hopefully this one turns out great.  Good luck development team :)

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,After reading the full Steam store page and watching the trailer I can say I haven't been this excited about an early access game since The Forest. Hopefully this lives up to its immense potential.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,Far Cry meets The Flintstones. Awesome :)
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"This actually looks really great, hopefully it's not another early access disappointment."

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"Well you had me sold at riding Pterosaurs. Seriously, I'd buy a game just for that! What's with the dragon though?"
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,I'm going to stay completely reserved about this game since there's already about 100 of these kinda games on the market. It does -look- good though... but so have so many others.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"I have a question, will this game have some sort of story line or will it be like every other survival game where ""you make your own story"". I saw the part with the people venturing through the caves with a notebook and a compass and that got me excited to see a possible story along with the survival. "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"Oh man that looks great! I loved the music on Ori and the Blind Forest too! It was one of the reasons I bought the game.

My biggest concern is that you will just throw cool things in without thinking too much of how it will affect the game as a whole. 

For example, the ability to ride all of the animals will get old fast. It needs to be a challenge to find a species that can be tamed, some being much more rare/harder to tame than others. Also, riding giant scorpions might not be the best idea.

Another thing is how common the creatures are. From what I saw, they are kind of scattered everywhere and there is one just about every place you step. This is fine for smaller creatures, but the larger animals should either be a bit harder to find, should travel in very condensed herds, or should be packed into one very small area of the map.

I know that might sound condescending, but please don't take it that way. I'm really excited for this game and I don't want it to fail. This is my vision of the game, if yours is different then ignore my opinion, make the game you want. All I want is to put it out there so you can consider it. I hope the game works out whichever way you decide to go with it, good luck!"
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,Ok we got some space future things...Dinosaurs...Fuck it might as step into the fantasy genre and add a dragon for good measure.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,The last dinosaur game I played was carnivores dinosaur hunter and I loved it.  This one looks amazing in comparison!
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,I noticed alot of pop in in the trailer for distant objects
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"Hey that looks awesome, I think a good strat for you devs would be to giveaway a few early access keys to fellow redditors, after all, the community is the best way to give you free publicity.

one question though.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,The trailer looks awesome. What games have you guys made in your past? I can't find anything about your company nor any games you have made. Is this your first game?
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Hi Jat, first of all congratulations on your announcement, the trailer looks *fantastic*. Could you give maybe a short overview of what features will/will not be included in the Early Access? 

Also, just curious, what are some previous games members of the team have worked on? 
"
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Finally a game where I can mercilessly slaughter Dodos. 10/10.

However there is one problem I have with your game, the pteranodons. With the way you've had their wing membranes designed I don't think they could sustain flight. Their wingspan isn't that ""big."" I think you should have gone with Quetzalcoatlus instead since they're taller than a Rex when standing. Plus they have the largest wingspan of all time.

Dang, I'm glad to hear that. I felt foolish after donating to those guys who sold themselves as the ""team that wants to do it wrong""."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Will there be any form of campaign, story, or mission structure?  Or is it like most of the new wave open world survival games where there is none?"
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,is it at least 80% science based?
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Your idea sounds good, but you said it yourself..Early Access and Dinosaur games have so far been a losing combination.

Assuming you hit full release, I'd buy your product. But I can't give money to this before that. I'm sorry. It's not you, guys, it's me...really. "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,Will the dinosaurs have feathers?
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"Hey man this game looks great. Stomping lands broke my heart.

Any chance we gonna see Baryonyx in this game? "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,awesome hope you guys pull it off! because the concept of this game is the shit in my eyes! it got it all!
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"I was wondering if the Open world be in the form of Far Cry type of open world or WoW type of open world? 

Also, would it include multiplay/LAN coop? "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"Thanks for commenting! While I do appreciate your participation in hearing what we think, I personally will hold on this. I've just been burned a few too many times on Early Access games. This trailer does look fantastic and I can see a lot of potential! Please let us know when the full game is released as well please! I wish you all the best of luck!"

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"This is a great idea! I feel like video games give older gamers that sense of playing wit their toys like a kid again. This game looks like it will do a great job of that. More games need to be like this. In my opinion I think you guys should add more over the top things. Be able to be a spacema, or a ninja, or a cowboy. Fight dinosaurs, dragons, and other fantasy beast. But either way, I'm excited as hell to play this. "

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"You put the stegosaurus and the T-rex in the same time. The real difference between them is larger than it is between us and the t-rex. But I digress.

Also running like that next to a large sauropod like the brachiosaurus and triceratops seems very unrealistic. They would probably act very aggressive if a bunch of humans came running at them."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,didn't the devs release it EA and then just leave?
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,It said its coming out for xbox one and ps4 so I doubt it will be early access

Yeah, yeah, it adds to the ""survival"" and ""brutal reality of man"" shit but I'm not to keen on running from people with machine guns for 90% of the game the minute I step off the beach.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,Let's wait until we get to play it before saying things like that. But I agree it certainly appears to have a lot of great things done already. 
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"The visuals look good, but you can't tell much about the gameplay from this video. I bet collisions with enviroments are an issue when riding dinos (getting stuck on a rock?) And the combat with triceratops doesn't look that great. He should charge you so you can't just walk backwards to dodge his stationary head butt attack."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-11,"I thought the same, but if it's implemented well I think it could be really good."

>And yup, various of the team's worked on major games in the past, including the Uncharted series among other franchises. Also, all of our dinosaurs were designed by the original creator of Primal Carnage!

>Studio Wildcard was co-founded in 2014 by Jesse Rapczak, former Technical Art Director at Microsoft Game Studios

>ARK's music is created by Gareth Coker, the composer of ""Ori and the Blind Forest""!

This [programmer/designer](https://pl.linkedin.com/pub/rafa%C5%82-jarczewski/41/394/524) from CD Project Red also possibly. "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,"Hey there, sorry about the late reply.

We've been busy on all fronts and I was going to tackle reddit after though it took longer than I would have liked haha.

We've officially set up the /r/playark subreddit if you guys would like to check it out.

As for other games, some of the team have worked on Uncharted, Primal Carnage to name a few dino-related ones. As for other games/titles, we want to keep the focus on the game, not on the team for now. As we hit Early Access and shortly afterwards the team are likely to reveal more information about themselves, but right now the game is the priority.  "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,The team worked on Primal Carnage and the Uncharted Series.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,"Everything you saw in that trailer will be included, plus more.. It's hard to say what won't be included when we launch as there's a lot more we still plan to do from now til 2016. Could you expand, is there something in particular you would like to be in the game?

As for some of the previous games, Primal Carnage and Uncharted series are to name two, related to Dinos. As for the many others... the team are going to reveal some more information about themselves as we get closer to EA/Into EA as we want to keep the focus on the game. Though there's an experienced team around the game :)."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"I think the choice was probably based on recognition which is what they seem to be focusing on as far as the Dinosaurs themselves go. Just take a look at the dinosaurs featured in the trailer. T-Rex, Raptors, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus, Brachiosaurus (I could be wrong here, it could possibly be Apatosaurus), etc. Basically dinosaurs that are in Jurassic Park. To the general public all Pterosaurs are basically referred to as pterodactyls....Hell most of the general public doesn't even know that Pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs. Most associate pterodactyls with the Pteranodon. By this reasoning it makes sense that they haven't used Quetzalcoatlus for the pterosaur mounts since most of the general public has no idea about them. So the decision makes sense. Granted I totally agree that the Quetzalcoatlus should definitely be in there as a mount. I would love flying on that gigantic thing's back."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,yeah screw those guys.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-14,"It does seem to be based on science, at least paleontology. The raptors have feathers, although not completely covered like some species were. I don't know the lore of the game, but it seems like it takes place in a science fiction version of Jurassic Park.

What would you like to see in the game that is scientifically accurate?"
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,"That's perfectly fine! We understand that we've got a lot to do to overcome the stigma associated with Dinosaurs and Early Acccess (THANKS TSL) Though we'll do our best.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,I'm very excited for this game but too many times have i trusted unkown developers. I will not purchase this game until i know more about the team. You guys don't even have your own company website.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,">is there something in particular you would like to be in the game?

I was more curious of how much in the trailer would be included in EA (mountable dinosaurs for example), so it's exciting that all of it will be!

I guess aside from that, I'd be interested in what server options would be available (I heard LAN mode will be available at some point, which is a huge plus for me as I play a lot of coop games with my wife). 

One more question, if you could reveal this at this point. How does ARK handle dying? Is it like DayZ / The Forest where you die, respawn, and run back to pick up your equipment, or is it a more or less punishing system? 

Thanks for answering the questions! "
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,"Something I'd like to see, which is really a specific feature that could be reasonably put off till a later date, would be giving certain dinosaurs different utilities and weaknesses upon being tamed. 

Large herbivores could carry a caravan style group of people, with the largest ones being somewhat of moving fortresses but they would be slow and vulnerable to attack if not properly defended (possibly by mounted archers and spearmen.)

Pterasaurs would be the ultimate mobility mount, but have a complete lack of combat ability besides dropping a small cache of bombs. And they'd be very easy to kill, so evasive maneuvers and practicing flight skills are a must.

Bipedal predators would definitely be the war horses while armored quadropeds would be similar to siege engines and excel at destroying man made structures, but neither would tolerate carrying cargo.

others like deinosuchus could be employed as body guards for the herbivore convoys due to them being rugged and strong, but not too fast.


This games potential excites me.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"On their site it says the sauropod is a brontosaurus. We will see if that means they're using the new information found a week or two ago that brontosaurus and apatosaurus are separate or if they just prefer the name. 

I'm guessing the second, since all their theropods have pronated wrists. "

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,Yea I'm guessing the point is to keep progressing and slowly uncovering the mystery of why your there.
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-14,"I think he was making a joke about the ""100% science based dragon mmo"" which is is of a meme on reddit.

I personally would just like the dinosaurs to look and move better. The Pterosaurs are seriously awful in my opinion. Not only are the wing membranes nothing at all like the real deal, there's absolutely no way it'd be ably to fly with that sort of half assed flapping. 

http://www.itsnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pteranodon.jpg

They're just not supposed to have that bone in the wing, and the membrane is supposed to run completely through, instead of tapering off before reaching the body."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"How are you going to pay your bills with this... free thing? I don't think its a valid currency. /s

It takes time to develop a game, people need to get paid if they're to do it full time. If you do not have the capital for it up front, you put a somewhat stable/working version of you game out for a small fee. Enough people cash out because they believe in your idea and your ability to deliver on it, allowing you to pay the bills while working on your game full time.

Commonly referred to as Early Access."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"Which is fine. Feathers were a feature nearly isolated to a few branches of the theropods family. 

I know people like seeing bad ass t rexes with feathers but at best it had protofeathers and even then we aren't sure about that. I doubt they'll have the rexes we have found feathers on. "

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-15,"Server options - for EA, we're aiming to have: Single Player / Private Games / Custom Servers [dedicated] / Official / LAN. 

When you die - you will retain information on how to craft/create, your character's status and level are also retained. You will drop your items on the floor, but you can run back to your place of death and grab what you've lost. There's a time limit though, so go there quick before it decays / someone else loots it.

35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-12,"> What ever happened to a beta version?

Still valid as far as I know. Plenty of high profile games are so broken on release that one might just consider then to be some late beta build. Assassins Creed anyone?

> Early access is just a beta that you pay for, unless there's something I'm missing. 

True that, though like in the days of old, if game breaking bugs bother you, sit tight and wait for a stable, finished and polished release. Paying for early access is just as voluntarily as participating in beta testing.

> Why not just do what hardline did and have a beta for a short period. 

Hardline is part of the Battlefield machinery, which have the near bottomless pockets of Electronic Arts, an already established brand/franchise and the developer team of DICE behind it. Money pays the bills, the brand has an established fanbase and experienced developers with multiple titles in the same genre under their belt smooth makes things a lot easier.

Those 10 guys sitting in a garage? They don't have that kind of experience (first title for many of them), money (might have to borrow from parents/relatives, sell the car etc) or connections. And on top of that, they're starting their own brand/IP from scratch. They're called indie developers because they are independent from the big, medium and even small publishers. 

> I can't think of another industry where you pay for early access to an unfinished product.

I'd argue you'd take a similar chance when jumping on something very new, untested. Let's say you're the 5th owner of a Tesla car in the world. Very few have driven this car before and the few that have, have only done so a couple of weeks longer than you. Will it hold? How's the build quality? Battery? Engine performance? Recharge time? Even if the first generation Tesla cars don't live up to the hype, what about the second, third or forth generation? Technology improves over time, right?

Of course you can sit on the fence and wait it out. There is nothing wrong with showing disapproval for the Early Access business model. At the end of the day, it is your money. You're free to spend it however you see fit."
35lim9,2015-05-11,2015-05-14,"Amen to raptors, but again I'm fine with the Rex because they can't even get wrist pronation correct so I don't expect them to get the texture of the Rex correct when we don't have skin impressions of them yet. 

I've personally liked when people draw tyrannosaurus with a 'mane' of emu feathers as opposed to full body. Also when we look at the scale of tyrannosaurus relatives that were feathered compared to Rex, I think that leaves a little room for creative license. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, the rexes we have found protofeathers on were both Chinese (I want to say they both have long in their name) and were very early cretaceous which gives millions of years for tyrannosaurus Rex to have lost them and the lineage is more like cousin, as opposed to direct ancestor.

Truth be told, they can make mad dollars with very little effort. Maybe it's because I'm older now, but I realize that game devs are people too; bills to pay, mouths to feed and what not. If they can make a quick buck or two via 5 different texture packages, more power to them I say. It will in theory allow them access to more capital, which will allow them more resources to improve the existing game, or make another, potentially better game from scratch. Of course they could also just take the money and bail, but that's just a theory. A game theory!

It's taken me about a year of slider tweaking to figure out settings to suit my style of gameplay so this is a tough one to answer. This website helped [http://www.gamewalkthrough-universe.com/Walkthroughs-Guides/Ark-Survival-Evolved/Game-Server-Customization/default.aspx](http://www.gamewalkthrough-universe.com/Walkthroughs-Guides/Ark-Survival-Evolved/Game-Server-Customization/default.aspx)   

I'm not a big fan of chopping trees and rocks for hours on end to build things so I turn rates way up and weight capacity way up. Setting alarm clocks to wake up and feed video game animals is also a big no so tweak the snot out of that. 

It's definitely an amazing game but keep in mind, no matter what settings you use, the game finds a way to make things ragey difficult at times."

On reddit, you can tell it's personal."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Cod was pretty bad but I have to mention a game that I had a love/hate relationship with. There used to be a free to play game called defiance. I loved the game but that was after muting/blocking about 500 ppl. The game was plagued by modders/glitchers. Ppl running around PvP using aimbots and one shot killing ppl with an insta-spawn kill glitch. Then had the nerve to teabag and talk trash in the main chat box after they went 75/0 using an aimbot and lifesteal glitch. The amount of racists and homophobes was ridiculous. The game became literally dangerous when they found out a couple pedophiles were using the game to groom children. Total nightmare. The servers would crash every 20 minutes from ppl using a game breaking glitch to purposely overload the server and players would have to email the dev team to restart the server. Was an awesome game if you ignored pvp and turned off the main chat box. They shut it down a few years back and I actually felt relief when it was over even though I invested years into that game. Just blew my mind how horrible ppl can be when they're behind a keyboard.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"For what the game is vs the community that plays it? 

EASILY Sea of thieves is the most toxic community in and out of game I've run into. 

Straight delusion met with deep hostility towards new players, and insane demands of time and commitment for deeply mundane tasks. 

I like the game somewhat but enough encounters with the toxic shitbags in general and on the discord had me turned entirely off. If you aren't hearing slurs in the general game chat of the exclusionary culture in their discord that demands 2000+ hours to join a basic ass group for an inconsequential task....idk. 

The problem is the community but imo, the game designers are entirely culpable and the way they designed the game brought in a toxic mix of children and families who want to play a fun cartoony pirate game and a try hard elitism because of the way the game is structured around time sinks, PvP, and preying on the weak.

Frankly, unless the game does a 180 it can die imo."

A lot of the stuff is pretty tame on the surface. RP cities that function like a deeper version of GTA, battalions of clone troopers who fight battle droids, prisons where players can be an inmate or a guard, SCP facilities...and then the server list quickly goes off the deep end. Nazi Germany, US slavery-era plantations, high schools where players are randomly selected to be the active shooter. I'm pretty sure Auschwitz roleplay was on there at one point. 

Within the not-morally-apalling servers, things get confusingly competitive - to an antisocial degree. Most everybody feels the need to be a badass crime kingpin, so bending every rule to its max and skirting around any unnecessary and time-wasting interaction with others is a must when grinding certain tasks pays more. There is fairly constant bickering and accusations in most chat bars because everybody must be the winner and the main character."

When I first started people were complete assholes, acting like I should already have years experience in MMOs and have read every wiki guide, half the time it was more stressful than fun just because I don't like when people are mad at me, and you better believe they're watching your stats and will tell you if you're not doing something perfect, it's just not fun to play like that. Nostalgia for the Final Fantasy series and the solo activities kept me going, once I did all that and got my fancy weapons that took months of work, and did every dungeon through endwalker at least once, I turned off the game and cancelled my subscription and have never played another game online since, even Monster Hunter and I've played thousands of hours of that series, all solo.

However, if you have an incredibly thick skin and/or can ignore the chat and avoid the servers where trolls are rampant then you will be hard pressed to find another game that will hook you in. The gameplay mechanics are very satisfying and the content comprises of pretty much everything you can think of in the Star Wars universe. Every map, character ect you can imagine. It get updated regularly and has infinite playability. 

The most toxic *base game* (excluding community mods) that I've played? Probably one of the older CoD games like MW2 or BO1.

I remember talking to others in the community about it and so many tried to justify it and victim blame (ie ""they shouldn't have advertised it, they brought it on themselves""); in reality, these people ""advertised"" so that anyone who had been touched by this person was welcome. It was ridiculously callous and toxic to treat it like a joke and commit a mass slaughter, and it was even worse for me when those outside the issue upheld the fact that it happened and blamed everyone BUT the people who did it. Just pure meanness. I've also never seen another MMO (just personally haven't, not saying it's gospel) that was as addicting for so many of my friends as this one.

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I know there's the usual suspects, like CoD, LoL, etc.

But I'm gonna go old school, and nominate EVE Online.

The game,  by design, is incredibly toxic, and cheating, scamming and ganking is not only not against ToS, it is actively ENCOURAGED. The ethos of the game is basically ""do onto others, before they do onto you"". Because they WILL, it's only a matter of time. In any other MMO, if you see another player, it's a toss-up as to what is going to happen. Maybe they will be a dick, maybe not. In EVE, if another ship lands on your grid, you better be running, because it's never good news. In fact, the moment local starts spiking (ships entering your solar system), most people are already hitting their warp drive and heading for a deep space safe spot where they can only be found with active probes, and those take some time, and you can always bounce between deep safes which will buy you time. Because those people that just spiked local are never there to give you free cookies and leave peacefully. And with these kinds of people, things like racism and homophobia are EXTREMELY casual, nobody bats an eyelash. I mean yeah, you can report it, and maybe they'll get a short suspension, but that's as far as it went, after a while you just don't even bother.

The main difference though is that CoD, LoL, etc., are full of kids and/or dumb people. You sort of expect this kind of thing from those kinds of people, and can sometimes shrug it off. But EVE is a slow, methodical, thinking-man's game with incredible complexity. Most of the player base are adult, and many of them professionals. So you'd expect higher quality from a community with a demographic like that. But it attracted the vilest people.

Now, this is not to say EVE does not have some genuinely amazing people and friendly corps. It does. Just like every other popular game. But that's an exception rather than the rule."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-07,"Now, hear me out on this: Team Fortress 2.

It's a stone-cold dead in the ground game, but there are still so many players who insist that ""there's an big update on the way, just you wait! This game will go on forever!"" They make multi-hour long video essays about weapon balance nuances, map trivia, and patch notes history. They will wax philosophy and make verbal love to every singular aspect of the game (besides mini-crits and the phlog).

All of that would be fine, just quirks of a community, but it comes at the cost that near every single one I've talked or listened to is **VERY** defensive of the game and at even a *whiff* of competition or comparison they will flip the fuck out. Somebody says they think Overwatch had more variety? Fuck you, casual, you're outta here. Somebody says that the game is too hard to pick up with lobbies full of 'ten year veterans'? Fucking scrub, fuck off back to baby land!

They do that passive-aggressive shit where they bully people for picking certain classes. ""Oh, you're going Pyro? Haha, that's utter trash, ha ha, *juuuuust kidding*"" and will dogpile most anyone who plays as the medic and flip out if they didn't intuitively pick up on the 300 IQ plan that they hatched up for jumping right into the choke point and soloing the enemy team.

I'm sure, absolutley positive, that people are going to say that they've never, *ever* played with people like that in all their time playing the game, and it's actually the most supportive and cheerful community out there, and to these people I would like to ask how it is that you evidently have the staggering amount of luck it takes to stroll through a rainstorm without getting wet?"

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I mean easily The Last of Us and MOBAs, but I wanna give a special nod to the Fallout community. They are toxic specifically in the fact that they can't stand the video games they're fans of. Fallout has been owned by Bethesda for longer than it was owned by the OG creators, there are more Bethesda Fallout games than there are Black Isle/Interplay/Obsidian Fallouts, and they still just HATE anything Bethesda does with the game. Never mind the fact that Fallout would have been dead if Beth didn't pick it up, and when Black Isle DID own it they were putting out stuff that involved Bawls Guarana and Slipknot soundtracks. [Big tiddies and tribal tattoos](https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/124832-fallout-brotherhood-of-steel-xbox-screenshot-through-dialogue.jpg). The fan base at the time had already basically given up on the franchise by the time Bethesda bought it, and Van Buren was canceled in favor of Brotherhood of Steel 2 (and increasing their console presence overall) so the Slipknot vibe was the official one going forward. All of this is neglected and the new Fallout game is always hot trash to them. Until a new Fallout comes out, then the last one was an underrated gem and the new Fallout sucks. You can even see this to this very day, the narrative around Fallout 4 shifted on /r/fallout around when 76 dropped. Suddenly 4 was a much better game according to them, and the idea that it didn't deserve all of the hate is commonly very popular.

I feel like ""toxic to the very game you're fans of"" deserves a special bit of attention, The Last of Us is bad for it but Fallout is the grandfather of ""fuck this game I love"" culture."

I Play League of Legends and have done so since it first came.The rampant toxicity in that game due to peoples genral lack of empathy and understanding when someone does not play the game exactly how they think it should be played is amazing.

I've dealt with people who have had a promising professional career lined up for them, new contract signed with top e-sports organizations at ages 17-20 and they still burn it all by being toxic/recist in-game and recieving full bans due to their behaviour.

I've played World of Warcraft PvP both within bigger groups of players and in the open world situations and it's ridiculous sometimes how people simply thrive from seeing someone go ballistic and just flame/grief people for almost no reason.

People set up entire discord servers where hundreds of people join in just to grief and ruin the game for a single guild. it's amazing."

I'd assume they were just trashtalking, because every time a takedown took place, a photo would be snapped and sent to the other guy using PS Eye. I had a lot of dick pics sent to me. the worst part was I didn't know those pictures would get saved to your HDD by default, so years later I opened the folder on my PS3 to find some certain pictures and got surprised with a bunch of middle finger, dick, stupid face pics. good times."

Even after role queue it takes 20 minutes to find a game as DPS, and everyone flames you no matter how much damage / which medals you get if you lose. At least in LoL it's easier to see when someone gets solo killed 4 times in 5 min, or if the jungler is afk farming only, in overwatch everyone just assumes everyone else is playing bad."

My pick would be csgo, lol and dota. Competitive games are melting pots for sweaty tryhards that can't take a loss or can't take responsibility for things going wrong.
They really don't understand the team aspects of those games.
""I'm so much better than this team/ you guys are shit/ random single person lost us the game""
Yelling on voice, starting to feed/cheat/drop n-bombs in all chat and so on.
If most people were just open with how to communicate on a basic level for teamwork, I would never stop playing these games, but it's really ruining all the fun. 

The most double edged community, as in people are either super helpful or completely gatekeepy toxic asshats, has to be path of exile.

Asking a question in chat feels like russian roulette. It's hilarious, because it's never just a straight answer, it's either an invite and the person explaining stuff like a father to you, or it's Gregor Mengele finding his next victim. No in-betweens"

Sometimes you‚Äôd team up with people until it came time to extract gear, then the fighting started.

Even in the games titled ""beginners welcome"" and a buddy teaching me it wasn't worth the hatred so many people had for newbies. On top of that, the game is complicated and has a ton of nuances that are hard apparently absolutely crucial to your team mates ability to play the game."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"ARK.

Box tribe invasions. 

The game mechanics of jumping servers allowed for financially and racially motivated, coordinated attacks on OC servers.

It got to the point many just gave up, can't be awake at 3am night after night. Most just walked away."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Ark/Atlas are especially bad, due to the completely inept moderation by the devs, who refuse to take any meaningful action against the worst subsets of the community. The number of times I saw flat out Neo-Nazi recruiting on the official servers was absolutely unacceptable.

They devs have also not learned their lesson on how the cultural differences between Western, and South East Asian, players led to these outlying groups kicking off literal race wars on the official servers.

To top it all off, Ark and Atlas were both built on work that was illegally taken by ex-employees of a previous company, and led to a $40M lawsuit. And their parent company, Snail Games, has been linked directly to cheating/hacking tribes on both Ark and Atlas‚Äôs official servers. Going so far as to roll back servers to prevent the destruction of their own bases, and then taking action against those who attacked them."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,What a save!
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"They had an update recently where they removed the ""Psynet"" icon.
Basically you can't tell if people are on your platform anymore so you don't know if the other players see your messages.
Idk why they did this, communicating with others or banter is so much harder to do now"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Rocket League is literally the only game I‚Äôve stopped playing due to the community. This was years ago though after playing a lot and after coming back I‚Äôve had the same experience as you, people are immensely more reasonable. A lot of the toxicity has been pushed out although plenty still remains."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"RL is so weird because I can have games where I'm dominating the other team and we're just having fun in the chat making jokes or I could be in a tie game and have a teammate throw 3 goals because they thought me saying ""Wow!"" was being toxic at them.

Biggest issue is toxic smurfs. They need to do better with that because if you're in a ranked match against smurfs, you better hope they're on their way down and not up so they will ff. And if they're on your team, you're SOL.

Also you shouldn't get a demotion when your teammate is afk or even leaves a match. Maybe unless you're partied to dissuade smurfs. But I tell you nothing will tilt me more than fighting for my life in a 2v1 and then have the demotion afterwards."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,">Rocket League sucked for awhile.

Still does. Recently got back into it, and the only chat I've seen is on lower ranks (bronze - gold). Once you hit plat, everyone just shuts up, and you cannot tell if they are actually listening to your quick chat commands (I got it, go for it, etc).

Its been replaced by the overwhelming forfeit requests after going down by a single goal early in the game. It gets really annoying, round after round, even if you end up winning."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,That's interesting to know.  Rocket League is the only game I've ever quit because the other players were such awful excuses for human beings.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I fucking hate the policy of killing the newbies. It ends up being annoying
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,The vast majority of GTA Online players are under the age of 14 and are more toxic than Chernobyl and Love Canal combined.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Absolutely this!
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Special nod to the GTA RP community for that.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"There's like, different types of toxicity. Acids. You know? GTA V takes the cake for whatever chaos is in toxic form. You go in almost absolutely expecting nutty.

But then, there's LoL people mentioned. It has to be the winner (IMO) for a community with the most toxic learning curve? There aren't many more brutally abusive games I can think of to be a beginner as LoL.

And for the, well, I don't know anymore but when I played Overwatch (OG season 1-8) and a bit in the teens. OW seemed to always be the most toxic to females. Holy moly the hate people have for gamer gals in OW that I remember.

So yeah! We need like, Toxic Oscars ü§≠"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"I used to play GTA online so much, nearly quit when I 1st started because the flying bikes would constantly kill me. Then I got my own and everyone actively avoided me. 

Final straw for me though was when I tried to do the heists, would take half an hour just to get enough people and someone would quit as soon as you started, taking you all out of the whole thing. Fuck that."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-09,"Yeah it‚Äôs trash. I have made my millions in entirely PvP lobbies and can say it‚Äôs amazing how cruel people can be. There are good people though (team up! No bully is as big as all their victims united!), and you learn a lot by overcoming the challenges. For those people who really want to strike back, research the ‚Äòstrike teams‚Äô at the Facility. I routinely run bad souls out of the lobby with this tool. It‚Äôs amazing how quiet it can get when you‚Äôve given 2-3 players a taste of the bitter pills!"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I just started playing League for the first time ~6 weeks ago and my experiences have been generally positive.

Only one person in one game told me to hang myself, the rest of the commentary has been pretty constructive criticism."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,The league of legends assholes graduated into Valorant try hards.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"This.  League, DOTA, basically any MOBA except weirdly heros of the storm seems to breed toxic players.  I really think it's the fact that your competing with your team as well as the other team that does it.  If you aren't last hitting, you don't get gold or XP so you can't keep up.  At least HOTS has the whole team level up together.

Note: I'm not saying that HOTS doesn't have toxic players, just that my experience is far fewer of them exist than other mobas."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I quit cause my own friends were too toxic hahaha
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Honestly not anymore, I‚Äôve been playing since I was sixteen and female. It used to be awful but honestly I‚Äôd say cod is way worse now I don‚Äôt get death threats on league anymore but as soon as guys know you‚Äôre a female on cod it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I came on this post to write exactly this, but you beat me to it."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Here here. I started playing League back in 2010 when it was still in open beta and was super involved with the community at the time. It was a small bunch of people and you'd run into the same regulars all the time, including the devs and other Riot employees. For a while, I had Pendragon, Phreak, and Riot Morello on my friends list and played with them from time to time, it was a fun little game that had a lot of potential.

Then it exploded in popularity after release and the swarms of unwashed masses flooded the game. Riot was extremely slow in addressing the growing toxicity and they let it fester for so long that it eventually became a part of the game's core identity. Now, you have the enemy team muted by default and your own team will flame you into oblivion with death threats and racial slurs any time you, they, or anyone else makes a mistake. It's awful.

I stopped playing regularly almost 6-7 years ago and stopped completely about a year ago. I only played it for so long because of my IRL friends and our attachment to the early days, but that game is long dead."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I switched from console to PC and made it about a year. I had enough and deleted it. I'm so happy to not play it anymore and it's been 3 years.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,The community really got the vote to kick option removed cause they would use it every game just because lmao
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"Totally agree.  Anything that is said about CS:Go exists in Siege tenfold.  

Before I quit I took some statistics.  I played 50 games, solo queue, and at least 45 were toxic in some way.   I got kicked by my team upon joining at least 10 of the games.  Voice chat spam in 20+ more.  LOTS of racism too.

It's not even like I'm a bad player or anything, its just the community is terrible.  I really liked the game, but it was too much of a pain to play without a pre-built team."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,ten plucky waiting rob history axiomatic imagine squash nose tart
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"CSGO is probably the worst because from the very start of the game you have to buy the right guns 


As a new player I got yelled at for spending my money wrong before the actual match even started. Then I get 1-tapped by veterans with AKs and I no longer want to play the game"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Stopped playing CS for a few months. When I decided to go back, had a bit of luck and headshot 3 person in a row. Immediate ban from server. It is the last time I played."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,You think it‚Äôs like a rank or level thing?
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Gotta get CSGO prime, free CSGO sucks ass since it was made free."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Not saying those guys were not toxic, cause they were. But it's generally a good idea to put in some hours in casual and gungames before going into a 5v5, to get a feel for the game without any real consequences to dying. Cause people will be competitive, since that's the point of that game mode. If one teammate turns out to be entirely new to the game you're at a major disadvantage."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Even the god damn scientists and animals act almost toxic in that game, and they're essentially just pre-programmed bots. lol.

Usually I have a ""peak of frustration"" that I get over and start loving the game after. With *Dead by Daylight* it happened around 75 hours; I've now logged 1400 hours.

With ***Rust***, that moment never came. At 250 hours, I not only quit and uninstalled it, I actually hid it from view in my Steam library because just seeing it in there made my stomach turn."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I get on to gather on random servers for random people. 

Being solo truly blows and there is always some jerk that kills me, ruining getting free resources for anyone on that server.

Ive never seen a more toxic community in 20 years of gaming, and I was in COD MW2 lobbies all the time!"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I‚Äôve heard horrible things
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,This is what I was gonna say
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"Also r/BatmanArkham. 

Wouldn‚Äôt call them wholesome though, they‚Äôre more like ‚Äúspecial‚Äù."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"It's a shame you can't really interact with the community within the game beyond just giving likes or upgrade materials. But by and large, most Stranding players just want to place structures that will do the most benefit for themselves and others. 

Of course you also randomly find a bridge in the middle of a flat field that somehow has 750,000 likes."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,Makes sense.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I‚Äôve actually had that happen with a 4 now that you mention it
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"It's a great game, but if you are a beginner, good luck.
I heard everything about my mom, my sister, myself, and all my family members.
Uninstalled in a couple of days later"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"I feel like siege is great when playing casual only but comp seems pretty toxic.

Also helps playing in Australia, way more banter and shits and giggles."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,Kicking was abused so much in Siege they actually removed the feature. Not even kidding.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I have played fps games a long time. Almost every big one that came out. When I got on OW I was shocked at how whiny everyone was. I had never heard people complaining so much it really caught me off guard. Id much rather someone calling me a bitch than complain about what hero everyone was running for ten minutes.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Dammit, beat me to it. I love overwatch but fuck that sub."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I played all the games listed so far. By far Overwatch is THE MOST toxic of the bunch.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"Nah people on overwatch are nice compared to league, valorant, ark and dbd lol."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I have a buddy who is genuinely one of the nicest people I know that plays OW. But when he plays the game, he suddenly turns toxic! He used the teammate prevention feature to stop being teamed up with someone just because they were new and not as good as him‚Ä¶. In casual matches.

He also has a weird obsession with Mercy to the point that if the enemy picks Mercy he makes it a point to kill them and then starts name calling them under his breath for ‚Äúthinking they can play Mercy‚Äù. It‚Äôs super fucking weird to me."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Literally ez killer gg every game in inbox
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Yeah, I actually try to expose myself the least I can to the subreddit, which sucks beacause there are a lot of helpful people that get drowned in the toxic majority."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"Yup. You either play the way survivors want you to and shit talk, or you beat them and they shit talk. It's very rare that at least one survivor doesn't get pissed for any reason. There's a laundry list of things that community hates on."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"This is why I play solo, I used to love playing with randoms because you never knew what the dynamics would be like it made it interesting.

But recently I've had a couple of groups single out my playing style and flame me for not having a mic or using a keyboard to type messages out and I am not the greatest player but I've been playing since the 90s. I'm not changing my play style.

I find the consoles are the worst offenders xbox in particular, my eldest pointed out that he gets alot of bad messages but he just deletes them.

Why can't we all just get along."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Not necessarily toxic but I've never seen a more self-deprecating community like Halo.

New players that enjoy Infinite join the sub looking for tips and people to play with, only to promptly get told: "" ahcktually, Infinite sucks! Do yourself a favor and play Halo 3, so much better."" Because everyone in there is living in 2007.

Obviously, nothing wrong with Halo 3, but just really gives the wrong first impression."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Call of duty was always toxic growing up so don‚Äôt mind it.It‚Äôs the one game the toxicity made it fit in since sometimes funny reactions
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Haven't ran with toxicity in halo infinite but halo 5 was filled with so much team killers it was unplayable
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"The trick is to cause infighting in the other team. When one of them messes up, you gotta point it out to their teammates. (GG mid feed, ect)

When your dipshits mess up, you have to be very calm and nice to them."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I agree. I avoided CoD since Black Ops and then my cousins really wanted to play. I played DMZ on MW2 and it was actually pretty positive interacting and cooperating together. Bought the full game and my first match of general matchmaking was full of people using n-word and telling me to kill myself.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,Easily the most racist community to exist for generations now
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,It's where I found out my mom has sex with a lot of people. Good times.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,It for sure has its horrible moments but I‚Äôve been finding tons of decent people in DMZ mode.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,For sure. You know how many matches have ended with virtually everybody on both sides just cussing each other out. All over a fuckin game lol.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Bro why aren't you running an exotic? Your energy weapon is off class how are you going to make orbs? Why aren't you running firepower or wells for font of might? Why did you waste your super on that yellow bar? 

Dog it's a strike. Chill."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Lmao I remember going on LFG for trials and everyone was ‚Äúmust have mic/ 10.00kd/ platinum elo, don‚Äôt lie I‚Äôll be checking‚Äù 

Also raid peeps who would give you the 3rd degree about your raiding experience only to find out they sucked and were looking to be carried

Game was great though, bummed when my clan stopped playing because they didn‚Äôt like the first or second dlc (forget which one everyone hated on, lol I liked them)"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"As someone who plays D2 regularly and loves it, I don‚Äôt blame you in the slightest. I typically tend to tune out that side of the community when playing and learned to just have fun with the tools and skills I have. That being said, yeah, the community is still rather rabid."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Yeah I don‚Äôt touch pvp with a 50 foot long stick excluding mayhem, the pve community isn‚Äôt as bad though, there are some bad eggs but you can instantly tell after a while"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Back when I first started Destiny 2 in year 1 I ended up doing competitive PvP just to get the quest off my list(I don‚Äôt like having quests left undone) and had someone end up messaging me after one of the three matches it makes you play just cussing me out and telling me I should quit playing. Like dude I don‚Äôt typically play PvP I‚Äôm just here for a quest and that‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt take it so seriously, it‚Äôs a game üòÇ"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"Certainly some sour apples in the D2 community, as with any other game, especially in PVP, but there are also plenty of good groups of folks that are very friendly and helpful if you look for them. Even in LFGs you can find a bunch of friendly sherpas. It sucks that one or two negative experiences can put an entire community in a bad light, but I LFG all the time and have been in a bunch of big community clans with loads of friendly folks and have a positive experience well over 90% of the time."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"The best part is when you‚Äôre playing Mercy, you‚Äôre the only one on the payload, and every one complains that you‚Äôre not healing every player simultaneously. ‚ÄúHealer diff‚Äù said the DPS with less kills than the support"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"My friend will be in the top damage as Rein and the entire team will yell at him for not doing tank work. Like dude, you picked DPS, I, the healer, shouldn't have more damage than you, it's not a shock that the tank is out doing you."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"I'd have to disagree. There's plenty of valid criticism regularly upvoted in the community. The community just happens to also receive a lot of people who want to troll instead of providing valid criticism.

Playing in game, you'll generally find some of the nicest, most helpful people you can meet."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-06,"The community is actually great, very positive. 

The issue is all the trolls that show up that criticize the project and make all sorts of wrong accusations despite having never even played the game themselves."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"That's funny, kinda the exact opposite experience I've had on the usual gaming subs. Every time I've seen it come up, there's been an outrageous, irrational level of hatred for SC and the developers from people that haven't actually bought the game or ever planned to. Meanwhile, the people that actually paid for it are mostly happy with it and are just waiting patiently for it to leave development hell.

On one hand, I get it - the game's been in development forever and they've spent a metric fuck ton of money. I just don't understand why randoms on reddit have such an invested interest in hating it and calling it a scam. Feature creep and incompetence are certainly fair things to complain about, but that doesn't make something a scam. Alas, expecting any degree of nuance from the reddit hivemind is a lost cause."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,The community was pretty great until they upped the server size to 100 players. Now it just feels over crowded and stuffed with children and trolls.
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,I actually wish I could play but pretty sure it‚Äôs PC exclusive atm

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-07,That's what happens when a sequel comes out that directly mocks the fanbase that allowed it to succeed. It's like they hate their fans with how disgustingly awful TLOU2 is.

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"The game itself is amazing, if you have a 5stack. The problem is that a single player can throw a game, and snowballing gold means that playing from behind is just flat out not fun. The community is also split between people who play the game to play the objectives, and people who play the game to play their champion, and there's basically an irreconcilable mindset gap between the two playstyles.

LoL counts on moments of extreme excitement, and extreme frustration and boredom. It's kind of like an abusive relationship to play."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,The Halo community is just depressed and acting out. Communities like Rocket League and CoD are genuinely toxic.

Otherwise, Fromsoft's community is geniunely the best gaming community I've ever participated in the past decade. 

I have never seen a fanbase so supportive of each other, constantly making impressive art, theorycrafting about what's to come, participating in fan events, and simply engaging in jolly cooperation. 

If you ask for help against a boss, you can get a summon within minutes, even in the most inactive Fromsoft games. That has been such a help for my disabled self.

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I have 6000 hours in modded dayz - PVP / raid style servers.

That community, along with rust, will legit call off work, cancel any school plans, girlfriend, and daily life tasks‚Ä¶.just to offline raid you or camp your base for a week straight, in groups of 5-20 for 8-16 hours a day. Until you leave the server.

I‚Äôve legit seen, experienced, and there are videos on YouTube showcasing the lengths these kids will go.

I played on a dayz server called rearmed and there are multiple clans on there that have 24/7 raid surveillance. A dedicated player with no job or life commitment that is on for 16-20 hours a day. I won‚Äôt say the clan names but there were 4-5 of them. 

There are dedicated players in both games (rust / dayz) that their jobs are to name change, personality change, and befriend other players just to steal all their shit and run them off the server. 

I‚Äôve been told by a 30 man Zerg on dayz their goal is to ensure that you quit the server. They do not want you to have a good time. Insane. 

I‚Äôm convinced these style of games attract the worst of the worst of society.

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Hots I feel is less toxic because you level as a team, you can't hard carry so there is less ego that goes into matches"
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"HotS probably had less toxic players because it's more casual, sorta like playing Smash with items on. You also can't win any fame or money with it, really. I remember when the game was new, it wasn't very toxic, but when it had its first tournament with a prize pot, there was an uptick in toxicity. But the game didn't have much staying power in E-sports."

Toxicity knows no ends because pretty much no one is 100% right about what to do and not do to.

Most common stupid idea I see in dota are those who think it‚Äôs more important for a core/carry to get their 4th high tier item when a support doesn‚Äôt even have a basic survival item to stay in a fight versus way more farmed heroes. I‚Äôm talking ghost scepter, glimmer cape, aeon disk, etc."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"I think with a lot of Build-craft-survive games, (i.e. Rust, Ark, Minecraft, The Forest, Project Zomboid and other games like them) they are way better with whitelisted servers/curated communities.

Otherwise you're stuck with bottom of the barrel people. That's how I've been playing these kinds of games. A select group of friends that we have on a small server, anyone we bring in for a ""season"" (i.e. whatever we're playing at the moment on the server) that doesn't fit in just doesn't get invited back. Might come across as a bit harsh but if someone is making the game unfun for a portion of the group then that's not something we want. Especially since the group is roughly 7 people at the moment, any one person starting shit influences the experience a lot.

Example would be a season we did of Minecraft, had a community base/townhall where we had an agreement for everyone to build it up first as a pool of resources and other communal storage and facilities. Then when we got to building individual houses/projects you could pull from the communal resources with the expectation that you'll contribute back what you took or something else. Had a guy ask to join, not contribute but continually taking resources, started goading people into dueling him because he beelined getting netherite whilst everyone else was just enjoying building stuff and going on small adventures, kept starting building projects and dropping them within 5 minutes because he got bored leaving the area people were building their very aesthetic projects looking like a junkyard, and so on. We didn't invite him back."

But psychological warfare and inciting infighting among the enemy (or even your own really)?

 Instead of putting in new heros they should focus on making new game modes or maps and they should've expanded the storyline more or used the stuff from the storyline for special events like horse riding or calling animals with emotes or having to fight animals.

 And lastly they should balance the fucking war map situation because let's be honest there's probably not even 1000 samurai faction players (If there is I'm genuinely surprised) whilst there's definitely atleast a million fucking vikings .ATLEAST."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"> I will agree with everything but isn't the point of downvoting to show disagreement without using harmful words?

Nope, upvotes/downvotes are specially not supposed to be agree/disagree buttons according to the official reddit guidelines. They are supposed to be for whether or not a comment contributes to the conversation regardless of whether or not you agree with what a person said."
10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"Downvoting mostly fails because everyone has totally different logic for why they downvote.

Some people downvote misinformation. Some people downvote opinions they don't like. Some people downvote facts they don't like. Some people downvote just out of spite. Some people downvote simply because a post isn't their *favorite* post, even if they don't have any problems with it.  And then you have the people who don't even have a reason for downvoting. And to top off all of that, all of those reasons can be artificially inflated by brigading by a group of like-minded individuals.

I think one of the few good things Facebook has done from the very start was not having dislikes. They're just contextually useless on social networks at scale and do more to spread toxicity than to give any worthwhile feedback. And because of the herd effect, posts that get voted in one direction tend to trend further in that direction *even if the voters don't necessarily agree with that direction*, because people are stupid at decision making when confronted with evidence of prior decisions. ""5 people hated this post, they must know something I don't and I don't want to look like an idiot, so I'll be #6."""

&#x200B;

>LoL counts on moments of extreme excitement, and extreme frustration and boredom

These two statements seem at odds with each. Personally, I played it off and on for almost 8 years from the original open beta, and I think the 2nd statement is much more accurate. Even playing with a 5 man group of close friends with a healthy mindset, the game is dull half the time, and frustrating the other half of the time, with like a tiny sliver of fun one game in 20.

For summoner's rift, the meta has been stagnant for years and it's either a horrible landslide win / loss from how snowbally the game is, or nothing happens for 25 minutes and suddenly one team wins out of nowhere.

The champions are so wildly unbalanced and the damage numbers are so overtuned that the actual fights take less than 10 seconds and most of that time is spent CC'd so you aren't even controlling your character.

Truly the only redeeming quality of League of Legends is the art, and that's only because they poached the crew of Dawngate after EA shut down the project. Everything else about it is a monumental dumpster fire."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"RUST would like to have a word.

But yes. All online games have toxicity innately in them. Because, we, as players of games are all unique individuals. Shove everyone in a room with the guise of anonymity and you'll see some pretty out there actions/reactions/hot takes given because of the principle of ""they don't know me so I can say whatever I want without fear."" But on the transverse of that you'll also see some really humble/amaxing actions/reactions happen. You'll see folks who might have varying backgrounds create their own social community and in turn slap down the toxic/edgy behavior, and slowly you'll see room dynamics shift one way or the other. But there will always be toxicity whether apparent or not while looking in.

Because the most vocal side of a game tends to be the toxicity, you might encounter a toxic player one match, then have a few without said toxicity, only to run into it again later on.

No game that is online; heck even offline games aren't free of toxicity; because someone will always say/do something to get a rise out of you as a person; it's more prevalent in Online since it's more of a forced cycle of potential matches/seasons/whatever; offline it's more related towards speedrunners/Lets Plays/Guides/Streams where you'll more often see toxicity within comments more directed at you and your actions in a game.

So no one game has a most toxic community, as a lot share overlaps; folks who play CS:GO might play DBD/RUST/ETC so they take it there; someone who plays WoW might take it to OW/Hearthstone/Whatever game they feel meshes with them. You only really /notice/ toxicity in abundance when you play specific games that share a wide overlap of a core game idea (PVP/Leaderboards) where folks can ""flex"" their e-peens on folks and treat them like shit because once again anonymity. Granted I feel in my older age that the vast majority of the extreme fringe cases of a toxic player is the younger generations trying to just be edgy; let's be fair here, we as gamers probably have seen/heard/said ourselves everything that a teenager today might be spouting at us; and I'm sure you can remember being just as cringe about it.

That's my TED Talk on it. Point is, you'll always encounter toxicity, it might seem more apparent in some over others but that is solely based on how long you play a game for. If you play Hello Kitty Online Adventure for 2hrs you might not see much toxic behavior compared to if you played WoW for 16hrs straight. It's all about the amount of time played in a given session that will weigh the scales in this case."

10ufm25,2023-02-05,2023-02-05,"In this one case it was part of a YouTuber's Discord, group of us played the games he plays for his channels together. (Steel Division/Warno) 

After a while, someone wanted to play The Forest so asked if any of us were interested in playing it with him. From there we had about 5 people playing it together? Then afterwards we branched out to other games with the same general group of people. Of course some games were less popular or the timing wasn't right, so the numbers have gone up and down over time. e.g. With Valheim and Raft it was 4 of us, with project zomboid it was 6, with space engineers it was 9. Other random games as well like borderlands or divinity that had groups of 4 playing them; always different people due to interest.

I think a lot of it is just reaching out within a community that would hold a similar interest to yourself. Maybe start with a game that's co-op and a couple of friends who are available, then start pulling in people who express interest as you progress through games. Of course, this requires someone within the group to be the ""bad guy"" and curate whoever is coming in. 

Some times it just feels a bit dickish, but it is something someone has to do if you wish for your gaming experience to not be a diceroll for the lowest bidder every time you log on. Usually try to suss out the opinions of the other guys who've become part of the group before we make a decision as well, with the poorly behaved player I referenced in the previous comment, there was quite a bit of unhappiness within the group as well.

Has a character creator. Has a whole bunch of activities (e.g. fishing, gold saucer) that are fun without necessarily requiring lots of skill. Can be played as a party.

The actual combat content is fairly slow, especially in the beginning. So it still might be a challenge but not insurmountable. 

It can also be played free."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"WORMS!

Also, most old arcade games are designed to be played by 2 players, easy to learn tough to master and offer good fun."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I can recommend Guild Wars 2 if you want an MMO. It has a very casual flair and it doesn't demand you play it every day, or punish you for not doing so. There's little FOMO to it, and its horizontal progression system makes it so it doesn't turn into an endless grind once you reach max level.

You can do the personal story content with your party, so you can co-op your characters' story missions. There's also a lot of 5 and 10-man content, some of which is kind of abandoned (like dungeons), but you can still find people to do them with, and the community is overall pretty nice.

The base game is free and, for a f2p, it offers a LOT of content, including reaching max level, the core story before its expansions and some max level content to do. You can do pretty much everything together as well!

It has good visuals for a 2012 game and I used to run it without major issues on a gtx 1060 3gb, so your wife's gpu shouldn't have any issues."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Palworld was pretty casual when I played it, she can go around catching cute creatures and then force them to work and battle. Haven't played it in a while, but reviews are still very positive so they probably haven't ruined it just yet.

LOTR: Return to Moria is another base building exploration game, playing as dwarves from lord of the rings.

Boarderlands might be a little too fast paced for her, but the GOTY enhanced edition is currently ¬£2.49 so worth picking up in case you decide to give it a go.

If you're looking for non-explore the world games and have others you can play with (or are happy to play online with others) you could also check out golf with your friends and shell shock live. Golf is a fun mini golf game and has 1000s of free maps on steam workshop, shell shock live is basically an updated pocket tanks if you ever played that, if not, basically worms but with tanks instead."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Gears of War. It's one of the best couch co-op experiences you can play. I first played it with a friend in college on his 360 (complete campaign), when I came home from college I bought my own console and played the whole thing again with my brother, and with my dad, as well as plenty of partial playthroughs with friend online."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Runescape or Oldschool Runescape. I lean more towards the Oldschool one for several reasons but I'm not going to shit-talk the OG one. 

They're grindfests and more of a lifestyle than games. The point is to level up skills, do quests, kill bosses and get better gear to kill bosses faster. There are crazy amounts of great content creators and if you need to know something, RS wikis are some of the best wikis out there or just ask one of the RS veterans everywhere who are more than willing to spend their day by teaching you. Clans have a constant stream of people asking and answering questions. 

You can also play both on mobile."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Wayfinder & Enshrouded, these are your games.

Portal 2 co-op missions

Trine 2

Baldur's Gate 3

Coridden > Last Epoch > Path of Exile 2 (in order of new player accessibility, skip diablo4 it's obscenely dumb down brain rot billboard for its own cash shop.) Coridden in particular has a fresh VERY coop centric mechanic that feels great. Coridden is also aimed for low specs. Plays way better than it looks. Tiny tiny dev studio, basically a couple made it that picked up some help along the way, so a little awkward jank here and there, but the gameplay knows what's up. Poe2 might be hard on a low spec system now that I think about it, it's pretty CPU dependent.

Palworld

Wayfinder is an absolute *gem* and perfect for coop. It started life as a mtx driven psudo-mmo, when it's publisher went poof, the developers bought the rights back and overhauled it as an incrdible offline solo/peer to peer coop for one (dirt cheap $25) price, feature complete, with tons of collectables and cosmetics to find in game (virtually everything that was to be sold as mtx is now included as drops)

*Phenomenal* combat, will feel VERY cozy and surprise you how well it scratches the itch for an MMO player. But is very very new player friendly, designed to play well on a controller or kb.

Fantastic fantastic boss fights.

Gameplay loop is overtly setup to foster putting you immediately into the boss fights you want with zero time gating barrier once you're into the game a little bit. It's a lot of fun.

Only tip is to progress the main story line. Main storyline quests are what unlock the new zones and things like your mount and such.

This is your game. Don't look back 

With that said,

Enshrouded: I just typed a lot, and I don't have the time to get effusive again, but heap the same level of praise on Enshrouded, but it's less refined combat centric, and much more a phenomenal sense of exploration, discovery, and base building. She can come out and explore and adventure with you, or she can stay in base and build you an incredible shore/castle/whatever she wants, leveling up your shared vendors while you're out there hunter-gathering, if that's what she likes.

Portal 2 co-op missions are a MUST.

Borderlands 2 & 3 (2= better story, 3 maybe slightly better gameplay)

Halo Master Chief Collection. I'm honestly in the minority in that I don't like the halo games, I think halo tainted the fps genre for decades now with bad gameplay mechanics (shield mechanic, while very forgiving, pushes the player to run and hide and do nothing for several seconds is the opposite of fun, doom 2016 gets it right via incentivising the opposite). With that said, played co-op, it's a great time."

Cannot give this game enough praise. Looks shallow at surface level but have never had so much fun in a coop game before.

For RPGs, Diablo 3 is boring but very accessible. Less accessible but lots of fun is Divinity 2."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"My wife is addicted to Palworld. She also tries very hard to get me to play Don't Starve Together which is fun if someone knows wtf is going on. lol

We've played Elder scrolls Online for a while but she stopped about a year ago when I started doing a lot of group stuff but you really can play about 400-800 hours of completely voice acted questlines."

* Valheim is a crafting survival game with lots of exploration and several bosses to kill.
* Portal 2 has a really fun co-op campaign.
* Deep Rock Galactic has bite-size exploration in short missions involving mining and shooting bugs. Rock and Stone!
* The Raft would get you some exploration as you work together to survive."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"My wife didn't know fps controls at all and portal 2 was a great starting point. Unlike normal shooters you can take your time aiming, and someone still learning can more or less fully participate because the problem solving isn't dependent on controller use. 

Plus when she accidentally killed me she got awarded those fake participation points by Glados and started laughing her but off. Good times"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,My husband and I adore the We Were Here series. Co-op puzzle solving game where each of you has a specific role in completing tasks. It can get chaotic when you're trying to explain what you're seeing to them but they're picturing something different. Definitely best played where you're in separate rooms or at least can't see each other's screen. We replay it and switch sides when there's been enough time between playthroughs to forget the puzzles. Highly recommend!

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,I recommend Elder Scrolls Online. I play it and it offers both casual and intense gameplay options.   I've never played it but Lord of The Rings Online looks good.  LOTRO is free-to-play but one usually has to pay at some point.

It comes up as a meme around our house at random. Patience was important- she often knew what she was trying to do but lacked the reflexes to pull it off.

We started playing Guild Wars 2 on the free trial, she loved talking to everyone and getting into every little thing. It was easy to pick up a couple of copies.

Right now we are playing No Mans's Sky together because it's very relaxed. Like guild wars, we can do whatever we want and I enjoy just following her around while she chases down goals!"

Basically ‚ÄúHoney I Shrunk The Kids‚Äù where you are a kid shrunk down in a garden and have to fight insects to survive.

But on survival, crafting, weapons and armour, fighting bugs, bosses and robots, building a giant base (optional, but great fun).

Try it on mild, so it‚Äôs not too intimidating, anyone less experienced can stay near the starting areas and anyone else can go out and fight the hard bits. There‚Äôs a lot of crafting for food, smoothies, parts for weapon upgrades and building, oh sooooo much building options. 

Great story, excellent exploration, decent progression and extensive NG+ material making me replay again and again and again (you‚Äôve got to get to NG+4 to unlock the last few things, they‚Äôre not essential though) never once did I find it repetitive, boring, too easy or too difficult. The bosses were hard, but my skills and weapons kept improving, I died a lot but I took it as a challenge and went back and fought again and again to get it done and I did eventually.

I platinumed it easily and carried on going, that‚Äôs practically unheard of for me, usually that‚Äôs when I have had enough. As an adult with little time to spare, this was easy to pick up and put down with small amounts of time or long runs early in the morning before I had to get out and do stuff, this absorbed me for a long while and I will definitely be going back again and again."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"if you two are into the sci-fi aesthetic and want a laid-back grindy game, i would personally recommend warframe over any mmo tbh; in my experience mmos are not great for people generally new to gaming (overwhelming, boring early = quick loss of interest, lack of expectation about how mmos work and the traps they lay for players, etc etc)

i hate sounding like a jaded doomer and i usually make fun of people that sound like that, but it's just my honest experience

that said, other games i would recommend are tabletop simulator, palworld, guild wars 2 (by far the least egregious mmo imo), minecraft, terraria, any co-op supporting monster hunter game (there's a new one coming out i think?), viscera cleanup detail, marvel rivals, killing floor 2, risk of rain 1/2, valheim, helldivers 2, project zomboid, remnant from the ashes/remnant 2"

It's fun, gives people the opportunity to laugh and communicate, easy to pick up and put down if you've got a busy work schedule. It's obviously not as big of a market as I think it could be because devs aren't seeing the monetary incentive for it, but I love it. I'm going to give Unravelled a go soon but if you guys can recommend any other to try, I'd love to give them a shot."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I highly recommend [Haven](https://www.ign.com/articles/haven-review).


It's a fantastic story driven SciFi RPG that really puts the focus on the relationship of the two protagonists. It's pretty light as far as game mechanics go and fairly laid back for the most part. Great music, fun exploration, and enough meat to not feel boring to a gamer while also not totally overwhelming to a non-gamer. I'd recommend couch co-op over separate computers in this case.


It may not be for everyone, but it's definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had with my wife in a decade and a half of gaming together. She would constantly comment on how fucking cute the on screen relationship was."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Ark is a great game, both Survival Evolved and Survival of the Fittest. I absolutely love Ark but you need a pretty beefy computer to play it. Especially Ark Survival Evolved as it's massive, like 300 something GB. Space Engineers is also fun and a lot smaller. Also if you want to go really OG get Minecraft! Oo also check out PixARK it's like if ARK and Minecraft had a baby. Creativerse is fun too. 7 Days to Die, Monster Hunter World, Interstellar Rift, Hellion, The Forest, Deep Rock Galactic, Empirion Galactic Survival, Dying Light, Galactic Junk League.

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Ok heres a few:  
Medieval Dynasty - Its an RPG lite, simulator where you are building a village. The simulation aspect is the main focus, has survival elements where you got to cut down trees for wood, farm, hunt, craft, manage NPCs jobs housing. You can set the pacing as you like.

Baldurs Gate 3 - You can play this as slow as you like, with Multiplayer. Huge RPG and imo should be ok to get into, my wife and I used to play the Icewind Dale games multiplayer which BG3 is a successor of, and she had a good time with those.

Now Im going to go a bit out of left field and recommend some single player games. Cast them to the TV and play on a controller. Enjoy the experience of these games together.  
These should work with what she has.  
Persona 5 Royal  
Persona 3 Reloaded  
Persona 4 Golden (this ones a tad out dated)  
Metaphor ReFantazio

These are just great experiences from start to finish, and all with requirements she can meet, which tbh I wasnt sure of Metaphor until I just checked the minimums for that. GeForce GTX 750 Ti, I thought it wouldve needed far better for such a good game, I still think P5Royal is the better of the two, but Metaphor is Fantasy where Persona is Modern Altered Reality."

Borderlands series is great fun as a couch co-op, and has split screen!

If she likes RTS you can‚Äôt go wrong with Warcraft, command and conquer, age of empires, StarCraft, rise of nations, or the likes thereof.

My wife REALLY likes Sea of Thieves and pretty much ANY racing game.

There‚Äôs always Neverwinter which is mmo-ish/low demand for graphics."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"My wife and I started trying to play a few games together many years ago, but we didn't really hit it off until I got her into The Elder Scrolls Online.  Between getting to play a fire-breathing elfling in an absolutely gigantic, mythical world, and getting to share a house with me, we've had a ton of fun just roaming around and exploring.  The game play is not particularly complicated (everything scales, so if you're lvl 8 or 508, you can still team up and fight the same stuff (maybe avoid PVP).  Don't like one area or story line? Just skip it.  Don't feel like dealing with NPC drama?  Go fishing or decorating the house with the bajillions of random junks you pick up/craft  everywhere.

It's also getting to be on the older end, so not only is there just gobs of material to consume, the PC requirements are minimal."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I'm gonna recommend Warframe because I haven't seen anyone say it here yet.

Fast paced third person shooter/hack 'n' slash, technically an MMO and it's more sci-fi instead of fantasy if you're into that sort of thing. It's also free and you can earn the premium currency in-game if you're savvy with the trading system."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Lego Star wars is a must
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I've had success with my non-gamer girlfriend on the following titles:

+ Baldurs Gate 3 (very surprised but she loves the combat, hates the admin though so I do all that in between play sessions) 
+ Portal 2 (take it slow, let her solve and get used to controls of an fps without actual combat)
+ Trine 1, 2 + 4 (puzzle platformer with physics, fun and goofy titles - skip 3, it blows) 
+ It takes two (again, take it slow, we found the game has difficulty spikes that frustrated her)
+ Spiritfayer (definitely a highlight, very relaxing game with a great cast of characters and overall narrative) 
+ Unravel 2 (interesting as one player can help the other with difficult platforming - you can literally pull her up) 

Games we tried but she disliked:

+ The ascent (too much going on, bullet hell style maybe a bad choice)
+ Cuphead (too pixel perfect, frustrating for us both honestly) 
+ Human fall flat (she hated the controls) 
+ Overcooked (we both didn't really like it as the difficulty ramps up, fun initially though) 

My advice is to be patient and supportive, some people decided to do weird shit like play outside or do organized sports rather than get cracked at FPS/third person camera controls in their teens. They have no muscle memory and will struggle initially. If you've played a game before, don't ruin it! Portal 2 puzzles are best solved by the first timer, no one enjoys being shown the solution before they've even had a go. If a game has admin or dull tasks, take on that burden for them - not everyone likes sorting through gear or leveling characters as much as us spreadsheet freaks. 

Honorable mentions! We sometimes play a single player game ""together"", swapping the pad:

+ Return of the Obra dihn (solve the puzzles together, drinks in hand recommended)
+ Baba is you (see above)
+ Case of the golden idol (see above)
+ Unchartered and Tomb Raider series (she enjoyed the exploration, I did the fights) 
+ Alien isolation (she enjoyed watching me shit my pants)

Best of luck. Gaming is such a great shared hobby but we have to invite and help new gamers, play when they want to and at their pace. Your Mrs will be a gamer goblin in no time ;]"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,I have over 1000 hours on divinity original sin and original sin 2. There is also baldurs gate 3. Sacred 2 was great as well (sacred 3 not so great). We are currently plays teenage mutant hero turtles:splintered fates but this is a roguelite game. Still loads of fun hut not great if you do not okle starting from the beginning everytime you die.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Monster Hunter Wilds releases in 9 days and MH games are absolute bangers to play with friends.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Here's an odd one, but hear me out‚ÄîSatisfactory. Nothing says ‚Äòromance‚Äô like industrial efficiency! You and your wife can put your brilliant minds together to build the perfect factory‚Ä¶ or, more realistically, argue about conveyor belt placement until one of you ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô falls off a cliff. Relationship-building at its finest! Enjoy :)"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Fun game for two people: Astroneer  on steam
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"if you want to be able to commit to one game for a long time (and be able to consistently have different goals) I'd say Guild wars 2. 
After the initial grind for gear (which has been the same power-wise for maybe 10 years now) you can grind cosmetics and achievements. 
So YOU choose what and if you want to grind. Choose between open world content (ranging from small solo to map-wide events (called Meta events)), World vs World (i.e. server vs server group ""pvp"" in a medieval setting where you capture castles, towers, camps etc), closed instance (dungeons, raids, mini raids (strikes)) and pvp (not recommended as it's rarely touched). 
FWIW in one of my guilds half (or more) of the roster is comprised of couples, most of them late 30s-mid 40s."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Start things slow with mobile gaming. Infinity Nikki and Love and Deep Space gatcha games aimed towards women. Start with the 1st and introduce the 2nd. Both by Papergames a company that makes games for women. Then I would say Prophunt its very fun when you hide and or chase but she needs to get used to the frustration of losing üìâ üòÇ
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I just got my wife into The Division 2. As a game where you can, potentially, solo all content with the right gear and tactics, it's a great game as she doesn't often like games that force multiplayer interaction on her. Just us two running around DC shooting bad guys and wishing we could pet the doggos!"

the most awesomest game ever"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Doesn't really compare to any game you've mentioned, but Phasmophobia is great fun. Enter a haunted house together and guess the type of ghost haunting it! There's no jumpscares, the horror is psychological only, and I see it as a huge plus. You bring some equipment in, she brings some more, and each can do different cool tasks.

It sounds tiresome quickly in theory, but people easily reach the hundred hours, myself included! The satisfaction in this game is slowly learning about ghost behaviours, and once you get things right, you'll feel badass! The higher difficulties are much more fun than the easier ones by the way, this is important to mention since Amateur is mind numbingly boring. Try to play harder difficulties as soon as possible, since there's more action sooner, and things get interesting quicker.

Phasmo runs in any PC if set to low, so both will run. You can do everything together up to a maximum of 4 players. Matches don't last for too long. It's fun to interact with the ghost by talking in-game! You can be like ""Give us a sign, please"" or ""Show yourself!"", and there's a chance for paranormal activity. It's so awesome!"

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Worms Reloaded is (or was this weekend) cheap on steam. My wife who likes older games (new, snes) and a handful of modern games like It takes two, loved Worms after she got the hang of it, which took like two games. So much silly, unpredictable fun"

It has a huge map, four ships to sail the oceans(very realistic ship controls), and plenty of biomes to explore. Definitely worth trying!"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"World of Warcraft would be the perfect game. I recommend the newest expansion (The War Within).

That game still runs on older hardware no problem and you won't run out of things to explore or do."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I would say 7 Days to Die.  Learning the base game and UI is pretty simple with a little instruction.  My wife loves zombie movies and she loves seeing the bases I build and POIs I rehab.  She does, however, have vertigo and she can't even watch me play for more than a few minutes before she becomes dizzy.  It's unfortunate because I would love to have her in my world with me."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I heard Untitled Goose Game is nice to get people into gaming, very low hurdle. If you love tabletop RPG go for For The King 1&2 or Demeo, roguelite  with a bit of learning curve is Wizards of Legend. For something that needs fast reaction skill I can recommend Door Kickers Action Squad. If you need more recommendations write me, I'm somewhat of a co-op gamer myself. xD"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Anno 1404/1800 coop (it's a city builder) with you SO is amazing. The start is very, very chill (to the point it is a bit boring after both of you become good at the game but should be perfect to start off) and becomes very complex and deep with SO MUCH TO DO in the endgame.

The sense of achievement you get by creating a vast, complex network of interdependent islands is very real."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Me and hubby just started out journey on Green Hell not long ago. It's been fun.

7 days to die could also be something to check out.

Valheim is also a game we enjoyed.

There might be a build + survival theme here :D"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,"My wife has 0% gaming in her blood but we enjoyed a lot: Monaco: what's your is mine, Lovers in a dangerous spacetime and Party Hard. The last one is a subpar game but we really had fun playing it. The first two are really good. 
My go to games to play with her are point and click adventures. Every couple of years we cicle through the classic."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-23,"Valheim due to the sheer volume of crazy shit that you get into and out of, together as a team. You will remember scrambling to get away from a sea serpent or being like ""oh shit oh shit there are like 3 wolves here help."" 

Escape Academy is a really great game that has been free on epic like twice. It is a derpy escape room simulation that is very self aware. The puzzles are fair, none are like ""well that was bullshit."" It runs on older hardware and has great co-op and several dlc packs."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is an excellent co-op game. It originally released in the GameCube era but was later released for the Nintendo switch.

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Surprised this was so far down. I‚Äôve met the most couples playing together in WoW than any other game
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Maybe Pokemon can be a good game too? I've been playing this mod called PokeMMO which lets you play the DS and GBA era of Pokemon games online in an MMO format. It's pretty good.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,Wow classic is the way to go. So much world exploration and as long as you aren't rushing to get to end game it is a ton of fun.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Their new one is coming out in a couple weeks!! So stoked. Called Split Fiction.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I see this recommendation all the time but I want to be so clear to anyone actually doing this. If your significant other does not play video games, they will not have a good time. The game is a third person platformer, which is really hard for people who don‚Äôt know how to do jumping and moving of the camera at the same time, which is something that people who don‚Äôt play video games aren‚Äôt very good at.

I was playing with my wife and she was new to games, but we literally could not finish this game because she was incapable of completing many of the challenges and it became more of frustration to her than a joyful time playing with her. I would suggest playing other games if possible, because someone who is literally brand new to games won‚Äôt be able to handle all the mechanics of this game.

I do want to be clear. This game is really fun, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good example of a game to play with someone to get them into video games for the first time."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"This will always be my recommendation. Fun, not too complicated, accessible story and graphics."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"This keeps coming up but I could not play it with my partner, the skill gap was too large. If your partner has good reflexes and coordination for gaming it could be good. If not it's realllllllllly frustrating"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Was gonna be my reply as well. Very accessible game with fun gameplay and solid story.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Yeah, one of the best games to play co op in! Superfun!"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Thats me and my husband‚Äôs game (& a few of our friends.) It‚Äôs a little overwhelming at first just because of how big and open it is, but because of those traits, you can do a lot of different things (fishing, house decor, fashion, crafting, PVE, PVP, trials, dungeons etc) and there is a lot of quests. The combat is usually pretty relaxed, but there are some things you need to work with other people for. The community is generally very friendly (at least on Reddit & PC, can‚Äôt speak for PS or Xbox.) 

The game does go on sale often & goes down to around $5."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Similarly fallout 76 is in a really solid state. My girlfriend absolutely loved the base building and the shooting mechanics were surprisingly easy for her to handle particularly with VATS.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,Stardew Valley is top tier. Insane that it was created independently
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Can I say: Diablo IV is very weak for a modern ARPG.
Something like Necesse is a lot more fun."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Easy Satan. I assume OP wants to remain married.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Divinity Original Sin 2 should also run fine
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,BG3 is really CPU heavy in act 3. Don't know if that bad boy 4790k can handle it without game feeling like a slideshow.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,GW2 is great but switching to other MMOs from it can be tough. GW2 has an important dodge mechanic with just a handful of abilities while most of the other MMOs are more about standing still and learning to press your 20 ability buttons in an optimal order.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"It will show you where your communication is lacking very quickly.
I love the game, friend and I do fine, my husband hates it lol"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I don't know sounds sus xd

I heard about it tho and it's on my list."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Came to recommend. Be warned though: free can be frustrating, it's why my wife quit. Can't trade, can't be friends, can't do a lot of things, so you spend a lot of time ""alone"". Even when you're both subbed, there are some main story quests and class quests that are solo - you've gotta learn your stuff instead of letting others drag you through. But it's pretty easy."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Plus ARK sucks if you don't know how to tweak the game rules to be fun. 

And there's still bugs and jank in ARK local co op that havnt been fixed. (Nodes will stop respawning if the host signs out shortly after they've been depleted) and a bunch of other small annoyances i can't even remember i love the game but man do I hate it."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Second this. I put off trying valheim for ages and am now HOOKED!
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I'll toss a vote for this as well. It's the baseline around which I measure all survival crafting games. It's so very flexible on how you find you wanna play it.¬†


I've put more time on this than any game since the heydey of MMOs"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Valheim was one of our first ""hits"" too. Great game with a semi cozy vibe"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"This is the answer. 

They can have a shared server and also solo servers 

Explore together or tackle dungeons.

Get lost building or farming Mats 

Something for every type of play mood 

12/10 game for sure. Plus updates!"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Play this with my wife.  
She can sort and organize chests for hours."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Another vote for Valheim! 

I am playing it with my wife and kids too, pure fun :D"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Another vote for Valheim!

My wife isn‚Äôt a big gamer by any measure but she‚Äôs logged over 1,000 hours so far and we haven‚Äôt played since Mistlands. We‚Äôre thinking about getting a copy for our son and jumping back in too."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Really? I have both and I enjoyed 1 way more. Spending so much time in Neruud in 2 was just too bland and boring. Biome diversity in 2 is severely lacking IMO.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,How did you like Return to Moria? Heard more negative things.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Had to scroll a lot to even see it mentioned.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"That was the plan in the first place but so far I saw it's not the most optimized game and it won't work on her PC, we will be upgrading her PC at the end of the year but as for now we need games her PC can handle(or games that has a Cross-Play with Xbox so she can use my PC and I will use my Series S)."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I am a huge 7DTD fan so I would definitely agree with this.  I would love it if I could get my wife to play, but she can't even watch without getting dizzy (she has a touch of vertigo I believe)."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Would someone who enjoys souls and soulslike games enjoy new world?
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Pssst their new game Split Fiction comes out soon!
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,How does the save system works? This game is one of the firsts on our list but I needed to do some more research about how saves actually works.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"The only games she played was Animal Crossing for like 2 weeks and CS2 with me and friends(for like half a year). We just want some games that we could play together but without any other friends if they are offline. 

So yeah, any genre and we are open to anything but preferably she said she is more interested in some survival type of game(she saw me playing Ark years ago and said something similar like this). 

Her PC is our only downside, but if a game is Cross-Play I can let her play on my PC and I will just use my X Series S."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-21,"Yeah, I realized that maybe the best way to start it would be to see which games are on game pass so we won't spend a lot of money for testing things out, so I made a list of games from this post, saw what is on game pass and have her the list so she could see on YouTube which games may be interesting to her. 

We started with installing both Stardew Valley and No Man's Sky but once we started playing Stardew Valley I think it will be the game for us for some time, we are having a blast playing together. 

We played Animal Crossing together but it was a ""meh"" experience because the other person had to be near the main player, here we can both do what we want and still enjoy the game together. 

At the beginning I was thinking that I would be bored playing it but for some reason I am not. 

Next in the line are No Man's Sky, Grounded and Raft. We would go with ARK next but I forgot she only has an 200GB HDD in her PC so that's a problem xd Actually she is telling me to upgrade my PC now so she can take the one I have now but I have to finish my car before the summer first xd"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,You will need 2 switches and 2 copies of the game to play coop
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Casual? I carried my wife through that game, had to do so many parts for her and boss fights were more stressful than buying a house.


Elden ring for couples"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Mweh, with Division 2 I'd say it comes and goes, the leveling experience is horrendous with mandatory grinding because the main story doesn't give enough exp every 10 or so levels you'll end up having to stop doing the main missions and start doing ""side content""

  
Other than that its a really fun game though.

And oh, there is no telling what the future of Division 2 holds with the current state of goobysoft."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Sure, I got you!ü§£"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"My husband wasn‚Äôt a huge gamer, but he did play stuff occasionally. Then I got him started on WoW back in 2009 and it‚Äôs been basically nothing else ever since. And as much as I hate to fulfill the stereotype of the husband being a tank and the wife being either a healer or hunter‚Ä¶yep, he‚Äôs a prot pally and I‚Äôm a hunter. Our teen daughter who plays with us now has started to fill the healing spot."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Yeah, can't wait to play with my wife. We played first two, and they are just perfect co-op games."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"My wife has never played games aside from solitaire and candy crush lmao but she didn‚Äôt have much trouble past like 20 minutes of playing this game.

Not saying it‚Äôs the case for everyone just like you but just also wanna be clear that even if your significant other doesn‚Äôt play video games, they might be just fine on this"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I agree, we had to work towards games with camera control. Started off on platformers, then games with limited camera movement, then It Takes Two. That was when it finally ‚Äúclicked‚Äù for her. If this was the first game I introduced it would be more frustrating than fun"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"People don‚Äôt think of Portal as an FPS, but having played the co-op of Portal 2 with my wife (new to games), the fact that she struggled with the basic movement controls really hampered her ability to engage with the game."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I‚Äôve been working through it with my kids (6 & 9). Neither of them have experience with platformers and camera control is an issue. I let them try the more difficult sections a few times and then I‚Äôll help them before they get too frustrated. Although, it can be rather difficult controlling both characters at the same time. 

It‚Äôs easy to forget that camera control in 3D games requires a lot of muscle memory. It really isn‚Äôt intuitive. I can vaguely remember my frustration playing Mario 64. I now have 30 years of experience with camera controls and platforming. 

I can see controls being a large barrier to someone that isn‚Äôt really interested in gaming. It‚Äôs simple to a seasoned gamer but overwhelming to those just starting."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Thank you. The game is insanely hard for someone who never experienced dual stick gameplay before. Can't recommend for a first experience. My SO doesn't want to give up yet, but the struggle is real (we're at the bee boss, and I had to do one part of the tool box boss for her)."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Yup, same with my girlfriend, we didn't get to finish the game because it almost always ends up with her handing me the controller on many parts of the game."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,My wife played more D4 than me for that reason. Its easy to pick up and doesn‚Äôt need you to involve yourself to much to have fun
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"For an arpg it is very weak, but for coop couch gameplay it's amazing"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,My wife and I used Overcooked as premarital counseling. Surprisingly effective and making sure you both know how to communicate
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Yeah Overcooked starts off really fun but gets really difficult really quickly.

We are playing through Diner Bros, and it's easier overall.  You control the pace more by buying upgrades and additions to the restaurant.  Like you won't have to serve ice cream if you don't buy an ice cream machine.  But you do need to eventually buy upgrades to progress.  Unlike Overcooked the kitchen/level design isn't actively working against you.

But I will say that both games support 4 players and at some point they feel like there is too much for 2 people to do."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,DOS 2 story line is harder to follow and has less compelling characters. My partner gave up in the second act
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I don‚Äôt recommend DOS2. Play Baldurs gate. 
Much more interesting characters, the graphics are more up to date, more cutscenes etc‚Ä¶ 

DOS2 is old nowadays. My partner gave up on it in the first act."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Yeah it was BG3 ACT 3 that finally made me upgrade my last build
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Fair enough, I‚Äôve not played it on PC so I‚Äôve got no clue about performance there."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"BG3 seems to run fine on steam deck, probably runs fine on her specs with some settings toned down."

1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"tbh i think this is true but a non-issue, it's not like OP or their wife is planning to play 30 MMOs simultaneously"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,If it fails try Moving Out!
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,"Good point. Palworld is easier and less grindy than ARK, and would be better to start with. And if she really enjoys Palworld, then move to ARK. That's what I did."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I do wish there were more biomes in 2, but I found build crafting, exploration, looting, comabt, all to be better. Do remember some having a similar sentiment in preferring the first one, but for me 2 is pretty muxh the perfect sequel."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I enjoyed it but only put about 15 hours into it so there‚Äôs probably a lot I didn‚Äôt see and do. That‚Äôs not necessarily the games fault though as I only ended up putting similar hours into valheim and pal world.

Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve any criticisms of the game from the few hours I played. If you like your typical base building exploration games it‚Äôs worth a try."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Same. Hope they come back with some thoughts.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"My dude!


It will be crossplay on day one, I even tested out the crossplay over the weekend with me on PS5 and a friend on xbox using the beta."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Man that‚Äôs a shame! Have you tried adjusting her settings for her before she even looks at the screen? I have to do that for my mom. She‚Äôs had multiple concussions so she‚Äôs super sensitive to stuff like that but most of the time we can get her settings to where she‚Äôs ok. She just can‚Äôt look at the screen before we do or it‚Äôs over
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,New World is just a traditional MMO. Totally different game.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Psst. I know.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I play using nintendo switch so your experience may vary. We have our own nintendo switch. both of us have our own saved game on our switch. as for the save for coop game the save file is in the host. and if you are planning to play say 4-player coop. ""player 2"" is always the second person that joins no matter the profile or hardware used. so say Switch 1 is the host and is player 1. Player 2 can either be Switch 2 or Switch depending who joins first. Also to get the 100% completion achievement would depend on the achievement of the host"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Actually, you only need one copy of the game. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúlite‚Äù version for other people to join in with a hist who has the full version. It‚Äôs also got crossplay. Can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs on PC but I had it loaded up on several things to play with my kids until they all got bored and wandered away. üòÇ"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,Man I‚Äôm jealous:) it was a bit of downer having our fun video game time become a frustration for her. I‚Äôm glad your wife was able to grasp it so well though! Suppose my wife may be an outlier instead of the rule haha
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,At least she didn‚Äôt get motion sick.  My wife can‚Äôt handle first person games fairly well and Portal was a terrible way for us to figure that out.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I've had a few non-gamer girlfriends, who wanted to get into gaming so they could take part in my hobby, and every one of them just *could not* deal with first-person games.

Third-person was always fine though."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-21,"Portal 2 (and then 1) was one of my dad's first ""modern games"" and man it was wild for me to see how uncoordinated he was with navigating the camera and portal gun. He was like jerking around in his chair trying to use his body to move the camera lol. Took awhile for him to get better, but it still looks unnatural to me. Idk I guess I figured since he's an engineer and computer programmer, it would click quickly, but that was not the case. 

He enjoyed it regardless. Ended up buying portal 1 on his own then playing a bunch of player-made levels too."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I have played it with friends on its free weekends, our consensus was there were better options for less money."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Oh there's that too, I forgot. My elementalist ended up being a mule character. I'm not much of a piano player."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,True. I didn't think it'd be a real issue. I'm just one of those people who switch games all the time so I threw in my thoughts without thinking if the person I'm writing to needs that.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"The game, right?"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"Did you play all the DLC for 1? I enjoyed that the most, especially the new class(es? Don't remember how many there are anymore) it added. I was really hoping for some good dlc for 2 that expanded the biomes but alas..."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Have you played Valheim or Enshrouded - would love to know how it compares :) appreciate your insights!
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Replied to the original comment if you‚Äôre still interested
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Yeah after I replied to you I checked this out and it's great, now I need to somehow talk her into it, because I never played Monster Hunter games before but it sounds like it would be something I will enjoy (played Dauntless for a couple of days and liked it but playing alone was meh).

Now I just need to see some reviews of how it will work on Series S."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,This may sound a bit silly but I'm not sure what settings to adjust.  It's the motion in the game itself that gets her I think.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"Ahhh okey, we will both be playing on PCs so probably easier to manage this :)"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Just remembered the time we tried to get my dad to play Call of Duty. He could not get the sticks to work together - walking and looking simultaneously was just too difficult.
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,"Yeah, gamer friends vs wife / girlfriend. 
I agree with you, but there is no way I play poe2 into endgame with my girlfriend. D4 on the other hand we almost finished and both had fun."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,Obviously...
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-18,"I didn't play all of the last one, but yeah. Still haven't gotten around to the third DLC for 2."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"You may want to consider Monster Hunter Rise, which is still a lot of fun and will run on the pc no issues."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"I‚Äôd have to check 7Days specifically but turning down mouse sensitivity is always a must. Turning off view/head bobbing is another, and also bloom and other post processing can be helpful"
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,yes and it will even be easier to transfer save files from one PC to another
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-19,"All this is great info.  I am going to monkey around with some settings and see if she can tolerate it.  If it seems to work, then you will have cost me a few thousand bucks as she will insist on a new machine lol.  I would pay that and more to get her to game with me.  Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it."
1isnaxh,2025-02-18,2025-02-20,Haha no problem! I hope it works! And a new machine always helps üòÜ
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,"I think you're misreading what they're saying...they've lowered the overall price to make up for not releasing as much content on day one.  The price is being reduced from 49.99 to 44.99 - you then get a launch discount of 5.00 for buying it when it is released, much like you get a discount on some games when you pre-order.  They are NOT charging more for early access..."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"I think what it's saying is 'the game will be $44.99 in early access, but will launch (in early access) with a five dollar discount."" They're not talking about the launch of the finished game when it comes out of early access."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,I stopped buying EA all together.
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,This is clearly saying it will be 39.99$ for early access.
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,Early Access should always be free. They should be paying testers not charging them.
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Oh NO, Anyways."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Remember when early access was for small first time developers to get on their feet? 

Pepperridge farm remembers."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Just don't buy it.  It's a fucking remaster anyways, who cares."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,"Considering the old way was ""full price without telling anyone it was early access"" - this is still better.

Stupid, but better."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,You mean I'm not passing $60 for an unfinished game? That's a win.
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"man, it's almost like this is a non issue if you just ignore he game and play something else."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,"If that's the case then that's super poor wording, because this looks like it'll cost $45 for early access.

Or are they saying I get $5 back once it launches late 2024, if I bought EA in 2023?"
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,"I don't mind a small charge. I'm paying for less of a game and get ""future updates for free"" but I should *never* pay MORE for EA!"
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Your comment makes it sound like it's not a big deal to pay more for ""less of a game"" that's still in development."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"No, that's not what I mean at all. I think you misunderstood.

I mean you're paying *more* for a less finished game than the finished version."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"If you buy it at/before launch, it's 39.99.  If you buy it after the launch, the regular price will be 44.99."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"I don't see that interpretation here. It says, ""EA price point of $45"" or $40 if you buy it at-launch (at a discount compared to EA)."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"‚ÄúEA price point‚Äù means ‚Äúthe normal price for an EA game‚Äù, which they are lowering the normal release to in order to make up for the fact that it‚Äôs not going to include all the content they wanted to include at release. It‚Äôs a discount. It‚Äôs not some conspiracy to charge you more for less. Then a further five off if you buy at launch for being an early adopter. If you can‚Äôt see that, then I cant help you."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,">‚ÄúEA price point‚Äù means ‚Äúthe normal price for an EA game‚Äù

Is $45 a ""normal"" EA price point though? I've not heard of that as a, like, standard. Even Ark's original EA was like $20."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,Then don‚Äôt buy it if you have such a problem with it. JFC‚Ä¶
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"So we have the same understanding of the pricing scheme then?

I don't think I will buy it. But I do think that if the pricing scheme is ""More for EA than launch"" then that is an issue and should be shared with people."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"No, we don‚Äôt. You clearly have no understanding at all."
14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Well you never did answer my question of whether $45 is a ""normal"" EA price point."

14o6xan,2023-07-01,2023-07-02,"Youre the one who said they're using the definition of ""normal EA price point"" which is both not normal, and not clear from their post. It says it's starting at a price point of $45, and discounted to $40 once the game fully launches."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"I too keep seeing stuff about this game, and while I'm interested, I'm not interested enough to put down 30 Dollars for another ""Early Access"" survival game. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it looks pretty dang sweet. *But* I'm probably going to pass on it (at least for the moment). Kind of tired of the whole ""Early Access Survival"" game fling. "

it's just multiplayer. not massively so"

Got H1Z1 but havent been in it in weeks.. just lost interest - was playing 7daystodie to for awhile but when my friends left the game - I left it as well .. probably why I have a hard time with H1Z1 - the crafting in 7days in way better than H1Z1... but it looks like the crafting in this game is amazing.

2. Its incredibly, incredibly intensive on your processors so much so that even running on the absolute lowest settings can be a challenge for some systems so unless you're willing to play with horrible graphics or you have an absolute beast of a system i would hold off on buying this"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"I've been playing Rust since February. Ark looks far too similar to Rust, but with dinosaurs, I'll probably get it in the Winter sale. The Dev team is active so thats really good. But I love Rust too much atm."

3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,I got this game a couple of days ago. After an hour of play I refunded it. The optimization is just so bad right now. 
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Does it still slog, or can it be run on a semi decent computer now? Wanted to get it a while ago but I heard you needed a beefier computer during the time."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,Then you find a camp of folks with a dinosaur encampment. With T-Rexs and other big ones.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Sadly this doesn't really go over the main issues that currently plague the game. From what I've viewed you're either playing on a private server or a PVE one, this is important to state outright as an official server, a base like this can't exist. (for long anyway.)

Here's a current 7/15/2015 review of the game, written by me who has roughly 300hrs chalked up to the game, that will have some details about some of the unadvertised things in game.


-----
PVE Content
=
-----
While the game IS fun, it's current content is about a weeks worth of play time with a decent sized group (or 10 weeks if you play solo and have to loot all the engrams you don't have.). The end game content thus far are one  boss battle, and pvp. You'll build a base, stockpile resources, kill the boss then basically be wondering what to do. Because of how resources work in the game, it's EXTREMELY hard to amass resources to build, and even with a determination to build and nothing but the grind might get to you.

On the upside, this is subject to being changed and new content is being regularly added in forms of new dinos to hunt and tame! Which means if anything, if you wanted to enjoy a good survival dinosaur game, the content is regularly coming in and is pretty good.  From this view alone, I'd recommend the game. However...

--------

OFFICIAL Servers/PVEVP
=
-------
If you join an official server (not the strictly PVE ones), you'll instantly notice that it's futile to try and strike it solo, or with a small tribe. It might work for a few days, but at some point a lvl 67 player with a rex is going to come and trash your shit, because that's their end game content. They have nothing else to do.

However on this end game content, right now the community is using the one strategy that will always outright win over any other, assaulting a tribe while their players are offline. 

As if this wasn't bad enough, the tribes dedicated to just wrecking everyone else will outsource their tribe members from different countries, meaning they'll always have active members, unless you have friends who are interested in the game in other countries, you're going to have a huge vulnerable period where they will come and kill you and all your progress and you won't be able to do shit about it. 

The Devs think that adding some traps will make this less critical, but in reality the traps and suggestions they have thrown out will not even remotely prevent an assault, and doesn't help tribes who all live in the same timezone.  

Now assuming you're still standing and can fight another tribe (Not an offline one, that's basically fighting a wall.) You'll encounter the next horrible problem. The official online servers, are horribly desync'd. I have joined many, and every single time I tried the servers were just horribly desync'd. Guns and Arrows in PVP suffer the most from this, Melee is basically just holding down the left click button and hoping you spear something. 

This is also bad for balance because some dinos that SHOULD be intimidating and terrifying to fight, don't land their hits. This is particularly critical to some of the dinos that ARE extremely strong and make great mounts, and should be hell to tame, but because of the sync issues, they are knocked out without much of a fight. This is also a shame for PVE because sync'd dinos make for an intense PVE experience!  

This issues extends to raptors, rexes, spinos, megalodons, bats (Oh god the bats.) ect; In contrast if you play on a low latency server or local, you'll notice these fuckers will more often than not just totally wreck you unless you know what you're doing. (Especially the bats.)

-----

Exploits that are used regularly
=
------

Supply Drops
=
------
The current meta is to grab all the supply drops for their ""Upgraded"" Features. This shit can get crazy as the highest i've seen are weapons with a 50% extra damage bonus. 

Because the map is static, as are the drops for the supplies. Big tribes can set up bases and sentries to deny smaller tribes and new comers any access while reaping all the benefits for themselves. Before you might of been able to be sneaky and steal it via flying mounts, but since the patch that made ranged weapons do x4 damage to birds, you're more prone to being shot out of the sky.

------

Area Denial
=
------


Area denial in this game is so easy it's sickening. If you want, you can build metal foundations in mountains, caves, ect to entirely block resources from spawning. This can be done almost literally anywhere and it takes a LARGE sum of resources to remove metal foundations, it's outright impossible for non metal based tribes to deal with this, considering this can be placed on metal mining locations, you can make it so only YOUR tribe is metal grade if you're sneaky and fast enough.  If a group was dedicated enough, they could literally block off all the metal access from the map, block caves with metal structures, and become an uncontested super power. 

------

Steam Server View
=
--------

As previous stated earlier, you can use steam to see if enemies you want to assault are even online, this is so horrible because it denies half the fun planning an attack, which is recon. Why bother reconing when you can just KNOW when your enemy is offline?

--------
Is the game worth buying?
=
------

I'd say yes, but you'd have to also know exactly what you're buying into. If you were looking forward to making your own jurassic park on a PVE server and showing your creative flair, this game will probably be worth a lot.

If the PVP i described is enticing and what you're looking for in a game, than for sure it's worth buying, although keep in mind it's in alpha and everything is prone to change. 

If you wanted to have giant land wars on mounts using guns/pikes/explosives for epic battles in PVP. I would have to say, don't buy the game quite yet, keep an eye on the forums and see if the current meta is ever changed. Otherwise your efforts will be for not due to offline raids, and you'll lose out on your money AND be extremely livid."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"this is epic, way to go! most exciting and well thought out base ive seen!"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"I like early access because it gives developers a chance to explore ideas they normally wouldn't have, but, there needs to be a demo on every early access game"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"> the Dilo pack make surprisingly good guard dogs against wild dinosaurs that somehow manage to make it in to the settlement (usually they fly or come through a gate while it's open).


There's wild Tyrannosauruses and Velociraptors out there, and you leave the fucking gates open?"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"For anybody who hasn't heard yet, Ark: Survival Evolved is an early access, AKA an unfinished game, survival MMO with dinosaurs."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Don't get it.. It involves no skill at all, a higher level will beat you no matter what."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I got rocket league over this, glad i did too. Rocket league is stupid fun"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,That's adorable.   If you were on our server you'd be dead already 
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,i bought it and played for about 2 hours... it is a good game but it runs like shit
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"It's very full featured, unfortunately it's most well done feature is unemployed losers who play 24/7 and crap up every server."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"I can understand that. My honest opinion is, the optimization is what needs the most work. Which is happening. Every week. These devs are amazing. Patches and additions almost every day. "
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I'd personally vouch for the gameplay right now. Depending on what you're after there's a lot for all kinds of people.

I've got about 80 hours in the game and that has been completely alone on a PVE server. I work M-F and can't be on to defend my house / tame collection from someone who wants to pike my tames through a wall for the ""lols"". With that said I know a lot of people who are in big tribes on PVP servers and LOVE it. 

There's a little bit of rubberbanding from time to time but overall it's very manageable and enjoyable. You can even create a single player world and control the server settings like tame speed, rate of XP gain (you acquire levels on your character), and things like that.

I've definitely gotten my moneys worth and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The game has been live since the beginning of June and you can see [patch notes here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/594820656447032287/). The developers have literally worked their asses off from day one and are hands down the best early access title / team I've ever seen. I'd even go so far as to compare them to Squad, the shop that did Kerbal Space Program.

One thing I will forewarn you about that I did experience early was the loading time into the servers for me was terrible, in excess of 5-6 minutes. Moving the game over to my SSD fixed it completely and it's now a matter of 20 seconds. They released a patch a few weeks back that was supposed to have major client loading time improvements but I have not tested the performance on my spindle drive since. I do know that not everyone on spindle drives was experiencing the issue though. The game will also take just a bit of tweaking to up your framerate for the better, this is another area though where the devs have made tremendous strides in a months time and they're currently waiting on NVIDIA to release a set of beta (and later stable) drivers which should be another 20-40% FPS boost on nvidia cards.

So in short, I feel it's worth a shot if you're curious, especially with steams refund policy."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-22,It's gotten some pretty series feedback so far. Most agree the game is pretty damn fun but I guess your base is destroyable while you're offline and it got frustrating for people. Not sure if they fixed that issue yet.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Crafting can be a bit of a chore, but once you have a basic base setup things start to get easier.

The thing that makes a massive difference is the dinos. Aim to get a trike and raptor as your first 2 dinos, really starts to make things much easier."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"The crafting in Ark is very demanding on resources, and the game is almost entirely designed around the tribe system. Playing solo you will find that most of your time building a base is just gathering. Luckily we have a few active members and two of us love building.

There are 4 tiers of structures that can be combined either for practicality or aesthetics, and several tiers of weapons and armour as well, and the game is made so that no single character can access the 'engrams' (basically blueprints) for all of it."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I don't stream as I'm not good at narrating or talking to an audience, and up until very recently I had a terrible internet connection.

I do have a youtube channel, but I stopped making videos a long time ago. If by any chance you're still playing one of the old MTG games and want help with the challenge levels though, [have a look] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuE4zY8CMxqdpgLoNsYD8ZA/videos?).

I also don't have any video editing software or skills :( "
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Not sure, I just hit the epic quick setting in game to get some shots."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,I play on medium or low. These shots were on epic.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Even beast systems are having issues running the game due to optimization.

Right now it's a bit of a crap shoot if you can run on epic settings or not."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"The MMO thing was just a brain fart as I didn't really know how else to describe a game that isn't meant to be single player but has a persistent world with saved progress unlike repeatable games such as LoL, CS ect.

As for the graphics, the first screenshot was taken on medium settings at the end of last month. It was almost unplayable on my gaming laptop at the time. The optimizations since have made it a lot more playable and they continue to pump out updates basically every day. I admit I set the graphics to epic and had like 10 or less FPS to get these screenshots, but playing on medium or low doesn't look really horrible and is a lot more stable."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Ark plays out differently due to the pacing being slower. I don't play Rust but I play Ark, and from what I've seen Rust has a lot more raiding/PvP in the wild, but Ark usually makes people inclined to be friendly with other players because of the amount of effort required to gather resources as you head to late game, amount of food for taming etc.

The taming mechanic certainly distinguishes it from Rust too. Having the ability to have animals that provide different roles really diversifies the game and provides benefits to players who are willing to take on different dinos.

Then there's the exploration. Ark's world is really stunning, there's vast forests, lakes, cave systems, huge climbable mountains, coves, reefs, underwater air pockets/caves, beaches, cliffs etc. "
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I have rust, that's it. I never bought day z, h1z1, the island, depth, ect, ect. I wouldn't blame somebody not trying multiple early access games in a row."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,">If you join an official server (not the strictly PVE ones)

This is misleading. There are official PvE servers with full support from the devs and just as large player base. 

Also the idea that PvE means softcore is an outdated belief that we could do without. PvE isn't there for newbs or people with shit computers, it allows you to enjoy the game in a different way, focusing on building and exploring."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Actually in ark they decided to name them Indominus Rex as a shout out to the new Jurassic world movie, and the raptors are utahraptors. But no, we don't just *leave* the gates open, sometimes they agro onto something through the wall, and run in when one of us is leaving."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,I've played Minecraft and rust on PvP so much that I've grown tired of playing that way. Trying to hide and make shit that's super practical and defensible all the time. I wanted to make something that looked good and wouldn't be just *gone* except for maybe a chest full of poop and a taunting billboard message after coming back from a 4 day block at work.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,When did you play it. It's running better than at launch. I run a 560 ti and average 30 fps until I get inland a ways. It gets better each week.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,"I wouldn't doubt it. Plenty of Devs are amazing, but sadly I myself am pretty burnt out on the whole genre. That said, I'll probably pick it up in a few months depending on how the development goes. If I like what I read and what people are saying, I'll pick it up. (Or if it's on sale for a really nice price). "
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"When I first bought this game I couldn't play it as the PC I play on barely scrapes the specs and due to poor optimisation - now it runs ok, still not great but it's definitely playable, glad I didn't give up on it! There are very frequent updates and all are making big improvements to the game."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I dislike when devs get more credit for doing their job on a game that shouldn't have been released yet. 

It's like if I sold you a coffee table in pieces and then came to your house and gradually fixed it for you every so often and you praise me for doing such a good job. Like what? 

The age of early access and games being released in beta state is the worst thing to happen to gaming."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Just like every other EA survival game soon after release. Wait till sales start to drop off. Now that they will have made most the money the updates will come to a slow crawl. Just like dayz, h1z1 and so on."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,120 hours and counting. This game is great.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Is it hard to tame things?
"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,That sounds interesting.. 
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Almost what ever you have said is in Rust, and in Rust if you have a mic you should be fine, but yeah at the end the game is about raiding, gotta keep getting them resources. I've heard the same thing about Ark if you leave for some hours you'll probably have been raided."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,[removed]
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Where was any of that stated in my post? I said if you join an official server (Not the strictly PVE ones). Official servers are PVEVP(most common, not listed as PVEVP but rather ""Official server [number]), hardcore PVP and PVE have their module listed specifically.

I also did not say PVE meant softcore, I said it had limited content vs the amount a PVP player will have. PVE right now is only ""softcore"" due to desync, the dinosaurs are a challenge to fight and get around (Unless you're on a mount) as long as the latency is low and they can land blows on you. Which was also mentioned in this post.  

What i DID say was that because of how the community in official servers (not the PVE ones.) work, they'd have already demolished your base and killed your dinos, which is an important thing for someone buying the game to know prior. 

However I didn't cover the amount of grief that can occur in a PVE server, where unlike PVP the malice is assaulting you offline, in PVE it's doing area denial for shits and giggles AND not having the ability to remove their structures, at all. Because in PVE you can't hurt other players structures, regardless of any modifiers (Such as, blocking a resource.)

All of that is moot on a private server with an active admin however. 

I'm unsure what you're trying to say. More importantly, did you even bother to read the post? "
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,Much like the Indominus Rex from Jurassic World
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Uh, what? They're clearly labelled as ""Trex"" in game"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,Oh I understand but you must not have Chinese raiders doing hardcore raids on your servers.  We had a base in a cave with 12 metal doors on it to get from our outer ring into the cave itself.   They got in.  Our outer base looked nice like yours too.  Completely leveled.   You can't have nice things on our server.  That's why I switched to a primitive server because at least there are no more explosives
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"probably 3 to 4 weeks ago last time i played. GTX 680, probably 20fps last time i played before i added a launch command line in steam properties which made it run a bit better"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-15,That's a good plan.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I agree that EA is out of control. However, praising a developer for doing what so many ""official release"" developers haven't been willing to do for a few years is not a bad thing. These developers are listening to the community and it shows.

Maybe we shouldn't have to but at the same time it's not a bad thing. Do you say ""thank you"" when your waitress brings you food that isn't fucked up? I know I do. Do you say ""thank you"" when she fixes the problem when it **IS** fucked up? You should."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"EA is more like me paying you for the uncomplete table and coming to your shop and having input on things like wood selection, joinery options (maybe I want a keyed mortise and tenon?), stain color, and finish options.

Yes, if I go out and shop finished tables I'll probably pay a higher price but I know exactly what I'm getting. However some people enjoy the process of seeing a build early on and having the ability to input their thoughts."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,I fell into the day and h1z1 trap day one. Neither one pushed patches as quickly as Ark. But I do fear they'll get to that point.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"At the very start of the game it can be daunting and difficult. You dont have access to tranquilizers or narcotics to knock out dinos and keep them asleep.

You have to knock them out with blunt weapons, meaning your fists or a slingshot, and they will be attacking you while you try to do that, then once they're out you have to continually supply them with food and feed them the right kind of berries to keep them asleep.

Once you have access to narcotics it becomes a lot easier, and is then just time consuming. Larger and higher level dinosaurs can take hours to tame.

That's why /u/slushysnowman was recommending you get a raptor and a trike to start with. Raptors are excellent for getting raw meat and trikes for berries. You can use the sleep inducing berries with spoiled meat to create narcotics which don't expire like raw berries and meat do, and are much more potent as well."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I watched that hyper Swede dude on YouTube play it... It was def a survival game, maybe I got the name wrong?"
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,">did you even bother to read the post?

A bit rich, don't you think? You said in your comment that it 'seemed like' I was either on a private or PvE server, which indicates to me that *you* didn't read *my* submission before posting, yourself.... 

I did however, read your comment. 

I thought it was ok, but didn't focus on any of the smaller details of the game that make it unique from other survival games, and instead focused too much on the general aspects that are present in basically every PvP survival game. I think that your frustration over these player-influenced elements coloured your review of the game and doesn't give credit to the developers for all the improvements they have already made, instead only making vague remarks about waiting until things get better.

>Official servers are PVEVP(most common, not listed as PVEVP but rather ""Official server [number]), hardcore PVP and PVE.

For me, there is nothing like that anywhere in the server browser. I click on ""official"" in the filter, and it shows me, for example;

""The-OC-OfficialServer144""
""The-OC-PVE-OfficialServer166""

ect. No distinction other than PVE in the title.

>I also did not say PVE meant softcore

I did not say that you said that. You did make it sound like the PvE servers are not an official feature of the game and that playing on them is not the real thing, though."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"The ones in ark don't command raptors or camouflage though. I'd prefer it the just called them T Rex. All the players do.

Still, I lost a couple of my first thatch huts to rexes. Those fuckers are scary as hell. You need walls 4 high on flat ground to fully prevent them from being able to see over the top, ours are only 2-3 though because our tamed Dino's are quite high level and can beat most wild rexes out on the edge of the map where they're lower level."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Ok so I just checked and we're both wrong. The in game name is T rex, but if you read the dossier in your 'survivor profile', it's actually a Tyrannosaurus dominum, which is from the same genus as a T rex, but not the same species.

I must have misread 'dominum' in game and never checked again."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,You're missing the point. The base looks like this specifically because we knew we were on a PvE server. We wouldn't have built it that way on PvP.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,Yeah -sm4 or -dx10 help a little. Supposed to get a gpu boost soon with some new nvidia driver thing. Two weeks back they found a bug that limited gpu to 25% usage. That one helped me a bit too.
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,Wait...how can I use a raptor to get meat?
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,[removed]
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"This game is shit, stop spreading your salty lies."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"They're pretty loose with dinosaur names and genus' in this game. It's my honest-to-god only complaint.

Nice base, by the way."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,We were on a pve server...
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"People also just need to learn that the game isn't fully optimized yet, and needs to have the graphics turned down for a little while. My friend bitched and moaned that the game wasn't working at all for him. I adjusted a few settings and while it didn't look as nice, ran as smooth as butter."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"Until you can make a saddle for it, you need to set it to either aggressive or attack your target, and enable victim item collection which will make it eat bodies.

Once you get a saddle just ride it around and chomp everything in your path. You'll end up with more meat than you can use before it spoils."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"That's not the game. You couldn't play as a shark.. I'll try to find what it was actually called.

edit - It was Stranded Deep. Similar names, and they both have a focus on sharks. My bad."
3dfnor,2015-07-15,2015-07-16,"I really enjoy it. Peoples tastes are different but I think that there is something special about this game compared to other early access games. My post is not an advertisement, it's just showing my own experience with the game, which is on a PvE server. Judging by your other comment you got wrecked on PvP and now you can't stand other people enjoying the game."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,There's gonna be a 2?
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,After 2 years of playing I still have a small ass thatch house and still can't figure out the controls
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"Definitely won't be buying, these scum developers need to fix the first game before they make a new one they deleted my dinos along with my data so now my other dinos I got left won't listen to me this game makes fallout 76 look perfect can't believe their trying to scam more ppl with this crap"
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Feel free to check out r/ArkLifeNews for more ark 2 news and memes!
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,I just got my wife to start playing. I played a few years back and it's been a while. Shes not a gamer but is doing well in the easy area of the island and she really enjoys the dinosaurs and breeding the little baby's. Looking forward to the second one
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-06,Holy shit I love this game so much but when that happens it genuinely makes me angry
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Yup! 2022
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-13,"It really is sad how they wont fix the game, ark could be one of the greatest if fleshed out imho. And please wildcard add atleast another line of code to dino ai -.- maybe they make ark 2 because ark 1 is beyond repair, they just aint got skills to fix it"
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Wow... that trailer was fucking awful why was vin diesel the main guy and wtf where those evil people? Missed the whole point of Ark
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-13,"That's what I'm saying like I played so much of that game I put so much fucking money, my blood sweat and tears along with my sanity into it and they can't put that into fixing a simple bug like come on, but somehow they have the time to make a whole new game makes perfect sense"
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Vin diesel played like 1000 hours of ark and was asked to be in tbe game. As for the other stuff i jave no idea.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Great so we get some shoe horned shitty celebrity cameo just what I want in my survival game lmao.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"How do you know it's shoehorned in and he's not Rockwell or Gaius or one of the other people who left lore notes on the islands?

I mean he could be Gaius Nerva, Edmund Rockwell, John Dahkeya, or Rusty Stafford, etc...."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"Not really shoe horned but sure. Also not your game, you didnt make it."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Shoehorned is exactly what it is. And it's a figure of speech you must not be a native English speaker.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,The fact that you called that your game is hilarious. Also you should look up the definition of shoehorned because you have no idea what it means.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"> he fact that you called that your game is hilarious.

Again it's a figure of speech you must not be a native speaker, but that's ok. Also 1 : to force to be included or admitted is exactly what including him is."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Yeah it's really weird to include a guy that played the game for a thousand hours to be in the game and he happens to be a celebrity. Nobody forced anyone therefore it's not shoehorned dummy. Start learning English.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,He has no relevance to anything. Hence he was shoehorned in (1 : to force to be included or admitted) he has no relation to the game except he played it? I mean how many people have over 1000 hours in the game? Even I have it if they wanted to put someone in it use one of the many popular streamers that play their game don't shoehorn in a celebrity. Again Shoehorn 1 : to force to be included or admitted
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"He's literally an actor, as long as his character lines up with the lore, it makes perfect sense to bring him in. Especially if he's a fan of the game, cause then he's probably more likely to give it a good effort (which hopefully results in a good performance)."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,You are not famous and you are not going to bring people into the game Therefore your thousand hours are a waste of time and a waste of your life like much of your life probably is at this point. Saying that he was forced into your game when you're not even a dead for the game is hilarious. You sound like a basement dwelling loser.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Neither is a hacked up 3rd rate C list celeb lol
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"Wow so you're mad that it's Vin Diesel in the game wow you couldn't be more pathetic sounding. Also pretty sure the dude is an A list celebrity. Have a good new year, keep crying aboit a game youre not making!"
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,The weirdest part is all I said that was he was shoehorned in and you came white knighting from no where to defend a nobody you don't know you tool haha
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"Haha you are jealous of vin diesel, this might be the greatest reply in reddit history. Man since its YOUR game you shouldve really stopped it from happening. 

Keep using shoehorned wrongn because youre so mad about vin diesel."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"1: Not shoe horned in. We don't know anything about him in game yet, and as I've mentioned before... he could easily be any of the people who have written and left us notes from Rockwell to Gaius to John to Boris....

2: Vin Diesel is definitely not a c-list actor. He's a main character in a huge Marvel property, had an entire series on his back (Riddick and Fast and the Furious films),  has pretty solid Nerd following (between his gaming and his love of D&D). 

Sounds like you're just angry that they picked Vin Diesel and not your favorite Youtuber."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Not only am I not mad I am correct in saying he is shoehorned in for no reason. Also I thought you where leaving had to come back to defend your idol?
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Never seen someone so mad about a cameo in a game. Especially one you called your game. Remember that? Like youre a dev for ark and ypu had any part in the decision making? And then you make fun of a celebrity noone cares about. I gave you a simple response and you chose to cry like a basement dwelling mommas boy. Done from here on out. Have fun not getting a reply.
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,Only one person here has been crying it's you lol. Also when someone says in my survival game it's a figure of speech look into when you're not simping over weird ass vin diesel of all people
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"Pretty sure you asked about the game and made some whiny little kid comment about the trailer and i gave you the reason vin diesel is in the game.

You sound like a safe sspace kind of kid. Keep being extremely soft and getting offended when you hear names like vin diesel coming into YOUR game."
kqygbb,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,"> Done from here on out. Have fun not getting a reply.

4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Does she have a hot sister? Send her my way. ktnxbai. 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,But do you get to keep the toy dinosaurs?
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,I bet your girlfriend kicked ass at school dioramas. A+ work there and happy birthday! 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Building my tree fort right now! 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,It was for tomorrow but w/e
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,A lot of those props don't look edible...
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Your girlfriend made that.. that should be your WIFE! That's wifey material right there.. [Remember...](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/e0/1d/8b/e01d8bcbd1cec8858df34e149b376198.jpg)
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"Hey, we're birthday buddies!"
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,That's a great cake. 10 year old me would have lost it. Heck I want a Dino cake now!
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,"How much of that is edible? It looks like a regular cake with toys on top. The grass and water might be frosting, and the rocks might be like chocolate eggs. The cage looks like play-doh and the dinosaurs and trees straight up plastic"
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,The cake is more complete than the game
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,The cake doesn't actually look that good though since you have to lower the resolution/settings to run it at an edible framerate.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,Sweet cake and happy birthday! Mine is tomorrow too!
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,picture of cake has more fps than game
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,Your girlfriend is an amazing cook
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,So she went to walmart and got you a kid dinosaur cake for 20 bucks.. gg... 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,To mimic the true experience you need some random dude to come into your house and curb stomp it.

4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,That's Hella bad ass
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Oh yep she's a keeper buddy.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"Happy early birthday, that's awesome! Mine's Wednesday and I won't be getting anything nearly as cool."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"tfw your gf never builds you game themed cakes

tfw she stands in front of the screen in lingerie and says
""if you turn off that game and come in  the other room I have something you can play with""

GODDAMMIT IM ABOUT TO LEVEL UP REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"Lol ""girlfriend"". Looks like mom put a lot of work into that dinosaur cake for her little manchild."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"I honestly have no idea what people find fun about the game. I picked it up on steam summer sale, and was pretty excited to get in and start adventuring. I spawned on a map and instantly died. So I respawned, and then instantly died again. So I respawned again and took about 3-4 steps before dying. After the 6th-7th time respawning, I was able to find a place where there wasn't anything trying to kill me. So I started chopping trees, and made a pickaxe. Cool. So I keep walking a ways, and all of the sudden I am attacked by a leech. Apparently the game gives you no way to remove the leech from your face when you are attacked, and you just have to walk around until you die from the leech face. 

I uninstalled RUST about 10 minutes in, and I uninstalled this game about 10 minutes in. IMO it's just a more polished RUST. Sorry for the rant. I'm sure everyone in this thread loves the game. I was just really bummed out that it looked like such a cool game, but ended up being such crap."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Autism : The Cake.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Yupp haha but it's still my favorite game 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"No, on PC is nearly a huge turnaround.  My friends and I took a break for ~6 months, came back recently and was able to crank the graphics and get better frames.  Very impressed."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,"There are a few workarounds to make it more manageable. 

I found [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuTtzVV0NvQ) to be the most helpful back when I was trying to fix it up."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Her sister is a troll. I'll spare you man 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Thanks man! 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"I posted in earlier comments, but I actually just proposed to her on Friday so she IS my fianc√© now- just not use to it yet!"
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,You say that like its a problem
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"This statement applies to every single person that is alive and has eyeballs to see things. Obviously it just looks like a dinosaur themed cake if you don't know what ARK is/ weren't informed it was an ARK themed cake; BUT if you do know what ARK is then it's a pretty awesome cake. Sorry if this is coming on a little strong, I just don't get what your point is by posting this other than to be condescending."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,I actually misspoke. I just proposed to her Friday so she's my fianc√© now. But yeah either way- I'm definitely a manchild haha  
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,But the thread is about CAKE!
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Man I got the game last year and haven't played it because the horrible fps! I know it's good tho
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,lol damnit!
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,haha congrats man!! 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"Sorry, I didn't mean it to sound condescending. If you feel my comment takes away from the thread then I can delete it if need be."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,You... you lied to us?
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Man life is looking up for you!
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,"The new map they have is a lot better now, and it's even bigger and cooler. The frames are a lot smoother. Give it another shot."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,"I haven't personally played ark but from what I've heard, [grav](http://store.steampowered.com/app/332500/) is everything people wanted from ark (feature-wise) and/or went right where ark didn't. but like I said, I cannot back this up. Right now its on sale for three bucks. imo, its totally worth it. mind you, its still in alpha and has lots of glitches but they (hopefully will get fixed."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,That didn't rhyme. 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Thanks? Haha life is great. 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Ok! I'll try
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Don't.  The new anti cheat system is a massive privacy violation.  It will send non ark related information off of you're computer to a third party server that you're not allowed to know what they do with it.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,How does this affect the console versions? 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,you can play on servers that don't support battleeye though. 
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,Delete your browser history before playing then.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,Not sure.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,"still just seems kinda dodgy, and not something I want to support."
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-27,no one should have to do that.
4q4c7d,2016-06-27,2016-06-28,There's an option to not install battleeye at all and to not be bothered by it again. I haven't ever installed it and I play Ark nightly; I can understand the want to not support it thought. I asked the host of the dedicated server I play on to not turn it on.  
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"It‚Äôs a sandbox game man.. nobody explains to you how Minecraft works and you figure it out too, it‚Äôs the name of the game.. starve to death or make shelter and tame to grow your existence."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"For someone who has played ""hundred of games"" you seem lost.

And you started with Atari, because those games were well known for hand-holding."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,It‚Äôs alright. Picked it up for free and after 1 minute of browsing I was well on my way. Tho tutorial would be nice yea
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Posts like this only happen when people are shit at the game, just sayin."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Wow. That was a lot to take in...
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Just because you are slow to learn doesn't mean it is a bad game.
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Everything kills you 

Find a safe location and grind some levels up move speed progress from there."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"I agree, it is very hard for newcomers to pick up and play the game, even with a tutorial. There‚Äôs a lot to learn right off the bat and can be hard to grasp it all in one go. Maybe get an experienced gamer to help you with the start or even play with others to get a feel of how they play and what to do."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Very true!
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-11-11,This is the worat game I played simply because it's bad af. I didn't had any trouble getting into it. It just sucks
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,"Only a noob would say ""noobie"".... like new to gaming in general. Hearing, or reading that word is like listening to Dr Evil say, ""I'm hip""

Edit: I don't think many of us ever felt the need for a tutorial. If you point at any object while standing up close it basically tells you what button to press. Imagine that, it's the standard ""interact"" button on basically every game. It even says ""hold for more options"". I wonder how many people read that and just sat there listening to Ark music waiting for an operator to come on the voice chat and assist?


Sorry if this seems harsh. I'm so tired I literally fell asleep at my PC desk. If it means anything, it doesn't sound that harsh to me.

Edit 2: You are always free to hit the menu button and look at the key bindings....it will at least give you a general idea of what to do."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,"Lol That said, this is the only game that I know of that has made the tutorial into a DLC. Are we sure this game ever left Early Access?"
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2021-01-15,"I completely agree with you. I really really tried investing time in it, days and days of gameplay, Solo, Coop, PVP, PVE, everything I could. The concept is great but it is impossible not to break your monitor after hours of trying to tame things with the exact kibble made with a specific egg from a dino you have not even seen, but when you do it kills you instantly without a chance. Man, the boas made me rage quit...

What is wrong with the hitbox? When you try to hit anything you miss and when they come to your hpuse they can just bite you through the walls of the house you just spent 5 hours making.

I have played videogames my entire life, even ""hard"" games like Sekiro, but nothing is as stressful and annoying as this game.I am pretty sure some people really enjoy it somehow, but I don¬¥t think I have the patience for that shit."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,You are a fucking dumbass for not knowing how to play a game after looking at the box of it (!)
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Maybe the game developers thought that people with common sense and a brain would play their game lol obviously they were wrong  üòÇüòÇ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"The thing that bothers me most is that the game is 150GB, I (personally) don't see enough content to justify the 150GB.  


Besides that a tutorial would indeed be nice."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,"Maybe it was the Atari ""Jaguar"" lol

I also pointed out that ""noobie"" is used by people who are literally noobs."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Yeah that's why I'm here. The games I usually enjoy lately are solo adventure games like Detroit, Zelda, RDT2, Cuphead... games that tell you how to play... and then you play. I'm so sorry I bothered you with my lost-ness. I'm just asking for help with an unusually cryptic game. Am I wrong for doing that?"
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Yeah... hence the asking for help
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-11-26,yo this game is straight up BOOTY cheeks
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-11-18,Old post but nah this game is genuine ass. Worst game I've ever had the displeasure of trying numerous times to get into. Rather play minesweeper or something than this overrated pile of steaming dino shit
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,I know sorry. I literally have the controller in my lap. And just had to tell into the abyss.
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"""The game looks really cool later"""
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"""For newbies"""

hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,I'm pretty sure you're trolling but never can be too careful
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Yup guess so.  And thanks for your help. Really makes me feel good when I'm already struggling. Great contribution dude /s
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,THANK YOU!!!! And damn 150gb?? I know RDR2 was big but it was at least worth the space
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,"This game isn't cryptic. You can go through the entire game just fine using the same basic interactions used on any other game. The stuff that is complicated and cryptic isn't necessary to play, or even to enjoy, like the ""whistle"" commands. 

Why would you need a tutorial for Cuphead, if you are a veteran gamer? It plays exactly like Double Dragons, Contra, Battle Toads, Streets of Rage, Mega Man etc. You should have tried Minecraft back in the days when you had to figure out what pattern to put your blocks in for the crafting menu."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-11-19,"You‚Äôre just shit at the game, sit the fuck down and go play your precious minesweeper then"
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,And it can be and I went in just as blind as you and figured out pretty easily that you need fuel for the campfire and you have to manually light it.

hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Didn't know Reddit comments where surposed to help you , you post and you get all types of comments don't like it don't post on a public forum."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,"It's 150gb because Wildcard is a sloppy dev. They didn't compress any game files like a normal developer. If you look at a normal game's file folder it's full of .pak files, this one has every single thing layed out plain. Wildcard was a new dev when they originally made this. For some reason they decided to keep it like this as they added more content. Idk why, though."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Yea something like 150GB at least, that is due to the large file size of the maps, apparently those can not be compressed down by unreal or something along those lines."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-11-21,Not my fault u can't handle ur favorite game sucking ass. Youre either 12 or have no concept of good game design.
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Yeah an hour or two later I've figured some stuff out. Gist of my post was just: is a 5minute tutorial too much to ask. I admit I posted in a rage. Whoops
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"I thought it was like a paid subscription service or something. If not, I'll check it out. Thanks"

hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,The design is fine. I could recommend some textbooks on game design if you'd like?
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Why when you can trial and error.  Or open up the internet and learn everything by reading the wiki page for the game.

hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,You are allowed to ask for help but doesn't mean I have to reply helpfully.
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-12-15,The likelihood of spoilers for Ark is really low. There is a story line to each official map. But you have to be an avid explorer to find all of that. At least when you find an explorer's note it doesn't automatically pop up and fill your whole screen like it did in 2015 lol. Lots of unnecessary deaths came from that.
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Ok cool.

*allowed"
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Lmao u even changed your spelling from aloud to allowed after I corrected you?!?!? Hahah big tough guy know it all till daddy gotta teach u grammar huh? Omg dude and the fragile ego you have to have to actually give a fuck to go change it? Lol wow. Maybe you should just be nice to people instead of getting called out. Just a thought...
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Thanks for the help
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,"Dude I changed it and thanked you for it lol I went to go have a shower and you come back with this lol. Ok I wasn't bothered about my grammar I'm dyslexic so it happens alot, so when you pointed it out I thought thanks and corrected, nothing more than that. I don't need to be nice to random people on Reddit."
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,Np dude! Anytime!
hzwvr4,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,See how easy that was?
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,TIL the best use of a farm animal in a video game is to use it as a bribe to your playerbase. 
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"It's dirty pool, I made my peace with the alpha dlc, because of their lawsuit. But this is just bad business ."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,I guess using a sheep to bribe the playerbase for votes is the best use of a farm animal.
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,Who's not voting for goat simulator?
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,wow that's pretty scummy
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"After they released DLC for an Early Access game, does this surprise me?  Not really.  I hate to say it but this is business, and this kind of thing happens all the time."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,The comment section is pretty funny though
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,"Update: they've edited the post.

Now it says this: ""We want to make it clear that regardless of whether ARK wins a Steam Award or not, Ovis will be making its debut in the next major ARK version update! ""

I'll let everyone think whatever they want after this."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,"I don't see the point of the sheep. I'm pretty sure they already won ""Biggest Fucking Time Sink"" award and the ""Most Infuriating Game"" Award. I don't think anyone else is competing for the ""Watch All of Your Fucking Progress Go Out The Window"" Award. Yes this game makes me salty as fuck. Quitting this game was one of the best things I've ever done."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"The sheep is being released eventually, their comment saying it will make it into the next major update is clearly being taken to mean something different. This isn't buying votes, this is someone who works at ARK trying to be cute and here comes the outrage. "
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,this looks awful but it also just seems like some person just writing up a little dev blog that has nothing to do with actually bribing with the sheep. its not much of a bribe anyway so chill the fuck out rofl
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,It's a trash game and they aren't going to win. Something stupid and memeish like goat sim is going to win. 
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Sorry to hear this, but Fact, no game holds such a strong shift in gameplay as you advance.  The game begins you a weak husk  of barely life, til you eventually own the Sky bridges connecting each island and full on community you've established.   You begin, hunted by everything, til you, can hunt everything.  It deserves to win. This is every Jurrasic park kids dream"
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,I mean they are using a farm animal to get votes. That is the best use of one I've seen. 
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"What lawsuit are you taking about? Haven't heard about it, just curious."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,You mean baaaaad?
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,Is it really? even if they lose they will most likely release it.
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"The only other vague one I can think of are the explosive cows in Worms...

Goat Simulator will smash this award."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"There was an ""if"" there.

5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Look. Maybe the person who wrote this didn't mean to sound like he's buying votes. Maybe.

But it's pretty hard to fuck it up this bad... there's a sentense saying, that if they win, that sheep will be in the game.

Maybe it's just a grammar error, but if it is... then they've manadged to fuck something up in a way, that is almost unfuckupable."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"This post isn't about the game itself. I haven't played the game, because I don't really like sandbox games.

I just think that buying votes like this is shameless.

I think they should have just said sometghing like: ""Hey, if you like the game, vote for us in the steam awards.""

But this... this is just shameless, and I hope they get banned for this."

5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Oh right I heard about that a while ago. Something to do with the lead dev's wife owning the company to try and skirt around the issue...

My problem with this is that I feel employees deserve to work where they wish and that non-competes are predatory in nature. FFS its the game dev industry not some big pharmaceuticals or scientific research. They only instate those policies to protect their ass wile screwing over anyone who may be unhappy working there."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,"Not sure if they edited it, but it does say ""We want to make it clear that regardless of whether ARK wins a Steam Award or not, Ovis will be making its debut in the next major ARK version update!"" In the first paragraph. 
"
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Well, theyre only gonna win votes from their playerbase, and only a percentage that actually votes, and their playerbase will have a shitstorm if they dont get a sheep. It looks good if they release the sheep even if they lose the award, its obviously already worked on and close to ready, usually takes them months to release one dino."

Think of it this way: There are 2 paintings. You have to vote for the one you like more. The one that gets more votes wins.

That sounds fair right? Now, imagine this: One of the painters gives you candy if you vote for his picture. Since to you, it means nothing, you'll obviously vote for his painting, wether or not you like the painting or not.

That's unfair.

And I don't care if they have had financial trouble, it's still unfair, and shameless.

And also, sorry for the shitty grammar, I'm not a native speaker."

5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,Yeah it must be pretty easy to say that any game development company is technically a 'competitor' I imagine 
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,They've edited it. It wasn't there before.

If it's already close to being done, then them trying to buy votes with it is just shameless and dishonest. Not like it wouldn't be shameless otherwise, but if what you're saying is true, then it's shameless and dishonest at the same time.

Witch is a good reason for me not to buy the game. I don't want to support dewelopers like this.

Also, sorry for my shitty grammar."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-28,"yeah but its not bribing with money, its promising content in exchange for an election. ya know, how elections work.... poor example choice"
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"But imagine this, everyone knows and played Dark Souls 3, so its naturally gonna get tons of votes, far less people played or even know Ark, so realistically it has no chance of winning, without the proper shine, a great game can fail and no one wants that, these are Steam awards, they don't mean anything anyway
"
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Why anyone in their right mind would play on a PVP server is beyond me.  The game is survival horrorish, human enemies is absurd.  Most of my experience has been a split screen closed server with a friend, and the game is incredible.   I'm not too hip to rigging votes or however this is properly worded, i don't have all the facts.   I just like Ark."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"Meh they did worse when they got sued, and released scorched earth. At least theyre not after a decent award. The game isnt that great either unless you got hundreds of hours to invest with friends who also have hundreds of hours, just for someone to ruin it when u log off."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"The most popular wins 90% of the time. It's still not unfair tho

Unfair, is when you manipulate the voters to vote for you, instead of letting them vote based on their own thouts.

In the case of ""but it's more popular, so more pople will vote for it"" argument... Don't you think that there's a reason that game's popular?

It's not the games fault, that people like it. If ARK was as good as dark souls, it would get a reputation, and... it would be just as popular.

I mean... NMS was one of the most popular games out there, and still, it's already forgotten, and it's not going to win an award.

So in the end... being popular is not unfair, because it's something you have to earn."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"The issue here is that Ark isn't some indie game that no one knows about. Ark is one of the most popular games on steam, always reaching the top sellers list even out of sale. People don't\won't vote for ark simply because the game, when stacked up against other games, is not as good. 

Its not like Ark is unknown, some of the most popular streamers\youtubers have played it, and still play it. "
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"""Why anyone in their right mind would play on a PVP server is beyond me""

I haven't played the game, but this is just bullshit. It's a feature in the game. It's ment to be played... otherwise, why would it be in the game?

If a feature's bad, it's not the players fault for using it... it's the dewelopers fault for making it bad.

Saying ""Why anyone in their right mind would play on a PVP server is beyond me"" is like saying ""why are you playing this shitty level in the game, when all the other levels are good""... well sorry for playing something that's ment to be played."
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,Not sure its so cut and dry
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,"If you played the game you'd get it, or if you read any comments in this thread"
5kk9b0,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,It kind of is though.  I am actually surprised to see someone posting who doesn't seem like they are trolling.

ztn0m3,2022-12-23,2022-12-24,The BEST map is clearly Aberration

ztn0m3,2022-12-23,2023-01-13,Yeah!!
ztn0m3,2022-12-23,2023-01-13,I liked both of those. Altough I also liked the Isles
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,"Pretty fun and tons of stuff to do. Really love the base building system and the diversity of the wildlife. Honestly for myself it's too much of a grind with the temperature and water needs, just eating in Minecraft was already tedious enough haha."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,"Great game, just don't play official with official rates."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,It is a great game that was ruined by the developers.
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,Base game needs more space than my SSD has
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,I think it's great because it allows you to change just about anything to adjust it to your preference. Dinos are cool
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,"I like the game a lot, it‚Äôs fun to play. One major downfall that practically ruins the game is the tech pillar spamming. I get that you don‚Äôt want me close to your house, but you don‚Äôt have to take up half the island with spam structures."

That's way I have roughly 1.000 playtime...

vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,"It‚Äôs like Minecraft with Dinosaurs. Which is cool; I enjoy Minecraft. But I kind of got bored with the game after a while.

I also got tired of the game after a raptor pack started spawn camping me before I could get any decent weapons."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,Fun and addicting
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-16,It‚Äôs a great game but requires a TON of patience and troubleshooting skills. The game explains absolutely NOTHING to you and punishes you pretty hard (early on) for dying. If you have the patience to spend the time learning and googling stuff it‚Äôs basicaly freaking infinite hours of escalating content
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,In what way if I may ask? Just got the game for free on steam and am thinking about downloading it. Reviews seem positive.
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-15,"I couldn't get past the grind, die, lose everything, grind.... Loop"
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-16,"I think it's a great game. We were the alpha tribe on several different servers. It was so taxing mentally. Then I did a modded ark called primal fear that is way better, once you figure out the game.

Pros:
Fun complex survival game
Lots of exciting dinosaurs
Dragons

Cons:
On normal settings you will die a billion times
On official pvp servers, people are mean. You will get your base and all your cool dinos killed without remorse or reason.
The game itself is not super explanatory so you have to either Google stuff, ask people or cheat to get certain things. Use Dododex app, that helps with taming.
The game also lags bad. It has glitches and problems. Bases will break things. Bugs about items, dinos and all sorts of things will break. The developers never gave a crap about the game. Kept adding dlc maps and other dumb things instead of making the game better"
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,Sounds like pvp isn't for you...
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,"Yes, a 3 year 10 server wide alpha tribe that didn't like PvP... Nothing about the lag, the glitches, the terrible programming and non-fixes.

Very helpful comment."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,you legit complained about how people kill your stuff. yeah it's pvp. what do you exepct damn it?
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,"Plus, on most servers that run full time, you have players who don't have jobs or other commitments who can play 18 hours a day which is hard to keep up with when you have a family, or a job, or anything else in life where you are contributing to society.

Needing to have players on at all times 24/7 in small or big tribes is difficult and taxing.

However, the game itself, and many well picked mods and server boosts can make it enjoyable for a long time to play."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,"Thanks for sharing that you've never played and you're just in chat bc you have nothing to do.

The game is not PVP first, then do other things. It is a boss centric game with PVP enabled servers. If you'd have played, you'd know that. Servers allow different levels of aggression. Some are all in, some are peaceful, some are in the middle.

Those who PVP first without cause on a generally peaceful server get wiped immediately. And those who treat others unfairly get wiped immediately.

PVP first all you want, but you will get hunted until you realize you're spending hours just trying to make a small stone shack bc noone wants you on the server.

It's PVP is a terrible argument. Have some humanity."
vczgqa,2022-06-15,2022-06-23,"if it takes you hours to make a small stone shack, than you really need to get better.

Oh and if i've never played the game, why do i have 7.1k hours on my steam account?? funny you just assume. 

The game has been pvp since day 1. There was ONLY pvp servers, that was the entire idea behind the game.

It sounds like you made a stone hut, and got wiped. You 100% were never in a mega tribe."
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Subnautica
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Ark is huge (like 300+GB) and is designed for multi-player. Really tough to have a full experience solo. Subnautica is designed for single player but doesn't have the same depth (no pun intended) as Ark.
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"For me personally it‚Äôs ark but I never play it solo and we have our own server so that we can make our own settings and access it anytime. For most everyone else that asks this, I‚Äôd say subnautica"
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"I really enjoyed both. I'm enjoying ark more at the moment only because I have a server with a tribe and we are able to do anything, if you prefer a single player experience subnautica might be the way to go however you can still customise the harvesting and exp multipliers of ark to suit how much you are willing to grind. Both have heaps of exploration ark tends to rewards killing everything where as subnautica wants you to focus on story and exploration."
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"Ark is huge and addictive! If you like a big open map with a big emphasis on survival and lots of exotic pets then it might suit you. 
The story is pretty loose around the gameplay so you dont have to complete it if its not your thing, you can just do what you want or you can try to challenge yourself. Start off on the island to get the hang of things, it's pretty tricky at first but so good once you get really immersed into it. 

different dinosaur species that you can tame have different abilities, different needs and ways to breed them to make stronger pets. 

If that's what you like, you'd probably like it."
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Do you play on PC or Console? ARK has a huge variety of mods available which imo really increase solo playability by reducing farming f.e. by having Super Structures or something alike which let's you recover already built buildings or better reusables which makes especially the early game a lot easier because a single throwing spear is able to take down a raptor which would normally anihilate you and cause you to ragequit after your first 10 minutes

ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Subnautica was awesome. It's been hard trying to find a game that will scratch that Subnautica itch. Below zero was good I really hope they make a third one.
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Agreed
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"Actually if you don't own any DLC it's much smaller, I get to around 100 GB by just only having one DLC installed, the exact size varies on which one I do have at the moment, it's still pretty huge though"
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Solid description. I‚Äôve played over a 1000 hours of Ark solo and you‚Äôre right there‚Äôs stuff that‚Äôs just hard to build up to solo and offline.
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-12,"I love modded solo Ark but I'm really in to customization of my playthroughs. It's the most customizable game I've ever played. But if  a player isn't into that, yea, Subnautica makes more sense."
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,Console.I did play Ark but only once at a friend's house and it looked fun
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-12,"Good call on PC or console and strong agree on mods(Love me some Primal Fear). I must, however, express my personal disagreement on reusables - If I don't die at least 3 times within the first 30 minutes of a newly started map, there is something wrong with my settings."
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"I assume all DLC, as if OP is anything like me, having all DLC is mandatory before playing a game... üòÖ"
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"I'd go with Subnautica then, as I said especially solo I personally wouldn't like to play without mods and also in later game they can add really cool stuff. ARK can however still be fun without them that's just my opinion"
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-02,"Yeah I have it all too, but as in ARK the different DLCs don't influence each other, you can easily just do it as I did and change which to use, also ARK has whole lots of DLCs and I wouldn't spend a hundred ‚Ç¨ on a game right away, so for a start I think 100 or 150 GB will suffice"
ru9iu2,2022-01-02,2022-01-12,"This. Also, besides the full maps and story events, most new content in DLCs has been replicated in mods"
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Green Hell is pretty realistic and has multiplayer. Maybe Conan exiles is also to your liking, if you liked ark than you should give it a try."
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Consider the forest for a horror survival option. I've never played rust, but me and my friends have hundreds of hours in Ark. You definitely need to tweak the game settings for it though, as it's designed around groups of 10+ people playing constantly. You can tweak the difficulty to make it easier for 1-4 players effectively though. Highly recommend."
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Play the best survival game on the market.....Subnautica. no need for mp.

But if you really want an mp game, I'd honestly go with the forest.

While ark is fun, it is very tedious and the menus and interface look like they came from windows 95."
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Green hell or the forest is your best bet.
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-06,"Ark is the best survival there is.  10x the amount of content vs any other survival and ive dumped hours into rust, dayz, minecraft, forest, grounded, etc"
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Don‚Äôt Starve Together not so realistic but pretty well made survival game
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"ARK Gets boring fairly quickly, and rust has to Be The most toxic game in history. i own both but play neither one because just that"
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Rust is great if you like more realistic gameplay and better base building/upkeep elements the multiplayer is generally good if you like hearing screaming/slurs/Russians. Also very time oriented so you kind of have to play often. I haven‚Äôt played much of ark.
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"I suggest none of them.

I mean in Rust you log in and find your shit destroyed because some no life was riding you in the middle of the night or something. What is the point of game like that? 

Some people suggest green hell and I agree. Good single player experience and its interesting. And no one ride your base in the middle of your sleep."
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Go play [MUCK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625450/Muck) for the sweet price of free üòé
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Valheim!
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Don't starve together is great, but you need friends to play with mostly imo.

If you want to try Ark I think there's some decent private servers that have more reasonable rates that make playing in small groups or solo more effective.

A the learning curve for DST is also lower than Ark's, but it will eventually come down to preference ofc"
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Yeah ive recently found ark and it looks like what im looking for. Thanks for the suggestions
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-07,Thanks üôè
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Thanks for the input. Ill check it out
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Good to know. Ive heard that you need to be on rust alot for it to be fun. Like keep checking on you‚Äôre stuff
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,I would probably get rust if it wasnt so much money. J enjoy the competitive part of video games though. Do you think its worth the money?
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Thats what ive heard about rust. Multiple suggestions about green hell so ill compare the two and check em out.
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Never heard of it, ill check it out rn"
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,I have also thought about this game
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,Its the same with ark too. Both games are also very group heavy and kinda requires a group of people to be consistently successful.
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"If you like being competitive, rust is the better pick, since it‚Äôs definitely up there with the most comp games. Also I believe it‚Äôs on sale currently but I don‚Äôt remember."
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,I live for multiplayer so ill check the price again just in case and see. Thanks for the info. It really helps
oc66um,2021-07-02,2021-07-02,"Yeah no problem. I would also recommend watching someone like Welyn on YouTube to see how the game can be when you really get into it, to see if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd be interested in."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Does the 33 hours include grinding for resources?
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,This is cool! How did you do the cables? 
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,What platform are you playing on?
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Reeeee it‚Äôs not pvp viable
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Amazing commitment!
Well done!! "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Pretty dope
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"No, the main reason it took so long was the cables.  As well, I tore down the first version.  30 people in the tribe made resources no problem."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,I‚Äôm fairly high and deadass just though this was a really photo for a few seconds. 
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-04,Looks amazing :) 
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"This game looks so pretty, its a shame the devs are literal trash. Nice build bro. "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Call me when you build a 4x wide bridge to carno island on a day 1 pvp server and hold it there for 6 months.
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"I found out only later that I could have used a ladder to line them up straight.  The cables were tricky, I used a horizontal one lined up at the bottom, the just kept placing until I reached the top.  Twice I have to remove them because when I got to the top, they essentially missed. Once I did hit the mark though, I would place all the vertical ones.  "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,"This was built on PC.  Private server.  Mods used are S+.  As well, the server has collision enabled.  I have a video walkthrough of it, but was not sure it was appropriate to share it in the comments.

Edit:  The bottom right is a cemetery I built for the real life workers that lost their lives building the bridge.  I researched the background of the bridge, and was surprised to find out, it was way below average for that time in history.  The main reason, the engineer was keen on safety.  Among many things, he built a net to catch workers that fell.  Sadly, a bunch of scaffolding fell and broke the net.  The workers that fell with it, were killed, except for one.  That day, was the only day there was loss of life, with the exception of one other worker.  Which was amazing for that point in time.

Edit II: The building was built for a player in the server from CA, who had helped with the server a lot, and had spent time with his daughters throughout their childhood on that bridge."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Thank you, much appreciated."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Thanks, it was a grind of a build.  It is one of two bridges that connect our tribe to the main land.  We were 30 living in our village.  Sadly, the madness of the bridge build among other builds, made the area lag really hard.  It has since been removed, and is only remembered in pics and videos. "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Yeah, well thanks.  Had I used dynamic pillars to get the towers right, it would have been pretty close."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-04,"Thanks, appreciated."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Hard to argue with the dev comment, especially after the botched release of extinction."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Well, it goes without saying this was built on a PVE server.  I can't imagine this even getting off the ground on PVP.  "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Weird flex but okay
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Impressive! That sounds incredibly time consuming, if it were me I probably would've cried the second time having to remove them, haha. I'm assuming you used the electrical cables?"
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,Back when going to war or building shit was a hard choice to make.
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,The fact that they released DLC when the game was in early access was enough for me to stay away from them. 
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"It was cables, there were many trials and issues.  I had the demo gun to remove them, but even with it, you have to aim it perfectly.  I learned a lot in the build, sadly most of it was after the fact, when people saw it, and suggested ways it could have been done easier. "
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Back with Scorched Earth.  Yeah, they were being sued for millions of dollars at that time.  That DLC probably saved Wildcard.  The company was not looking like it was going to make it.  They settled the lawsuit, and the DLC I assume helped in part to pay off the settlement.  I do not know the details.  I agree though, what a shock, paid DLC when the game was not finished."
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"All this being said, I love the bridge! Well done!"
a1xvxv,2018-11-30,2018-12-01,"Thanks a bunch, much appreciated!"
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,All i play
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,It is definitely worth it especially when you mass tame dodo birds they are fun birds
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,Toxic on PvP public servers. Amazing with friends or single player.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,Definitely more fun with friends too.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,Absolutely all of them
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,The single player is absolutely worth it...
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,"Don't bother playing on pvp servers but if you play singleplayer or, even better, drop like 15 bucks to get a server for you and a few friends, it can be one of the most fun games ever made. So much variety in how you can play and creates so many awe-inspiring moments mixed with laugh-your-ass-off moments. It's great"
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,Don't bother. I was a long term ark player and if you want a smooth solo experience you better get used to using commands to free yourself from stupid glitches or spawn gear back in because the game decides to wipe it from existence or get your bag trapped out of bounds. The single player progression is unsatisfying and grindy especially when it comes to preparing for bosses. On the other hand a survival game I enjoyed was Valheim although that can also be a bit grindy.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-07,I got it for free. That's... about the limit of what I'd recommend you spend on it. It's an okay diversion. Might be good with friends.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-07,"meh its ok.  other then the survival aspect theres really not a ton of ""content"" in it to really keep me that hooked to be honest."
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-07,"In Koop it's ok, but Singleplayer is a bit lame I would say. And the game is a like and hate at the same time thing"
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-08,Fuck no. Lose all your dinosaurs when they just randomly despawn/fall through the map
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-08,"I have been binging Ark recently. I like it so far (20 hours in). It's not without it's flaws of course like being very grindy as far as resources and taming goes. With that said, the game is incredibly customizable so if you don't like an aspect about it you can customize it. I increased resource harvesting and taming times bc I don't have a lot of time to play it anyways and I don't like spending the whole time grinding."
rai34i,2021-12-06,2022-01-11,"it‚Äôs a really good game, only reason people hate it because it‚Äôs so damn buggy half the time, most of my play time is literally me trying to just get the game work. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs all the hate. But i still love it though."
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,You saw the sliders? Crank them up you will reach max level by chopping a tree
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-08,"Thats good, But most of the problems are about the bugs, Does Wildcard even do anything about those? The game is very well known and has a very active player base, By the time I am sending this, around 36k people are playing it and today's peak was 50k players (According to Steam Charts) So I am pretty sure they are profiting quite well for it so I think that budget isn't really a problem, They also had around 35 employees in 2016 so I don't doubt they have a much higher amount of employees right now, And if thats the case, Why wouldn't they do anything about it, Are they even aware or did they atleast say anything about it"
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-06,I did use boosted rates. I had a lot of time spent on Ark and I don't know why. It just made me angry because its so buggy.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-08,I only play pve so I may not see all of the bugs other see. It's not the amooth at game on PvE but nothing is so bad to make it unplayable imo.
rai34i,2021-12-06,2021-12-08,"Im specifically targeting singleplayer, and maybe multiplayer once I do everything, But I really care about singleplayer more and I would like to see what it has to offer and what differences are there between SP and MP, Other than that one is toxic and one is not"
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Okay?
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Ark is a good game, it‚Äôs just so fucking buggy and unoptimized to be playable. They keep on adding new stuff but never fix game breaking bugs. They‚Äôre actually making a sequel ;-;"
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Farming simulator is a completely different genre of game. 


Also, Ark IS terrible. But it's the best game with dinosaurs. Because it's the *only* game like it with dinos besides modded Minecraft."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Ark is awful, full agreed.

It‚Äôs a shame too, need more awesome dinosaur games."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,yall are smoking crack. i got thousands of good hours of play from ARK
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Too bad because ARK 2 is coming... With the juicy Furious speed of Vin diesel from F&F crossroads
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Top five worst of last gen
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Is it still labeled as early access on steam?
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Used to be fun with my mates back in the day and little bugs made it funnier, now I've seen it's getting close to unplayable with game breaking issues. 

I was one of the many people that hoped it would be fixed until they basically said it's problems are too deeply rooted in the game.

Now there's Ark 2 on the way lol. I do hope they learnt their lesson so i can enjoy it with my mates again."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"It‚Äôs shit. It‚Äôs buggy. It‚Äôs unfair. And it‚Äôs run by a clown show. But there‚Äôs no other competition in the survival/Dino taming genre, so i love it."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Ark is indeed, a giant pile of broken shit"
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,[deleted]
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,They're both Life Simulators
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Turok would like a word...
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"I couldn't give a shit if Ark Survival 2 had Arnold Swartznegger as its lead and replaced the Dinasaurs with Predators, the game is shit..... Simple."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"If not, its false advertising. The game is probably more broken now than it was before 1.0"
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Second Extinction?
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,I know people who play ark who have jobs and a good social life. You could say any games playerbase has people with no life or job.
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Lol No. Not in the slightest. 

Ark is a spin on Rust with dinosaurs. Farming isn't even a thing everyone does on ARK."
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,Turok is a completely different kind of game as well.
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Never played it thought that was like an old shooter

Edit: I googled it. It‚Äôs a shooter. I need the building and base defense and raiding as well"
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,"Wait. Misread that you wrote. Thought it had said ""dino game"""
mpbwcw,2021-04-12,2021-04-12,All good thanks for trying :)
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"Those first two are a COMPLETELY different genre of game, but if you're looking for survival, I agree with the other person, No Man's Sky is great, as well as Stranded Deep, 7 Days To Die, Grounded (if you're on pc or xbox)....there are numerous survival games out there, all depends on what style you're going for. As for games like Miles Morales (open-world action/rpg) the list is even larger. Maybe give the assassin's creed games a shot if you haven't already, dozens of locations to explore and so much to collect"
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"Ahh yes I too like crafting survival games like Ark, Subnautica and Spiderman."
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,No Man's Sky fits well with the first two.
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"Rust, scum, planet crafter üòä"
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"Maybe ""kinds of games"" was not the right choice of words. And how are Subnautica and ark completely different? I know many aspects of them that are similar. They have an amazing foundation and while their gameplay is a bit different it's still amazing. It's like a cake, both are cakes but different kinds."
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,What? Spiderman might be a bit out of place but the other two?
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"Sorry, badly worded, I meant that those 2 were completely different from Spiderman haha my bad"
y2akpm,2022-10-12,2022-10-12,"For spiderman you said action but it's much deeper than that even though I don't know what makes them so good to me. It's really hard to make a gam that I enjoy as much as the one that I mentioned. You also said open-world which is like the most important thing in a game for me. Ark, Subnautica and spiderman are open-world."
10glto4,2023-01-20,2023-01-20,What kinda mutations you got on that Raptor there?
10glto4,2023-01-20,2023-01-20,All oxygen and carry weight
znz7c1,2022-12-17,2022-12-17,"Yes, when you go to steam it will give you an option to download it onto the drive"
znz7c1,2022-12-17,2022-12-21,I haven't from Steam. Whill this playable from External HDD? Whitout lagging?
znz7c1,2022-12-17,2022-12-22,"Yeah it will be playable, just a slot slower compared to an ssd."
znz7c1,2022-12-17,2023-04-26,And how I will install it? Game crashing with ntdll.dll error.
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"I have a little over 2,600 hours on Ark, much of which was spent with very experienced players that I learned a lot from. I'd be happy to answer any specific questions if you want to DM me.

I wanted to make sure you get some kind of help because why would this post get downvoted? Odd to me. Anyway, hit me up."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,I have thousands of hours in Ark and can help out with any questions as well. Unfortunately I cant hop in game with you but could hop in a Discord and answer some questions. DM me your discord info if you would like.
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,No experienced ARK player will want to waste tens or hundreds of hours helping 2 bambies. You just gotta play
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Thanks man I actually have a question about pvp base that I hope you could answer? I already talked with someone about mutations and they were great, but I‚Äôm struggling to not get raided on my Official server, atm my base is in the underwater cave at herbi but I wanna find a cave that doesn‚Äôt have 6x damage, do u know of any?"
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Ye man for sure thanks heaps, dm me whenever you‚Äôve got some time, really appreciate it!"
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Why not? They haven't asked for tens or hundreds of hours. They asked for a hour long session, probably to explain basics to them.

I would be glad to help if I had the knowledge..."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Unfortunately I can't really help with that. When I did play PVP, it was usually with a group and we would build big out in the open instead of finding a secure hidey hole. I do know for a fact though that Youtube is chocked full of videos about good pvp base locations."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,">  They asked for a hour long session, 

No they asked for help with mutations and base building etc. In ARK that's tens to hundreds of hours. I have over 1000 hours in ARK and still don't consider myself very good."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Yeah I‚Äôve been using YouTube quite a bit, I‚Äôll keep looking. Thanks for the help man really appreciate the time"
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"Sorry, I can't see base building mentioned anywhere in their post, only mutations. But I can see 1 hour long session at most."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"No that's all you WANT to see they gave that 1 example while SPECIFICALLY asking ""I‚Äôm looking for an experienced player who can help teach us more complex things about Ark"". And the fact they claim they only want an hours just shows they need way more help in the game than they are letting on lol."
s2txn7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"No you‚Äôre right, I probably do need more help in Ark than I realise, and if you don‚Äôt have the time you don‚Äôt have the time, I get it.

vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,"Just FYI, Ark came out in 2017, so, at most it was 5 years ago. Good luck with your search!"
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,I did the same with a lad I found except I stuck him in a fight pit with the rest of my kidnapped to duke it out to the death for some supplies and would send them on their way from there. My tribe called it the noob trap.
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,"nope, it released in 2015, but thanks anyway"
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,That does sound very similar to what op described
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,"Hmm, ok. Might want to edit this then: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark:_Survival_Evolved"
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,"Ya not me though, I did it more for the kicks. We‚Äôd get the new players to fight and get some Pvp in and then send them on their way rather than join our tribe. I remember we did have one kid who helped us with taming and such and kept him around as sort of a morale up bringer of sorts. Different story though but fun times. Was odd how it all turned out since I was tribe leader but I‚Äôve never been a leader in anything else in my life."
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,"It was released as a beta on June 2 2015, you're looking at official release"
vrfkve,2022-07-04,2022-07-04,My guy... read the wiki page that you have sent...
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,"It has a lot of issues but I had fun with it for a while.  If you dont mind the countless bugs and a company that doesnt care about fixing it then you will probably like it.  It is however incredibly difficult to get started from the rondo dinos that kill you, the difficulty of keeping food,water,healthiness up and other players it can be a little discouraging.  I reccomend starting in private server to learn the game then do official"

ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,I enjoy it. I don't play on offical servers but solo and when I can rent a server with my wife we have a good time.
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,It's very grindy with a steep difficulty curve and tons of griefers. And the developer pulled a lot of scummy moves so depending on your play group and tolerance for it it's up to you. Xbox has a demo version and it's on gamepass as well so not a big ask to try it out.
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,yes it is
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,Try grounded
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,"It‚Äôs like rust but shitty, but I understand wanting something like rust on console. I had fun with it for like 2 or 3 weeks but. It‚Äôs not nearly as fun without someone to play with"
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,"Honestly, if you're not going to play with a few friends I wouldn't get it. I played it when it was still in early access and enjoyed it everytime they added something new. But once my friends stopped playing and I started playing on public servers, it kind of lost all of its novelty value. I'll play it every once in awhile but I'll just spawn my own items and dinos."
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,"Only way to play ark is in private server with custom mods, anything else is a exercise in fustration pain and getting ass fucked dry with a pineapple."
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt play it on console. Custom settings with at minimum certain mods make it so much better.
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,"I personally never liked it , my friends however played it for days after I stopped , and they loved it. But to be fair , they knew more than I did in terms of what you‚Äôre supposed to do in the game. 
I guess for me , the game progression itself was just too slow , getting setup and started takes pretty long.
But you can play on booster servers , which will increase the game speed , but it still just wasn‚Äôt captivating enough for me."
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-18,"I've only started playing on PS4 last Saturday. I really enjoy it. It's easy to lose track of time when you play it. It's a bit grindy to begin with, but it gets better once you upgrade your equipment and tame enough dinos. The controls leave something to be desired and the graphics sometimes mess up."

ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,How would you compare the two? I was interested but haven't heard too much about it
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,"Fresh into the game never played before those can be a hassle to keep up with, not saying its overly hard but it's very easy to overlook amidst all the other things you are trying to get done."
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,7-8 I‚Äôve only played a bit of it but I vehemently dislike grinding in games so while I‚Äôve given my opinion dont let me soly influence your decision
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,Personally i hated it but played it in early access. Have a few friends who absolutely love it so id say it's a mixed bag rather than a good or bad game. Best of luck deciding if its the game for ya.
ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,I‚Äôve heard that it is similar i played like 30 minutes of grounded and liked it and played like 20m of ark and i didnt love it that much

ib37sk,2020-08-16,2020-08-17,Its been like a year since i played it so i dont remember everything so i liked the look of the world and most of the creatures but hated the gameplay and how complicated the game at the start i played solo so maybe it would have been better if i played with someone and hated the menus and i know that is not really fair for the game but i expected much more than it is and i was plagued with the amount of games i had at the time

x19361,2022-08-30,2022-08-30,There's a Walking Dead turn based strategy game that's OK
x19361,2022-08-30,2022-08-30,"Sorry not a native english speaker so I might get some of the grammar wrong but I'm gonna suggest the games that I currently have on my phone

Graveyard Keeper - more of dark humor but as the title suggest this game makes you into a graveyard keeper who tends to the church's graveyard along with doing a myriad of other task (wood chopping, iron gathering, cooking, etc...), there's also combat if you're into that but it's not a big part of the game, more like press x to slash and thats it.

Rebuild - It's a turn based strategy game where each turn you have the option to kill zombies, recruit survivors, loot buildings & reclaim buildings whith the end goal being to reclaim the whole city from the zombies.

This War of Mine - You play as group of civilians stuck in a war zone for different type of reasons just trying to survive and you only have each other to rely on. At morning you can fortify your hideout and at night you can scavenge other locations in the city for basic necessities.

Sheltered - Similiar to ""This War Of Mine"" but instead of a war zone you're a family stuck in a bunker trying to survive in a nuclear wasteland.

Punch Club - Now this game isn't dark at all except maybe for the intro. This game is more of a management type of game where you only manage one person - your character. You need to train your character to better themselves, schedule fights, learn moves, etc. The other best thing I can say about this is it has a mishmash of 70-80's feel to it.

Hope this helps üòÄ"

Have you run dxdiag? If you dm me, I'll shoot you a link or walk you through the dxdiag, it is simple but Reddit pukes when you post a link. Could also Google how to run dxdiag if you haven't done."
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"I don't remember how to do it exactly, but choose a launch option in ARK to start without battleye and see if that helps. My server is without it due to crashing on some other player's rigs. (It's just a couple friends anyway, no need for anti cheat)

nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,I have. It says I've got Direct X 11

nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"I'm glad that was your fix XD battleye is a pain.

Be aware, official servers require it to play but I seriously don't recommend playing on officials anyway. They're pretty toxic and take an ungodly amount of time to do anything.

Unofficials shouldn't require battleye, some may depending on the host. 

Finding a smallish community, unofficial, dedicated server with boosted rates is likely your ticket. Bonus points for cluster servers, and mods. My own is not cluster but modded.molded.

Also the next DLC is releasing this Wednesday! I've been playing since right before Scorched Earth."

Edit: Can't figure out how, that's funnnnn"
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"Yeah, that was mainly what I was concerned about when I first bought the game; other players.

I don't really like PVP in most games, I can play it but I prefer PVE, so I was figuring I'd either make my own server or find friends like you suggested"
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"Yup. Battleye is the pain in fortnite players ass. https:// www.battleye. com/support/faq/

nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"PVP can be fun, if done right and with friends or at least folks I know. Playing on a roleplay server was great. My tribe planned a raid, told the other people when we were doing it so they would be online. Had to act in character that they didn't know of a coming raid! (Gave them time to move dinos they didn't want to risk) 

You can play single player locally. If you'd like, I can suggest you some mods. The one I will never play without. XD others are QoL, and some nice additional dinos and decors. And I can show you how to modify multipliers in single player."
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"Roleplay servers you say?

Not quite sure about mods yet, will probably try some out after I've gotten a handle on the game. (First time playing in years)"
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"It's been a while. You just have your character, how you got there, personality... imagine playing D&D but ingame. 

I recommend always using either Super Structures or S+, they're both the same mod (SS was made using S+ open source) but S+ is ""integrated"" and no longer being developed, while SS is still a mod being updated. Whichever you choose, set at least no foundations required, and your building life will be significantly less painful. 

Also rates/multipliers aughtta be boosted, so you're not spending hours on small tames. Most unofficials do that."
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"Huh, a lot of those do seem really cool! I'll try them out soon!"
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"They're fun :3 

If you need help with anything you can message me. I've been managing a server for a few years, so I'm familiar with messing with rates, mods, difficulties, etc."
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,Gotcha! I might take you up on that soon
nogzxw,2021-05-30,2021-05-30,"Ye! Feel free. 

Hopefully that's the end of your problems. ARK is a game that you sometimes need to pin it down in order to make it work. XD"
vlpt03,2022-06-27,2022-06-27,"GTAOnline. It wasn't worthwhile. Wasn't  even fun in the slightest. Nothing but grinding the same 4-5 missions day in and day out. Pushing through multiple paywalls and resisting the temptation to give into Shark cards, bit it paid off until I had just enough to buy the Oppresor MKII. 

I can vividly remember using it for no more than 10 min before realizing how empty I felt to grind this much for something so mediocre, at which point I uninstalled the game and couldn't even turn on my game for a week."
