Having an F is completely fine for the vast majority of users even for gaming. Especially for gaming in fact since it requires you to get a dedicated GPU. They're totally fine with an F series CPU.

You should almost always buy a K, it has higher clocks and allows for higher sustained clock speeds when coupled with the proper motherboard.  Not just for over clocking but for everyday usage the turbo speed is higher than the non K version. Again an F series processor is cheaper BECAUSE its a failed regular series processor or K varient, if you dont understand why thats true, read what i said before, there isn't 3 lines of manufacturing, there is 1, and if it fails to meet a standard in the iGPU it is disabled and called an F.

Like the big Trex thing that wipes your first weeks worth of progress.

A bridge I built in ARK: Survival Evolved,24713,"Believe it or not, the GPU is rarely the bottleneck in Ark. It’s the fact that Ark only can use two CPU cores and is constantly fetching which drags most peoples frame rate down around large builds. If you check your GPU utilization you’ll see it’s rarely pegged, and your CPU utilization is almost fully maxing out exactly two cores but nothing more. 

Fix I just found recently was the 5800X3D. That extra L3 cache was exactly what Ark needed. I was blitzing around on some random servers on Gen 2 this morning, trying to find the biggest builds I could just to see what it would take to tank then frame rate.

That game was like a God damn drug addiction but it was without a doubt my favorite gaming experience of my life. I'll always miss the long nights of arguing, grinding, and wiping other tribes. I also used to go around and perform Joe and Bob inspections of small tribes bases. I'd make them open their chests and delete a section of their floor to verify they were not harboring any Joe's or bobs.

A bridge I built in ARK: Survival Evolved,24713,"I don't think you can mod the Epic version, only the Ssteam version.

You can play solo (offline), PVE official (no mods, vanilla rates), PVE modded (hosted and maintained by other players), PVP official, or PVP modded. If you've no interest in playing with non-friends, you can host your own instance and have friends join (you need to be playing for them to play) or you can rent your own server and have friends join you there too (they can play when you're not).

In PVE, this bridge cannot be destroyed by others outside of a few very niche ways (joining your tribe and them dismantling it or leading a powerful dinosaur over who is capable of destroying that tier material). It took at least a couple hours to build this but many hours to understand all the cool stuff you're able to do with the building.

I would recommend trying Epic but ultimately buying on Steam in the long run.

Rates are also able to be adjusted. Taming a Rex with ""vanilla"" rates will take you >4 hours. The rates I play at reduce that to just under an hour. Pretty much, any rate can be changed (harvest amount, health points per level, breeding time, max level, etc).",1

A bridge I built in ARK: Survival Evolved,24713,"That's assuming single player though, at which you can beat the game with far less then a giga. Online is nuts unless you're in an alpha tribe and even then those can be wiped.",3
A bridge I built in ARK: Survival Evolved,24713,"well, here's a little helpful info then -

ark's server browser is terrible for downloading mods. you'll time-out before you can finish downloading, and you have to keep clicking join to continue. most good servers will instead have a steam workshop page with their mod list. so use the ark browser to find a server, and then google ""server-name workshop"" and hopefully you can download all needed mods through steam workshop with ark closed. sometimes there's still more mods that have been added since they built the workshop page, so you'll still need to do the join rejoin thing on the ark browser. it's a real hassle to join a heavily modded server, but it's just one-time cost. 

also, if you want to play on a modded map (recommended, some are awesome) you'll usually need to individually subscribe to that map, again through steam. just use the search box on the store page, they're free downloads. and then right click on ark in steam, go to properties, dlc, and enable those maps

however, even once they're downloaded it can take 5-15 minutes for your game to load those mods to join, every time you join. if it takes longer than that, i usually find another server; some are poorly built. 

and yea, there's mods for everything, my favorite is servers that include ""awesome teleporters."" not only are they low-cost lightweight teleporters that you can use without power (place one by metal, pearls, whatever) but there's a ""corpse recovery"" option on the action wheel. it will just teleport your body's inventory to yourself. spawn at base, recover corpse, boom. it's like your death didn't happen. those are usually PVE servers though, but many of them (primal fear) have actually terrifying dinos, so you're fighting the world and not the players. but that's just one example. 

structures+ mod (or S+, an earlier fork) is crucial on any server, too many benefits to list. 

and watch your level points when you distribute - some servers are smart, you put one point into weight, and it shoots up to 1000, but one point in health only gives another 50 or w/e. crafting is often insta-maxed; one point into crafting will give you like 1000000% craft speed.

and expect to spend a whole day finding a server you like. maybe more. it can take hours to get all the big popular mods installed, and every server has different ones, and you may find that server still sucks, for whatever reason. be ready to abandon several servers to get what you're after.

Mind you, you’ll need to put a lot of points into weight to be able to move metal, but even so, it will mean you can reach all corners of the map quite easily. Just remain aware of the stamina at all times. Nothing worse than running out of stamina right in the path of a pissed off rex lol",2

That is when I learned about massive multi server clans that would pool resources, and move to other servers to establish dominance. A dude came in on a fucking Griffin and dropped 20+ c-4 charges, and carpet bombed my beautiful strat into the wind. I quit that day for good. Terrible community in that game.",107
So I built this cabin on ARK: Survival Evolved. I think it looks pretty cool C:,23292,"No it doesn’t , many pve servers aren’t much better. Lotta people just lure alphas to you’re base and watch em stomp through it.",33
So I built this cabin on ARK: Survival Evolved. I think it looks pretty cool C:,23292,"Playing pvp is something you have to learn. It's a completely different game. It's like when you finish the singleplayer version of a game and move onto multiplayer (I'm thinking of like halo 3 Era when people actually still played campaigns). Once you know how to survive against the ai dinos you can move on to learning how to survive against other players. It's of course not for everyone but unless you are trying to build a massive fort in the open you can definitely find time for other things in life.

For example everything valuable I own in pvp is in a 1 foundation 'base'. It's nothing you would call a base but it works. It's only 1 ceiling high and has a bed inside. There's a vault placed on the ceiling but this whole thing is in a little nook underwater. Also I have about 3 or 4 of these 'bases' set up, one other with a vault and one that's stashed near an obelisk on land that just has a bed, smithy, and pestle all crammed into the one foundation. If I log on and my most valuable stuff is miss it's unlikely that my backup and backup's backup bases will also be gone. Each one has flak and some basic tools. Luckily the auto decay timer on metal structures is high so I could probably get away with playing once a week but I'm on every weekend and usually once during the week to check on things and really just reset the decay timers. The base on land has been broken into and relocated a few times but I don't think anyone has found my underwater spot. 

I'm definitely straying from my point but at least on a pvp server everyone agrees that they can be assholes. I'm really hesitant on pve servers because of the players that think it's some kind of competition and block off crap or get your stuff killed.",2

So I built this cabin on ARK: Survival Evolved. I think it looks pretty cool C:,23292,"For sure! I'll definitely take that list, I want to get that DLC and start playing again soon.  It's amazing to see how far the game has come with all the mods now.

Most modded servers I've played on had very little, just some QOL mods - most of which I think have been added to the game, it was some machine stuff that I can't recall because it was long ago.  The only building mod we had was some glass stuff that was supposed to be as strong as metal (it was greenish-tint, two-way, can't recall the name of the mod).",3
So I built this cabin on ARK: Survival Evolved. I think it looks pretty cool C:,23292,"Chrons servers are great. Great community that I've been playing with for years. Lots of mods but he and his team spend hours balancing many things manually and he stays involved with the community some what. Discord is fairly active and others are extremely helpful.

Tired of spending time on gathering resources? Increase harvest multiplier. Taming takes too long? Increase taming speed. And so on. And then I haven’t even started telling you about mods.

It’s incredible how much more I enjoy playing Ark after finding out about the above.

I don’t have a need to play with others to enjoy this game. And I definitely won’t join a PvP server and see my base raided. Yet that’s what most Ark content on Reddit seems to be about.",44

Then instead of fixing that they add things like wyverns as a giant f-you to any group without hundreds of players on 24/7, and instead of at least only having them on the new map they allowed them to be pulled to all the existing servers, so base defenses were meaningless since wyverns could torch metal walls from outside turret range and only groups with players on 24/7 could keep walls standing.",4

"It took me over 100 hours to build this on ARK: Survival Evolved, and I am very happy with how it came out",5663,"> that's just the way these game go, the most toxic player gang up and drive away everyone whom don't join them; then with the hordes of menial laborer in their rank they scoop up all the end game content until whole servers become locked by them.

Eh, only if the game design allows that, pre-server transfer where they couldn't hide anything if they pissed off enough people on server they'd start losing dinos so the main gameplay was more of defense, building up, and mounting an actual strike, led to a lot of actual interesting battles.  I honestly can't remember a single ACTUAL fight post-transfer, the only one I even was a part of even my own group abandoned us and the base and quickly hid all the dinos and loot in the transfer pillar, and that's really how it goes, instead of fights it's just a scramble to hide things where nobody can get it, and just rejoin later and rebuild.  Being able to hide dino's/resources somewhere where they're 100% invulnerable...but only if you're a large enough and high enough level group broke the game badly and just destroyed the ability to play solo or in small groups.  They just kept doubling down over and over again making the game worse for small groups and favoring large groups.",1
"It took me over 100 hours to build this on ARK: Survival Evolved, and I am very happy with how it came out",5663,"Good chance they were debuffed since then from what you say, could have sworn they damaged the walls themselves but honestly that's a secondary issue anyways, their breath attacks WEREN'T STOPPED by walls and especially the lightning ones could AOE destroy generators and turrets without even being in range to be shot, they actually instantly destroyed cables in an AOE so the turrets would be shut down even if not destroyed! When they were added it essentially made offline base defenses useless, a single wyvern could very easily take out all the turrets and power letting the bigger physical hitters come in close and break in.  Prior to them a decent mid-sized base for a 5-10 person group would be ""moderately"" safe offline with some plants and turrets guarding it and actually assaulting it took resources, risk, and some actual time, post wyvern you could just hit and run and the AOE was so strong you could blow base defenses quickly, it really sucked all the fun out of base assault/defense.


Honestly they're pretty trash in an actual fight though, they're extremely easy to take down by online players, they actually felt like something who's only purpose was to AOE grief bases of people who were offline.


Edit: looks like in the past few years since I quit ark they've been nerfed to almost 50% of their old hp and the lightning wyvern isn't quite the flying base-melter it used to be, it still destroys defenses in AOE but at least it no longer blows up walls and structures along with the turrets.  The last few private servers I played on all had wyverns disabled for a reason, they're just too game-breaking and the only counters are such massive time-sinks they turn the game into a day job.",2

"It took me over 100 hours to build this on ARK: Survival Evolved, and I am very happy with how it came out",5663,"From reading the replies, I guess it really depends on the type of server you join. For me, I gravitate towards PvE servers with a dedicated community, one run by admins/owners that have a FB page or a discord server rather than just picking a random server on the PvE list ingame. I’ve rarely had issues of other players griefing there as admins would be on top of things. And with those servers there’s more of an ingame economy for trading and stuff along with events here and there which really appeals to me. 

When I first started, I joined from the ingame server list and found both PvP and PvE terrible and one of the worst experiences. But doing a bit of searching for an established server really saved Ark for me. Experiences may vary as you can see from the replies of people who have seen the other side of the coin, but as in any multiplayer game, people will be people.",2

So excited for Ark: Survival Evolved,3506,Its like Stomping Land but good and real..,7
So excited for Ark: Survival Evolved,3506,"Can people try to stop being ""excited"" for survival games that inevitably will get early access for ages ?

When will the general public learn ? Dayz, H1Z1, Reign Of Kings, Rust, 7 Days to die, Stranded Deep, Space engineers, Grim Dawn, medieval engineers, beast of prey, subnautica, savage lands and the list goes on and on....

Yet how many have actually delivered on their promises and are near officially release ?

Let's take DayZ as a example, since it's early access success is a (if not THE) reason why we have this issue.

They announced development back when they were still working on the mod, so that is years ago. It's early access has been on steam for a good two years now ? And they are miles behind of delivering the experience that they so much talked about on streams and announcements ect.

Let alone how far that they are to surpass the mods that were made for dayz mod (inception-esque).

Yet that didn't stop Dean Hall (the dev that people trusted) to take a load of money and bail from the project, he's now in NZ on retirement at the age of 35 i believe, while trying to start up a new game studio (Rocketwerkz).

And while the other early access games are not in the same league of ""shadiness"" as Dayz, many are barely receiving any updates.

Why ? one could argue it's because one of the largest incentives that pushes game studios to deliver a proper product is now gone with early access a.k.a. they got your money already.

So please, go easy on the ""excitement""",8

Anyway I really like just surviving in the wilderness and I noticed H1Z1 had some PvE servers... Every single one was empty. Not a single fucking person on any of those servers. The most I seen in a PvE server was like 10 people right.

I bring it to the two dude's attention and they straight told me that they only play those games to fuck with people so PvE is boring.

Now I ask you, FieryDog. Why are these PvE servers empty? You can still get into zany interactions, you can still build a base, go hunting, jerk off, what ever. The only difference is that you cannot kill each other. That difference alone has turned off the entire H1Z1 community from visiting these servers.

I'll suck your cock if you can explain that without bringing up the idea that people only play these games to grief and kill other players (which they do).",5

Almost always is god awful.

The gameplay has little point and seems rather shallow right now.

Some of us just simply expect a little lower quality than what was shown as gameplay footage. That's really not unfair to want.

Every single Early-Access developer, seems to have some sort of ""over the top Ultra build"" (near finished version, it seems, compared to the EA releases) that they then show footage of and tend to release a fairly mediocre version of that when it launches (Not talking about bugs and what not, at all) with added features that makes the game look and feel worse than it was shown initially.

So excited for Ark: Survival Evolved,3506,"And I understand him. 

Firstly, with a Titan X, I will not decrease the resolution, I will just close the game and play something else if I don't get good framerate. I'll play the game when it's working passably at least.

Secondly, when you have a 1440p screen, decreasing the resolution to 1080p looks terrible. I know that that may sound elitist compared to all people who play at 1080p (which is the majority), but the problem is that 1080p isn't a multiple of 1440p, so you get blurriness and aproximations in the rendering that looks ugly. A lot of the times decreasing to 720p can look better. A 1080p resolution on a 1440p screen looks far worse than a 1080p resolution on a 1080p screen.

And again, to be fair, I play at 1440p with a GTX 690 and an old processor and I'm fine for most of the current releases (of course not always in full ultra settings), I don't see why a Titan X should make concessions to a completely unoptimized game (which is normal for alpha / beta, but if you charge for it, basic optimization so that it is playable should be required)",2

You support the idea of early access but are telling people not to buy into it. What?
",3
So excited for Ark: Survival Evolved,3506,"I think the point people are trying to make is that it looks like most Early Access Survival games on the market right now (Rust, theHunter: Primal, DayZ, Stranded Deep, H1Z1, The Forest). Those games don't have the best reputation right now. Just look at Rust for a second; it was originally released in December 2013 and it's **still** in Early Access. I doubt it will even be out of Early Access 2 years after the initial launch due to the ""reboot"" releases they've been doing. Or DayZ for example which was also released in late 2013 and many people have migrated away from due to slow development and other issues. 

So what makes Ark different? Is it going to be the one survival game that makes it out of Early Access in a timely manner? Does it have such amazing features that it's worth stomaching poor performance and unpolished gameplay? For me it's an resounding **No** to all the above.

The indie game scene is so crowded with Early Access Survival games it's ridiculous. It reminds me of when the AAA industry flooded the market with WW2 Shooters in the early 2000s, but worse, because these games are unfinished. I like reading the mentality of most of the comments on here because it looks like people are coming to their senses. I don't think games like these should be coming out every month with the expectation of being a hit in Early Access, it's only lowering our standards of what a game should be when we pay $30 for it.

TL;DR Vote with your wallets people and don't support another generic Early Access Survival game. Or for another TL;DR watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz3OSSpopzY)

What you have to understand in the 9 hours you played buddy? The mod was more playable than that 3 years ago.

Oh, and as soon as you think you're doing good and have a remotely-stable setup going.... the game spawns a pack of Carno's, Rex's, or Raptors to utterly fuck your day up, destroy your home, and eat your body. Then they'll camp the area for 30-45min to make sure you can't recover anything you lost.

"[Ark: Survival Evolved] NEVER set the poop interval to ""0""",4766,"My friends and I joined a server with a particularly aggressive ""alpha"" tribe when we first played the game. Being the stubborn fucks we were, we vowed revenge after they destroyed our three-story thatch house. We built a boat and opted to live on the ocean until such a time that we could stockpile supplies to set up a good base.

Any Ark player knows that riding on a boat as a passenger can be an extremely dangerous task. You basically have to keep your feet on the ground 100% of the time the boat is in motion or you go flying off. We figured this out pretty quickly. It had already happened a few times but my dumbass decided to climb a ladder while we were in motion, and found myself swimming. As I did a 360-degree spin trying to find the boat again all I see is a massive fucking shark in the distance turn and start coming towards me. I freaked the fuck out, it was on the same level as the first time I played Depth as a diver. Literally started screaming while swimming to the boat. I made it onto the ramp but it was like the chum scene from Jaws as this massive shark just swims along the boat waiting for one of our dumbasses to fall in again. We had no idea that there were sharks in the game until then and every time someone flew off the boat from then on it was a panicked rush to get back on for fear that one would show up for a snack.",3

You can also drag over an area to crop before it copies the picture, and it's easy to open and edit if you wish!

You can take a screenshot of a selected area, freehand draw, a specific window, or your entire desktop!

Then just paste it right into Reddit, discord or save it locally!

Wanted to revisit this game but then saw its install size!,24511,"Hi, you're probably looking for a useful nugget of information to fix a niche problem, or some enjoyable content I posted sometime in the last 11 years. Well, after 11 years and over 330k combined, organic karma, a cowardly, pathetic and facist minded moderator filed a false harassment report and had my account suspended, after threatening to do so which is a clear violation of the #1 rule of reddit's content policy. However, after filing a ticket before this even happened, my account was permanently banned within 12 hours and the spineless moderator is still allowed to operate in one of the top reddits, after having clearly used intimidation against me to silence someone with a differing opinion on their conflicting, poorly thought out rules. Every appeal method gets nothing but bot replies, zendesk tickets are unanswered for a month, clearly showing that reddit voluntarily supports the facist, cowardly and pathetic abuse of power by moderators, and only enforces the content policy against regular users while allowing the blatant violation of rules by moderators and their sock puppet accounts managing every top sub on the site. Also, due to the rapist mentality of reddit's administration, spez and it's moderators, you can't delete all of your content, if you delete your account, reddit will restore your comments to maintain SEO rankings and earn money from your content without your permission. So, I've used power delete suite to delete everything that I have ever contributed, to say a giant fuck you to reddit, it's moderators, and it's shareholders. From your friends at reddit following every bot message, and an account suspension after over a decade in good standing is a slap in the face and shows how rotten reddit is to the very fucking core.",1

Wanted to revisit this game but then saw its install size!,24511,"It probably wasn't.  But this is what I call AAA bloat.  (Whether ark is AAA or not doesn't really matter).  Basically gamers have ignore or defended larger games for so long that it's no longer a problem when games grow in size.  

People accept 100 GB sizes for files, but the problem is games like ARK, Warzone, even Genshin Impact constantly update, but there's no effort to optimize, they just image they can just take up more space and more space.  That's why when Genshin impact used to be able to run on almost any phone, now it's 32GB, which kind of pushes it out of lower end phones (But that's also 32 GB JUST for it.  Which most people probably won't want to use).  

Warzone is over 100 GB.  It kind of boggles my mind, because Ark is a paid game, but both Genshin Impact and Warzone is trying to be ""F2P"" But they seem to just lop off entire parts of their market with this shit. 

I have a feeling a big part of this is that these companies keep adding to the game with out ever taking things away, and that means there's outdated textures models and more living on your hard drive that you'll never see but probably remains there because the engines either can't remove them or the developers are afraid to. 

Then I see something like Fortnite which somehow is under 30GB or so and under 3 gigs on mobile?  Damn.(I don't have it, I don't play it so maybe what I see online is incorrect) That's pretty impressive compared to these behemoths

But the idea that we have infinite hard drive space and developers can bloat their game up as big as they want really has to end and it only ends when people call them on it... or rather when people stop buying their shit until they fix this shit.",1

Wanted to revisit this game but then saw its install size!,24511,"Depends on how you look at it, from the CPU/GPU side having the raw assets available is a net benefit to performance at the cost of storage, *if your storage is fast enough* .

Now if you are trying to run this off an old 5400 rpm drive, you're going to be in for a really bad time.

IMO only - If you have a rig that can play games at medium/high settings, you shouldn't even be considering anything less than SATA SSD, and their cost is so...so cheap by comparison.

I played with a buddy and a friend of his, they both loved the genre.

There were some really cool aspects, like riding the dinos (and shortly before I stopped you could even ride flying dino!) and I did enjoy the building aspects.

But, if you quit, your body just dropped in place and stayed there. You could be eaten or robbed the entire time you were logged off. Even if you were on a private server, it didn't matter. I had a baby so I couldn't just go ""oh, he's crying! Let me just take 15 minutes to make it back to base so I can check on him!""

And, even if you were in your base, it could also be overrun at any moment even if no one was logged into the server. So, if you left it alone for more than a day, it might get destroyed and all your progress eliminated.

You had to be always playing.

That's not fun for me, that's just a job with cool dinosaurs.

1gb cable was 30€ a month, and cheaper DSL was 8€ for 125mbps. Telekom, Vodafone, 1&1 all similar prices. This was mostly at a small village about an hours drive from Cologne & Wuppertal.

Phone speeds were pretty mediocre, though, and reception in more rural areas wasn't great (on an O2 sim). Unlimited data plans were really freaking expensive too.",3

In the following decades, none of the reigning parties managed to fix that issue even when it was very obvious that the Internet was gonna last.

That led to a famous quote from Angela Merkel in *2013*: Das Internet ist für uns alle Neuland (the internet is something new to all of us), which is just a perfect description of what's wrong. 

Germany tends to be run by people who don't want to change things. They wait until a problem solves itself (it usually doesn't), then blame the previous government or the opposition and claim that they would have never done that (even if they were the ones who did it).

It doesn't help that almost 60% of the population is older than 40 and also more than 60% of voters are 50+, who grew up with CDU (that christian democrstic party) and always vote the same for some reason, no matter how much they fucked up this time.",415
Wanted to revisit this game but then saw its install size!,24511,"Short: Bureaucracy and corruption.

Long example:
Here in my area we have telekom, who was first and has fiber going towards their dslams. But their dslams are old and would require upgrading, which wouldnt be worth it for the company without state financing.

Because of poor speeds and multiple complaints, local government had a ""bidding"" (dunno what it is called correctly in english).
Telekom would have done up to 250/40 for 55€/month including a free phone flat and other benefits like free disney+, free netflix, other free stuff like this year I got a free christmas tree and free disney 100 year anniversary hoodie, 60€ worth in gift cards of choice - i chose amazon. And the monthly price can be had a lot cheaper with rebates like 5€ off under 28, 5€ off for corporate benefits, 5€ off for mobile contract with them plus like 30€ off for first 6 months upon contract extension - down to an average of like 30€-35€/month from what I know.
Also other companies would have been able to rent those lines and offer their own internet at potentially lower prices.

Meanwhile our municipal utilities, partnered with another new local company, offered 50/5 for 60€/month without any rebates or benefits and without a phone flat (that would cost an additional 5€/month) for laying completly new cables, tearing open like 10km+ of road and placing completly new dslams. Oh and no other company is allowed to rent those lines, so they have a monopoly in our area.

Guess who got to build their stuff with government funding. Worst part isnt even them having worse internet for higher prices with no benefits or rebates. Worst part was we were with them for 2 years and their service would simply collapse at least once every single month for multiple days. You can imagine not having a phone or internet for multiple days in a row every month can be frustrating, especially when youre in an IT school, so if you want to do anything, you either stay in school to leech their network there or stay at home using mobile data. (Which was incredibly expensive back then, like 5€+ per gb)

Now eventually our municipal utilities founded a new company, who also build new dslams recently. And again nobody else can rent those lines. On top they only offer 25/4 for 60€ month, again with additional 5€ for a phone flatrate and no benefits or rebates possible. And they are even less reliable from what ive heard from others who are with them.

Now luckily telekom offers 5G hybrid in our area for a while now. While I only have a 2k line connection, I am getting 300/50 over 5G and only paying 40€/month while getting free phone flatrate, free disney+, free netflix and other free stuff every year. Also they are extremely more reliable. I joined during the beta test and last like 2 years theur service only collapsed once for 4 hours from literally 2am to 6am, which I wouldnt have known if my server didnt complain that it didnt have internet during that time.

Still its funny and frustrating our government spend millions on small local companies, effectively delivering a lot less for a higher monthly cost than telekom now delivers for free and way lower monthly cost.

Ofcourse I would still like to get 550/90 combing a decent line with 5G or even getting gigabit eventually in 50 years, when I retire.",27

Also it can be a CPU problem if it's too slow.

You knew exactly what you were getting with the base game - take it or leave it, and it was a complete, albeit simple game.

It worked because of the kind of goal-less ""mine, build, explore, fight"" game it was, and that what *was* there was fully functional for its core game loop to be enjoyable. While the updates were nice, they weren't essential to have a lot of fun with it in its initial state.

Wanted to revisit this game but then saw its install size!,24511,"> but it's the best way to do it.

No, it's not. It really, really, *really* very emphatically is not. For the record, I'm a game dev for a living myself. I certainly can't say I've ever built a software delivery platform that's as successful as Steam, but I can confidently say I've built an update system that's better than Steam's.

Maybe Steam's method is better when bandwidth is extraordinarily limited (I'm talking 90s internet or a fucking Mars colony or something, not ""I have a relatively sensible bandwidth cap on my connection"") and storage space is plentiful. Generally though, you can very roughly just 

* Check CRCs to make sure the files you're starting with are what the update expects. If not, give up and basically do a fresh install (which is what would end up happening if a ""regular"" Steam update failed), ideally just of the files changed by the update if your CDN setup allows it.

* Do what you can to signal to the game it's in the middle of updating and shouldn't run (the user can run it half-update anyway if they really try, but it's not really a big deal, worst case game crashes or something)

* Ensure you will have enough space to work with before starting (nobody likes updates that randomly fail in the middle, just append blank data/create blank files up to the size needed as your first step, and grab file handlers with write-permission to all of it ahead of time, easy to undo if it turns out there isn't enough space)

* Download the diff files, apply them directly to the original copy

* Check the CRCs or whatever, if anything's wrong just... delete the faulty file(s), and re-download them (whole, not diff, and ideally individually and not the whole package) directly from your CDN (a partial fresh install, essentially)

* Done.

It's really not rocket science. In an age where bandwidth is relatively plentiful, you can worry about replacing a corrupt file (a rare occurrence) when it actually happens. And ""always have the game folder in a runnable state"" is a nice philosophy in theory, but I'd much rather save hundreds of GBs in disk space (and disk lifetime!) than have some intangible theoretical benefit. Which isn't absolute, anyway, it's not like Steam's system doesn't also momentarily break the install once it decides patching has succeeded.",7

People keep saying stuff like this like it was an achievement but it was actually the norm at the time. Most games in the 90's and practically all games from the 80's and before were written in assembly.

Everyone learned Assembly so it wasn't that daunting to do, compilers weren't as good as today so writing games in a compiled language even like C wasn't going to be fast enough and let's not even talk about interpreted languages (which continue to suck till this day when it comes to performance). I also remember reading about an undocumented CPU instruction on the NES that people discovered and found that it was super useful but since it's undocumented none of the few C compilers for the 6502 supported it at the time which is another reason for using assembly on those systems. Finally, computers at the time were not as complicated as now. Certainly, printing ""hello world"" in python is still easier than in any assembly language but it was far less difficult than today. Couple this with the simplicity of the games of the time and you can see how writing games in assembly for the SNES or the amstrad CPC wasn't that big of a challenge.

Worth noting that some people still write hobby games for the Sega Mega Drive (genesis) and other platforms till this day.",2

Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"No one will give a shit. But I have 1500 hours played in Ark.

- I have never seen an EA game with a Dev group as great as ark. There content release cadence is incredible. Their patching and response time for critical bugs is measured mostly in hours.
- the amount of added content (Dinos, biomes, tech, mats, system mechanics) is truly staggering since EA launch until now
- their responsiveness to community needs and desires is admirable (landing flying Dinos, prioritizing doedicurus and frog release for soothing stone and CP needs
- Any content created not immediately towards the end goal of hitting release date has generally served the overall game (community pissed their pants in rage over first holiday event - they explained that something like Halloween Jackolanterns give them a way to implement new lighting)
- Original game is something like 30$. Given constant sales getting it for 20$ is common.
- this expansion features 10 Dinos most with a heavy fantasy focus. So i view it as tangential but still underlying core Ark. Appropriate to be an expansion rather than add-on (center, prim+) from my POV. To me this is a far cry blood dragon.
- the content price is not outrageous for amount of content IMO.
- performance has improved staggeringly overtime. Additionally this game features a staggering amount of graphical configurations. I have a decent rig with a gtx970. Certain features when turned up or down can swing my average FPS sometimes by 30-40 frames (resolution scale slider, sky box detail). I agree ideally it's graphics and perf still have a ways to go, but it has gone a long way already and with the right settings I play with most things on ultra at 60.

So crusading just on the principal that game is not officially out of EA, therefore DLC is inappropriate seems so... Snap judgement to me. Everyone's opinions can be varied, but trying to crusade like this is ""another example of cash grab by shitheads"" feels really unfair (especially considering how many comments came from people with 4 hours of play...)just a thought.

P.S. Assuming no technical gains or perf increase were, will or are taking place because content team made a neat side expansion is unfounded. Teams have different functions. So someone working on new textures or Dinos are not the same people working on how to streamline memory usage or getting better perf from video cards.",6

This is not a survivable business model. So they made some additional content for people to purchase if you chose to. They even made the original game 40% off for the release of this new content.

You might think ""well maybe the content will make it to the base game eventually"" but they actually removed the content from their ""coming soon"" list.

Interesting thing of note:

80% of 592 reviews are positive for their DLC. It's probably great, but when you look at 'recent' reviews for the base game ark you get 44% of 6,285 reviews are positive in the last 30 days. So by appearances, the paid DLC doesn't seem to be doing well, and they're killing their potential sales for the base game (during a sale no less) due to bad recent reviews.",1

What the fuck is it an expansion for? You mean an update? If the game isn't completed then that's just an update. You can have separate teams work on updates just like you can ""expansions."" This is shady by default. Nothing makes them a separate entity other than their words as the game sellers.

There are only so many people who are every going to buy a particular game. Even Minecraft is probably mostly funded by Realms servers and licensing profits at this point.

I paid $15 for Ark in a humble bundle if I remember correctly. I will probably buy the DLC if/when I get back into playing it more regularly. 

I don't expect something for nothing, and by my stanards, Ark has been well above average on updating the game and adding new content, and I don't mind supporting that.

Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"> The game has been ""out"" for a long time, without any release of additional paid content. They've gone on for ages now, adding swaths of new content for free. The game is in a condition that it is playable, with about as many bugs and balance issues as you would expect a title of its kind to have if it were fully released. It is basically a complete game with an active development team adding new content consistently and frequently.

Three things here:

* The developers are still under the Early Access disclaimer, which means they can hide behind any issues of their game under the claim that it's being worked on. A lot of released games get skewered by the media for being broken at release, at least this way, the developers can avoid being skewered while reaping the benefits of Early Access (including Early Access funding).

* The game is only playable if you consider significant performance issues as acceptable, and let me tell you, most people don't consider crashing acceptable when thousands of dollars are being poured into this game. They made promises that x content would be released and that content hasn't been released, so by definition, the game isn't finished.

* You're justifying their actions by claiming they're basically releasing free content because you find the game personally acceptable, under your opinion. When they started this game development project and released the game under early access, they made an investment. If they can't continue to release content they promised based on the expectations they had of their investment, then they've failed to properly assess their game development business and they deserve to fail, just like any other business owner who plans poorly and lacks the funds to operate.

> This is not a survivable business model. So they made some additional content for people to purchase if you chose to. They even made the original game 40% off for the release of this new content.

Sucks to suck. I don't hand money to my local sandwich shop just because they're going out of business because they can't make enough money because they're failing to properly acquire business contracts for their meat. They thrive or fail, like any other business. If they can't properly assess the market they wish to compete in and they can't determine a profitable business model by which to operate then they deserve to fail. It isn't my responsibility to pay their bills if they can't provide the product I paid for.


> Now people are mad because they want to argue semantics. This is a non-issue, and people need to get some perspective. They could have removed ""Early Access"" status ages ago and people would still be complaining that they have to pay for new content.

Semantics? You need to acquire some perspective. If they ""could have"" removed Early Access status ages ago, then why didn't they? Because they wish to reap all the benefits of Early Access status while avoiding all of the negatives of traditional game development. Early Access is a cornerstone by which smaller companies can develop while actively receiving funds to pay for those developments. When those development costs exceed the funds appropriated then their game is deemed either too ambitious to complete or poorly managed, neither of which should be the burden of the consumer or continued at the expense of the consumer.",21
Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"I don´t buy early access games because I have no intention of paying to be alpha/beta tester. 

So.. after release early access game, I expect fixed game without bugs and good optimalization after such a long time in early access with so many people ""testing it"" (I wish if they were really testing it and reporting bugs instead of playing it and taking it for full release) and if you release buggy unfinished game after such a long time with SOOOOOO many people testing it, prepare for hate.

Why should it bother me that they were adding content for free before release? If they are adding something, that means that they want it to be in finished game! Or do you expect me to pay for the game and shitload of pre-game dlc´s because they added them there why you were testing it? Oh, no. 

Everything till point of realease is in means of early access free stuff. Early access literally means EARLY access. You can play it before release with all of its unfinished and buggy features and help creators to release a better product. Give them ideas, report bugs, give them response. Help them.

What many people gets wrong is that early access is not for you to enjoy, but to polish. But it´s starting to change into ""buy our product early, so we have excuse for game not being working"".

How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
“While we have the foundation of our game at Early Access launch, there are many currently-planned features and content additions we will be adding over the year from EA to full release. Beyond such planned features, will be adding TONS of aspects suggested or iterated on by the community, hence the point of Early Access! 

Planned Core Features include, among many other things:

- Mac and Linux versions
- Procedurally Generated ARK's
- 40+ more creatures to reach well over 100, with essentially every major category of extinct animal represented in some way
- More saddle types including saddle armor tiers and saddles with powerful weapons mounted on them
- Gas-powered Vehicles
- Human/Dino Body-Paints
- Enhanced building mechanics to evolve ARK into one of the best straight-up builder games out there
- More underwater biome/ecosystem complexity, including support for vacuum-sealed underwater bases
- Lots more items, weapons, armors and further advanced tech tiers
- More item skins, limited run event skins
- More bosses and the end-game cycle including the Ultimate Life Form & Ascension
- More biome types, including deserts, snow regions, swamps, and more.
- Steam Economy Support for Statistical Items (Need some Steam API functionality for this from Valve!)
- Way more plants and more detailed plant biology systems/farming systems
- More statistical modelling of status illnesses/diseases (both player and creature)
- Better SFX, more Music, Better UI's, Better Gamepad support (i.e. UI button shortcut callouts), Better VR support (i.e. HMD gun-aim option)

In addition to zillions of bug fixes, intensive performance improvements, mega iterative polishing, and what have you. The game will sparkle like a shiny diamond before it is considered ready for Full Release, and even then we plan on a long-term post-Release content lifecycle, with specialized ARK's on the drawing board.”",2

That's how ridiculous your claim sounds to me. You can't simply tell people to ignore the fact the game is still in early access, and that they should not think about that when talking about this DLC.

Being blind to the fact that this is nothing but a blatant cash grab isn't going to fly with me either, bucko. This is some horse armor 2.0 level of bullshit that will set a precedence for other devs to do the same. 


>Besides the transfer system allowing you to bring back DLC to play amongst non DLC owning players, I see no issue with this.  They have already released a lot of content and listened to their player base.  I played Ark for quite a while and the only thing I feel they should retract or apologize for is Official Servers.


There are tons of issues with this but let's focus on the big one, the game hasn't even left alpha/beta stages! This should have been worked on after the game completes. If the game is as you say, for all intents and purposes ""complete"", then they need to remove the early access tag pronto. You can't hide behind early access protection and sell extra content. let alone stuff that costs almost as much as the base game. 
",2
Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"Look at Starbound.

It's one of the few games that did EA-to-full release correctly.

If you had known how extremely lackluster SB was in its early days, and then played the complete, 1.0 version, you'd understand how big of a difference a game can be between a EA title, and the completed version.

When you say ""For all intents and purposes, it's out"", you're pretty wrong. A game like Starbound changed MASSIVELY over the time it was in its diapers, up till full release. It might as well be an entirely different game, just using the same visual assets.

And the game turned out great! But here's the deal right; 

It coulda easily turned out bad, too. Imagine a world - for example - where the game was going to end up being terrible at full release, but the game showed potential. Imagine that they decided to release EA DLC, promising that the game would be much better when it's complete, only for it to turn out that it wasn't.

So you paid DLC for a game under the premise that you're *hoping* it turns out being worth your while.

Hell; this can happen in reverse too. Which is arguably even worse; going from a decent or good game in early access, then having it snowball down a hill of shit; pulling your money with its EA DLC along for the ride.

And this is precisely why you don't support EA DLC. It's the same kind of pseudo-gambling that you have with pre-ordering and season passes. It's terrible for consumers and allows developers to cash in on hype, rather than actual effort in their product.

I really don't get how you defend this to be honest.

And just to cap this all off;

If your game is in Early Access, that means it is incomplete. DLC is reserved for after a game's completion. Why the hell are you taking man-hours away from *actually finishing the game*, and dumping it into a DLC?

""Well, they could have a team dedicated to the main game and this isn't slowing down their progress!""

That's crap. The more people they have working on the base game, the better. And besides; designing your DLC off of your game in its EA status is a *terrible* idea.",2

If we went by the proper technical descriptions of release stages, even Minecraft isn't technically ""launched"", since it isn't feature locked and they are still adding content to the game. That is supposed to be in the Alpha stage.

Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"Three main reasons:

* First, the player base is much smaller, therefore it's safe to say that the few people actually playing it are pretty big fans of the game and thus the kind of people who wouldn't complain about this kinda thing anyway.
* Secondly, even if they did rage about it there is much lower chance of it being seen anyway as it's not a popular game, anyone can tell that if something isn't as popular, people's opinions on it won't matter nearly as much and the opinions won't be seen as much, that's just basic news stuff.
* Thirdly, there is a huge pricing difference between the two, ARK base price is £23 and the DLC is another £15 on top of that, you're paying almost a AAA game price at this point for an unfinished game and it's DLC, whereas the other game is less for the game and DLC (£21) than ARK's base game, small amounts of money is gonna get cried about a lot less.
* Fourth, have you actually looked at the reviews of said dlc? 25% of the reviews are already bad which is pretty bad considering there is only 40 total reviews, getting a pretty mediocre % with such a small player base is pretty damn bad, as it basically says that 1/4 of your dedicated players even hate the dlc.
* Fifth, the size of the DLCs is pretty different, the one you linked is a pretty small thing, should have been part of the base game but probably didn't take them too long to put together and pump out for the cash in but at the same time is just a small bonus thing that doesn't actually affect the gameplay, the ARK one is meant to be a pretty big DLC that locks previously promised content behind a new paywall while the DLC is also pretty damn big so many will easily see it as them working on the DLC instead of finishing the game and adding stuff to the DLC that they should have gotten with the base game.
* Finally, the game you mentioned isn't late coming out of early access on top of everything else, which leaves a pretty sour taste in the mouth before pulling this shit on the people, as someone else said, ARK was promised to release June 2016, but didn't, the one you linked has just an early 2017 release date, not even a set time.

I could go on but I'm sure you get the main ideas by now as to why there's such a disparity in the outrage.",1

Early Access game 'ARK: Survival Evolved' suffered 16% rating drop with the release of paid DLC.,943,"The thing about Ark, is a lot of people pay them to rent servers to play on. They have their whole own server farm thing you can rent space on just for the game, so you don't have to run a server yourself. An actual maintenance cost, for dedicated teams to keep going on, 24x7.

Right now, the game is at its 24-hour peak (early in the afternoon), and is still climbing. Since launch, it's only lost about 60% of its peak player base (80k to 35k on average). The game has remained a strong seller on Steam any time it has a big content patch, even if they don't push a sale out for it.

In short: They're not hurting for money. Even after losing a 40 Million dollar lawsuit. They still have a warchest that can pay for a long time to come, and very stable income.

Even their community managers on the steam forum thought the expansion would be free, would be an extension of the core gameplay (AS IT IS!), and basically function as the entire endgame content after ascending from the main island. Instead, you now need to PAY for the other half of the game, in something that hasn't even left Alpha status (still adding core gameplay mechanics, only doing bugfixing and optimizations when they're high urgency and blocking).

They had 2 other expansions, both of them starting out as mod overhauls and both of them being released as free. The developers were even hired on and maintaining their mods is their primary job. Now, we have the ARK developers turning around and showing that they split their dev team into fractions, doing up the console launch, doing up the expansion internally, and they still haven't even officially pushed the game into Beta status, yet alone to 1.0. And that's on top of any other projects they've decided to do as spinoffs.

And to top it off, here's some actual numbers: http://steamspy.com/app/346110 - 3.5 million users, at 30 dollars a pop. Even if Steam were to take 1/3 of the sale price, and then adjust for sales, they've brought in 50-70 Million dollars, just in sales, for themselves.",7

Yes, and again, I think you are missing the distinction. However you feel about the game is cool, you do you. But the developer is calling this an alpha stage, the game has not launched, and is still part of Steam's Early Access program.

The distinction between alpha and continued support after release aren't arbitrary. Diablo 2 isn't an easy access/alpha game just because Blizzard released some new stuff a few months back.",4

People have certainly played the game for a very long time, but to find out a whole slew of new content (with the corresponding crapload of development time/money) went into a new expansion while updates and fixes for the base game were pushed back for months has left a rightfully sour taste in many players' mouths.

Not unlike the debacle that was No Man's Sky, there are a great number of things they could have done differently that would have prevented the backlash and even got them overall praise despite releasing the expansion during early access (particularly if there hadn't been a very long period of time where the base game was essentially ignored while the expansion was worked on), but they did it this way and the outrage should not be surprising, it was a shitty move on all counts.

They've been on this content and new gamemode kick for a long time, and while they passed most of it off as free DLC I think they just realized that bug fixing and optimization is boring, hard work, and new content is fun to add and fun to talk about.  It doesn't help that they've built up a ridiculous amount of technical debt by following this dumb content-first development meme.

The default settings are balanced for big tribes so it is really important to tweak your settings tho. DO NOT USE the ""singleplayer mode"" that tweak then for you. It will limit the difficulty to 0.2 instead of 1.0. Non-intuitively it will make the game a lot harder and grindy because it actually just lower the dinos levels, with lower level dinos you won't be able defeat bosses, it will be slower to gather resources and even pass through terrain because they will have less stamina, trust me on that one, keep your difficulty in 1.0.

 In Ark you can keep your base for a long time (months), in both PvE and PvP, it has a lot of pure PvE content and it's really great to play single player or with an group of friends in your own server. The PvP is a lot less optimized and accessible then Rust but  it can be fun if you know what you are doing. If you like creating your base and build an army of dinos to fight bosses, choose ark.   


In Rust it only makes sense to play in a PvP or RP server, there is no pure PvE content, only PvEvP.

I think Australia was one of the country's that it became a problem which forced them into making refunds if they wanted to operate in those country's.  I don't think it's something anyone at valve wanted to implement I think it was a forced issue and as a result that limited them during steam sales with what they could offer since people could buy a game and an hour later if it went cheaper they would then refund the game and buy it at the better price.  I'd like to know if steam sale revenue is up or down since introducing the refund system because I haven't bought more then 2 games at a time whereas before I'd end up with 10+ each sale and I've seen others say the same.,3

Ideally it would be less ""you must refund"" and more ""seems like the devs died. You *can* get your money back now.""

"PSA: You can all refund ""ARK: Survival evolved"" on steam no matter when you bought it or how many hours you've got played on it.",424,"See, they way I see it is a bit different.  As an early access buyer I am doing a favor to the developer by beta testing their game (something that people usually/used to be PAID for) in order to help them improve the quality of their product, while also giving them funds to accomplish this end.  Now, if a game doesn't live up to the hype, that's one thing.  Scams and other things?  Fair game.  In ARKs case they proved to spend resources on stuff like DLC and console releases for an unfinished game and eventually said ""Fuck it, release it as is"".  As a consumer I was promised they would release a full game, they failed to deliver on that part, so yeah I want my money back.

The way I see it is there's two options, refund it and get my money back, or live with it and stop using early access.  Being more careful with what games you buy in EA isn't enough, its still a gamble even with that, and EA should never be a gamble.  First option punished developers for shitty practices, second option punishes *all developers using early access*.  I see no reason why a system that could honestly do a lot of good for fledgling game developers should be tarnished by shitty practices when you can instead just punish those who choose to abuse the system?

ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,"Hey everyone,

We understand that the track record on Early Access games in general and in particular, Dinosaur games, isn't great. However we're set on being an exception. We want to be the team that does it right. The developers and the team behind ARK actually have quite a bit of veteran experience creating various well-known titles, so we're fully aware and committed as to what we're getting into! 

We plan to bring the game not only to PCs, but also to the console world. The expected release is Summer of 2016 and we'll definitely make sure to take advantage and use Early Access to the best of our ability to prepare for this. This coupled with the support we receive from our partners, we plan to make a great game. 

Hopefully you'll stick around and give us a shot and we can construct a fantastic world together.

Cheers,

Jat",127

ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,"Oh man that looks great! I loved the music on Ori and the Blind Forest too! It was one of the reasons I bought the game.

My biggest concern is that you will just throw cool things in without thinking too much of how it will affect the game as a whole. 

For example, the ability to ride all of the animals will get old fast. It needs to be a challenge to find a species that can be tamed, some being much more rare/harder to tame than others. Also, riding giant scorpions might not be the best idea.

Another thing is how common the creatures are. From what I saw, they are kind of scattered everywhere and there is one just about every place you step. This is fine for smaller creatures, but the larger animals should either be a bit harder to find, should travel in very condensed herds, or should be packed into one very small area of the map.

I know that might sound condescending, but please don't take it that way. I'm really excited for this game and I don't want it to fail. This is my vision of the game, if yours is different then ignore my opinion, make the game you want. All I want is to put it out there so you can consider it.

We've been busy on all fronts and I was going to tackle reddit after though it took longer than I would have liked haha.

We've officially set up the /r/playark subreddit if you guys would like to check it out.

As for other games, some of the team have worked on Uncharted, Primal Carnage to name a few dino-related ones. As for other games/titles, we want to keep the focus on the game, not on the team for now.

As for some of the previous games, Primal Carnage and Uncharted series are to name two, related to Dinos.

To the general public all Pterosaurs are basically referred to as pterodactyls....Hell most of the general public doesn't even know that Pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs. Most associate pterodactyls with the Pteranodon. By this reasoning it makes sense that they haven't used Quetzalcoatlus for the pterosaur mounts since most of the general public has no idea about them. So the decision makes sense.

ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,">is there something in particular you would like to be in the game?

I was more curious of how much in the trailer would be included in EA (mountable dinosaurs for example), so it's exciting that all of it will be!

I guess aside from that, I'd be interested in what server options would be available (I heard LAN mode will be available at some point, which is a huge plus for me as I play a lot of coop games with my wife). 

One more question, if you could reveal this at this point. How does ARK handle dying? Is it like DayZ / The Forest where you die, respawn, and run back to pick up your equipment, or is it a more or less punishing system? 

Thanks for answering the questions! ",1
ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,"Something I'd like to see, which is really a specific feature that could be reasonably put off till a later date, would be giving certain dinosaurs different utilities and weaknesses upon being tamed. 

Large herbivores could carry a caravan style group of people, with the largest ones being somewhat of moving fortresses but they would be slow and vulnerable to attack if not properly defended (possibly by mounted archers and spearmen.)

Pterasaurs would be the ultimate mobility mount, but have a complete lack of combat ability besides dropping a small cache of bombs. And they'd be very easy to kill, so evasive maneuvers and practicing flight skills are a must.

Bipedal predators would definitely be the war horses while armored quadropeds would be similar to siege engines and excel at destroying man made structures, but neither would tolerate carrying cargo.

others like deinosuchus could be employed as body guards for the herbivore convoys due to them being rugged and strong, but not too fast.

ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,"> What ever happened to a beta version?

Still valid as far as I know. Plenty of high profile games are so broken on release that one might just consider then to be some late beta build. Assassins Creed anyone?

> Early access is just a beta that you pay for, unless there's something I'm missing. 

True that, though like in the days of old, if game breaking bugs bother you, sit tight and wait for a stable, finished and polished release. Paying for early access is just as voluntarily as participating in beta testing.

> Why not just do what hardline did and have a beta for a short period. 

Hardline is part of the Battlefield machinery, which have the near bottomless pockets of Electronic Arts, an already established brand/franchise and the developer team of DICE behind it. Money pays the bills, the brand has an established fanbase and experienced developers with multiple titles in the same genre under their belt smooth makes things a lot easier.

Those 10 guys sitting in a garage? They don't have that kind of experience (first title for many of them), money (might have to borrow from parents/relatives, sell the car etc) or connections. And on top of that, they're starting their own brand/IP from scratch. They're called indie developers because they are independent from the big, medium and even small publishers. 

> I can't think of another industry where you pay for early access to an unfinished product.

I'd argue you'd take a similar chance when jumping on something very new, untested. Let's say you're the 5th owner of a Tesla car in the world. Very few have driven this car before and the few that have, have only done so a couple of weeks longer than you. Will it hold? How's the build quality? Battery? Engine performance? Recharge time? Even if the first generation Tesla cars don't live up to the hype, what about the second, third or forth generation? Technology improves over time, right?

Of course you can sit on the fence and wait it out. There is nothing wrong with showing disapproval for the Early Access business model. At the end of the day, it is your money. You're free to spend it however you see fit.",1
ARK: Survival Evolved Announcement Trailer,453,"Amen to raptors, but again I'm fine with the Rex because they can't even get wrist pronation correct so I don't expect them to get the texture of the Rex correct when we don't have skin impressions of them yet. 

I've personally liked when people draw tyrannosaurus with a 'mane' of emu feathers as opposed to full body. Also when we look at the scale of tyrannosaurus relatives that were feathered compared to Rex, I think that leaves a little room for creative license. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, the rexes we have found protofeathers on were both Chinese (I want to say they both have long in their name) and were very early cretaceous which gives millions of years for tyrannosaurus Rex to have lost them and the lineage is more like cousin, as opposed to direct ancestor.

It's taken me about a year of slider tweaking to figure out settings to suit my style of gameplay so this is a tough one to answer. This website helped [http://www.gamewalkthrough-universe.com/Walkthroughs-Guides/Ark-Survival-Evolved/Game-Server-Customization/default.aspx](http://www.gamewalkthrough-universe.com/Walkthroughs-Guides/Ark-Survival-Evolved/Game-Server-Customization/default.aspx)   

I'm not a big fan of chopping trees and rocks for hours on end to build things so I turn rates way up and weight capacity way up. Setting alarm clocks to wake up and feed video game animals is also a big no so tweak the snot out of that. 

It's definitely an amazing game but keep in mind, no matter what settings you use, the game finds a way to make things ragey difficult at times.",11

"After nearly 6 years and nearly 1500 hours, I have finally completed the base game of ARK: Survival Evolved. Here is my trophy room as proof",513,"Here’s what is changed from the default single-player settings as fast as I can remember:
Difficulty 1.0
XP Multiplier 3.0
Taming Speed 2.0
Dino Harvesting Damage 3.2

Lay Egg Interval 0.5
Mating Interval 0.06

Harvest Health 2.0
Resources Respawn Period 0.5

Settings like hatching and maturing probably don’t need to be that high in most cases; I only did it so it didn’t take absolutely forever to breed a 20-rex army.
As for tactics, the only things I can really think of off the top of my head is to have lots of storage so you can save most resources, and take lots of ammo into the caves.",2

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,Cod was pretty bad but I have to mention a game that I had a love/hate relationship with. There used to be a free to play game called defiance. I loved the game but that was after muting/blocking about 500 ppl. The game was plagued by modders/glitchers. Ppl running around PvP using aimbots and one shot killing ppl with an insta-spawn kill glitch. Then had the nerve to teabag and talk trash in the main chat box after they went 75/0 using an aimbot and lifesteal glitch. The amount of racists and homophobes was ridiculous. The game became literally dangerous when they found out a couple pedophiles were using the game to groom children. Total nightmare. The servers would crash every 20 minutes from ppl using a game breaking glitch to purposely overload the server and players would have to email the dev team to restart the server. Was an awesome game if you ignored pvp and turned off the main chat box. They shut it down a few years back and I actually felt relief when it was over even though I invested years into that game.

I like the game somewhat but enough encounters with the toxic shitbags in general and on the discord had me turned entirely off. If you aren't hearing slurs in the general game chat of the exclusionary culture in their discord that demands 2000+ hours to join a basic ass group for an inconsequential task....idk. 

The problem is the community but imo, the game designers are entirely culpable and the way they designed the game brought in a toxic mix of children and families who want to play a fun cartoony pirate game and a try hard elitism because of the way the game is structured around time sinks, PvP, and preying on the weak.

A lot of the stuff is pretty tame on the surface.

Nazi Germany, US slavery-era plantations, high schools where players are randomly selected to be the active shooter. I'm pretty sure Auschwitz roleplay was on there at one point. 

Within the not-morally-apalling servers, things get confusingly competitive - to an antisocial degree. Most everybody feels the need to be a badass crime kingpin, so bending every rule to its max and skirting around any unnecessary and time-wasting interaction with others is a must when grinding certain tasks pays more.

When I first started people were complete assholes, acting like I should already have years experience in MMOs and have read every wiki guide, half the time it was more stressful than fun just because I don't like when people are mad at me, and you better believe they're watching your stats and will tell you if you're not doing something perfect, it's just not fun to play like that. Nostalgia for the Final Fantasy series and the solo activities kept me going, once I did all that and got my fancy weapons that took months of work, and did every dungeon through endwalker at least once, I turned off the game and cancelled my subscription and have never played another game online since, even Monster Hunter and I've played thousands of hours of that series, all solo.

The gameplay mechanics are very satisfying and the content comprises of pretty much everything you can think of in the Star Wars universe. Every map, character ect you can imagine. It get updated regularly and has infinite playability. 

The most toxic *base game* (excluding community mods) that I've played? Probably one of the older CoD games like MW2 or BO1.

It was ridiculously callous and toxic to treat it like a joke and commit a mass slaughter, and it was even worse for me when those outside the issue upheld the fact that it happened and blamed everyone BUT the people who did it. Just pure meanness. I've also never seen another MMO (just personally haven't, not saying it's gospel) that was as addicting for so many of my friends as this one.

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"I know there's the usual suspects, like CoD, LoL, etc.

But I'm gonna go old school, and nominate EVE Online.

The game,  by design, is incredibly toxic, and cheating, scamming and ganking is not only not against ToS, it is actively ENCOURAGED. The ethos of the game is basically ""do onto others, before they do onto you"". Because they WILL, it's only a matter of time. In any other MMO, if you see another player, it's a toss-up as to what is going to happen. Maybe they will be a dick, maybe not. In EVE, if another ship lands on your grid, you better be running, because it's never good news. In fact, the moment local starts spiking (ships entering your solar system), most people are already hitting their warp drive and heading for a deep space safe spot where they can only be found with active probes, and those take some time, and you can always bounce between deep safes which will buy you time. Because those people that just spiked local are never there to give you free cookies and leave peacefully. And with these kinds of people, things like racism and homophobia are EXTREMELY casual, nobody bats an eyelash. I mean yeah, you can report it, and maybe they'll get a short suspension, but that's as far as it went, after a while you just don't even bother.

The main difference though is that CoD, LoL, etc., are full of kids and/or dumb people. You sort of expect this kind of thing from those kinds of people, and can sometimes shrug it off. But EVE is a slow, methodical, thinking-man's game with incredible complexity. Most of the player base are adult, and many of them professionals. So you'd expect higher quality from a community with a demographic like that. But it attracted the vilest people.

Now, this is not to say EVE does not have some genuinely amazing people and friendly corps. It does. Just like every other popular game. But that's an exception rather than the rule.",2

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"Now, hear me out on this: Team Fortress 2.

It's a stone-cold dead in the ground game, but there are still so many players who insist that ""there's an big update on the way, just you wait! This game will go on forever!"" They make multi-hour long video essays about weapon balance nuances, map trivia, and patch notes history. They will wax philosophy and make verbal love to every singular aspect of the game (besides mini-crits and the phlog).

All of that would be fine, just quirks of a community, but it comes at the cost that near every single one I've talked or listened to is **VERY** defensive of the game and at even a *whiff* of competition or comparison they will flip the fuck out. Somebody says they think Overwatch had more variety? Fuck you, casual, you're outta here. Somebody says that the game is too hard to pick up with lobbies full of 'ten year veterans'? Fucking scrub, fuck off back to baby land!

They do that passive-aggressive shit where they bully people for picking certain classes. ""Oh, you're going Pyro? Haha, that's utter trash, ha ha, *juuuuust kidding*"" and will dogpile most anyone who plays as the medic and flip out if they didn't intuitively pick up on the 300 IQ plan that they hatched up for jumping right into the choke point and soloing the enemy team.

I'm sure, absolutley positive, that people are going to say that they've never, *ever* played with people like that in all their time playing the game, and it's actually the most supportive and cheerful community out there, and to these people I would like to ask how it is that you evidently have the staggering amount of luck it takes to stroll through a rainstorm without getting wet?",1

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"I mean easily The Last of Us and MOBAs, but I wanna give a special nod to the Fallout community. They are toxic specifically in the fact that they can't stand the video games they're fans of. Fallout has been owned by Bethesda for longer than it was owned by the OG creators, there are more Bethesda Fallout games than there are Black Isle/Interplay/Obsidian Fallouts, and they still just HATE anything Bethesda does with the game. Never mind the fact that Fallout would have been dead if Beth didn't pick it up, and when Black Isle DID own it they were putting out stuff that involved Bawls Guarana and Slipknot soundtracks. [Big tiddies and tribal tattoos](https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/124832-fallout-brotherhood-of-steel-xbox-screenshot-through-dialogue.jpg). The fan base at the time had already basically given up on the franchise by the time Bethesda bought it, and Van Buren was canceled in favor of Brotherhood of Steel 2 (and increasing their console presence overall) so the Slipknot vibe was the official one going forward. All of this is neglected and the new Fallout game is always hot trash to them. Until a new Fallout comes out, then the last one was an underrated gem and the new Fallout sucks. You can even see this to this very day, the narrative around Fallout 4 shifted on /r/fallout around when 76 dropped. Suddenly 4 was a much better game according to them, and the idea that it didn't deserve all of the hate is commonly very popular.

I feel like ""toxic to the very game you're fans of"" deserves a special bit of attention, The Last of Us is bad for it but Fallout is the grandfather of ""fuck this game I love"" culture.",1

I Play League of Legends and have done so since it first came.The rampant toxicity in that game due to peoples genral lack of empathy and understanding when someone does not play the game exactly how they think it should be played is amazing.

I've dealt with people who have had a promising professional career lined up for them, new contract signed with top e-sports organizations at ages 17-20 and they still burn it all by being toxic/recist in-game and recieving full bans due to their behaviour.

I've played World of Warcraft PvP both within bigger groups of players and in the open world situations and it's ridiculous sometimes how people simply thrive from seeing someone go ballistic and just flame/grief people for almost no reason.

Sometimes you’d team up with people until it came time to extract gear, then the fighting started.

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"Didn't play ark, but I had to quit Lol after a few games because it was so toxic. 

Even in the games titled ""beginners welcome"" and a buddy teaching me it wasn't worth the hatred so many people had for newbies. On top of that, the game is complicated and has a ton of nuances that are hard apparently absolutely crucial to your team mates ability to play the game.",3

Box tribe invasions. 

The game mechanics of jumping servers allowed for financially and racially motivated, coordinated attacks on OC servers.

It got to the point many just gave up, can't be awake at 3am night after night. Most just walked away.",2
Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"Ark/Atlas are especially bad, due to the completely inept moderation by the devs, who refuse to take any meaningful action against the worst subsets of the community. The number of times I saw flat out Neo-Nazi recruiting on the official servers was absolutely unacceptable.

They devs have also not learned their lesson on how the cultural differences between Western, and South East Asian, players led to these outlying groups kicking off literal race wars on the official servers.

To top it all off, Ark and Atlas were both built on work that was illegally taken by ex-employees of a previous company, and led to a $40M lawsuit. And their parent company, Snail Games, has been linked directly to cheating/hacking tribes on both Ark and Atlas’s official servers. Going so far as to roll back servers to prevent the destruction of their own bases, and then taking action against those who attacked them.",1

Biggest issue is toxic smurfs. They need to do better with that because if you're in a ranked match against smurfs, you better hope they're on their way down and not up so they will ff. And if they're on your team, you're SOL.

Also you shouldn't get a demotion when your teammate is afk or even leaves a match. Maybe unless you're partied to dissuade smurfs. But I tell you nothing will tilt me more than fighting for my life in a 2v1 and then have the demotion afterwards.",18
Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,">Rocket League sucked for awhile.

Still does. Recently got back into it, and the only chat I've seen is on lower ranks (bronze - gold). Once you hit plat, everyone just shuts up, and you cannot tell if they are actually listening to your quick chat commands (I got it, go for it, etc).

Its been replaced by the overwhelming forfeit requests after going down by a single goal early in the game. It gets really annoying, round after round, even if you end up winning.",2

But then, there's LoL people mentioned. It has to be the winner (IMO) for a community with the most toxic learning curve? There aren't many more brutally abusive games I can think of to be a beginner as LoL.

And for the, well, I don't know anymore but when I played Overwatch (OG season 1-8) and a bit in the teens. OW seemed to always be the most toxic to females. Holy moly the hate people have for gamer gals in OW that I remember.

So yeah! We need like, Toxic Oscars 🤭",8

At least HOTS has the whole team level up together.

Note: I'm not saying that HOTS doesn't have toxic players, just that my experience is far fewer of them exist than other mobas.",92

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"Here here. I started playing League back in 2010 when it was still in open beta and was super involved with the community at the time. It was a small bunch of people and you'd run into the same regulars all the time, including the devs and other Riot employees. For a while, I had Pendragon, Phreak, and Riot Morello on my friends list and played with them from time to time, it was a fun little game that had a lot of potential.

Then it exploded in popularity after release and the swarms of unwashed masses flooded the game. Riot was extremely slow in addressing the growing toxicity and they let it fester for so long that it eventually became a part of the game's core identity. Now, you have the enemy team muted by default and your own team will flame you into oblivion with death threats and racial slurs any time you, they, or anyone else makes a mistake. It's awful.

I stopped playing regularly almost 6-7 years ago and stopped completely about a year ago. I only played it for so long because of my IRL friends and our attachment to the early days, but that game is long dead.",2

It's not even like I'm a bad player or anything, its just the community is terrible.  I really liked the game, but it was too much of a pain to play without a pre-built team.",2

But it's generally a good idea to put in some hours in casual and gungames before going into a 5v5, to get a feel for the game without any real consequences to dying.

Meanwhile, the people that actually paid for it are mostly happy with it and are just waiting patiently for it to leave development hell.

On one hand, I get it - the game's been in development forever and they've spent a metric fuck ton of money. I just don't understand why randoms on reddit have such an invested interest in hating it and calling it a scam. Feature creep and incompetence are certainly fair things to complain about, but that doesn't make something a scam. Alas, expecting any degree of nuance from the reddit hivemind is a lost cause.",6

That community, along with rust, will legit call off work, cancel any school plans, girlfriend, and daily life tasks….just to offline raid you or camp your base for a week straight, in groups of 5-20 for 8-16 hours a day. Until you leave the server.

I’ve legit seen, experienced, and there are videos on YouTube showcasing the lengths these kids will go.

I played on a dayz server called rearmed and there are multiple clans on there that have 24/7 raid surveillance. A dedicated player with no job or life commitment that is on for 16-20 hours a day. I won’t say the clan names but there were 4-5 of them. 

There are dedicated players in both games (rust / dayz) that their jobs are to name change, personality change, and befriend other players just to steal all their shit and run them off the server. 

I’ve been told by a 30 man Zerg on dayz their goal is to ensure that you quit the server. They do not want you to have a good time. Insane.

Otherwise you're stuck with bottom of the barrel people. That's how I've been playing these kinds of games. A select group of friends that we have on a small server, anyone we bring in for a ""season"" (i.e. whatever we're playing at the moment on the server) that doesn't fit in just doesn't get invited back. Might come across as a bit harsh but if someone is making the game unfun for a portion of the group then that's not something we want. Especially since the group is roughly 7 people at the moment, any one person starting shit influences the experience a lot.

Example would be a season we did of Minecraft, had a community base/townhall where we had an agreement for everyone to build it up first as a pool of resources and other communal storage and facilities. Then when we got to building individual houses/projects you could pull from the communal resources with the expectation that you'll contribute back what you took or something else. Had a guy ask to join, not contribute but continually taking resources, started goading people into dueling him because he beelined getting netherite whilst everyone else was just enjoying building stuff and going on small adventures, kept starting building projects and dropping them within 5 minutes because he got bored leaving the area people were building their very aesthetic projects looking like a junkyard, and so on.

Some people downvote misinformation. Some people downvote opinions they don't like. Some people downvote facts they don't like. Some people downvote just out of spite.

I think one of the few good things Facebook has done from the very start was not having dislikes. They're just contextually useless on social networks at scale and do more to spread toxicity than to give any worthwhile feedback.

>LoL counts on moments of extreme excitement, and extreme frustration and boredom

These two statements seem at odds with each. Personally, I played it off and on for almost 8 years from the original open beta, and I think the 2nd statement is much more accurate. Even playing with a 5 man group of close friends with a healthy mindset, the game is dull half the time, and frustrating the other half of the time, with like a tiny sliver of fun one game in 20.

For summoner's rift, the meta has been stagnant for years and it's either a horrible landslide win / loss from how snowbally the game is, or nothing happens for 25 minutes and suddenly one team wins out of nowhere.

The champions are so wildly unbalanced and the damage numbers are so overtuned that the actual fights take less than 10 seconds and most of that time is spent CC'd so you aren't even controlling your character.

Truly the only redeeming quality of League of Legends is the art, and that's only because they poached the crew of Dawngate after EA shut down the project. Everything else about it is a monumental dumpster fire.",1

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"RUST would like to have a word.

But yes. All online games have toxicity innately in them. Because, we, as players of games are all unique individuals. Shove everyone in a room with the guise of anonymity and you'll see some pretty out there actions/reactions/hot takes given because of the principle of ""they don't know me so I can say whatever I want without fear."" But on the transverse of that you'll also see some really humble/amaxing actions/reactions happen. You'll see folks who might have varying backgrounds create their own social community and in turn slap down the toxic/edgy behavior, and slowly you'll see room dynamics shift one way or the other. But there will always be toxicity whether apparent or not while looking in.

Because the most vocal side of a game tends to be the toxicity, you might encounter a toxic player one match, then have a few without said toxicity, only to run into it again later on.

No game that is online; heck even offline games aren't free of toxicity; because someone will always say/do something to get a rise out of you as a person; it's more prevalent in Online since it's more of a forced cycle of potential matches/seasons/whatever; offline it's more related towards speedrunners/Lets Plays/Guides/Streams where you'll more often see toxicity within comments more directed at you and your actions in a game.

So no one game has a most toxic community, as a lot share overlaps; folks who play CS:GO might play DBD/RUST/ETC so they take it there; someone who plays WoW might take it to OW/Hearthstone/Whatever game they feel meshes with them. You only really /notice/ toxicity in abundance when you play specific games that share a wide overlap of a core game idea (PVP/Leaderboards) where folks can ""flex"" their e-peens on folks and treat them like shit because once again anonymity. Granted I feel in my older age that the vast majority of the extreme fringe cases of a toxic player is the younger generations trying to just be edgy; let's be fair here, we as gamers probably have seen/heard/said ourselves everything that a teenager today might be spouting at us; and I'm sure you can remember being just as cringe about it.

That's my TED Talk on it. Point is, you'll always encounter toxicity, it might seem more apparent in some over others but that is solely based on how long you play a game for. If you play Hello Kitty Online Adventure for 2hrs you might not see much toxic behavior compared to if you played WoW for 16hrs straight. It's all about the amount of time played in a given session that will weigh the scales in this case.",40

We've needed another game to rotate to lately, and I think Infinite would be good, but it's crazy once people have a bad taste in their mouth for something, they won't go back to it. That's primarily why I was upset at the poor release; I knew people wouldn't give it a second chance.",10

The game has a ton of female, multicultural, lgbtq+ representation, all in a way that is very positive and welcoming.  The top players, when they do content creation, are mostly focused on teaching and helping newer people.  TBH the literal best online community I’ve ever seen hands down.

Most Toxic Gaming Community???,670,"In this one case it was part of a YouTuber's Discord, group of us played the games he plays for his channels together. (Steel Division/Warno) 

After a while, someone wanted to play The Forest so asked if any of us were interested in playing it with him. From there we had about 5 people playing it together? Then afterwards we branched out to other games with the same general group of people. Of course some games were less popular or the timing wasn't right, so the numbers have gone up and down over time. e.g. With Valheim and Raft it was 4 of us, with project zomboid it was 6, with space engineers it was 9. Other random games as well like borderlands or divinity that had groups of 4 playing them; always different people due to interest.

I think a lot of it is just reaching out within a community that would hold a similar interest to yourself. Maybe start with a game that's co-op and a couple of friends who are available, then start pulling in people who express interest as you progress through games. Of course, this requires someone within the group to be the ""bad guy"" and curate whoever is coming in. 

Some times it just feels a bit dickish, but it is something someone has to do if you wish for your gaming experience to not be a diceroll for the lowest bidder every time you log on. Usually try to suss out the opinions of the other guys who've become part of the group before we make a decision as well, with the poorly behaved player I referenced in the previous comment, there was quite a bit of unhappiness within the group as well.

"For anybody who hasn't heard yet, Ark: Survival Evolved is a new survival MMO with dinosaurs. Here's some screenshots of my settlement.",68,"Sadly this doesn't really go over the main issues that currently plague the game. From what I've viewed you're either playing on a private server or a PVE one, this is important to state outright as an official server, a base like this can't exist. (for long anyway.)

Here's a current 7/15/2015 review of the game, written by me who has roughly 300hrs chalked up to the game, that will have some details about some of the unadvertised things in game.


-----
PVE Content
=
-----
While the game IS fun, it's current content is about a weeks worth of play time with a decent sized group (or 10 weeks if you play solo and have to loot all the engrams you don't have.). The end game content thus far are one  boss battle, and pvp. You'll build a base, stockpile resources, kill the boss then basically be wondering what to do. Because of how resources work in the game, it's EXTREMELY hard to amass resources to build, and even with a determination to build and nothing but the grind might get to you.

On the upside, this is subject to being changed and new content is being regularly added in forms of new dinos to hunt and tame! Which means if anything, if you wanted to enjoy a good survival dinosaur game, the content is regularly coming in and is pretty good.  From this view alone, I'd recommend the game. However...

--------

OFFICIAL Servers/PVEVP
=
-------
If you join an official server (not the strictly PVE ones), you'll instantly notice that it's futile to try and strike it solo, or with a small tribe. It might work for a few days, but at some point a lvl 67 player with a rex is going to come and trash your shit, because that's their end game content. They have nothing else to do.

However on this end game content, right now the community is using the one strategy that will always outright win over any other, assaulting a tribe while their players are offline. 

As if this wasn't bad enough, the tribes dedicated to just wrecking everyone else will outsource their tribe members from different countries, meaning they'll always have active members, unless you have friends who are interested in the game in other countries, you're going to have a huge vulnerable period where they will come and kill you and all your progress and you won't be able to do shit about it. 

The Devs think that adding some traps will make this less critical, but in reality the traps and suggestions they have thrown out will not even remotely prevent an assault, and doesn't help tribes who all live in the same timezone.  

Now assuming you're still standing and can fight another tribe (Not an offline one, that's basically fighting a wall.) You'll encounter the next horrible problem. The official online servers, are horribly desync'd. I have joined many, and every single time I tried the servers were just horribly desync'd. Guns and Arrows in PVP suffer the most from this, Melee is basically just holding down the left click button and hoping you spear something. 

This is also bad for balance because some dinos that SHOULD be intimidating and terrifying to fight, don't land their hits. This is particularly critical to some of the dinos that ARE extremely strong and make great mounts, and should be hell to tame, but because of the sync issues, they are knocked out without much of a fight. This is also a shame for PVE because sync'd dinos make for an intense PVE experience!  

This issues extends to raptors, rexes, spinos, megalodons, bats (Oh god the bats.) ect; In contrast if you play on a low latency server or local, you'll notice these fuckers will more often than not just totally wreck you unless you know what you're doing. (Especially the bats.)

-----

Exploits that are used regularly
=
------

Supply Drops
=
------
The current meta is to grab all the supply drops for their ""Upgraded"" Features. This shit can get crazy as the highest i've seen are weapons with a 50% extra damage bonus. 

Because the map is static, as are the drops for the supplies. Big tribes can set up bases and sentries to deny smaller tribes and new comers any access while reaping all the benefits for themselves. Before you might of been able to be sneaky and steal it via flying mounts, but since the patch that made ranged weapons do x4 damage to birds, you're more prone to being shot out of the sky.

------

Area Denial
=
------


Area denial in this game is so easy it's sickening. If you want, you can build metal foundations in mountains, caves, ect to entirely block resources from spawning. This can be done almost literally anywhere and it takes a LARGE sum of resources to remove metal foundations, it's outright impossible for non metal based tribes to deal with this, considering this can be placed on metal mining locations, you can make it so only YOUR tribe is metal grade if you're sneaky and fast enough.  If a group was dedicated enough, they could literally block off all the metal access from the map, block caves with metal structures, and become an uncontested super power. 

------

Steam Server View
=
--------

As previous stated earlier, you can use steam to see if enemies you want to assault are even online, this is so horrible because it denies half the fun planning an attack, which is recon. Why bother reconing when you can just KNOW when your enemy is offline?

--------
Is the game worth buying?
=
------

I'd say yes, but you'd have to also know exactly what you're buying into. If you were looking forward to making your own jurassic park on a PVE server and showing your creative flair, this game will probably be worth a lot.

If the PVP i described is enticing and what you're looking for in a game, than for sure it's worth buying, although keep in mind it's in alpha and everything is prone to change. 

If you wanted to have giant land wars on mounts using guns/pikes/explosives for epic battles in PVP. I would have to say, don't buy the game quite yet, keep an eye on the forums and see if the current meta is ever changed. Otherwise your efforts will be for not due to offline raids, and you'll lose out on your money AND be extremely livid.",1

"For anybody who hasn't heard yet, Ark: Survival Evolved is a new survival MMO with dinosaurs. Here's some screenshots of my settlement.",68,"I'd personally vouch for the gameplay right now. Depending on what you're after there's a lot for all kinds of people.

I've got about 80 hours in the game and that has been completely alone on a PVE server. I work M-F and can't be on to defend my house / tame collection from someone who wants to pike my tames through a wall for the ""lols"". With that said I know a lot of people who are in big tribes on PVP servers and LOVE it. 

There's a little bit of rubberbanding from time to time but overall it's very manageable and enjoyable. You can even create a single player world and control the server settings like tame speed, rate of XP gain (you acquire levels on your character), and things like that.

I've definitely gotten my moneys worth and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The game has been live since the beginning of June and you can see [patch notes here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/594820656447032287/). The developers have literally worked their asses off from day one and are hands down the best early access title / team I've ever seen. I'd even go so far as to compare them to Squad, the shop that did Kerbal Space Program.

One thing I will forewarn you about that I did experience early was the loading time into the servers for me was terrible, in excess of 5-6 minutes. Moving the game over to my SSD fixed it completely and it's now a matter of 20 seconds. They released a patch a few weeks back that was supposed to have major client loading time improvements but I have not tested the performance on my spindle drive since. I do know that not everyone on spindle drives was experiencing the issue though. The game will also take just a bit of tweaking to up your framerate for the better, this is another area though where the devs have made tremendous strides in a months time and they're currently waiting on NVIDIA to release a set of beta (and later stable) drivers which should be another 20-40% FPS boost on nvidia cards.

So in short, I feel it's worth a shot if you're curious, especially with steams refund policy.",2

As for the graphics, the first screenshot was taken on medium settings at the end of last month. It was almost unplayable on my gaming laptop at the time. The optimizations since have made it a lot more playable and they continue to pump out updates basically every day. I admit I set the graphics to epic and had like 10 or less FPS to get these screenshots, but playing on medium or low doesn't look really horrible and is a lot more stable.",1
"For anybody who hasn't heard yet, Ark: Survival Evolved is a new survival MMO with dinosaurs. Here's some screenshots of my settlement.",68,"Ark plays out differently due to the pacing being slower. I don't play Rust but I play Ark, and from what I've seen Rust has a lot more raiding/PvP in the wild, but Ark usually makes people inclined to be friendly with other players because of the amount of effort required to gather resources as you head to late game, amount of food for taming etc.

The taming mechanic certainly distinguishes it from Rust too. Having the ability to have animals that provide different roles really diversifies the game and provides benefits to players who are willing to take on different dinos.

Then there's the exploration. Ark's world is really stunning, there's vast forests, lakes, cave systems, huge climbable mountains, coves, reefs, underwater air pockets/caves, beaches, cliffs etc. ",2

This is misleading. There are official PvE servers with full support from the devs and just as large player base.

"For anybody who hasn't heard yet, Ark: Survival Evolved is a new survival MMO with dinosaurs. Here's some screenshots of my settlement.",68,"Where was any of that stated in my post? I said if you join an official server (Not the strictly PVE ones). Official servers are PVEVP(most common, not listed as PVEVP but rather ""Official server [number]), hardcore PVP and PVE have their module listed specifically.

I also did not say PVE meant softcore, I said it had limited content vs the amount a PVP player will have. PVE right now is only ""softcore"" due to desync, the dinosaurs are a challenge to fight and get around (Unless you're on a mount) as long as the latency is low and they can land blows on you. Which was also mentioned in this post.  

What i DID say was that because of how the community in official servers (not the PVE ones.) work, they'd have already demolished your base and killed your dinos, which is an important thing for someone buying the game to know prior. 

However I didn't cover the amount of grief that can occur in a PVE server, where unlike PVP the malice is assaulting you offline, in PVE it's doing area denial for shits and giggles AND not having the ability to remove their structures, at all. Because in PVE you can't hurt other players structures, regardless of any modifiers (Such as, blocking a resource.)

All of that is moot on a private server with an active admin however. 

I'm unsure what you're trying to say. More importantly, did you even bother to read the post? ",-1

You have to knock them out with blunt weapons, meaning your fists or a slingshot, and they will be attacking you while you try to do that, then once they're out you have to continually supply them with food and feed them the right kind of berries to keep them asleep.

Once you have access to narcotics it becomes a lot easier, and is then just time consuming. Larger and higher level dinosaurs can take hours to tame.

That's why /u/slushysnowman was recommending you get a raptor and a trike to start with. Raptors are excellent for getting raw meat and trikes for berries. You can use the sleep inducing berries with spoiled meat to create narcotics which don't expire like raw berries and meat do, and are much more potent as well.",2

A bit rich, don't you think? You said in your comment that it 'seemed like' I was either on a private or PvE server, which indicates to me that *you* didn't read *my* submission before posting, yourself.... 

I did however, read your comment. 

I thought it was ok, but didn't focus on any of the smaller details of the game that make it unique from other survival games, and instead focused too much on the general aspects that are present in basically every PvP survival game. I think that your frustration over these player-influenced elements coloured your review of the game and doesn't give credit to the developers for all the improvements they have already made, instead only making vague remarks about waiting until things get better.

>Official servers are PVEVP(most common, not listed as PVEVP but rather ""Official server [number]), hardcore PVP and PVE.

For me, there is nothing like that anywhere in the server browser. I click on ""official"" in the filter, and it shows me, for example;

""The-OC-OfficialServer144""
""The-OC-PVE-OfficialServer166""

ect. No distinction other than PVE in the title.

>I also did not say PVE meant softcore

I did not say that you said that. You did make it sound like the PvE servers are not an official feature of the game and that playing on them is not the real thing, though.",1

Still, I lost a couple of my first thatch huts to rexes. Those fuckers are scary as hell. You need walls 4 high on flat ground to fully prevent them from being able to see over the top, ours are only 2-3 though because our tamed Dino's are quite high level and can beat most wild rexes out on the edge of the map where they're lower level.",0

The in game name is T rex, but if you read the dossier in your 'survivor profile', it's actually a Tyrannosaurus dominum, which is from the same genus as a T rex, but not the same species.

I must have misread 'dominum' in game and never checked again.",1

If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,Vin diesel played like 1000 hours of ark and was asked to be in tbe game. As for the other stuff i jave no idea.,9
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,Great so we get some shoe horned shitty celebrity cameo just what I want in my survival game lmao.,-15
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,"How do you know it's shoehorned in and he's not Rockwell or Gaius or one of the other people who left lore notes on the islands?

I mean he could be Gaius Nerva, Edmund Rockwell, John Dahkeya, or Rusty Stafford, etc....",5

If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,Yeah it's really weird to include a guy that played the game for a thousand hours to be in the game and he happens to be a celebrity. Nobody forced anyone therefore it's not shoehorned dummy. Start learning English.,3
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,He has no relevance to anything. Hence he was shoehorned in (1 : to force to be included or admitted) he has no relation to the game except he played it? I mean how many people have over 1000 hours in the game? Even I have it if they wanted to put someone in it use one of the many popular streamers that play their game don't shoehorn in a celebrity. Again Shoehorn 1 : to force to be included or admitted,3
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,"He's literally an actor, as long as his character lines up with the lore, it makes perfect sense to bring him in.

If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,You are not famous and you are not going to bring people into the game Therefore your thousand hours are a waste of time and a waste of your life like much of your life probably is at this point.

2: Vin Diesel is definitely not a c-list actor. He's a main character in a huge Marvel property, had an entire series on his back (Riddick and Fast and the Furious films),  has pretty solid Nerd following (between his gaming and his love of D&D). 

Sounds like you're just angry that they picked Vin Diesel and not your favorite Youtuber.",2
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,Not only am I not mad I am correct in saying he is shoehorned in for no reason. Also I thought you where leaving had to come back to defend your idol?,1
If you have played Ark Survival Evolved you know this feeling all too well,68,Never seen someone so mad about a cameo in a game. Especially one you called your game. Remember that? Like youre a dev for ark and ypu had any part in the decision making? And then you make fun of a celebrity noone cares about. I gave you a simple response and you chose to cry like a basement dwelling mommas boy. Done from here on out. Have fun not getting a reply.,2

So I respawned again and took about 3-4 steps before dying. After the 6th-7th time respawning, I was able to find a place where there wasn't anything trying to kill me. So I started chopping trees, and made a pickaxe. Cool. So I keep walking a ways, and all of the sudden I am attacked by a leech. Apparently the game gives you no way to remove the leech from your face when you are attacked, and you just have to walk around until you die from the leech face.

What is wrong with the hitbox? When you try to hit anything you miss and when they come to your hpuse they can just bite you through the walls of the house you just spent 5 hours making.

If you have the patience to spend the time learning and googling stuff it’s basicaly freaking infinite hours of escalating content,1
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,In what way if I may ask? Just got the game for free on steam and am thinking about downloading it. Reviews seem positive.,2
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"I couldn't get past the grind, die, lose everything, grind.... Loop",-1
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"I think it's a great game. We were the alpha tribe on several different servers. It was so taxing mentally. Then I did a modded ark called primal fear that is way better, once you figure out the game.

Pros:
Fun complex survival game
Lots of exciting dinosaurs
Dragons

Cons:
On normal settings you will die a billion times
On official pvp servers, people are mean. You will get your base and all your cool dinos killed without remorse or reason.
The game itself is not super explanatory so you have to either Google stuff, ask people or cheat to get certain things. Use Dododex app, that helps with taming.
The game also lags bad. It has glitches and problems. Bases will break things. Bugs about items, dinos and all sorts of things will break. The developers never gave a crap about the game. Kept adding dlc maps and other dumb things instead of making the game better",2
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,Sounds like pvp isn't for you...,0
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"Yes, a 3 year 10 server wide alpha tribe that didn't like PvP... Nothing about the lag, the glitches, the terrible programming and non-fixes.

Very helpful comment.",0
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,you legit complained about how people kill your stuff. yeah it's pvp. what do you exepct damn it?,0
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"Plus, on most servers that run full time, you have players who don't have jobs or other commitments who can play 18 hours a day which is hard to keep up with when you have a family, or a job, or anything else in life where you are contributing to society.

Needing to have players on at all times 24/7 in small or big tribes is difficult and taxing.

However, the game itself, and many well picked mods and server boosts can make it enjoyable for a long time to play.",1
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"Thanks for sharing that you've never played and you're just in chat bc you have nothing to do.

The game is not PVP first, then do other things. It is a boss centric game with PVP enabled servers. If you'd have played, you'd know that. Servers allow different levels of aggression. Some are all in, some are peaceful, some are in the middle.

Those who PVP first without cause on a generally peaceful server get wiped immediately. And those who treat others unfairly get wiped immediately.

PVP first all you want, but you will get hunted until you realize you're spending hours just trying to make a small stone shack bc noone wants you on the server.

It's PVP is a terrible argument. Have some humanity.",0
What do you think of Ark: Survival Evolved?,0,"if it takes you hours to make a small stone shack, than you really need to get better.

Oh and if i've never played the game, why do i have 7.1k hours on my steam account?? funny you just assume. 

The game has been pvp since day 1. There was ONLY pvp servers, that was the entire idea behind the game.

It sounds like you made a stone hut, and got wiped. You 100% were never in a mega tribe.",1
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Subnautica,10
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Ark is huge (like 300+GB) and is designed for multi-player. Really tough to have a full experience solo. Subnautica is designed for single player but doesn't have the same depth (no pun intended) as Ark.,3
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"For me personally it’s ark but I never play it solo and we have our own server so that we can make our own settings and access it anytime. For most everyone else that asks this, I’d say subnautica",2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"I really enjoyed both. I'm enjoying ark more at the moment only because I have a server with a tribe and we are able to do anything, if you prefer a single player experience subnautica might be the way to go however you can still customise the harvesting and exp multipliers of ark to suit how much you are willing to grind. Both have heaps of exploration ark tends to rewards killing everything where as subnautica wants you to focus on story and exploration.",2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"Ark is huge and addictive! If you like a big open map with a big emphasis on survival and lots of exotic pets then it might suit you. 
The story is pretty loose around the gameplay so you dont have to complete it if its not your thing, you can just do what you want or you can try to challenge yourself. Start off on the island to get the hang of things, it's pretty tricky at first but so good once you get really immersed into it. 

different dinosaur species that you can tame have different abilities, different needs and ways to breed them to make stronger pets. 

If that's what you like, you'd probably like it.",2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Do you play on PC or Console? ARK has a huge variety of mods available which imo really increase solo playability by reducing farming f.e. by having Super Structures or something alike which let's you recover already built buildings or better reusables which makes especially the early game a lot easier because a single throwing spear is able to take down a raptor which would normally anihilate you and cause you to ragequit after your first 10 minutes,2

Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Subnautica was awesome. It's been hard trying to find a game that will scratch that Subnautica itch. Below zero was good I really hope they make a third one.,2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Agreed,2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"Actually if you don't own any DLC it's much smaller, I get to around 100 GB by just only having one DLC installed, the exact size varies on which one I do have at the moment, it's still pretty huge though",3
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Solid description. I’ve played over a 1000 hours of Ark solo and you’re right there’s stuff that’s just hard to build up to solo and offline.,2

Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,Console.I did play Ark but only once at a friend's house and it looked fun,2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"Good call on PC or console and strong agree on mods(Love me some Primal Fear). I must, however, express my personal disagreement on reusables - If I don't die at least 3 times within the first 30 minutes of a newly started map, there is something wrong with my settings.",1
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"I assume all DLC, as if OP is anything like me, having all DLC is mandatory before playing a game... 😅",3
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"I'd go with Subnautica then, as I said especially solo I personally wouldn't like to play without mods and also in later game they can add really cool stuff. ARK can however still be fun without them that's just my opinion",2
Subnautica or Ark survival evolved?,1,"Yeah I have it all too, but as in ARK the different DLCs don't influence each other, you can easily just do it as I did and change which to use, also ARK has whole lots of DLCs and I wouldn't spend a hundred € on a game right away, so for a start I think 100 or 150 GB will suffice",3

Is ARK: Survival Evolved worth it? (Singleplayer),4,"Don't bother playing on pvp servers but if you play singleplayer or, even better, drop like 15 bucks to get a server for you and a few friends, it can be one of the most fun games ever made. So much variety in how you can play and creates so many awe-inspiring moments mixed with laugh-your-ass-off moments. It's great",2
Is ARK: Survival Evolved worth it? (Singleplayer),4,Don't bother. I was a long term ark player and if you want a smooth solo experience you better get used to using commands to free yourself from stupid glitches or spawn gear back in because the game decides to wipe it from existence or get your bag trapped out of bounds. The single player progression is unsatisfying and grindy especially when it comes to preparing for bosses. On the other hand a survival game I enjoyed was Valheim although that can also be a bit grindy.,1

"The Golden Gate Bridge, 33 hour build, Ark: Survival Evolved.",103,"This was built on PC.  Private server.  Mods used are S+.  As well, the server has collision enabled.  I have a video walkthrough of it, but was not sure it was appropriate to share it in the comments.

Edit:  The bottom right is a cemetery I built for the real life workers that lost their lives building the bridge.  I researched the background of the bridge, and was surprised to find out, it was way below average for that time in history.  The main reason, the engineer was keen on safety.  Among many things, he built a net to catch workers that fell.  Sadly, a bunch of scaffolding fell and broke the net.  The workers that fell with it, were killed, except for one.  That day, was the only day there was loss of life, with the exception of one other worker.  Which was amazing for that point in time.

"Any mobile games similar to Door Kickers, XCOM or Ark Survival Evolved or darker themed games?",1,"Sorry not a native english speaker so I might get some of the grammar wrong but I'm gonna suggest the games that I currently have on my phone

Graveyard Keeper - more of dark humor but as the title suggest this game makes you into a graveyard keeper who tends to the church's graveyard along with doing a myriad of other task (wood chopping, iron gathering, cooking, etc...), there's also combat if you're into that but it's not a big part of the game, more like press x to slash and thats it.

Rebuild - It's a turn based strategy game where each turn you have the option to kill zombies, recruit survivors, loot buildings & reclaim buildings whith the end goal being to reclaim the whole city from the zombies.

This War of Mine - You play as group of civilians stuck in a war zone for different type of reasons just trying to survive and you only have each other to rely on. At morning you can fortify your hideout and at night you can scavenge other locations in the city for basic necessities.

Sheltered - Similiar to ""This War Of Mine"" but instead of a war zone you're a family stuck in a bunker trying to survive in a nuclear wasteland.

Punch Club - Now this game isn't dark at all except maybe for the intro. This game is more of a management type of game where you only manage one person - your character. You need to train your character to better themselves, schedule fights, learn moves, etc. The other best thing I can say about this is it has a mishmash of 70-80's feel to it.

Hope this helps 😀",1

I'm in a similar situation, looking to join a tribe, play and contribute a few times a week. I'll message you my steam id if you are still active. Cheers",2
