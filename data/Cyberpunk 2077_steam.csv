"Unbelievable—I’m saying this now, but there’s no way I would’ve said it back when Cyberpunk 2077 first launched. Those memes about all the bugs and crashes? Yeah, I was one of the people who couldn’t deal with it. I rage-quit and left it for dead.

But coming back to it now? 10/10. I’m honestly blown away. The gunplay is smooth and satisfying, the story is incredibly rich, and the graphics are on a whole other level. It’s clear that years of work and countless patches turned this game into something truly special. CD Projekt Red really redeemed themselves, and I’m glad I gave it a second shot. If you dropped it like I did back then, trust me—it’s worth diving back in.",True,501,9
"I'm glad to be able to play Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time in version 2.2 Update.

This game is not just a game to me. The world feels alive and so does every character in the story and side stories. Truly alive and fantastic. I've played countless games in my life but this experience changed my life. I know it's just a stupid video game how can it be so amazing?! Yeah I have no idea. I can't put it into words but this is such an immersive and mature game. It is funny and emotional and real, raw and deep. I love being in the world of this game. I love replaying this game which I never do usually. This game makes me feel things and that is quite an accomplishment trust me :). Every inch of this game and its world is interesting to me and playing through the story doesn't feel like you're doing missions like in most games but it feels like a natural progression and unfolding of a complex and unprecedentely deep narrative. There is also such an incredible feeling of evolution in the story, once you think you know what the stakes and direction are going to be the game throws something completely unexpected at you which changes your adventure and investment in this new adventure.

The cast is also amazing for this game, giving the characters life and memorable moments. Combat mechanics are great, and being able to mod yourself with cyber-ware is one of the coolest experiences I've seen in a game. This game is more than just a visual marvel-it's a storytelling powerhouse and a showcase of how thoughtful design can immerse players completely into a world. Simply put, it's a must-play, especially for those who appreciate deep narratives and richly designed worlds. This alone doesn't include the Phantom Liberty DLC which I think is extraordinary and may be a separate review. Peace, Chooms!",True,215,3
"Super underrated game for hardcore gamers.. game looks ""casual"" but it's actually super deep and wild!
Combat is smooth and feels very nice, story-telling and music are amazing.
Your really get conected with characters. Game feels like it's real.
Game is in my opinion some kind of mix of Fallout and Grand Theft Auto!
I'm very much recommending this game for every type of gamer, from super hardcore to super casual!

"I bought Cyberpunk 2077 when it was released back then but refunded it, because it was unplayable.

Now 4 years later i bought it again since someone recommanded it to me and I have to say: I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL

I did one playthrough with 120 hours and it was sooooooo great!! The stroy, the graphic, the gameplay i just can't let this game go.
It is still present in my mind and the story was breathtaking!

Such a good game and I loved it soooo much!",True,65,0

"[h3][b]Thoughts[/b][/h3] 
It's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. This playthrough took me two months, and I was so close to starting another one right away. It's so hard to move on from such a well crafted world and all those iconic characters. Please play this if you still haven't, it's an experience unlike any other. One which I'll never forget.

"I’ve been interested in Cyberpunk 2077 since it was announced in 2012, and I followed it closely since. It has been a rollercoaster, honestly. I was there on day one and decided to wait with my review all these years until after CDPR would have kept its promise to fix it.  

[b]Five years later,[/b] the modding scene has grown so much it's on the homepage of NexusMods. A DLC and many patches have come out, and with CP77 basically being a benchmark tool, it was about time I made my way back to Night City.  

[h1]Unique promise[/h1]  
Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a ""first-person shooter RPG."" [b]The things it excels at are what make it such a noteworthy experience.[/b]  
It all begins with a well-presented - although simple - story that is brought to life by the [b]very strong performance of the actors.[/b]  

It all happens inside of Night City, which is one of the most [b]detailed and captivating maps[/b] out there, likely because it wasn't made just for the game but has a long history and revisions of its tabletop counterpart. The game has a [b]distinct aesthetic[/b], fitting the genre like a glove, and every area feels alive, full of diversity, and things to see.  

It's all complimented by a [b]better take on hacking[/b] that's quite a step up compared to Watch Dogs and [b]solid gunplay and gun handling[/b] that could almost rival Destiny, which excels at it. Each weapon feels different and delivers a reason to use it over others simply for how it handles.  

The [b]side missions[/b], much like in The Witcher 3, are standouts, with storylines expanding multiple missions that can even unlock more endings when completed.
The [b]side activities[/b] are many, yet not so varied, much like in The Witcher 3 often being a point of interest with enemies in it. 

When Cyberpunk puts all these things together and does them well, [b]it genuinely is one of the most memorable experiences you could get in gaming.[/b]  

The issue is when it [i]doesn't[/i].  

[h1]Cutting corners[/h1]  
CP77 was introduced at first with many promises during some keynotes held by CDPR, and then to the masses with a gameplay footage of 40m of a tailor-made demo in 2018. 

Is this uncommon in the gaming industry? No. 
When TLOU2 was shown, Naughty Dog had nothing on their hands and also made a demo environment to showcase what they aimed the game to be like. Many choices had to be finalized in regard to the experience, and so had the design of the characters shown.
There is a spectacular documentary on it on YouTube.  

[b]The issue with CP77 was that it was an unachievable goal.[/b]  

But this is not just about the broken promises; it's also about the ones that were kept, with shortcuts. Even after the many improvements of 2.0, and dropping the old-gen consoles, the game still suffers greatly and has many bugs.
I was actually shocked to find so many, after hearing people talk about it so well compared to at lunch. I think that with time, a good pair of rose-tinted glasses, and with so much exposure to CP77 in ways I'll go over later, time has smoothed out some of those sharp edges in the general opinion that are still there.

[i]For example:[/i]  
The game had promised an [b]origin system[/b] that could be compared to Dragon Age: Origins, and while it does have a slightly different beginning based on your starting faction, for the rest of the story, it'll just be adding an extra dialogue option that you can use, with no impact besides a different sentence. In Origins, people who, for example, knew the family you came from would make comments and have extra dialogues because of it, a completely different level of immersion.

Staying on the [b]story[/b], there aren't many options for roleplaying, with most simply leading to extra endings based on what side missions you've completed. This is true for both the game and DLC.
I had story missions that bugged, telling me to make a call while preventing me until a restart of the game, or even main story bosses bugging with infinite health at 1% left.  

During the story - and that famous demo - the one and only [b]car chase[/b] is present. I'm happy to report that in the DLC, another one has been added, yet much like the story, it's heavily scripted. On a harder difficulty, when I didn't destroy one of the cars chasing me fast enough, it would just self-implode. Additionally, after the chase, I was given control over the vehicle that now had popped wheels and was a nightmare to drive. 

Everything around the [b]cars[/b] suffers in general from how it has been implemented. I have seen the cars either literally waiting on me when I was too far during a race, or worse, teleporting right behind me to make it challenging instead of proper rubber banding. This is the same as it was when it launched. At some point, other contestants hit civilians on the sidewalk, and the police started chasing me.  
I am happy to say though that general vehicle combat has been added!

Speaking of [b]the police[/b], it's great they patched it and now it won't spawn in front of your face anymore, but they still do: a bit further. Additionally, there's an achievement in the DLC to bring the wanted level to the max; this can be done only by killing civilians, attacking the police doesn't increase it, and there are no real differences between wanted levels 1 and 5. No helicopter or insane chase to escape them, it's worse than in Need For Speed Most Wanted from 2005! I'm not sure why they'd highlight such a weak point.  

Speaking of [b]civilians,[/b] they now finally run away from you during crimes, but they are still simpler than in GTA 3 and are nowhere near the promised complexity with day-night cycles even Morrowind had. Instead, if you look at them long enough, they either despawn or go in circles. Their nav-meshing seems to have issues too, since I've often seen them walking over benches and other parts of the map.

[b]All these examples are just what I noticed. Overall, the game is still just not a very polished experience and nowhere where I hoped it would be by now.[/b] I understand a project like No Man's Sky is smaller and requires fewer resources to elevate to the level it's at today, nevertheless, I can't say I didn't expect that from CDPR as a way to make up the wrong.

[b]Phantom Liberty[/b]

Much like the base game, its well-written story is brought alive by its performance, with the last small piece of the map of Night City, Dogtown, being now open and around 30h of content; a good expansion, especially for the new ending which I'll see as canon for my character.
I would not say it's at the level of Heart of Stone of The Witcher 3, let alone Blood and Wine. 

[h1]Forever installed[/h1]  
The smartest thing CDPR did with CP77 was update it to support many experimental features, making its way into many benchmarks nowadays.  
It's one of the few games with [b]full path tracing, ray tracing, every possible type of AI upscaling, and frame generation available.[/b] It's a wonderful benchmark for graphics cards and there hasn't been a video in the last 3 years at least that didn't show the game at some capacity.
Even now, with DLSS 4, the fact they updated the game to support the Transformer Model earlier than Nvidia released the drivers made it so that I could test it out and see all the issues the CCN model had with the path tracing gone.  
[b]They are genuinely doing a great job in this aspect.[/b]  

[h1]The Tower[/h1]  

To anyone who praises this game as one of the best ever made: I'm happy for you. I strongly suggest playing some of the games CP77 said it would be like.

[b]It's crazy how, 5 years later, my opinion on it hasn't changed.[/b]  
The game is not what was promised, despite the impressive work done, and it seems like it never will be, but it's not a bad game.
It's just not what I bought.
And that will always be bittersweet.

"[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is quite the dish. Of course, I had to wait for the controversy to cool down before diving into this tasty-looking treat after that tragic launch. But to be fair, I'm happy to say I enjoyed most of my meal.

There's a lot to compliment on this plate: To start, everything is so delicately detailed that it's almost like a sensory overload - you don't even know where to look first. You can see that Night City has been carefully crafted to feel as lively as possible. The vibes and atmosphere this game delivers almost feel surreally alien, yet at the same time, you can vaguely imagine our future ending up similarly to the one depicted in the game. The combat feels undeniably superb, with every aspect of it working like a charm. The motion capture and acting carrying the game are significant selling points, too. A great range of topics are also covered, including loyalty, principles, business, religion, capitalism and more. It also contains many pop culture references, which is also a massive bonus in my eyes. And, of course, the story was great, too. Everyone blaming a city and corporations for all their problems, but never themselves, is a pretty funny plot. You also get some leeway in your choices while avoiding the overwhelm of too many branching decisions in the story. However, I think I had the most fun playing the side missions.

Despite this, the gameplay doesn't have as much depth as I was expecting. By this, I mean there wasn't much variety in smaller mission types, and unique or special gameplay mechanics were very few. For all it's worth, I expected more for such a high price. Thanks to me, my friends and this game's extensive marketing, my expectations skyrocketed. Yet, it feels like you're mostly paying here for the graphics, details and, of course, [b]Keanu Reeves[/b].

Some other noteworthy thoughts include the disappointment of not being able to play purchased Braindances. I'm sure they would've been a nice addition. Another issue was the romance options. But this isn't primarily a dating simulator, so I can look the other way. However, certain characters were definitely pushed more than others. For instance, some felt like predetermined romantic interests for your character. One thing I can't ignore, though, is the fact that you can change your penis size - even though you're never gonna get to see it in action. As disheartening as this may sound, it was probably just a clever marketing gimmick. Curiously, I think this game is like a mix of [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] and [i]Far Cry[/i] but with a futuristic and sci-fi twist. Due to this, my dad would probably have a blast with this if he could play first-person shooters.

All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty solid game, and I can recommend it to anyone with the computational capacity to run it at max graphics and experience it in its full cyberpunk glory.",True,3,0
STUNING GAME - it is definitely what I expected after so long time of development and huge advertising. It has so much to explore like no OTHER game on the market. It does not feel LINEAR in any way. Night city is a REAL city - full of life and many different places to visit. I have never played such a good game and I hope that CD Project will make another game like this EVEN if we have to wait 5 years for that. Their imagination regarding of humans future is excellent and I strongly believe that our world will look something similar to what we can see in this game. Don't miss this game and forget about bad start on release day - it does NOT matter now - the game is simply BEST GAME of all times!!.,True,3,0
"Much (and correctly) maligned for a sub-par launch, CP2077 grew into the game it was hyped to be. Fans of the old RPG see characters brought to life with excellent graphics, voice acting and gameplay. Character classes a limited (compared to the RPG) but the story is excellent all the same with a good variety of playthrough options (stealth, hacking, straight up carnage). The story branches out a couple of different ways, but your mileage may vary on wanting to play through a couple of times to get them all. The vehicles still handle pretty badly, mind you.

The expansion adds a different line and more buffs for the chharacter and so adds some extra hours to the overall gameplay, and given its been out for some time can be found outside of full price. At the end of the day its a great pickup now that its not a godawful buggy mess. CD:PR made it there in the end, thankfully!",True,3,0
"[h3]Cyberpunk 2077: A Fully Realized Experience[/h3]
Cyberpunk 2077 has finally become the game it should have been from the start! The developers are still actively working on it, which is always a great sign.

Cyberpunk is truly a breathtaking and vibrant world, full of incredible detail. The number of side quests and stories is mind-blowing and adds a depth that's rarely found in other games! The main story is equally rich, packed with emotion, and filled with unforgettable characters, including the legendary Johnny Silverhand, who turns out to have a surprisingly compelling backstory.

The gameplay allows you to tackle missions however you like, whether through stealth, hacking, or action, while the RPG elements let you craft your own unique playstyle. On top of that, there are countless ways to play thanks to the various modules. The soundtrack is phenomenal, perfectly complementing this gritty and futuristic world.

What’s truly astonishing is the community's work on mods, which take the game to the next level. It enriches the experience like never before (and I highly recommend trying them).

[h3]Cyberpunk 2077 : Une Expérience Enfin Aboutie[/h3]
Cyberpunk 2077 est finalement devenu le jeu qu’il aurait toujours dû être depuis longtemps ! Les développeurs continuent de travailler dessus ce qui fait toujours plaisir !
Cyberpunk est vraiment un monde magnifique et vivant, rempli de détails. Le nombres de quêtes et histoires secondaires sont bluffant et ajoute vraiment une profondeur qu'on trouve rarement dans les jeux !
L’histoire principale est aussi très riche, pleine d’émotion, et peuplée de personnages inoubliables, comme le bon vieux Johnny Silverhand qui au final est un personnage avec un beau background !

Le gameplay vous permet d’aborder les missions à votre manière, que ce soit par la furtivité, le hacking ou l’action, tandis que les éléments RPG vous permettent de façonner votre style de jeu. Vous avez aussi d'innombrable manière de jouer rien qu'avec les modules. La bande-son est phénoménale, complétant parfaitement ce monde futuriste et sombre.   

Et ce qui est vraiment juste bluffant c'est la communauté qui fait des mods de malade et ça enrichi le jeu comme jamais (et je vous conseil de tester)",True,2,0

"Great game. Short but great main story. Many fantastically developed side jobs and gigs. Fun character development. Fully immersive and detailed environment -- night city it beautiful, sometimes I catch myself in awe just staring at the scenes in front of me. Already on my second play through and still finding new locations, things, etc. 

Would be nice if the police system was developed better and if there were more places and people to interact with as you traveled through the city -- there are a lot of people and cars but the interactions are very shallow outside of jobs, gigs and the main story. Would be nice to have more romance options and after update 2.2, would be nice to have additional dialogue/interaction during the romancing between V and his/her partner in the apartment than the same thing over and over. 

Overall, best so-called RPG I've played in a long time. Definitely recommend the game.",True,2,0

I played at release. Horrible experience, you know what I mean!

I played a year or so after, finished the main story and most of Gigs an Biz. Ending was kind of meh for me personally. Therefore I watched the other endings and was happy with how the game evolved.

Now I played the DLC.
Nothing brand new. You have a main story, gigs and biz and some more open world action. It was a blast and I had much fun with it.
I experienced some minor bugs, nothing game breaking.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is not like many other games, at least for the first play through, maybe even the second. 

Your first play through will be filled with trying random things, having a great time, and also hearing a lot of really good dialogue and voice acting. It's going to make you want to play it again, and again, and eventually you will start to skip through it, but the gameplay still keeps you around, something keeps sucking you back in. 

Night City. That's what keeps you coming back in, once she gets her claws in you, you're never truly going to leave. Night City will chew you up, spit you out, you can rise to the highest highs, and fall to the lowest lows, experience the loss of so many people close to you. Yet you will still come back for more, just one more run, just one more build, just one more gig.

So wake up and go burn this city Samurai, burn your name into her so deeply she never forgets it. But remember, she can just as easily burn you. So in the end, whats more worth it to you?

"I won't take too long beating the same dead horse that's already been beating a 1000 times before. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the game had a disastrous launch, you've likely heard that CDPR lied & how now it's been experiencing a massive redemption arc the past couple years. 

[h3]And yes, it's TRUE.[/h3] CDPR hid, deceived, misled and outright actively LIED about the state of the game on release, lied about features and the way systems worked in the game. What is also true is that YES, they have made insane progress attempting to redeem this game and they DID redeem the game as a product if you can separate experience from the scummy/lying practices they exhibited 4 years ago.

[h3]If you can get past the past and focus on what the game offers you now, you're going to get one of the most technically impressive and impacting experiences you'll have in a long time. It's really an extraordinary game now. Now, let's focus on the actual review:[/h3]

[b]Positives:[/b]

1) Flat out, the game has what is in my opinion, at MINIMUM Top 5 writing for a video game ever. CDPR's unbelievably talent in this department only has gotten better and these guys ACED it here. The game understands and respects the power of immersion and goes the extra mile with all the small details. When the game sucks you in, you are IN.

2) Visually, it absolutely is as stunning as everyone has said it is. Top 3 all time from a graphical standpoint for me personally. From the under the hood technical capabilities of the game's lighting and fidelity, but also from the handcrafted world. It's constantly stunning at every step of the journey.

3) Really enjoyable and varied approaches to game-play with several different ways to build your character & approach objectives. It's also got that classic Morrowind feel where the game will let you become comically OP if you so choose. It won't restrict you. Wanna take a fast paced, physical melee approach, jumping over buildings and dashing at lightning speed in-between enemies?  You can. Wanna be a stealth operator, covertly subverting security systems, utilizing an arsenal of tools to avoid detection and taking out enemies with silent, precise strikes? You can. Wanna be an over the top, godlike net-runner who can drop every enemy in a building before even stepping foot in it? You can.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

1) The game world, while aesthetically, one of the best looking I've ever played, can sometimes feel a bit static & lacking in interactivity. There isn't a ton of interactivity and if you're coming from something like a Rockstar game world and expecting the same here, you won't get that.

2) The traffic is unfortunately still kinda horrible lol. The AI for drivers randomly just breaks and cars will just stop and stay stopped in the middle of the road and at stoplights. They've advertised that police chases are now fixed but honestly, it's still extremely underwhelming. You can be in the slowest of cars and instantly lose pursuers with basically zero resistance once you get a few streets away from the scene of the crime.

[h3]EXTRA: Also will shout out here, that Phantom Liberty, the expansion for the game takes all the positives of this game and basically DOUBLES it. Honestly the best content in the game and a must buy.[/h3]",True,1,0

+ Main story's a bit short, but there's a shitload of side quests to keep you busy.
+ It offers a wide range of choices when it comes to weapons and skill trees, allowing you to tailor your playstyle - whether that's stealth, gunplay, or melee combat.
+ It has amazing Mod support, extending the game's replay value.


Con:
-- Driving still SUCKS (at least for me). It feels like ice skating in a car - slippery, unresponsive, and completely lacking in weight or traction. It's a disappointment, especially since driving is such a big part of the game.
- Optimization is still subpar. I've encountered some game freezes and lag, particularly when entering crowded areas.


I think CDPR kinda redeem themselves after all these years of effort on Cyberpunk 2077, but it's still far away the game they promised in the first place. The current full price might be a bit steep for some players. Grab it on sale, and you'll likely feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

"It's unfortunate that many people were turned off by Cyberpunk 2077 because of its rough launch. I played it for the first time about two years after its release, following the 2.0 update, and aside from a couple of minor visual bugs, the experience has been incredible.

What immediately stood out to me was the game’s world because it’s simply the best I’ve ever played. Night City is not just visually stunning with its neon aesthetic, but it feels alive. Driving through the streets, taking in in the vibrant atmosphere, is an experience I'm sure you'll enjoy.

With the addition of the Phantom Liberty DLC, the game now offers two main story lines, both of which are fantastic. They've got well-developed characters and, most importantly, feature epic and emotional moments that make the story unforgettable.

The combat feels amazing, especially in the late game, where you can dominate enemies with ease after getting strong weapons and cyberware. However, the difficulty curve can be a bit uneven because you start off feeling weak, but by the end, you’re almost too strong, especially against some bosses.

Even after 125 hours in this game, I plan on coming back to try out different life paths and, more importantly, to make different decisions and see the new endings I can get. Admittedly, replaying the intro and going through the same early events can feel a bit tedious, but I’m still excited to dive back in. Plus, there are mods available that let you skip the intro if you really want to.

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 has truly become a classic in my eyes, and I have to shout out my bro, Johnny Silverhand. If you haven’t played the game or revisited it since the 2.0 update, I can confidently say it’s 100% worth giving it a shot, as is the Phantom Liberty DLC. While it might not change your life, it will definitely leave a lasting impression and keep you coming back for more.

"This is game is just mind blowing. My experience with this was so good and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The characters, story, game play, music and everything else this game offers is just crazy. I'm not gonna lie, this game kinda changed me, but that's besides the point. Of course, this game does have it's issues, bugs etc but it's massively overshadowed by the beautiful story. 
I WISH I COULD'VE DATED JUDY AS MALE V, not saying I don't love you Panam haha. 

100000/10 I highly recommend this experience.",True,1,0
"I'm glad I waited to purchase this game. I haven't experience a better, more coherent story that keeps me deeply involved and wanting to know what happens next. You have the freedom to do what you want. The weight that the choices have on the story is a big selling point for me.

I loved this main story and the expansion, I can't wait to see what CD PROJEKT RED have in store next",True,1,0

"A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Immersion

Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning achievement that sets a new benchmark for immersive gaming experiences. From its richly detailed open-world setting to its compelling narrative, this game delivers on multiple levels, making it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and fans of futuristic storytelling alike.

World-Building and Atmosphere
Night City feels alive in every sense of the word. The attention to detail is phenomenal—neon-lit skyscrapers, bustling streets, and the layered history of its districts create a world that feels authentic and immersive. The city is not just a backdrop; it's a character in itself, brimming with life, danger, and intrigue.

Storytelling and Characters
The narrative is a standout feature. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a gripping story with deep, complex characters that leave a lasting impression. V’s journey, shaped by your choices, feels personal and impactful. The performances—especially Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand—are top-notch, adding depth and emotional weight to the story.

Gameplay and Customization
The gameplay is incredibly engaging, blending fast-paced action with RPG mechanics. The freedom to customize your playstyle—be it stealth, hacking, or all-out combat—ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. The array of cybernetic enhancements and weaponry offers endless possibilities for experimentation.

Visuals and Audio
Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. The lighting, textures, and attention to small details make Night City a visual feast. The soundtrack is equally impressive, perfectly complementing the cyberpunk aesthetic with its pulsating beats and atmospheric tracks.

Post-Launch Improvements
CD Projekt Red's commitment to improving the game post-launch deserves recognition. The updates have not only addressed initial issues but have also enhanced the overall experience, adding new features, content, and improved performance.

Conclusion
Cyberpunk 2077 is more than just a game; it's an experience. With its incredible storytelling, immersive world, and engaging gameplay, it stands as a testament to what ambitious game development can achieve. If you haven’t visited Night City yet, now is the perfect time.

⭐ Rating: 9.5/10
Highly recommended! Whether you're a fan of RPGs, open-world games, or just great storytelling, Cyberpunk 2077 is a ride you won’t want to miss.",True,1,0
"All things considered, the way this game launched is worthy of all the negative technical criticism surrounding it. However what was not technical is absolute gold. The city, the atmosphere, the ambient music, the radio music, the score, the characters, the writing, all of it was genuinely trendsetting and puts most open world games released in its wake to shame. It's been 4 years of updates and DLC, and I think it's pretty telling that this game still pulls numbers today. I'm playing through it now and falling in love with the world again, nothing in the gaming landscape comes close to replicating the feeling of reading Neuromancer and the ambient calm of Blade Runner (in certain parts; all things considered this game is diametrically opposed to the tone and style of BR). I give this game my highest recommendation, it makes me feel a childlike wonder like nothing before.",True,1,0
