"Unbelievable—I’m saying this now, but there’s no way I would’ve said it back when Cyberpunk 2077 first launched. Those memes about all the bugs and crashes? Yeah, I was one of the people who couldn’t deal with it. I rage-quit and left it for dead.

But coming back to it now? 10/10. I’m honestly blown away. The gunplay is smooth and satisfying, the story is incredibly rich, and the graphics are on a whole other level. It’s clear that years of work and countless patches turned this game into something truly special. CD Projekt Red really redeemed themselves, and I’m glad I gave it a second shot. If you dropped it like I did back then, trust me—it’s worth diving back in.",True,528,10
"I'm glad to be able to play Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time in version 2.2 Update.

This game is not just a game to me. The world feels alive and so does every character in the story and side stories. Truly alive and fantastic. I've played countless games in my life but this experience changed my life. I know it's just a stupid video game how can it be so amazing?! Yeah I have no idea. I can't put it into words but this is such an immersive and mature game. It is funny and emotional and real, raw and deep. I love being in the world of this game. I love replaying this game which I never do usually. This game makes me feel things and that is quite an accomplishment trust me :). Every inch of this game and its world is interesting to me and playing through the story doesn't feel like you're doing missions like in most games but it feels like a natural progression and unfolding of a complex and unprecedentely deep narrative. There is also such an incredible feeling of evolution in the story, once you think you know what the stakes and direction are going to be the game throws something completely unexpected at you which changes your adventure and investment in this new adventure.

The cast is also amazing for this game, giving the characters life and memorable moments. Combat mechanics are great, and being able to mod yourself with cyber-ware is one of the coolest experiences I've seen in a game. This game is more than just a visual marvel-it's a storytelling powerhouse and a showcase of how thoughtful design can immerse players completely into a world. Simply put, it's a must-play, especially for those who appreciate deep narratives and richly designed worlds. This alone doesn't include the Phantom Liberty DLC which I think is extraordinary and may be a separate review. Peace, Chooms!",True,219,4
"Super underrated game for hardcore gamers.. game looks ""casual"" but it's actually super deep and wild!
Combat is smooth and feels very nice, story-telling and music are amazing.
Your really get conected with characters. Game feels like it's real.
Game is in my opinion some kind of mix of Fallout and Grand Theft Auto!
I'm very much recommending this game for every type of gamer, from super hardcore to super casual!

"I bought Cyberpunk 2077 when it was released back then but refunded it, because it was unplayable.

Now 4 years later i bought it again since someone recommanded it to me and I have to say: I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL

I did one playthrough with 120 hours and it was sooooooo great!! The stroy, the graphic, the gameplay i just can't let this game go.
It is still present in my mind and the story was breathtaking!

Such a good game and I loved it soooo much!",True,67,0

"[h3][b]Thoughts[/b][/h3] 
It's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. This playthrough took me two months, and I was so close to starting another one right away. It's so hard to move on from such a well crafted world and all those iconic characters. Please play this if you still haven't, it's an experience unlike any other. One which I'll never forget.

"I’ve been interested in Cyberpunk 2077 since it was announced in 2012, and I followed it closely since. It has been a rollercoaster, honestly. I was there on day one and decided to wait with my review all these years until after CDPR would have kept its promise to fix it.  

[b]Five years later,[/b] the modding scene has grown so much it's on the homepage of NexusMods. A DLC and many patches have come out, and with CP77 basically being a benchmark tool, it was about time I made my way back to Night City.  

[h1]Unique promise[/h1]  
Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a ""first-person shooter RPG."" [b]The things it excels at are what make it such a noteworthy experience.[/b]  
It all begins with a well-presented - although simple - story that is brought to life by the [b]very strong performance of the actors.[/b]  

It all happens inside of Night City, which is one of the most [b]detailed and captivating maps[/b] out there, likely because it wasn't made just for the game but has a long history and revisions of its tabletop counterpart. The game has a [b]distinct aesthetic[/b], fitting the genre like a glove, and every area feels alive, full of diversity, and things to see.  

It's all complimented by a [b]better take on hacking[/b] that's quite a step up compared to Watch Dogs and [b]solid gunplay and gun handling[/b] that could almost rival Destiny, which excels at it. Each weapon feels different and delivers a reason to use it over others simply for how it handles.  

The [b]side missions[/b], much like in The Witcher 3, are standouts, with storylines expanding multiple missions that can even unlock more endings when completed.
The [b]side activities[/b] are many, yet not so varied, much like in The Witcher 3 often being a point of interest with enemies in it. 

When Cyberpunk puts all these things together and does them well, [b]it genuinely is one of the most memorable experiences you could get in gaming.[/b]  

The issue is when it [i]doesn't[/i].  

[h1]Cutting corners[/h1]  
CP77 was introduced at first with many promises during some keynotes held by CDPR, and then to the masses with a gameplay footage of 40m of a tailor-made demo in 2018. 

Is this uncommon in the gaming industry? No. 
When TLOU2 was shown, Naughty Dog had nothing on their hands and also made a demo environment to showcase what they aimed the game to be like. Many choices had to be finalized in regard to the experience, and so had the design of the characters shown.
There is a spectacular documentary on it on YouTube.  

[b]The issue with CP77 was that it was an unachievable goal.[/b]  

But this is not just about the broken promises; it's also about the ones that were kept, with shortcuts. Even after the many improvements of 2.0, and dropping the old-gen consoles, the game still suffers greatly and has many bugs.
I was actually shocked to find so many, after hearing people talk about it so well compared to at lunch. I think that with time, a good pair of rose-tinted glasses, and with so much exposure to CP77 in ways I'll go over later, time has smoothed out some of those sharp edges in the general opinion that are still there.

[i]For example:[/i]  
The game had promised an [b]origin system[/b] that could be compared to Dragon Age: Origins, and while it does have a slightly different beginning based on your starting faction, for the rest of the story, it'll just be adding an extra dialogue option that you can use, with no impact besides a different sentence. In Origins, people who, for example, knew the family you came from would make comments and have extra dialogues because of it, a completely different level of immersion.

Staying on the [b]story[/b], there aren't many options for roleplaying, with most simply leading to extra endings based on what side missions you've completed. This is true for both the game and DLC.
I had story missions that bugged, telling me to make a call while preventing me until a restart of the game, or even main story bosses bugging with infinite health at 1% left.  

During the story - and that famous demo - the one and only [b]car chase[/b] is present. I'm happy to report that in the DLC, another one has been added, yet much like the story, it's heavily scripted. On a harder difficulty, when I didn't destroy one of the cars chasing me fast enough, it would just self-implode. Additionally, after the chase, I was given control over the vehicle that now had popped wheels and was a nightmare to drive. 

Everything around the [b]cars[/b] suffers in general from how it has been implemented. I have seen the cars either literally waiting on me when I was too far during a race, or worse, teleporting right behind me to make it challenging instead of proper rubber banding. This is the same as it was when it launched. At some point, other contestants hit civilians on the sidewalk, and the police started chasing me.  
I am happy to say though that general vehicle combat has been added!

Speaking of [b]the police[/b], it's great they patched it and now it won't spawn in front of your face anymore, but they still do: a bit further. Additionally, there's an achievement in the DLC to bring the wanted level to the max; this can be done only by killing civilians, attacking the police doesn't increase it, and there are no real differences between wanted levels 1 and 5. No helicopter or insane chase to escape them, it's worse than in Need For Speed Most Wanted from 2005! I'm not sure why they'd highlight such a weak point.  

Speaking of [b]civilians,[/b] they now finally run away from you during crimes, but they are still simpler than in GTA 3 and are nowhere near the promised complexity with day-night cycles even Morrowind had. Instead, if you look at them long enough, they either despawn or go in circles. Their nav-meshing seems to have issues too, since I've often seen them walking over benches and other parts of the map.

[b]All these examples are just what I noticed. Overall, the game is still just not a very polished experience and nowhere where I hoped it would be by now.[/b] I understand a project like No Man's Sky is smaller and requires fewer resources to elevate to the level it's at today, nevertheless, I can't say I didn't expect that from CDPR as a way to make up the wrong.

[b]Phantom Liberty[/b]

Much like the base game, its well-written story is brought alive by its performance, with the last small piece of the map of Night City, Dogtown, being now open and around 30h of content; a good expansion, especially for the new ending which I'll see as canon for my character.
I would not say it's at the level of Heart of Stone of The Witcher 3, let alone Blood and Wine. 

[h1]Forever installed[/h1]  
The smartest thing CDPR did with CP77 was update it to support many experimental features, making its way into many benchmarks nowadays.  
It's one of the few games with [b]full path tracing, ray tracing, every possible type of AI upscaling, and frame generation available.[/b] It's a wonderful benchmark for graphics cards and there hasn't been a video in the last 3 years at least that didn't show the game at some capacity.
Even now, with DLSS 4, the fact they updated the game to support the Transformer Model earlier than Nvidia released the drivers made it so that I could test it out and see all the issues the CCN model had with the path tracing gone.  
[b]They are genuinely doing a great job in this aspect.[/b]  

[h1]The Tower[/h1]  

To anyone who praises this game as one of the best ever made: I'm happy for you. I strongly suggest playing some of the games CP77 said it would be like.

[b]It's crazy how, 5 years later, my opinion on it hasn't changed.[/b]  
The game is not what was promised, despite the impressive work done, and it seems like it never will be, but it's not a bad game.
It's just not what I bought.
And that will always be bittersweet.

"[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is quite the dish. Of course, I had to wait for the controversy to cool down before diving into this tasty-looking treat after that tragic launch. But to be fair, I'm happy to say I enjoyed most of my meal.

There's a lot to compliment on this plate: To start, everything is so delicately detailed that it's almost like a sensory overload - you don't even know where to look first. You can see that Night City has been carefully crafted to feel as lively as possible. The vibes and atmosphere this game delivers almost feel surreally alien, yet at the same time, you can vaguely imagine our future ending up similarly to the one depicted in the game. The combat feels undeniably superb, with every aspect of it working like a charm. The motion capture and acting carrying the game are significant selling points, too. A great range of topics are also covered, including loyalty, principles, business, religion, capitalism and more. It also contains many pop culture references, which is also a massive bonus in my eyes. And, of course, the story was great, too. Everyone blaming a city and corporations for all their problems, but never themselves, is a pretty funny plot. You also get some leeway in your choices while avoiding the overwhelm of too many branching decisions in the story. However, I think I had the most fun playing the side missions.

Despite this, the gameplay doesn't have as much depth as I was expecting. By this, I mean there wasn't much variety in smaller mission types, and unique or special gameplay mechanics were very few. For all it's worth, I expected more for such a high price. Thanks to me, my friends and this game's extensive marketing, my expectations skyrocketed. Yet, it feels like you're mostly paying here for the graphics, details and, of course, [b]Keanu Reeves[/b].

Some other noteworthy thoughts include the disappointment of not being able to play purchased Braindances. I'm sure they would've been a nice addition. Another issue was the romance options. But this isn't primarily a dating simulator, so I can look the other way. However, certain characters were definitely pushed more than others. For instance, some felt like predetermined romantic interests for your character. One thing I can't ignore, though, is the fact that you can change your penis size - even though you're never gonna get to see it in action. As disheartening as this may sound, it was probably just a clever marketing gimmick. Curiously, I think this game is like a mix of [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] and [i]Far Cry[/i] but with a futuristic and sci-fi twist. Due to this, my dad would probably have a blast with this if he could play first-person shooters.

All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty solid game, and I can recommend it to anyone with the computational capacity to run it at max graphics and experience it in its full cyberpunk glory.",True,3,0
STUNING GAME - it is definitely what I expected after so long time of development and huge advertising. It has so much to explore like no OTHER game on the market. It does not feel LINEAR in any way. Night city is a REAL city - full of life and many different places to visit. I have never played such a good game and I hope that CD Project will make another game like this EVEN if we have to wait 5 years for that. Their imagination regarding of humans future is excellent and I strongly believe that our world will look something similar to what we can see in this game. Don't miss this game and forget about bad start on release day - it does NOT matter now - the game is simply BEST GAME of all times!!.,True,3,0
"Much (and correctly) maligned for a sub-par launch, CP2077 grew into the game it was hyped to be. Fans of the old RPG see characters brought to life with excellent graphics, voice acting and gameplay. Character classes a limited (compared to the RPG) but the story is excellent all the same with a good variety of playthrough options (stealth, hacking, straight up carnage). The story branches out a couple of different ways, but your mileage may vary on wanting to play through a couple of times to get them all. The vehicles still handle pretty badly, mind you.

The expansion adds a different line and more buffs for the chharacter and so adds some extra hours to the overall gameplay, and given its been out for some time can be found outside of full price. At the end of the day its a great pickup now that its not a godawful buggy mess. CD:PR made it there in the end, thankfully!",True,3,0
"[h3]Cyberpunk 2077: A Fully Realized Experience[/h3]
Cyberpunk 2077 has finally become the game it should have been from the start! The developers are still actively working on it, which is always a great sign.

Cyberpunk is truly a breathtaking and vibrant world, full of incredible detail. The number of side quests and stories is mind-blowing and adds a depth that's rarely found in other games! The main story is equally rich, packed with emotion, and filled with unforgettable characters, including the legendary Johnny Silverhand, who turns out to have a surprisingly compelling backstory.

The gameplay allows you to tackle missions however you like, whether through stealth, hacking, or action, while the RPG elements let you craft your own unique playstyle. On top of that, there are countless ways to play thanks to the various modules. The soundtrack is phenomenal, perfectly complementing this gritty and futuristic world.

What’s truly astonishing is the community's work on mods, which take the game to the next level. It enriches the experience like never before (and I highly recommend trying them).

Cyberpunk 2077 est finalement devenu le jeu qu’il aurait toujours dû être depuis longtemps ! Les développeurs continuent de travailler dessus ce qui fait toujours plaisir !
Cyberpunk est vraiment un monde magnifique et vivant, rempli de détails. Le nombres de quêtes et histoires secondaires sont bluffant et ajoute vraiment une profondeur qu'on trouve rarement dans les jeux !
L’histoire principale est aussi très riche, pleine d’émotion, et peuplée de personnages inoubliables, comme le bon vieux Johnny Silverhand qui au final est un personnage avec un beau background !

Le gameplay vous permet d’aborder les missions à votre manière, que ce soit par la furtivité, le hacking ou l’action, tandis que les éléments RPG vous permettent de façonner votre style de jeu. Vous avez aussi d'innombrable manière de jouer rien qu'avec les modules. La bande-son est phénoménale, complétant parfaitement ce monde futuriste et sombre.   

Et ce qui est vraiment juste bluffant c'est la communauté qui fait des mods de malade et ça enrichi le jeu comme jamais (et je vous conseil de tester)",True,2,0

"Great game. Short but great main story. Many fantastically developed side jobs and gigs. Fun character development. Fully immersive and detailed environment -- night city it beautiful, sometimes I catch myself in awe just staring at the scenes in front of me. Already on my second play through and still finding new locations, things, etc. 

Would be nice if the police system was developed better and if there were more places and people to interact with as you traveled through the city -- there are a lot of people and cars but the interactions are very shallow outside of jobs, gigs and the main story. Would be nice to have more romance options and after update 2.2, would be nice to have additional dialogue/interaction during the romancing between V and his/her partner in the apartment than the same thing over and over. 

Overall, best so-called RPG I've played in a long time. Definitely recommend the game.",True,2,0

I played at release. Horrible experience, you know what I mean!

I played a year or so after, finished the main story and most of Gigs an Biz. Ending was kind of meh for me personally. Therefore I watched the other endings and was happy with how the game evolved.

Now I played the DLC.
Nothing brand new. You have a main story, gigs and biz and some more open world action. It was a blast and I had much fun with it.
I experienced some minor bugs, nothing game breaking.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is not like many other games, at least for the first play through, maybe even the second. 

Your first play through will be filled with trying random things, having a great time, and also hearing a lot of really good dialogue and voice acting. It's going to make you want to play it again, and again, and eventually you will start to skip through it, but the gameplay still keeps you around, something keeps sucking you back in. 

Night City. That's what keeps you coming back in, once she gets her claws in you, you're never truly going to leave. Night City will chew you up, spit you out, you can rise to the highest highs, and fall to the lowest lows, experience the loss of so many people close to you. Yet you will still come back for more, just one more run, just one more build, just one more gig.

So wake up and go burn this city Samurai, burn your name into her so deeply she never forgets it. But remember, she can just as easily burn you. So in the end, whats more worth it to you?

"I won't take too long beating the same dead horse that's already been beating a 1000 times before. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the game had a disastrous launch, you've likely heard that CDPR lied & how now it's been experiencing a massive redemption arc the past couple years. 

[h3]And yes, it's TRUE.[/h3] CDPR hid, deceived, misled and outright actively LIED about the state of the game on release, lied about features and the way systems worked in the game. What is also true is that YES, they have made insane progress attempting to redeem this game and they DID redeem the game as a product if you can separate experience from the scummy/lying practices they exhibited 4 years ago.

[h3]If you can get past the past and focus on what the game offers you now, you're going to get one of the most technically impressive and impacting experiences you'll have in a long time. It's really an extraordinary game now. Now, let's focus on the actual review:[/h3]

[b]Positives:[/b]

1) Flat out, the game has what is in my opinion, at MINIMUM Top 5 writing for a video game ever. CDPR's unbelievably talent in this department only has gotten better and these guys ACED it here. The game understands and respects the power of immersion and goes the extra mile with all the small details. When the game sucks you in, you are IN.

2) Visually, it absolutely is as stunning as everyone has said it is. Top 3 all time from a graphical standpoint for me personally. From the under the hood technical capabilities of the game's lighting and fidelity, but also from the handcrafted world. It's constantly stunning at every step of the journey.

3) Really enjoyable and varied approaches to game-play with several different ways to build your character & approach objectives. It's also got that classic Morrowind feel where the game will let you become comically OP if you so choose. It won't restrict you. Wanna take a fast paced, physical melee approach, jumping over buildings and dashing at lightning speed in-between enemies?  You can. Wanna be a stealth operator, covertly subverting security systems, utilizing an arsenal of tools to avoid detection and taking out enemies with silent, precise strikes? You can. Wanna be an over the top, godlike net-runner who can drop every enemy in a building before even stepping foot in it? You can.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

1) The game world, while aesthetically, one of the best looking I've ever played, can sometimes feel a bit static & lacking in interactivity. There isn't a ton of interactivity and if you're coming from something like a Rockstar game world and expecting the same here, you won't get that.

2) The traffic is unfortunately still kinda horrible lol. The AI for drivers randomly just breaks and cars will just stop and stay stopped in the middle of the road and at stoplights. They've advertised that police chases are now fixed but honestly, it's still extremely underwhelming. You can be in the slowest of cars and instantly lose pursuers with basically zero resistance once you get a few streets away from the scene of the crime.

[h3]EXTRA: Also will shout out here, that Phantom Liberty, the expansion for the game takes all the positives of this game and basically DOUBLES it. Honestly the best content in the game and a must buy.[/h3]",True,1,0

+ Main story's a bit short, but there's a shitload of side quests to keep you busy.
+ It offers a wide range of choices when it comes to weapons and skill trees, allowing you to tailor your playstyle - whether that's stealth, gunplay, or melee combat.
+ It has amazing Mod support, extending the game's replay value.


Con:
-- Driving still SUCKS (at least for me). It feels like ice skating in a car - slippery, unresponsive, and completely lacking in weight or traction. It's a disappointment, especially since driving is such a big part of the game.
- Optimization is still subpar. I've encountered some game freezes and lag, particularly when entering crowded areas.


I think CDPR kinda redeem themselves after all these years of effort on Cyberpunk 2077, but it's still far away the game they promised in the first place. The current full price might be a bit steep for some players. Grab it on sale, and you'll likely feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

"It's unfortunate that many people were turned off by Cyberpunk 2077 because of its rough launch. I played it for the first time about two years after its release, following the 2.0 update, and aside from a couple of minor visual bugs, the experience has been incredible.

What immediately stood out to me was the game’s world because it’s simply the best I’ve ever played. Night City is not just visually stunning with its neon aesthetic, but it feels alive. Driving through the streets, taking in in the vibrant atmosphere, is an experience I'm sure you'll enjoy.

With the addition of the Phantom Liberty DLC, the game now offers two main story lines, both of which are fantastic. They've got well-developed characters and, most importantly, feature epic and emotional moments that make the story unforgettable.

The combat feels amazing, especially in the late game, where you can dominate enemies with ease after getting strong weapons and cyberware. However, the difficulty curve can be a bit uneven because you start off feeling weak, but by the end, you’re almost too strong, especially against some bosses.

Even after 125 hours in this game, I plan on coming back to try out different life paths and, more importantly, to make different decisions and see the new endings I can get. Admittedly, replaying the intro and going through the same early events can feel a bit tedious, but I’m still excited to dive back in. Plus, there are mods available that let you skip the intro if you really want to.

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 has truly become a classic in my eyes, and I have to shout out my bro, Johnny Silverhand. If you haven’t played the game or revisited it since the 2.0 update, I can confidently say it’s 100% worth giving it a shot, as is the Phantom Liberty DLC. While it might not change your life, it will definitely leave a lasting impression and keep you coming back for more.

"This is game is just mind blowing. My experience with this was so good and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The characters, story, game play, music and everything else this game offers is just crazy. I'm not gonna lie, this game kinda changed me, but that's besides the point. Of course, this game does have it's issues, bugs etc but it's massively overshadowed by the beautiful story.

"A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Immersion

Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning achievement that sets a new benchmark for immersive gaming experiences. From its richly detailed open-world setting to its compelling narrative, this game delivers on multiple levels, making it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and fans of futuristic storytelling alike.

World-Building and Atmosphere
Night City feels alive in every sense of the word. The attention to detail is phenomenal—neon-lit skyscrapers, bustling streets, and the layered history of its districts create a world that feels authentic and immersive. The city is not just a backdrop; it's a character in itself, brimming with life, danger, and intrigue.

Storytelling and Characters
The narrative is a standout feature. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a gripping story with deep, complex characters that leave a lasting impression. V’s journey, shaped by your choices, feels personal and impactful. The performances—especially Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand—are top-notch, adding depth and emotional weight to the story.

Gameplay and Customization
The gameplay is incredibly engaging, blending fast-paced action with RPG mechanics. The freedom to customize your playstyle—be it stealth, hacking, or all-out combat—ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. The array of cybernetic enhancements and weaponry offers endless possibilities for experimentation.

Visuals and Audio
Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. The lighting, textures, and attention to small details make Night City a visual feast. The soundtrack is equally impressive, perfectly complementing the cyberpunk aesthetic with its pulsating beats and atmospheric tracks.

Post-Launch Improvements
CD Projekt Red's commitment to improving the game post-launch deserves recognition. The updates have not only addressed initial issues but have also enhanced the overall experience, adding new features, content, and improved performance.

Conclusion
Cyberpunk 2077 is more than just a game; it's an experience. With its incredible storytelling, immersive world, and engaging gameplay, it stands as a testament to what ambitious game development can achieve. If you haven’t visited Night City yet, now is the perfect time.

⭐ Rating: 9.5/10

"All things considered, the way this game launched is worthy of all the negative technical criticism surrounding it. However what was not technical is absolute gold. The city, the atmosphere, the ambient music, the radio music, the score, the characters, the writing, all of it was genuinely trendsetting and puts most open world games released in its wake to shame. It's been 4 years of updates and DLC, and I think it's pretty telling that this game still pulls numbers today. I'm playing through it now and falling in love with the world again, nothing in the gaming landscape comes close to replicating the feeling of reading Neuromancer and the ambient calm of Blade Runner (in certain parts; all things considered this game is diametrically opposed to the tone and style of BR). I give this game my highest recommendation, it makes me feel a childlike wonder like nothing before.",True,1,0

"Across gaming platforms, I have over 800 hours in cyberpunk. Finished Phantom Liberty tonight after choosing reed in firestarter. I never write serious reviews, only jokey comments. But CDPR have created the greatest game, and potentially the greatest fictional story-line, of all time. take that with no pinches of salt, and as no exaggeration. Red Dead Redemption 2, widely considered as one of the best story games ever - to which I used to agree to be the number 1 - has absolutely nothing on this piece of writing. Love, Betrayal, Redemption, Hope, Evil, Lies, and genuine feelings. To complete a story like that is heart-breaking - gut wrenching if you will, but to complete it and then have that song play? with that piano? and that background visual of Myers and Hansen? Poetry. This review will end up in a tiktok talking about how the writer waffles about a game. But this isn't a game, its a fucking film, where you can blow someone up from blinking every so often. This game is so completely unrealistic, yet so realistic that it appears as a warning. 

Not only have CDPR put out the greatest composition of human emotion in the form of audio and visuals, but the comeback that came with it?? I was driving the bandwagon of C2077 haters in 2020. I quit the game after the braindance tutorial. I got a noti for 2.0 Update and tried it again. I will never be the same

If this is too much for a game review consider me apologetic, if this is what you needed to spend the money and buy the game, consider my purpose fulfilled. Shit I'll buy it for you.

"TL;DR: Cyberpunk is a good game and you shouldn't use it's launch as a reason not to buy it cause your missing out.
Yeah, the launch was absolutely horrific but CD:PR have worked on the game majorly since then and have turned it into (In my opinion): one of, if not THE greatest game of all time.
From stunning visuals to an emotional storyline, the base game has it all.
The characters from start to end vary massively but prove vital in order to enjoy the game, V's relationships are entirely the players choice which allows you to connect with the game majorly.
The storyline of the game is one of the most option reliant I have ever played, from dialogue to what V physically does; everything matters. 
The vehicle system is solid with some nice cars and motorbikes but for those who don't like to drive long distances ( unlike me, set the game to 2am and play Billy Idols ""Eyes without a face"" in the background and its absolute bliss), there are fast travel points for you to use although you do have to walk past or be within a vicinity of them for them to become available for use.
The weapon system is highly diverse, from rarities and tiers to attachments, there is something in this game for everyone to use to their own liking; for example, Those into using knives and other forms of melee weapons have Toxin Knifes, Katanas, Machetes and even a Dil** on a hilt for them to use, the amount of builds that you can create for your V is endless. This also adds to the games replayability as some people I know have completed the game 10 times over, each using different builds to change up their gameplay from the last.
Phantom Liberty was an amazing addition for the game as well. I love Idris Elba as an actor and think he fit the role of Reed perfectly, alongside Keanu as Silverhand. 
The additional story was perfect as were the choices, the new relationships with each newly added character helped fuel the storylines plot. Acting as a sort of ""spy"" showed a difference from the Main Game's story of being a ""gun for hire"" to actually working for the Government of the NUSA. 
Overall, Cyberpunk is a 10/10 game for me, especially after the horrid launch that it had after 12 years of development and I can't wait to see where this universe goes in the future.",True,1,0
"GTAlike with RPG and Dues Ex style stealth elements. Story is killer, but constantly following the GPS to the next mission can get old...

Good game over all.",True,1,0
"One of the best games in my option, revived my willing to play after buying different tittles and dropping them after few hours. This keeps me engaged. Love the modding options.",True,1,0
"Still getting continued support, has a really good story, pretty good game play, and impressive build variety. 

Also I'm in love with Panam",True,1,0
"
I absolutely loved playing Cyberpunk 2077! The game's stunning visuals, immersive open world, and detailed storytelling captivated me from the start. The futuristic city of Night City felt alive, filled with neon lights, dynamic NPCs, and a sense of chaos that added to its charm. The customization options for characters and gameplay styles allowed me to truly make the experience my own.

What stood out most were the gripping missions and the emotional depth of some characters, like Johnny Silverhand. The game had its flaws at launch, but I appreciated how CD Projekt Red worked hard to improve it over time. Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 delivered a thrilling and unforgettable experience, and it’s a game I’ll always look back on fondly.",True,1,0
Pre ordered and played it day one on xbox one. Never regretted it. I probably have several thousand hours in this all together. Multiple 100+ hr saves one was a bit over 140hr. Game was life changing for me,True,1,0
"You might have read many new positive reviews for this game, and i can say all that is true. As the game improves from the updates time to time, CDPR never stop making this game great. It's good to have so many improvements, the song, character voice, vehicle customization, hidden tips & tricks, easter egg from another CDPR games, etc. etc.

This game have a really touching stories from both side quest or main quest. I really suggest you buy the DLC (Phantom Liberty) too, beacuse it gives you some new story and new improvement for your progress :)

Overall 9/10 from me, really worth my 350 hours playing this game 3 times just to get all the endings :D",True,1,0
"They finally made this game what it was always meant to be, for the most part. The gameplay is some of the best in any game of this scope and every encounter feels perfectly balanced for whichever difficulty. The story isn't as branching as I thought it would be, but it's still a great game. Feels very polished now aside from occasional small bugs that are definitely excusable and don't break the game. Makes me feel how I felt playing Skyrim and Dishonored for the first time. Pick this one up when it goes on sale with the DLC.",True,1,0

Cyberpunk 2077. 250h on this game but still i want to play it more. The endless posibilities how you can play it... The endless possibilities of how you can decide where the storry will go.... Amazing game. Story is insanely good. Surroundings insane. It is like being i your favourite series. Except you make the story. Insane visuals+story combo. Cant wait for more games like this. Hopefully other game industries will learn something from CDPR games. Witcher was fantastic and Cyberpunk was even better. Game of the decade for me!,True,1,0
"I am enjoying this one a lot.  It's a culmination of so many pop culture references that I love like Blade Runner, the Matrix, hell even Idiocracy....and it plays like a GTA game.
I like story-driven single player games, especially other ones from CDPR and I haven't been disappointed.

 The graphics look amazing, the only real bug I've even seen in 30 hours was someone standing in a bench instead of sitting on it.  I understand this was a big concern at launch, but I'm not having a bad experience with bugs presently.
And beware of the gratuitous nudity LOL",True,1,0
"Played the game when it came out on Xbox One. It was horrendous overall, rushed out for maximum profit at Christmas time and backed with false promises, and it's become infamous. But what got me through was the story; The one thing you can't patch. So now, CDPR has gotten most of their street cred back, as they stuck with the game and made it into what it should've been. It's still not the insane game promised leading up to its release, and it will never be. But holy it is amazing

Especially with Phantom Liberty, this is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. and I would very easily consider it a masterpiece. If there's one lesson to be learned from the game's release though, it's to avoid being a gonk by pre-ordering. I would say unless it's FromSoftware but you never know, as CDPR is an extremely trusted and reputable developer just like they are.

If you play the game WATCH CYBERPUNK EDGERUNNERS TOO

"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of those game that really left an impression on me and before buying this game, I played the game illegally and instantly fell in love with the people, the city and the MC and at the time I already had 60hrs+ of gameplay then I got the game legally (with the help of someone) and the rest is history. 

This game has help me view the world differently and it has helped me go through 2024. I played this game in the middle of 2024 and took a break before continuing it in December and now this game has hold a special place in my heart. It's remarkable how it made me depressed and happy at the same time.",True,1,0
"A lot has been said about this game. I just finished Phantom Liberty and mostly just wanted to leave this comment as a reminder to myself of the experience I had with this game. Years back when I saw the first trailer of Cyberpunk, I remember the hopes and excitement I felt for what it might become. Looking back now, all of those hopes have been realised and exceeded by CDPR. I can't think of any experience more ""Cyberpunk"" than this game. A true masterpiece.",True,1,0
"Truly one of the greatest games of all time. The story is incredible, full of emotion, thrills and amazing characters. Night City is one of the best cities in gaming, feeling alive and stunning to look at. Cherami Leigh as V is easily one of the best performances I've ever seen. And if this wasn't enough the expansion Phantom Liberty adds on so much content and story it's basically a new game in itself and it hits all the highs, and maybe even more, of the base game. Soundtrack is excellent and memorable all the way through. Overall it is easily one of the best gaming experiences out there and absolutely worth a play! 10/10",True,1,0
I cant recommend this game enough in the state it is now. CD PROJECT RED did the impossible and turned a failed promise of a game into a masterpiece. Definitely recommend playing at least once but then one play through isn't enough you're going to find yourself playing again and again and again and its totally worth it. Please do yourself a favor and get Phantom liberty as well. A Beautiful DLC you wont want to miss,True,1,0
"I can only say Thank you, CDProjekt, for bringing this piece of art into the world, even if it started like shit, it ceirtainly molded into a game i'll never forget, it has ceirtainly affected me quite a bit, and now i feel empty after finishing it...Thank you.",True,1,0
"I avoided to buy the game at launch. I did not expect to enjoy the game so much (because I am not super interested about the world of Cyberpunk).  But the world is so well built, and the majority of the quests are so well written, it completely sucked me in (despite some of the obvious massive cuts concerning character plot and development, and in spite of the dumb ai and extremely simplistic police triggers which can be very annoying until you figure out how to avoid them).

Despite my initial worries, Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba are not some gimmick cameos, they are major characters in the game, and I think they carry the game story on their broad shoulders and absolutely sell they characters they play. Without them, I do not think the game would have been as immersive. Jason Hightower (Jackie), Rome Kanda (Goro) and Emily Woo Zeller (Panam) are also amazing. 

The game still has some silly bugs, but none are gamebreaking. 

Giant recommend from me. Completely worth its full price, but it is often 50% off. An absolute steal, really.",True,1,0

"Well, I finally finished it four years later. Version 2.2 is certainly a much better game than was released in 2020.

The worldbuilding and graphics are top notch. It's a very beautiful world. During the first few hours you can certainly lose yourself in immersion -- don't rush through Act I too fast. However, the veneer of immersion is paper thin -- the relative emptiness and sameyness of the world becomes quite clear after some repetition, especially the filler content with NCPD scanner hustles.

The story content is uneven. Act I is *amazing*, followed by multiple possible paths, some more interesting than others. The open world curse is here in full effect: with so many avenues to pursue, the red line of engaging plot is easily lost. Don't overdo side content at the cost of main story, or you might never make it to the end.

Phantom Liberty is quite clearly the best story arc of the entire game, being much more contained, so definitely play that content the moment it becomes available. I wish the rest of the game was on this storytelling level. The characters are somehow much better developed here, Johnny Silverhand very much included.

The game is *way* too easy on normal, at least when playing with a keyboard and mouse. Start on hard or very hard, otherwise you're going to be ridiculously overpowered very early on. Unfortunately stealth gameplay rarely feels worth it; it's so much easier to just use a silenced gun and start shooting. Apart from a few audio messages congratulating you after a gig, the game mostly doesn't care how you solve the challenges it puts in front of you.",True,1,0

"Incredible. The game's atmosphere is top notch. For reference, I greatly enjoyed the open-world, environmental story-telling aspect of Fallout 4, but I found the main story to be lack-luster. Cyberpunk 2077 delivers on the environmental story-telling AND the main story. It is truly the whole package. Furthermore, the game is fully enjoyable on less-than premium hardware. Yes, ray-tracing and path-tracing look incredible on the 4080, 4090, etc., but I played the entire game with these features turned off, and the visuals were still jaw-dropping. The gameplay is solid enough. The shooting is satisfying, and the enemies aren't bullet sponges (they might be if you invest points into mostly tech / net skills, but I built my character around pistols and snipers. Whatever the case, the combat balances aptly to your play style). There is also great re-playability (I didn't touch melee weapons or in-depth hacking for my first run, but doing so for a second run will alter the gameplay significantly). Lastly, the performances are solid. They're not on the level of RDR2, but I found myself caring for many of the characters, even if some could be a tad stiff (which I think is excusable for a game of this scope). I highly recommend.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is one the most well written games I have ever touched, every corner I turn I continue to find more and more characters that feel like they could be the most in depth part of any other game, yet in Cyberpunk they are a one off side character. The game presents its stories in such a way that can pull at ones heartstrings and morals and leaving them questioning if they made the right choice hours later. 
All of this is able to work so well because the world makes it all so believable, the lights of Night City and the dust ridden roads of the Badlands make everything that much more immersive

Weapons, the amount of weapons in Cyberpunk is honestly absurd, if you enjoy having choice well they give you what feels like 100's of choices, a downside to this however is some weapons even Iconic weapons can tend to blend together at times and feel very similar even when they are supposed to be different weapons

Cyberpunks difficulty and repetitiveness are some of its few flaws but flaws easily fixed by the player themselves. At times it will seem that enemies are a joke and bodies drop like flies which requires a simple switch to fix, while in one off instances it can seem like the game has decided to summon god himself to smite you down in your tracks making you question your difficulty switch, however this only happens about 3-4 times total making it bearable. 

TLDR: Some of the best character writing of the decade, a comical arsenal of weapons for players to use, and  random difficult spikes that require one switch to fix for said encounters.",True,1,0

The base game story was okay, but the expansion storyline really gets good. My main criticism is that by the end of the game some of the long winded dialogue was starting to grind on me.

"[h3] The love of gaming and respect for players, congratulations LCD Project. [/h3]


[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]
Two particularly important things to say about Cyberpunk 2077.

1: It's been a very long time since I've been so sad to finish a game.
This game is fantastic, the story is perfect and, in my opinion, Cyberpunk is in the same category as Mass Effect.
It's evidence that today's devs can still make games the old- style way. Devs who neglect single-player games in favor of multiplayer, such as Call of, should take a lesson from Cyberpunk.
There's never been a Call of to rival Cyberpunk.
I could hate Cyberpunk because this universe makes me nauseous, the model of what the world can become if we don't fight against all this wokist ideology and other leftist stupidity.
But it's not disturbing to evolve in this universe, because this game is in no way wokist.
We have a choice of road(Nomad, Corpo...) from the start of the game, and choosing one is already a sign of the fight against Wokist ideology.
We can fight this ideology, the degenerate universe we're stuck in, by choosing what we want to be and who we want to follow.

2:I'm going to close this interlude on the wokism that's destroying gaming right now by telling you about the second thing that I think is great about Cyberpunk.
Character creation: it may come as a surprise to talk about this for a gamer of my generation, since I belong to the free generation, the one that saw the possibility of creating a character that suits us.
But today, creation is undermined by this wokist ideology that wants everything to be for them, and like them, we no longer see many games in which we have the freedom to be what we want to be.
This also shows LCD Project's talent, as it's not easy to offer this option in a game, as it requires a lot of work.
Allowing us to create our own character isn't incredible, but it's a nice sign of respect.
LCD Project respects us, they respect who we are even if we don't have the same ideas as them, the same taste or the same orientation, that's not saying much but in this wokized world it's wonderful.
THANK YOU !!!

The choices:
Choices have a real importance in this game, I've never felt such importance in the choices I made during the game and especially at the end.
I remained true to my choices throughout the game, and I'm a very tough person who always assumes his choices and his positions, but in this game I suffered for my choices, despite that I assume them and I don't want to change them.
I never thought a game could make me feel something so strong, offer so much freedom in our decisions and have so much impact on our evolution in the game.
Sorry, Johnny.

I'd also like to talk about gunfighting, because that's also something fabulous about this game.
The weapons are wonderful, there's something for every taste, and those who know me well can well imagine that I went there with my big machine gun.
But in Cyberpunk I fell in love with shotguns, and I boosted my character for ultra-fast reloading because there are only two bullets in my toy.
Two bullets with ultra-high damage, it hurts, I shoot in all directions in close combat, enemies do backflips and scatter all over the ground, I'm totally ecstatic.
It's even better than my cock.

See you in 2078!!!

[h1] Graphic design: [/h1]
Today, the game is bug-free and never lags with my configuration.
I'd expected the map to be bigger, but the work really is of the highest quality.
LCD Project has done an excellent job.

[h1] Playtime: [/h1]
100 hours to finish the story mode with all the sub-missions, it's fabulous, this game is worth its price and really deserves to be bought and played.


[h3] I hope that LCD Project doesn't sink any further into wokist ideology, and that they continue to amaze us with their talent.
Let us be what we want to be, love us as we are and we'll love you for what you give us. [/h3]

"One of the greatest games of all time, after about 15 hours with mods and another 2 full playthroughs without i can confidently say in my opinion this is the best game of the decade and I will argue anyone who disagrees",True,2,0
"Cyberpunk was one of those games I picked up during a sale and thought nothing of it. I'd heard all about the somewhat disastrous initial release and the the state the game was in. I had heard online that the 2.0 update had done wonders and decided that if it still sucked, at least I bought it for less money than the full price. 
I was entirely unprepared for the wild ride that 2077 would be taking me on. I can honestly say that this is a game that remains truly interesting all the way through, from the very start - whatever that looks like per playthrough due to the existence of various life paths - to the very end. Every character was vibrant and had real depth to them. NPCs were interesting. Even obscure little side jobs had substance to them. 
Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible game that is both faithful to its original source material, and also provides so much more to the dark future. The only problem I have with it is my lack of ability to be able to experience the game with fresh eyes all over again, with no idea what to expect.",True,1,0
"First off: Thank you Steam for not saving my Notes, I literally had a novel written in those notes, but apparently they don't save sometimes, so I do have to do this little Review off the top of my hat instead of being able to use my notes for when my thoughts were fresh.

So, I try to cobble something together. I last played Cyberpunk in Version 1.06 on January 5th, 2021 and at that time I had 66.4 hours clocked. I remember I was not even close to finishing the Game, because as with me and many ""larger"" Games (e.g. The Witcher, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and 4, Starfield and many more), after a while I was just overwhelmed. I did a ton of Sidequests/Sidestuff, what I always want to do in those larger Games before I get into the meat of the Game (Mainquest). 
The problem for me is, it gets so much, that I put in 60-100 hours into the Game and then just stop playing it. Sure, this is a me problem, but this is one of the reasons I stopped playing Cyberpunk. (And at the time Destiny 2 I guess.)
Fast forward to December 2023, took a holiday, planned on playing, didn't get to it at all.
But this year (actually last year, started on December the 18th 2024) would be different and what a perfect timing it was. Took another ~3 Weeks Holiday from work and right before I started, Update 2.2 got released and I bought Phantom Liberty as well when it came out.
So I started a new Character/Game with the Nomad Path and for ~3 Weeks I lived in Night City.
And I really mean that, I lived in this Game. I never thought I would say this, but I even 100%ed Cyberpunk 2077. Steam says now I have 261 hours on the clock, although I took a few ""breaks"" while still being ingame, which means that I put nearly 200 hours into the Game just for this playthrough. And it could've been way more, I even got some more Sidecontent at the end which I didn't do and I could've explored and lived in Night City for a lot longer.
But it had to end, I want to move on to other pastures.

I can tell you: I really am glad that I finally got to play it. This Game (and I include Phantom Liberty here, because for me it was one, full experience) is actually a masterpiece.
You have this huuuuuge City (and Outer City) and literally so many Details in EVERY nook and cranny, it is insane what they did here. 
The Game ran smooth as butter on my i5-13600k, 3060Ti, 32GB Ram, installed on a SSD. It did before in 2021 as well for me on a RTX 2060 Super and some kind of i5-9600, 16GB Ram I think?! At one time I had a problem with my GPU or Case Fans, but that problem was before playing this. Apart from that: Zero hitches, the Game ran perfect. Even with RTX on and everything fully maxed. (Because of my Fan Problem I had to turn off RTX after a while though, not a Game Problem.)

And since this Game looks really, really awesome (still better than many Games released in 2024 or later) you can imagine that the immersion here is on another level.
Add to that EXCELLENT Sound Design in every way and AMAZING Voice Actors (yes, they are equal with Baldur's Gate 3 Voice Acting, maybe even better in some parts and yes, there were a few bad ""Actors"", especially some YouTubers - don't really know why they include them...) and you have even more immersion.

Sometimes the City itself felt chaotic and overwhelming. So many sights, sometimes 5-10 sounds from TV's and Radios overlapping, people talking over one another in dialogues but I think this is part of the experience. This is what a Cyberpunk City would feel like. It feels alive and real. (Kinda like GTA V or Red Dead...)
Also when you are in Dialogues, the people you talk to move natural. It just feels real and (again) immersive.

The ingame Music is also great, the Radio Stations I have to critique a little. They were not super great, I kind of wish there were way more tracks and way more stations. A few good songs/tracks here and there, sure, but you will hear all of them hundreds of times and the variety was lacking a bit.

Regarding bugs: In a Game this big, there were almost no bugs. Yeah sure, a few here and there with some elongated necks, some visual glitches here and there but really, they are not worth talking about. I know about the state of the Game when it came out (even though even at this time I didn't encounter many bugs/glitches) but I played it now fully and it was great. 1 Crash and 1 Mission Restart, that's it...

So yeah, atmosphere was also amazing. Sundowns, Sun rising, rain, Sandstorm, Nighttime, Neon Lights everywhere, everything is handcrafted. The lighting on the smallest surfaces... *mwah* (Chef's Kiss!)
And I really did everything (apart from maybe 1-2 Sidethings at the end because as mentioned, I wanted it to end now after watching/playing 8-10 (?) different endings.
Every mission, side and main, handcrafted, everything feels different. This also the perfect mix between RPG, Shooter (shooting and melee all feel great here) and Imsim.
Whoa, sorry for rambling but yeah, this Game will stick with me for a long time.

Regarding the endings: [spoiler] They were all kind of (semi) depressing. They all dealt with a ""Death"" thematic and for me, who has to live with cancer, death is a constant reminder for me every day, some of those endings hit kinda hard [/spoiler].

Oh man, I had so much more to say, but I try to put a sock in it because this ""Review"" has to end, also. I am just glad I finally got around to playing it and experiencing this masterpiece of a game in it's whole.
This is a 10/10 Game for me, same with Baldur's Gate.

"This game is a true masterpiece, and its greatness has only grown over time. The developers have supported the project for nearly four years, consistently improving and expanding it. My recommendation? Play this game! The story mode is deeply emotional, mature, and incredibly immersive. Once you finish it, you'll feel a mix of happiness and emotional connection that few games can deliver.
Each character in the game is thoughtfully crafted, charismatic, and engaging. They never feel boring, and their stories add layers of depth to the experience.

[h1]My Journey Through Night City[/h1]
My first playthrough was in 2020 patch 1.05, where I chose the Nomad lifepath for my V. Now, during my second playthrough on patch 2.2, I decided to go with the Corpo lifepath, offering a fresh perspective and new experiences.
What can I say? Cyberpunk 2077 is still a masterpiece today. The developers have shown unwavering respect for their product, and the game runs smoothly now without any issues.

The graphics are stunning, with excellent attention to detail. Shadows, textures, and models are all top-tier, creating a visually captivating world that draws you in at every turn.

[h1]DLC: Phantom Liberty[/h1]
This DLC is exceptional and absolutely worth purchasing! You may wonder, ""Why should I buy it?"" Here's my answer: it’s pure GOLD.
In Phantom Liberty, you take on the role of a Special Agent, akin to working for the CIA or FBI. The expansion introduces unique perks for your character, along with a wealth of new main and side quests. These quests are exciting, well-written, and anything but boring. The DLC enriches the game and makes it feel even more complete.

[h1]Cyberpunk: Edgerunners[/h1]
I’m not typically an anime fan, but Edgerunners truly impressed me. Thanks to CD Projekt Red and Netflix, this anime delivers an engaging and memorable story. If you have free time, it’s definitely worth watching, you won’t regret it.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The soundtrack is nothing short of epic. The music elevates the gaming experience, creating an emotional connection as you play. Don't forget about the radio stations, each one offers a distinct genre and great songs that perfectly fit the game's atmosphere.

"Nowadays, it's an amazing time to be a patient gamer. I can't imagine how frustrating it must have been to play this game at launch. After all the hype, diving into such an appealing story only to be constantly reminded of its unfinished and unpolished state by countless bugs and glitches must have been disappointing 😥 Thankfully, today, almost all of those issues have been fixed, and most of the promised features have been added, at least to SOME extent (aside from the cancelled standalone multiplayer). Sure, there are still occasional visual or physics-related bugs, but nothing that breaks the game or shatters the immersion - and for me, immersion is what this game is all about.

The world and city are some of the most diverse in style and visually captivating virtual environments ever created. Nearly every nook and cranny is a joy to explore and just straight out screenshot material. The lore is equally compelling, with shards, ads, slang, environmental storytelling and fascinating tech that add even more depth to the world. Another standout feature is the game's staging. The first-person cutscenes are some of the most engaging, immersive, and lengthy (in a good way) I've ever seen in any FPS game. Add to that a perfectly fitting (and now, to some extent, even iconic) soundtrack, and it’s just the icing on the cake.

The only thing that slightly dragged the experience for me was the interface and controls. While these things have been improved in many ways over the years, they still feel largely console-focused and take some getting used to. But that’s a minor gripe. Because after 80 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Cyberpunk is truly cyberpeak and a must have game 😎

Sometimes even just the random npcs talk to eachother about stuff thats been happening.

"[h1] Review: Cyberpunk 2077 - A place where all kinds of people meet [/h1]
2020 | played time: 112 hours | 8/10 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a very story-centric role-play game based on a tabletop role-playing game from the late 1980s. It is developed and published by CD Project Red which pulls you into a potential dystopian future of our world.

The game begins in one of three variants in the year 2076 depending on the background choice made for V, the protagonist, in the character creation. The first act begins with V working as a mercenary in Night City. However, after working a few gigs life takes an unexpected turn. In the second act, V is hit by the reality of the aftermath of the preceding act and tries his best to survive. 
The story of V progresses through the main story missions and a vast number of optional side quests in the open world. The relating cutscenes and dialogues are mostly set within the open world creating immersion, however waiting for a quest to start at the given location can feel disruptive. The side quests also include options to have romantic affiliations with some characters depending on the gender and sexual orientation of the protagonist. Night City is traversed by V in first person, by different means of transport such as by foot or in vehicles. The latter has an unusually unnatural handling to it. The fighting system seems rather unrealistic in a game with an immersive intent where one shot to the head does not result in immediate death of either V or some enemies. One the other hand, this would make certain play styles such melee builds unviable. Cyberpunk 2077 invites to capture moments by providing a photo mode. The world provides several apartments, and looting is possible at almost every corner. However, a missing survival system makes the apartments and most of the lootable consumables close to obsolete. 
Cyberpunk 2077 can be modified which is made very accessible through third-party mod-menus. These modifications offer extensive possibilities to improve graphics and visuals, immersion and quality of life, or simply adding assets such as cars.
The world is created with a lot of attention to detail though the huge size of Night City and the vastness of the Badlands. The city and the surroundings can be explored by various modes of travel such as by foot, with the metro or with vehicles. The latter have a unique and unordinary futuristic design due to the view of the late 1980s. The city captures the feeling of a de facto corporatocracy and the power of corporation through the many towering skyscrapers and other buildings. The 3-dimensional possibilities of such building by using balconies, bridges and other levels reachable through elevators are well explored though substantial potential in this area is left untapped. Night City offers a huge variety of places including bars and other vendors which can be explored. A short fall is that not every street vendor is interactable by the protagonist. Completely missing but essential in a city of this size are supermarkets and at least one proper mall. Though there are several markets which are a substitute for the latter. The city offers different districts, each with a unique style and architecture reflecting the different socio-economic backgrounds living there. However, the gradient between districts can feel noticeably abrupt. The world experiences different weathers such as rainfall or fog. Analog to the previous aspect, the weather changes in the game are also very abrupt. Although the map is beautifully created, the slope changes in hilly areas are jaggy and some on- and off-ramps are unrealistically steep. While walking around in back alleys, piles of garbage can be found. However, due to the solid design of the assets any disturbance in the arrangement of the piles results in a hail of garbage bags.
The sound is very neatly designed. As such stepping on different materials makes different sounds. The immersion is furthered by having sounds for moving glass bottles and cans. The sound design of the vehicles is very well made. The radio and the music selection offer a good variety and various genres. All the characters’ voice actors did an astounding job capturing the emotions of the characters. Unfortunately, very noticeable is the sudden high-pitched detection sound which is played upon detection by an enemy while stealthing ripping the player out of the immersion.
Overall, the game is nicely balanced from a graphics point of view. Though the resolution of the textures and the fidelity of the assets are below the expectation of a game released in 2020. Additionally, though pleasing for the eye, the color grading is rather warm which is a mismatch for a dystopian futuristic megacity. Furthermore, the contrast in the game is tuned a bit too high resulting in an unrealistic feeling. Fortunately, modifications to adjust the postprocessing filters exist to remedy these shortcomings.
The main story of Cyberpunk 2077 is structured into three acts including a prologue, interlude and epilogue. Most notably, the storyline is anything but railroaded. As such a huge amount of optional side quests are available forming V’s story in Night City. The order for the parallel running side storylines is mostly irrelevant giving the sensation of immersion in the world and actually living the life of V. Also noticeable is the feeling of impact of the decisions that need to be made in the life of V and the related events and people. News coverage of world events also increases immersion and the sensation of living in Night City. Unfortunately, due to this setup, the urgency of progression created by certain events is disregarded and minorly breaks the logic of the plot. However, time is still given the due significance by having waiting times between quests and forcing the player to explore the world. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a must play for any singleplayer roleplay game enthusiast. It offers a great and very immersive experience. The story offers a lot of freedom in decisions all affecting the outcome in some way. Graphically, the game is not up to par with other titles released in that year. But the story and the world design are worth overlooking the minor flaws the game has.",True,3,0

Partly because I am fascinated with the advancement of technology in this industry, but also because even on day one I knew that the open world they made here was special. I don't think there is any game out there including Skyrim that has a world that feels more lived in and real. Especially now that they've cleaned the game up MAJORLY. Has there ever been a come back story like this? Well yes, look at No Man's Sky. But this game is great, gets better every day. Oh, and mods.",True,1,0
"Very good game that made a ""No Mans Sky tier"" redemption. Not only is the game mostly bug free, but since 2.2 and PL, there has been so much added content, and much needed refinement of gameplay systems. The end result is that progression feels better, both in terms of character levels/skills and weapons/cyberware upgrades.

I highly recommend this game for the amazing & relatable characters, believable & awesome story, and even the side quests are interesting. Seriously, you won't find any standard fetch quests here. Everything is voice acted and well thought out.

I put 90 hours into my first characters playthrough, finishing about 75% of the content available; including all main quests from base game and PL, most side quests, but not many gigs or fixer jobs. My second playthrough on Steam I plan to complete every gig and side job.

Cyberpunk 2077 also has a great modding scene, including all types of mods from QoL updates, to complete overhauls.

"Having completed the game I can finally say something with full responsibility. In fact it felt pretty obvious after several hours in - this is a 10/10 classic. I have given devs time to sort their sh and went with mature version of the game, along with PL. In terms of quality - there are still some bugs, but not really different vs typical Bethesda game. You can complain about some mechanics as there are clearly titles that did better in some aspects, but picking this game you come for rich story within Cyberpunk world - and the game delivers the goods impressively. I set the bar high and was still awed. The writing is really good - if you've done stuff that on paper is wrong, but feel elation about doing the right thing - that's huge.

Note that the title is PEGI18 for a reason. And no: it's not violence or nudity (though this is the first title I ever played where you customize your plug/socket or pubic hairstyle). The game aims to give you a proper taste of what Cyberpunk world is and is pretty brutal about it. This is some disturbing stuff and honestly not something I would give my kid to play carlessly. You have been warned.

However as the effect is achieved - it's not flooding you with disturbing content all the time. The prevailing theme of dehumanization is the vibe of the world, but there are lots of emotions you can go through, some pretty stuff, some ugly, but never really one-dimensional.

Acting is superb, Characters are fleshed out and background stories can seriously alter the feel of the game. This is a great game and it's definitely worth going through alternative endings (both PL/main game) - it gives you a range of emotions and this is what I came here for. This is a true gem. Bring on the sequel.",True,1,0
"Cyberpunk 2077 is far and away one of the most intricately detailed open-world action RPGs ever created, if not the most. It's atomic complexity in both systems and storytelling is matched only by the energy of its moment-to-moment gameplay. The writing far outweighs genre standards, and even the studio's iconic previous outings. This is an incredibly special piece of media; something that could have only been created in the here and now, under specific circumstances by an extremely talented team. 

With 4 years of improvements and an enormous DLC under its belt, I'm so glad I finally decided to see what Night City has to offer. It's an experience I won't soon forget.",True,1,0
"I love the game wholeheartedly to simply put it, but it needs better mod support. It drives me crazy trying to manually install mods onto the files because I get lost and then I don't know what to do at that point. Maybe a mod menu could help us with that.",True,1,0
"Beautiful and dense open world, interesting story and characters, fast-paced and visceral combat (unless you prefer stealth, which can also be fun). Lots of replay value as well with dozens of side quests and smaller encounters, which can get repetitive but are still varied, with added lore and storytelling, adding character to the world.
The skill trees accommodate a number of different play styles which, in addition to cyberware and weapon types, allow for interesting build crafting, again adding replay value.

I bought the game after Update 2.1 and my experience was mostly bug-free, although I have had some bosses freeze during fights... other than that, I think this is a very good game and by the looks of it, much better now than at launch.",True,1,1

"At launch, this game was absolutely dog water, but now, it's finally at a place where it's worth getting. Bug fixes, performance optimizations, plenty of mods, and a really good DLC.

The graphics are gorgeous, the story is decent, the voice acting is mediocre, and the gameplay is super fun. You've got a big open world to explore and various paths to choose. While your background has zero impact, your choices do, as you can pursue one of several endings, all of which are different. There's also romance for those of you who care about that, customization, and more.

All in all, it's a pretty good game now. I wish it had been even half this good at launch, but anyway, I recommend this, especially on sale.",True,1,0

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 is not without its faults, and the launch experience should serve as a reminder of the importance of delivering polished products. However, the game's strengths—its great gameplay, immersive world, compelling characters, and impactful storytelling—far outweigh its shortcomings. It’s a vibrant experience that invites players to explore the depths of its narrative and engage with its rich world. While it's not perfect (because nothing truly is), I still RECOMMEND diving into Night City for an unforgettable journey!",True,0,0
"Fantastic gameplay, beautiful visuals, great voice acting, stellar music, incredible storytelling, great characters, and an incredible DLC. It does still have its bugs every now and then, but its Cyberpunk, you're bound to pick up a bugged braindance, happens to the best of us! Highly, highly recommend, become a Legend!",True,0,0
"The story is fantastic, the lore is incredibly deep, and the world feels truly alive. Gameplay-wise, this is the best and most versatile shooter RPG of all time. And I'm saying this without even having played the DLC (even though I own it).

I'm grateful to have experienced this story in my lifetime.",True,0,0
"Not since Baldur's Gate 3 have I found a game so time-destroyingly compelling to play. Glad I waited all this time to buy/try it as nearly all the bug drama of the launch has been solved. This game is a masterpiece and I say this as someone who HATES open world games. I'm totally obsessed. 

My only critique is that I wish it was easy to respec. Now that I've played speedy samurai knife build, I'd like to try netrunner with the option to simply return back if I don't like the build, but I refuse to give up my progress and gear just to try something new. Starting over from square 1 after 100+ hours to potentially not like a build is just too much time commitment.",True,0,0
"This game is still VERY buggy but it's playable. I really enjoy the story, however, the first person makes me think that the devs are too lazy. I'm not a big fan of grinding for fancy costumes just to only see them in my inv. Imaging having a third person pov, which allows us to see fancy animations with trace effect while using katana and sandevistan.

Yet the game is still enjoyable, just if you love CDPR other projects, you will feel quite disapointed.",True,0,0

The whole weapon/net-stuff/cyberware and perk system was hard to grasp at first, but then I loved it. I didnt like the vehicles much, the driving model was just weird.

The ""open world"" doesn't sport a million things to do and other games do it better, but everything about the game exudes the cyberpunk vibe so well. Very immersive. Also, the writing -- like is standard for CD Projekt Red games -- is top notch, the side quests are mostly good, and the subject matter of some of the quests are still lingering in my head years later.",True,0,0
"I was fortunate to start playing this game after they had fixed all the issues which existed at the launch of the game. Well I mean there are still some bugs in the game, but not any major ones. 
If you ignore all that, the game is very immersive. I feel like I've been living a completely different life the past couple of months, driving around and exploring Night City, doing gigs, meeting new people. It's awesome.

The immersion and the story is what kept me playing this game. The Phantom Liberty DLC was worth every penny. It is more of a linear and concentrated experience which is what made it so good. If you buy Cyberpunk, you have to play the DLC. *Chef's kiss*
And there are so many different endings to the game's story worth experiencing. A lot of games with which let's you choose your path eventually branches back and ends the same way but this game is very different. The devs created so many different endings to the game I felt like a time traveler changing the outcome of it all by just choosing a different path.

The combat is okay, I mostly played a Netrunner build through the whole game, which started to get a bit boring after a while. It was super fun though stealthing through missions though. If you want to really have fun in combat, play a melee combat build instead. Or have a more varied playstyle. Try different things, they made it possible to respecc freely so do that. I didn't. xD",True,0,0

The Phantom Liberty DLC brings a more lineair gameplay section which really works well. It goes back to the open world formula after that section, but I want to see more lineair section when it's this well executed.

The gameplay is incredibly engaging, offering tons of ways to approach combat, build your character, and explore.

"TLDR: 
- Pros: Amazing game now that is fixed. Fun gameplay and Interesting story and universe. Amazing DLC. 
- Cons: Sometimes animations in gameplay feel a little clunky and there are occasional NPC glitches.

Starting by saying that the game is not the mess it was when it was released (2020). 
I always had fate that CDPR was going to fix that mess, so I waited years to be able to play it as it was intended (or close to it) and it was worth it. This game alongside No Man Sky is one of the biggest redemption in gaming.

The game has a really good story, the gunplay and gameplay in general is really fun. You can create different builds for your character (Play as a Netrunner, Berserkerish, a god gunslinger, etc).
Night City feels very dense, you can walk to your destination and find a lot of paths where you can go, it feels alive considering the limitation of the amount of NPCs and it looks amazing graphically.

Also if you are looking to play it? Consider buying Phantom Liberty DLC (More like an expansion tbf). The story told by PL it's very good, i even like it more that the original campaign hahah. They really went all in with it, you wont regret it.

And the best part? Mods, as other CDPR games the game can be heavily modded and even the developers give the tools to the community to create more stuff (I'm looking at you Rockstar). There are a lot of mods that improves the game like QoL, graphics and lighting mods, etc and a lot more. I personally only modded the game with those since it was my first playthrough and i didn't want to affect the vanilla game experience that much.

My only cons with the game are that during gameplay some animations feel very clunky, specially during ""finishers"" and also there are occasionally glitches with the NPCs walking or driving. If you remember the times of ""Cyberbug 2077"" you should know what i mean, some of those bugs are still there, but like i said very occasionally compared to those times lol.

"After waiting for the patches to come and watching the peak that was Edgerunners, I decided to give Cyberpunk a try. From the moment I dove into this game I was drawn into this sprawling, futuristic metropolis with cool guns, great story, and cyber-augmented shawties. The biggest upside about Cyberpunk is how immersive it is. With its first person perspective, fleshed out characters, and detailed environments, it is so easy to get lost in Night City and its outskirts. I was locked in to this game and the relationships you form with its characters and its crazy sci-fi concepts. Also Panam (iykyk)

"4 years ago when the game came out, i played the PS4 version. I dropped it very early since the game was functionally unplayable on release day. But i decided to give the game another shot, so i purchased both the game and it's adjacent DLC, thinking i might've wasted 50 bucks, but i wasn't disappointed. Let's start from the top:


> The Gameplay:

- Looking back, the 1.0 version of the game feels radically different, it's kinda jarring actually. The gunplay was pretty unsatisfying, and the skill trees were very lacking in impact. Nowadays, the game feels much better to play. The guns feel much better to use (I thank the sound design for that), the skill trees, and, especially the cyberware, have a much bigger impact on the player, which turns you from a wet napkin blowing in the wind, to a FUCKING MENACE. Honestly surprised there weren't extra lines of dialogue in-game to intimidate large corporations or so-called ""hotshots"" since by the time you reach PL, you solo the entirety of Night City with no problems.


> The Story:

- Not gonna go to in-depth about the plot, since i don't wanna spend 3 hours writing a review, but i'll sum up my thoughts. I love the story in this game, and i always have loved it, even when the game came out. I mostly learned the story cause i watched videos of the game being played on PC, but the writing is lovely. It makes you feel for a lot of the characters, and the V and Johnny dynamic is very interesting. One element of the story i love the most is that if you don't play through all of the endings, you'll never fully understand the story. This holds especially true for Phantom Liberty as well. You'll never truly understand Songbird or Reed unless you play both Killing Moon and Somewhat Damaged. The story isn't perfect however, as there are holes present due to the game having a rushed development, but i still think it's largely excellent.


> Phantom Liberty:

- One of the main reasons i decided to give this game another shot was the release of the new DLC. And let me tell you, this DLC isn't just good, but it's in a league of it's own. It basically improves other elements of the base game that i thought were not good, like the gigs for example. The gigs in PL feel a lot more fleshed out compared to the base game ones, and it forces you to think about the choices you make. I usually just made my choice just to do the job that i was assigned, so i don't dwell on them too much. PL also gave me even more good reasons to like El Capitán. I also really appreciate that they fleshed out Mr. Hands as a fixer, as i thought it was odd that Mr. Hands didn't play much of a role in the base game, so it's good to know they gave him a larger role in Dogtown. With that being said, it's not without it's flaws. Dogtown, while a cool map, is very taxing on the GPU, bringing my system down as low as 25FPS around the rotunda (although, i'm not as picky with low frames, so i don't mind it that much), and the plot pacing. Most of the story just kinda, flies over your head the first time around, and by the time you start to understand it a little, you're met with the first important choice during the story via Firestarter. None of the characters are particularly stand-up, Songbird lies to the player about the Neural Matrix, Myers is just generally a POS, and Reed is a hypocrite, constantly saying how the NUSA is super corrupt and that they sold him and his squad out (coercing Songbird into eliminating him) and even still, he decides to keep his head up the NUSA's ass. None of the endings are ""good"" in the traditional sense, but King of Wands is the least bad ending, so i went with that.


> Conclusion:

- In general, the game has come a long way, from it's incredibly buggy launch to the polished experience that it is today. From the gameplay, to the DLC, and the optimizations they made to make it run smoother on even lower end PCs. This game had a ton of negative press, but i'm honestly glad CDPR stuck to their guns and kept improving the game, cause this was easily the best redemption arc of the decade, and will be for a long time. Overall, the game is an 8.5/10, i would definitely pay full price for this game + the add-on.",True,0,0
"After a whole month of adventure with CP2077, I would like to give it a 9.75/10. 
What you make of this game at the end is how much effort you are going to take in making your experience. A fantastic adventure (free of bugs and glitches) with crazy side character arcs and side gigs/missions that will satisfy your gaming needs for a long time, it was truly an experience of its own. I also deeply enjoyed replaying for all the endings from Point of No Return. Looking forward to replaying as a different gender in the future as I am aware the story-line changes as a result.

Not only have I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, visuals, nova storyline and freedom to roam around as much as I want in combination with immense control, I also leave this game with a preem vocabulary. All my chooms are gonna learn this btw.

Highly recommend this masterpiece. If you're a kid, however, stay put until you're 18 :)

I've only played this game after patch 2.0 but I can definitely say that in it's current state after two playthroughs this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life in terms of storytelling and immersion. The graphics are obviously demanding on higher settings but the amount of love for detail put into the environments is very apparent and every part of the city feels very alive and captures a fantastic dystopian retrofuturistic atmosphere that draws you into every aspect of both the main story and the meticulously crafted side- and character quests. A hard yes recommendation for every fan of immersive story focused games with it's fair share of unpleasant and difficult topics that are broached in interesting ways that go beyond simple black/white good/evil narratives.,True,0,0

"Had a rough launch but CD Project Red did it again. Cyberpunk 2077 is and insanely immersive game. The environment and NPC's make it feel like you are in Night City. Lost interest the first time I tried to play it but this second time I've done a full dive they same way I did when Witcher 3 came out. Highly recommend if you love RPG's with lots of action but also freedom to choose your own path, through the adversity the underbelly of Night City puts in your way.",True,0,0
"I am one of the few that actually enjoyed this game since launch. Yes, it was disastrous and filled with disappointment, but the story and (somewhat) detailed open world kept me playing at the time. Not encountering any game breaking or soft locking bugs definitely helped too (wish i could say the same about most day one players). 

[u]So how is this game in 2025?[/u] Well lets just say Cyberpunk possibly has had one of the craziest and most inspiring turn-a-round in modern gaming. I think it took about a year for the initial build to arrive at a pretty stable version and then the updates just kept coming. Major bug patches, improvement to open world, optimization, getting graphics up to par of how it was advertised. Many new features, completely reworked the skill tree at one point, and even added popular modded mechanics to the base game. 

Then the Phantom Liberty DLC came out and enhanced this game to new heights. I won't go into much detail to avoid spoiling but will just say, the general consensus seems to be; the events of Phantom Liberty are even more intriguing than the base game itself. Okay maybe that's just something I've been saying but I digress...

As of today, Cyberpunk 2077 is easily one of my favorite games I have ever played and is a beautiful tale of why developers should not get discourage by a bad launch. With hard-work, community interaction, and a [b]REAL[/b] passion for your vision, this is proof you can get sunlight even on the rainiest days.... [i]Or maybe it's just a reminder to not release your game a year early.[/i]

"After playing through this on Xbox One (which was stuck at 1.8), 2.2 provides a substantial step up. Regardless of updates or differences, Cyberpunk 2077 is still an excellent open-world soft RPG that explores some heavy themes and makes a quite nuanced world that tends to reflects our own. I never had any bugs that interfered with gameplay, just rare cases of clipping and floating objects. Performance is solid, I played on ROG Ally and got pretty good performance with FSR 3 and frame gen (which you have to settle for on a handheld), creating a solidly firm minimum of 50fps but pretty consistently over 60fps. I love this game and sincerely hope this review motivates anyone who loves the cyberpunk genre as a whole to try this game out despite what many people would call a lengthy prologue. ",True,0,0

One of the best games I've ever played - the story, the graphics, the gameplay, the characters you meet and make friends with. Only downside is lack of really happy ending and being forced to get rid of Johnny who, after all, is very positive for me.
There is still a lot space to extend the story - I'd love to see more DLCs , for example where V is looking with Panam for cure to extend his life, and there could be also tons of other stories happening in the Night City. I really do hope that CDP will change their mind and give us some more content before releasing sequel...",True,0,0

"Amazing game all around, very few complaints whatsoever. At the time of posting this review, only a measly 116 hours, but I would be willing to play this game for another million hours if it were possible. When I first bought the game, it was riddled with bugs and it was so bad that I stopped playing. But Cyberpunk of today resembles little of pain I remember once before. You can tell that the developers care about the game and mod support as well as community is rich and thriving. If you're someone who was worried about the issues with bugs on release and wondering if the game is worth playing now, I have only one word: YES.",True,0,0

After six re-runs and over a thousand hours (I know, im an addict) and watching the game evolve over the last 4 years, I feel honored to say that I've stuck through since the beginning and watched the game grow into the masterpiece it deserves to be. 

Since my first playthrough back in 2020 this games always held a special place in my heart, and I love introducing new players to the game and explaining all the ins and outs. It hard for me to describe how overjoyed I am to see how CDPR has improved the game so much over the years and seeing how new players gravitate towards it and develop a love for the game the way I did back then. It's definitely changed a lot in the past 4 years and I almost feel like I've changed with it in a weird sort of way lol.

"I played this game at launch on my Ps4 before i even got a pc, the game didn't run very well, there where lots of bugs and the game crashed quite a few times. Though I still enjoyed it because of how immersive the story and it's setting is, and how characters interact with each other felt very realistic. I thought it was a fine game at the time but definitely needed improvements and gave it a 6-6.5/10. After playing through the main story again for the first time in 5 years I am so incredibly happy i gave the game another chance. This is easily one of my favorite games ever made! It is very clear that CDPR was very passionate about this game and it shows! From the detailing to the Game play to the improved upon performance of the game as a whole I am quite astonished how much care has gone into this game, and I haven't even done everything yet.

"I started playing the game before the add-on came out. While it was still a different version and just completed the game on Jan 25th 2025. There were some major changes over the course of playing this game. I completed 298 missions. Fully upgraded tier 5++ cyberware.

I really enjoyed the missions and stories throughout the game. The guns are really cool. Huge variety of them also! The models look great! 

The game is still not without errors. The most annoying thing is when you kill a bad guy and try to pick up the item and can't. This can also happen more when you kill an enemy in a vehicle. Characters that snap into the default modeling position. Cars in the foreground spawning and flying. While attacking a gang in the city water system there were 3 bad guys. Shot one and the rest just disappeared. It's a lot better then when the game was released, though I think they could polish the game more. 

I've also found some level errors. Models clipping into each other. Missing support for a camera.  (Floating camera in the back behind the bar with the neon penis lights.) Dumpsters clipping right into the building or wall. Item boxes inside trees.

The character customization is great. I really just wish the faces could be different. The choices are very subtle. There should be an option for straight long hair for the female character. I wish the female had larger breast size options. Not crazy but a B cup appears to be the largest. 

I give the game 8/10.  recommend buying this on a steam sale. Don't pay full price.",True,0,0

Awesome graphics, visually stunning cutscenes that are filled to the brim with awesome action sequences, cool and realatable characters that are really well written and of course a lot of funny characters which reminds me of Borderlands 2 in some way.

"Cyberpunk 2077: A Triumph of Commitment and Respect

After a challenging launch, CD Projekt RED has showcased genuine dedication to both their vision and their community. Over time, the developers have addressed the initial issues, transforming Cyberpunk 2077 into an immersive and polished experience.

What truly stands out is the studio’s ethical approach to downloadable content and microtransactions. With no intrusive DLCs or forced purchases, Cyberpunk 2077 respects both the player’s time and budget—a rarity in today’s gaming market.

This commendable commitment sets Cyberpunk 2077 apart. It’s not just an entertaining game; it’s one that values its community.

"This game is preem choom don't miss out.

Great story that kept me locked in for multiple play throughs. The game-play alone can vary enough with different builds to be worth a second and even third play through. The city is a beautiful dystopian mix of neon lights and blood that kept me in photo mode or just made me take a minute to enjoy the visuals. all around great experience and don't even get me started on the mods that can quite literally make the game feel brand new.

"Hey Chooms,

If you're thinking about spending your hard-earned eddies, this game is absolutely worth it or, if you’re feeling daring, you could klep it from a site (but seriously, support the devs).

The game is honestly amazing. I’m not usually into story-driven games, but this one had me hooked the whole way through. Unlike most story/open-world games where side missions are a drag, this game is a huge exception almost every gig feels interesting and worth doing.

I just finished both the main game and the DLC in the same playthrough, and I’d highly recommend buying both together. Playing them makes it a better experience. I went into this game knowing nothing about it, and that blind approach made it all the more enjoyable.

One thing I have to mention is the music it’s next level. Whether you’re cruising through Night City, battling enemies, or just vibing in a club, the soundtrack hits hard and sets the perfect tone. The radio stations alone are worth the ride. During anything important that happens in the game the music just adds to it perfectly.

Sure, the game has its bugs here and there, but they’re not dealbreakers. Honestly, if you’re on the fence, just dive in it’s an experience you won’t regret.

This game is just preem. (Its better than the anime)

Stay sharp, and enjoy Night City! Become a NC legend.",True,0,0

"Cyberpunk, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the DataKrash

The game has come a long way from release, and I loved it back then. An amazing RPG with an engrossing story and setting. There's something about the setting and feel of just walking though dark neon-lit streets that I find amazing. Sitting in your apartment, looking outside, with the ambient sounds and TV on. Driving through the streets blaring the radio. The glow of the city as you look upon it from afar. The music kicking in during a Friday Night Fire Fight, and climbing your way up from the bottom. Highly recommend.

"I was turned away from this game for a long time thanks to some launch controversies. And I have to say, I regret letting those controversies, and the accompanying toxicity (that I have now learned has basically infested every corner of the gaming community) keep me away for so long. 

To start, the RPG elements of this game are fine-tuned and damn near perfect a lot of ways. Night City as a setting is masterfully crafted, in all of its horrible, brutal beauty. Every street block has some piece of detail, be it a strange gang ritual tucked away in some alleyway, to some surprisingly poignant conversations that can be heard or had with various NPCs. Every RPG has its ""busy-work"" side quests, usually in the form of fetch-quests or generic dungeon dives that, while an alright break from the business of the main plot, tend to bleed together without being super memorable. Not the case with Cyberpunk 2077; instead we have gigs and side missions, which have just as much love put into them as the main quests. They offer wonderful playgrounds for you to test out the game's myriad of builds and playstyles (more on that later), and are deliberately crafted to paint a nuanced picture of what life in Night City is like. The main quest puts these observations about life in Night City and your morals to the test, and although I wouldn't say there are any strictly happy endings, it offers a huge amount of agency in deciding your place within the city and the legacy your character will leave behind, even before you get to the end of the story and pick between the, like, 5-ish different endings. Each character is different, they're clearly not just there to guide the player to their next objective. Each one has their own habits, skills, morals, and goals within the game, and they might ask your help to those ends, or lie and manipulate you to bring about their desires. Sometimes both! It creates a very nuanced, very lived-in world that I very seldom see in any other game. All in all, when it comes to roleplaying, I think you'll have a hard time finding a better video game from the 2020's than this one. 

Next up is the gameplay. There are only 5 skill trees (6 once you start the Phantom Liberty DLC), but the combinations possible with those skill trees are so diverse it almost feels daunting at the beginning. Luckily, the game lets you re-spec perk points endlessly, meaning you get the opportunity to evolve your playstyle throughout your save. Do you frequently look back on recent DOOM installments with nostalgia, wishing you could fly around the map at Mach 10 blasting enemies point-blank with a double barrel? You can do that in this game. Have you ever wished you could replicate those scenes in anime and samurai movies where a swordsman unsheathes his sword in the blink of an eye and cuts everybody in half before the first body can even hit the floor? Chip in choom, get yourself a Sandevistan. Do you want to be able to bar-brawl your way through an entire map, picking up gonks and chucking their bodies at their friends before they even know how to react? Go with a Body-centric build. Hell, you can even play a near-complete pacifist if you want, getting through the story without taking lives (although to tell you the truth, some characters will probably test your patience as they're practically asking to be flatlined). The possibilities aren't endless, but they're a lot closer to being endless than damn near any other RPG I've played. 

This game also has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a video game. I legitimately think Keanu Reeves does a better job acting in this game than literally any movie I've ever seen him in. Unique characters have different animations and motion capture, and their actors frequently deliver grounded, powerful performances that will have you on a rollercoaster through the full range of your emotions. In particular, Cherami Leigh does a fantastic job, bringing a sensitivity and charm to the player character, V, that has few equals.

And the graphics, oh my God. If you have a ray-tracing enabled GPU, try turning ray tracing on for a bit, even if you have to lower your texture quality to make it run better like I did. Looking up at layers upon layers of skyscrapers and roads, all adorned with neon that reflects off the puddles in the road on a rainy day, will have your jaw on the floor at times. Just be careful to not accidentally hit any pedestrians as you're driving dumbstruck. Ah, what am I saying, it'll probably happen at least once even if I warn you; it just looks that good. 

The game isn't perfect, and there's definitely room to improve with the next installment. The weaponry could stand to be a bit more diverse, and some cyberware combinations that are possible in-lore and in Pondsmith's TTRPG systems are impossible here. The soundtrack has some incredible bangers, but you likely will come across a song an NPC has left on the radio that will straight-up annoy you (thanks, Voodoo Boys). The game has a lot of quirks, which aren't always up every players' alley, but usually leave me with a good belly laugh (like when you're a passenger in an NPC's car and they decide to just plow right through your parked car, haha). Games like this are made more charming by a bit of jank, and I appreciate that the devs left a bit of that jank in, and I appreciate their sense of humor around it, like the entire premise of Roach Race. 

So far, this is the game of the decade for me. I might eat my words when the Witcher 4 comes out, but everything about this game, from the characters, to the setting, to the roleplaying, to the graphics and the gameplay, itches some part of my brain in a way no game has before. I think the game has a lot to say given the current sociopolitical climate, too, which sets it apart from so many others.

"I played this game extensively when it first came out and have just recently got back into it after a while when I got the Phantom Liberty expansion pack. I really enjoy the non-linear nature of the game and how you can complete missions and multiple side quests in any order you like, as well as choosing between different dialogs when talking to other characters which affect the outcome of the game in different ways. There are plenty of variety of missions in various environments that you can complete in any play style you like - you can go full rambo and guns blazing, or you can go for the stealth option. There are many different weapon options as well, one of my favorites is the Katana which allow to slice through all the enemies with ease. I also enjoy the massive scale and the seemingly endless missions and side quests, as well as the mini-quests that just randomly show up all over your map. I have gotten to the Point of No Return Mission in the Main story quest so I decided to work on the side quests before I start the Point of No Return Mission. I have over 60 hours in the game total and have spent over 20 hours just on the side quests and as I complete them there are constantly more new missions showing up to complete. There are multiple elements that add to game as well such as the hacking elements, crafting elements, inventory system and character and weapon upgrade options. The expansion pack has the ability to use weapons on your vehicle which I think is a necessity. This game keeps you plenty busy and it feels really immersive with the impressive graphics and NPC's which make the city truly feel alive. This is exactly how an open world game should be.

There are a few negatives:
- Wish this game supported VR. With how immersive this game is I don't know why they didn't include VR support - that would have this great game that much better.
- Some of the vehicles could be look a little more futuristic, and maybe even include flying cars. Many of the vehicles have a retro 80's look. There is a mod that allows flying cars which I previously installed but no longer works since the game has been updated. It is possible this wasn't included in the base game because it would allow you to access places you shouldn't be able to.
- Something else I encountered is sometimes when I spawn my vehicle and start driving I would randomly get attacked out of nowhere for some reason which can be frustrating.
- The drawback to having a constant supply of missions is that sometimes when you are in the middle of one mission, you will get a phone call and the game will automatically switch you to the new mission - this can be annoying and there have been times where I have gone in the wrong direction because I didn't know it switched missions.",True,0,0

The side quests immerse you in the world and can even lead to different endings for the main quest. There is some ""fetch quest"" like activities in the game, but none of them really change any of the endings, so only do them if you want to 100% the game.

The world building is great. The story and voice acting is great. The game is just a great time. 
The Phantom Liberty DLC was a blast and also full of amazing story telling and great moments.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game. There is no shortage of things to do, it has great performances, and I'm loving the story so far. Not to mention the diverse gameplay; there's so many ways to play the game. Cyberpunk 2077 surpasses Fallout: New Vegas and cements itself as my favourite RPG of all time.",True,0,0
"Fantastic game, now extremely well polished and so fun. Have played through several times. Will again.",True,0,0
Absolutely amazing game. Ever since 2.0 its easily one of my most favorite games ever. The Graphics are insane. The story is one of my most favorite in gaming probably and feels very engaging (Also it has Keanu what else do you need). They really do a good job placing you in V's shoes and I am captivated by this game. The DLC is a banger too. Probably one of the best DLC's I have ever bought. While on Steam sales I got the game and DLC for a total of 50 EU. An absolute steal imo for what this game has to offer. Also it is currently one of the best running games in terms of perfomance in my steam library. Running it with all settings maxed (with RT and DLSS off) and crowd density to medium with a 4060 + R5 5600G + 16GB DDR4 at 1080p and I am getting more than 60 or around 60 most of the time. It does vary based on location sometimes 80 sometimes 55. Thank you CDPR for coming back and fixing the game even after a very bad launch.,True,0,0
game was awful at launch but after coming back years later it is like playing a different game. i really enjoy it now,True,0,0
"I played this game when it first came out, it was definitely a mess with so much bugs, but honestly I still enjoyed it. After seeing so much praise for the DLC I came back and gave it a second run, and I can say it delivered all the say this time, probably not perfect, but it is one fun an interesting game, the builds you can make as unique as you want, is incredible, and even though the story of the original game is quite simple to some degree, for the DLC part, wow, what an incredible experience with the story, characters, missions, and the side missions and gigs, waaaay better than the original game. Almost 100 hours on the second run and can definitely recommend this game.",True,0,0
One of the best RPGs I've played. They've really turned it around.,True,0,0
"An outstanding narrative supported by great characters and gameplay. Overall, a preem experience!",True,0,0
Only game I've listened to the soundtrack to outside of the game. Even if there was no game (which is like also good) I would still recommend it for the soundtrack alone.,True,0,0
This game is a must play for any and all open world fans out there. The setting feels so alive. The story and characters are well written and you will be left sad no matter what ending you get. I am glad to see this game shine.,True,0,0

I would say this is like a mix of Fallout 4 and GTA. It really is its own thing though and I highly recommend it. There are countless different ways to play the game.

I have nothing new to add to the plethora of praise this game has gotten. Night City is as beautiful as it is cruel. The characters and world feels real and grounded. Good game.,True,0,0
"Its a good story driven game with some rewarding side quests. Enjoyed the game a lot, you do get strong very quickly in this game so i recommend turning the difficulty up when you feel like its too easy. Even in Very hard at level 35 I felt like i was too strong, i wish there was a new game plus for this game, would help with replay ability. I recommend buying this game on a sale, the story, and game play are pretty good. 8/10",True,0,0

"I originally paid for this game on Stadia, where it was immensely functional compared to the PC port. After Stadia died out and refunds were issued across the board, I got this game back for PC. I waited until the 2+ version was released, and this game has been a fantastic play and well worth it. The bugs you heard of are gone as far as I can tell, and it's been an absolute blast to play. I've had 168 hours of fun with just this particular port alone. Granted, you'll want great hardware to experience at its fullest however I've played it on 3 different GPUs and still enjoyed the playthrough, graphics, environment, and all thoroughly. RTX 3060 at 1440p was great, RTX 4060 at 1440p was surprisingly great with the lower VRAM requiring some DLSS for both, but not so much to the point where it's a blur to watch. The RTX 4070 TI Super with its 16gbs of VRAM have made it viable for 4k with DLSS, however I still crank it down to 1440p because the difference between 2k and 4k for me just aren't significant enough for me to notice as I'm sucked into absolutely beautiful gameplay. I've run this at 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p with the 4070 TI Super and yes, you'll want some level of DLSS across the board as it's super demanding, however don't let the concept of fake frames get into your head too much. The GeForce app helps auto adjust these settings if you don't care to fiddle too much in the settings. 

Highlights:
-Story 10/10
-Replayability 8/10
-Graphical Beauty 10/10
-Stability (updated) 9/10
-Exploration 8.5/10

"I was turned off from buying this following the terrible reputation at launch but having started my journey at 2.2 it is undoubtedly become one of the best games of all time. Now that we have a strong & stable base hopefully there will continue to be updates and add-ons for the next few years,",True,0,0
"The gameplay overhaul this got with the Phantom Liberty expansion is just fantastic. All the new skill trees are awesome and the QoL improvements go a long way. It's optimized beautifully, runs seamlessly and is visually stunning. Everything's really been dialed in and given the love it deserves, there's nothing to even nitpick. If this title even slightly turns your head I definitely recommend picking it up. It's a culturally iconic genre landmark and probably one of the better games that's going to come out this decade.",True,0,0
"If you're still on the fence avout getting this game. Let me help you out. 

Get it. 

There is a level of story detail and interactions this game has that has me coming back over and over again just to see how different events could olay out or dialogues NPC's would say if I had done something different. 

This is probably the only game Ive seen full out philosophical arguments lash out in forums and comment sections so often about ""what the right choice is""
Night City is a chatacter of its own and as messed up as life is, something keeps calling me back. 

And lets not even mention the graphics. 
Im not a graphic nerd but golly gee willickers is this game beautiful.
Faces in this game are insane. 

I could go on, but just play it already. At this point i feel 40 is a robbery from my end. 
I understand why they dropped it from 60 to 40 but honestly I wouldnt mind paying full price for this. Its worth it and more. 

Get phantom liberty, you wont be dissapointed.",True,0,0
"I, like many other recent players, played the game in 2024. Cyberpunk/retrowave/synthwave is my favorite aesthetic of all time. I saw the game was on sale, I had recently bought a new PC, and said okay lets try this out. I am very aware of the disastrous launch and am very, very glad I waited to buy it when I did. 

It has to go up there as one of the best comeback titles of all time, much like No Mans Sky. From the customization in the player create screen, to beating the game, I was HOOKED. I don't usually play single player games. There are a few I hold dear, The Witcher 3 being one of them, hence my hopeful purchase of Cyberpunk 2077 4 years after launch. 

This game filled every hole I had in my life and I could not stop playing. I love a good story, much like the rest of us but I don't know if it was because I love the style of Cyberpunk, me buying a new top of the line PC and wanting to test the playability, or me just being so bored of games that are currently out I was willing to try anything out to fill a hole I felt in my free time, or the game is just THAT GOOD. Whatever the case, I love this game so much.

As I said earlier, I don't play many single player games. I was so enthralled with the story and gameplay, I rushed the main story quests just to satiate my curiosity and eagerness to see how my decisions would alter the ending. NEVER in my life have I beat a game, watched all the credits, purchased and played the DLC and beat it, and then immediately created a new character to play it again from a different playstyle. 

Does every decision alter how the game ends? No. Does your choice of life path (Nomad, Street Kid, Corpo) make that much of a difference? No, you get about 30 minutes of starter quests that are different from each life path and some dialogue choices throughout the game. But I don't care, that's 3 new excuses to play the game from start to finish.

What cemented me actually buying the game was watching Edgerunners. As I mentioned, I love the universe and art style but the story, although fleeting, the show immersed me into the world that is night city. I don't write or make review videos but this game is making want to write a damn script and record a review just on the off chance I encourage one person to download the game.

I didn't really touch on the DLC, but let me just say it is an entire game on its own and the characters are phenomenal. The best character in the whole game is actually Night City, the environment. I can easily just walk the streets, graphics on ultra and decompress after a long day of work.

I can write a novel on my experience with this game but the only negatives I would highlight are the life path diversity and the campaign making you feel like you need to rush. My biggest piece of advice is that there is no rush, explore every back alley, every monument, every sunset...take your time. Or you can play like how I did where I rush the main story, realize I missed out on so many characters and side quests (honestly a lot of the side quests are ""main campaign""worth) and then start a new playthrough.

I can go on for hours but If this review somehow convinces you to buy the game, I am envious of you for experiencing the game for the first time.",True,0,0
"Don't fear the reaper 

I've played and finished the game once on release, was forgettable at best, many glitches and nothing polished , although the story was the same but the unfinished game took all the good out of it.

Last months I finished it again along the DLC ( best DLC ever along blood & wind W3) and spend more than 100hrs in the run, collecting every achievement along the way closing on 100% nearly.

Now I could say for sure this game deserve its spot in my top 5 best games of all times.

"Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty is the greatest DLC of all fucking time. In aspects its better then the actual game at points but not only is it the few things games get wrongs, Project Red did right. Everything has an action and consequence. While I may be a shitlord of gamers I can say for anyone who loves Cyberpunk it truly is the greatest game, not in gameplay, not in true aspect of what the game wanted to be. 
The story is what makes it whole and the fact it's as if I'm not the only main character. There are stories around the intertwin with V, us have to navigate through. I only did the first ending and it was fucking amazing and is why I will always glaze this game.
The term always a bigger fish only makes it better. Cause we may be a big fish but it also is a big fucking ocean.
For this conclusion Cyberpunk will be a one of a kind and something those who didn't put time into it will forget and those who stayed for the ride something unforgettable. I am one of those who will not forget.",True,0,0
"I don't normally do serious reviews but my lord does this deserve it. 
Everyone is familiar with the buggy release and all the hype that was killed at launch, but if you're even slightly pondering the idea of buying this game, do it. I was just like you, I had seen the hundreds and hundreds of review videos from launch just talking about how disappointing this game was, but still I decided to give it a chance, and that might've been one of the best decisions of my life. 
From the atmosphere of Night City to the relationships you build with other characters, it's easy for me to say that (personally for me) Cyberpunk 2077 is the best story game of all time. I've never played a game where everything, down to the most random pedestrian, felt so alive. It was like a peek into a real world through my computer. 
Nonetheless, this game is as close to perfect as any game can get and you will not regret buying it.",True,0,0

Even though my computer struggles with the available ray-traced lighting, the graphics and environments were breathtaking. The story, elegant, and the available side content is nearly always engaging. Night City is a sleeping beast that everyone should take on at least once.",True,0,0
