ethancote98,2025-02-27,100,"this game is a dream come true for RPG lovers. If you ever wanted to play D&D but couldn't find a group, Baldur's Gate 3 is the next best thing. Every decision matters, the characters are fantastic, and the combat is deep. It sets a new gold standard for RPGS."
AlceoST,2025-02-25,0,"Game balance is utter garbage, played coop using a sorc with 3 friends. Watched other playing while I was 80% of the time stunned in fights. Enemies always focused me with stuns. Very funny watching others play. Do not play coop using a sorc/wizard this garbage.-"
Caterer8,2025-02-25,100,"Created this account after finishing the game. The amount of content, quality and care put into this game is nothing short of incredible. This must be the best RPG of all times as of now. No microtransactions and no shady practices. And like all good games, it's a lot of fun too. If you're into this genre you can't miss it."
znienackowy,2025-02-25,90,"I've created the Metacritic account especially to write this short review. Im quite old and started gaming something like 30+ years ago, so let say I've watched the process of bad changes to cRPG games during the years. This one is brought back the best memories I've had and its worth every penny & time I spent on. The story line, tactical fight, characters, the world is a masterpiece with beautiful graphis. Its not easy and requires some knowledge from the player, however, its rewarding. Im not giving it 10/10 as it has some issues due to isometric view, sometimes its difficult to navigate trough."
Ledoo6613,2025-02-24,100,"One of the greatest games of all time. I had a blast. The fight system was surprisingly perfect on controllers. I have never played a turn-based game before. The story and the characters are fantastic. This is easily in my top 10, maybe top 5 games of all time. It is a must for RPG fans."
CrimsonCrim,2025-02-24,100,"This game is worth every penny of its price, must play. Larian did a great work as always."
benjamin2466,2025-02-24,100,"It's an RPG masterpiece! The freedom is insane-you can do whatever you want! Your choices affect everything, and you really feel like you're writing your own story. It's Turn-based, meaning you'll need to strategize each move. If you like Dungeons & Dragons, this game brings that vibe to life in the digital world. If you're into deep stories and love freedom in your gameplay, this game is a must-play!"
Agno_Alencar,2025-02-22,100,"Uma obra prima do mundo dos jogos, cada escolha muda a gameplay, a escolha dos personagens, jogo perfeito de causa e consequências, a gameplay por turno pode assustar, mas vale cada minuto. Jogando pela segunda vez e descobrindo coisas que nem sabia que era possivel fazer."
Showa48,2025-02-19,100,"An extremely well-done RPG. There have been heaped so much praise on this game, so it is almost too much. Anyway, here I go; BG3 is one of those games, that is great, when compared to all games. If you only take RPGs, it literally blows away the genre. Everything just comes together really well; the story, the NPCs, the companions and the gaming world itself. The game also manages to touch upon some prette ""heavy"" themes, such as manipulation, control and - well - ""connection. Authority"", without the game itselfbecoming heavy-handed. Definately worth a buy."
Rarsus,2025-02-18,100,Great game with splendid character development. Immersive world with near flawless transition between areas.
Savke,2025-02-18,60,"I see why people like this one. It's just isn't for me, tho I beilive if I play this in few years i might enjoy it more."
Joqker1488,2025-02-18,70,"I feel like this game is quite overrated. It is an amazing classical rpg game, but it is very poorly made and unbalanced which makes it far worse than other new games of the genre like divinity original sin 2. I feel like they made it in a rush."
SamaelsBook,2025-02-17,100,"A gorgeous game that pulls you in from start to finish, 300+ hours played is proof of that."
LisaMarie2,2025-02-16,100,"whrite a list with every single thing you hate on lifeservice games in general. BG3 dosent have anyone of your points. music, art direction, all that makes a game a game, its just all more or less perfect. this is not a 10/10. we are atleast talking about a 12. if you talk about good games, you talk about BG3."
jeantulard,2025-02-13,90,"Jeu extraordinaire. Vrai RPG D&D comme on ne l'attendait plus. Rien à jeter, et une grande rejouabilité."
pale81,2025-02-09,50,"I don't know, you probably have to love this kind of game. I played it for a few hours and thought it was really stupid. Cumbersome control, missing localization and the annoying Iso perspective do the rest (Iso perspective is something like that from 1990 and a solution if you can't do graphics). I returned it and I return games very rarely"
alvarogbr,2025-02-08,100,Melhor jogo que já joguei nos últimos 10 anos. Realmente este game me prendeu. Parabéns!
JeffOtero,2025-02-08,50,"Good game, but it wasn't deserved the Goty, Zelda Totk was way better and epic."
Citgaming,2025-02-08,100,"The game has some glitches and short comings. Sometimes the co-op can be struggling or small weird ticks are annoying but overall this is a functional masterpiece. I have rarely played a game that was nearly this good, its truly fantastic for anyone that wants a story and strategy driven experience."

JSagittarius,2025-02-02,90,"Hra je to parádní a neexistuje lepší hra na hrdiny. Úžasný plný svět, neskutečná variabilita, strhující příběh, nezapomenutelné postavy, krásný vizuál a hudba. Milujete žánr RPG? Tohle je vaše jasná srdcovka."
G4bbe,2025-02-01,0,"Jogo com lacração forcada e gameplay datada, um RPG padrão sem graça de uma franquia que deveria cair no esquecimento"
Silvandar,2025-01-31,100,"800hrs so far, safe to say I am a big fan. Delighted that Larian are continuing to support the game."
socialoney,2025-01-30,90,"Not a great fun of turned based rpgs in general, I like turn based strategy games like Civ, Total War etc but rpgs, not so much. Saying that, I played BG3 over 100 hours, the story is so rich, characters are great, I remember all of them and their personalities even though I finished the game 5 months ago. I thought the first two acts were the peak areas of the game and at act 3 it was kind of all over the place and I could not get into the side stories and exploration too much since the main story was an ""urgent"" matter and I was curious about it so I left some stuff unfinished. There are ton of different routes to take an you can be the ""best guy around"" or the actual evil. I will do an evil run for my second playthrough sometime this year and experience that route. Definetelly recommed."

brixtert,2025-01-25,100,Baldur's Gate 3 has exceeded my expectations. I didn't know Larian could even improve on what Bioware has left off..
honestreviews99,2025-01-25,100,"Deserved winner of GOTY. Choices matter, companions matter, skills and customization matter. Terrific writing and voice acting, compelling story. Vast amount of content. Replay ability. This game has it all. Top 15 game of all time for me."
Luis0620,2025-01-23,40,Sinceramente me parece muy sobrevalorado. No digo que sea malo pero fuera de lo visual no destaca en nada más.
Ratonz,2025-01-22,50,"100 hours for leaving me with nothing Technically bad and at the end there is no free flow, you are forced to start a new game"
Anthoi12153,2025-01-21,100,"This game is fantastic, its an all 10, 10 in graphics, 10 in music, 10 in gameplay, 10 in writing,characters and lore, just the perfect game"
pecefgulgmer,2025-01-20,10,"Terrible game, incredibly poor optimisation, graphics quality are sub-par, cutscenes are dull and boring. Characters have no depth, and gameplay is lacking massively."

JKaiya,2025-01-17,80,"I wish multiplayer was better, but other than that the game is pretty good and unique to play. It is much better to play singleplayer though sadly as multiplayer would ruin the experience. If you do play multiplayer, I really really suggest to only play it when all the players have finished their own single player campaign. I also wished there was a harder difficulty mode. Hard is too easy, and all the hardcore mode does is make boss fights have a bit more skills on them, but the base difficulty never changes. If they had a harder difficulty mode and better multiplayer design, I would've easily 10 starred even though I'm not the biggest fan of the story at all."
FangRu,2025-01-15,90,"I never play turn based games but my first one really took the cake. Amazing RPG with so much variables, decisiones, styles, quests and maps that its almost overwhelming but in a good way. Definitely recommend this one for people like who generally do not play turn based games but like RPGs. Its new experience that will enhance your gaming life fully. Craziest thing is that more you play, the more fun it is. Great 9.5/10 game overall."
recagnacci81,2025-01-14,100,"Old gamer here. BG 3 is simply the GOAT, no way around it. Congrats Larian for another amazing game (both divinity souls are awesome too). Please keep on making great games and please don´t become an EA or something like that"
Zer0xBeagle,2025-01-10,100,"a true masterpiece and a game like no other in the rpg genre, every bit of it was near perfection and im so glad I was able to play it, such a special game"
k0d3-n-r011a,2025-01-09,100,This was an amazing jorney! Coop jorney! Larian did the best D&D for me and thanks for that!
Romarsofar,2025-01-08,90,"BG3 is a gem. All the praise is rightfully earned. Downsides: there is steep learning curve for the game controls on console, as well as the 5e DND mechanics (for those unfamiliar). It took me several hours to learn how to play. Furthermore, the turn-based combat is not for everyone. That said, this game is a masterpiece. The characters, story, music, and atmosphere are compelling and the level of depth regarding choice and player agency is unmatched."
Mandulum,2025-01-07,100,"While it's not perfect (stop running into visible traps, Lae'zel!) it is very entertaining and I didn't get tired of it before the end of the game. Date Completed: 2024-01-06 Playtime: 92h Enjoyment: 10/10 Recommended: Most definitely"
Valtyr11,2025-01-06,100,A masterpiece in all its ways. Love and passion went into this game and it’s felt in every moment.
Icekyng,2025-01-04,100,Any D&D fan would love this game. Shame only to level 12 but that is more than enough time spent. 150 hours plus and I wanted more.
Zunua,2025-01-04,100,"I wish there would be more games like this one, where the devs actually seem to care for their players... unlike all the AAA studios at the moment. I love all the choices they give us in this game. The characters are solid and so is the music. 10/10"
hertakss,2024-12-31,100,"One of the best RPGs I've ever played, I can immerse myself in the story like in no other game."
Franquini89,2024-12-31,100,"This game is the greatest piece of art I have ever experienced, I am extremely grateful to have played it and I cannot express the deep appreciation I have for it."
Thedvd3,2024-12-26,70,"There's sooo many things wrong with it that I could be writing something new every day. I'll just say that it is nowhere as good as promised and what the fans make it out to be. I went into it absolutely blind and excited as can be, only to realize that the game kept getting worse and worse down the line. I still stayed objective and only rated the game, but even then it's not more than a 7 or 8/10 if I'd be generous. Anyone making this out to be the best game eva!1!1!1 really need to lay off the skooma. It's absurd, and only makes sense if this is baby's first RPG for 99% of people and the ""professional"" reviews are just paid. All in all, worth a playthrough, but don't expect anything special. It's only held up because of the insane production budget."
Biboo,2024-12-26,100,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
doopie36,2024-12-25,40,"Looks good, plays boring. Story is meh, characters are okayish. Larians combat starts to feel outdated, you‘re always outnumbered and have to cheese or use cookie cutter builds. Reloading because you started a conversation with the wrong character is annoying. Literally everything in the game gets resolved by skill check or killing someone. There is no planning ahead, no outsmarting your enemies. There are much better crpgs than this. Even Divinity Original Sin 2 is a considerably better game. The popularity of this game comes down to sex sells and its honestly great graphics and design."
Tzoker,2024-12-24,100,Finished act 2 but very good till now. asdasdadasdsaddadasdsadadadasdasdasda
let_p,2024-12-23,100,"This game is amazing. I wish the romance was better, but that's me being greedy. I was craving Dragon Age Origins, and some things reminded me so much of it... the camp conversations, the romance, combat options, engaging story, decisions affecting the world... anyway D&D stuff haha, I loved it so much and I'm still playing."
HaloBlues,2024-12-23,100,"Apparently, I didn't review this after finishing my first playthrough. I don't quite recall why, but I suspect it would have something to do with having so much to say about it that I was promptly overwhelmed with no idea where to start. I'm going to have to take the easy way out and do most of this in bullet points, because there's genuinely such a broad ocean of Stuff here that it's impossible to address everything. I'm halfway through my second playthrough, a half-elf fighter Dark Urge, but my first completed playthrough was a tiefling bard. Positives: - The companions are well-developed, interesting, and likeable. I don't particularly dislike any of them; I wasn't sure what to think of Lae'zel at first, considering she pounced on my gay as hell tiefling man declaring she knew he wanted to taste her, which was more than a little off-putting for both of us, but I warmed up to her by the end. I'm probably most fond of Gale, Shadowheart, and Astarion (that first run's romance choice was Gale), but I suspect my feelings will vary the more I play and the more I focus on different companions. - The voice acting is broadly praised, and for good reason. I don't think I ever came across a character who was voiced badly or in a way that took me out of the experience. Astarion's is without a doubt the one most often brought up for this point, but I also really enjoyed Gale's. - The roleplay aspect was certainly satisfying to me. I don't recall a moment where I wished I could do something and wasn't given the option to, minus some obvious ones like wishing I could save someone who dies no matter what which I understand not being allowed to do, and the replayability is high enough that before I'd even finished my first playthrough I'd already come up with 20+ character ideas I want to try out sometime. - It's definitely made me more interested in D&D as a whole, as well as other CRPGs like this. I'd tried a D&D oneshot in the past, as well as a brief foray into Divinity Original Sin 2, but neither of them quite clicked with me at the time just because I was a little lost and had no clue what I was doing. Playing BG3 helped familiarise me with the rules and controls, so I now feel much more open to jump back into those. - I love that the companions are all romanceable regardless of your character's gender, etc. I know some dislike that, but it makes sense considering bi/pansexuality is canonically the norm in the Forgotten Realms lore, and I personally much prefer being able to romance whomever makes the most sense with my character rather than having options that would have fit them most being locked away. - The graphics are gorgeous; not the best I've seen in any game, in my personal opinion, but definitely great. - The music. I'd wager most players have gotten ""Down, down, down by the river..."" stuck in their heads before, and I loved Raphael's boss theme enough that I stopped fighting and just sat to listen to it all the way through first. Negatives: - When I first played, Act 3 was borderline unplayable. It was absolutely riddled with glitches and lag, to the point where it would take me a few seconds just to take a single step, let alone get anywhere. This was no fault of my PC, which can run absolutely every other high-requirement game I've ever tried no problem. I would have to exit the game and restart it to experience twenty minutes or so of no lag until it hit the point it started again. Hopefully this has been fixed since that first run; I guess I'll find out when I reach Act 3 again. - Pathfinding and AI can be unreliable. You'll likely find yourself going back and forth a lot trying to wrangle your companions into jumping over a gap, with them all jumping back over as soon as you switch to the next person. - The load times... they're so long... - Things can be a little confusing and unclear in the sense of the order of quests you're supposed to do or how many long rests you can safely take before certain things are locked off permanently. For the most part, you can tackle quests in any order you like, but once you hit Act 3 doing some quests too early and others too late will remove content or get characters killed, and in Act 1 too many long rests before completing questlines will result in you failing them. The latter is exacerbated by the fact that in later Acts you're encouraged to take a lot of long rests, so mixed messages. - The dice rolls can interfere with roleplay, e.g. if you have a character who would be able to charm their way out of anything but is instead constantly forced by the game to make a fool out of themselves by rolling low on charisma checks. - I wish there was more variety in the items you can find in barrels, bags, on corpses, etc. It's pretty much just endless rotten food or miscellaneous dishes and cutlery, which you can't use or even sell for gold, and it's eventually just not worth it to keep checking everything."
