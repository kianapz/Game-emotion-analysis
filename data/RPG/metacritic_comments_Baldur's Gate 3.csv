RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,"jogo perfeito em tudo que se prope, nunca vi algo semelhante no sentido de quantas possibilidades voc pode seguir e provavelmente no vou ver nem daqui 15 anos, talvez somente no proximo skyrim tenha algo proximo do que baldurs faz enfim quem busca jogar o game mais rpg de todos e massivo em contedo e possibilidades e tenha muitos horas disponiveis, jogue bg3, demorei 140 hrs para zerar sendo que muitas side quests eu no encontrei e algumas abandonei e 2 personagens recrutveis para party no primeiro mapa eu perdi mas isso faz parte da experiencia cada um segue sua prpria jornada nesse jogo."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-22,"metacritic, anyone who rates this game behind a 10 does not know nothing about videogames."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"the best game that you could ever play, if you imagine yo can do something, in baldur's gate is possible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"lucky to live in the era where we can play games like these. this is an example of the game which can be replayed thousands times and none of them will be boring. it's mind blowing realizing the number of many different ways game can be played in, number of many different dialogue details which varies on your backgorundor choices you've taken before. 1010 one the best games humanity has ever seen. thank you larian studios for countless efforts to make this game the way it is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"the best game ive ever played, together with rdr2, the absolute videogame peak. so realistic, detailed, and with so many choices and way of interacting, that feels almost too much to handle. id have paid happily 200 for it. wish could delete it from my mind and play it once again for the first time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"this game is a dream come true for rpg lovers. if you ever wanted to play dd but couldn't find a group, baldur's gate 3 is the next best thing. every decision matters, the characters are fantastic, and the combat is deep. it sets a new gold standard for rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"game balance is utter garbage, played coop using a sorc with 3 friends. watched other playing while i was 80 of the time stunned in fights. enemies always focused me with stuns. very funny watching others play. do not play coop using a sorcwizard this garbage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"created this account after finishing the game. the amount of content, quality and care put into this game is nothing short of incredible. this must be the best rpg of all times as of now. no microtransactions and no shady practices. and like all good games, it's a lot of fun too. if you're into this genre you can't miss it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"i've created the metacritic account especially to write this short review. im quite old and started gaming something like 30 years ago, so let say i've watched the process of bad changes to crpg games during the years. this one is brought back the best memories i've had and its worth every penny  time i spent on. the story line, tactical fight, characters, the world is a masterpiece with beautiful graphis. its not easy and requires some knowledge from the player, however, its rewarding. im not giving it 1010 as it has some issues due to isometric view, sometimes its difficult to navigate trough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"one of the greatest games of all time. i had a blast. the fight system was surprisingly perfect on controllers. i have never played a turnbased game before. the story and the characters are fantastic. this is easily in my top 10, maybe top 5 games of all time. it is a must for rpg fans."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"this game is worth every penny of its price, must play. larian did a great work as always."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"it's an rpg masterpiece! the freedom is insaneyou can do whatever you want! your choices affect everything, and you really feel like you're writing your own story. it's turnbased, meaning you'll need to strategize each move. if you like dungeons  dragons, this game brings that vibe to life in the digital world. if you're into deep stories and love freedom in your gameplay, this game is a mustplay!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,"uma obra prima do mundo dos jogos, cada escolha muda a gameplay, a escolha dos personagens, jogo perfeito de causa e consequncias, a gameplay por turno pode assustar, mas vale cada minuto. jogando pela segunda vez e descobrindo coisas que nem sabia que era possivel fazer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-19,"an extremely welldone rpg. there have been heaped so much praise on this game, so it is almost too much. anyway, here i go bg3 is one of those games, that is great, when compared to all games. if you only take rpgs, it literally blows away the genre. everything just comes together really well the story, the npcs, the companions and the gaming world itself. the game also manages to touch upon some prette heavy themes, such as manipulation, control and  well  connection. authority, without the game itselfbecoming heavyhanded. definately worth a buy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,great game with splendid character development. immersive world with near flawless transition between areas.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"i see why people like this one. it's just isn't for me, tho i beilive if i play this in few years i might enjoy it more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"i feel like this game is quite overrated. it is an amazing classical rpg game, but it is very poorly made and unbalanced which makes it far worse than other new games of the genre like divinity original sin 2. i feel like they made it in a rush."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"a gorgeous game that pulls you in from start to finish, 300 hours played is proof of that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"whrite a list with every single thing you hate on lifeservice games in general. bg3 dosent have anyone of your points. music, art direction, all that makes a game a game, its just all more or less perfect. this is not a 1010. we are atleast talking about a 12. if you talk about good games, you talk about bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"jeu extraordinaire. vrai rpg dd comme on ne l'attendait plus. rien  jeter, et une grande rejouabilit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-09,"i don't know, you probably have to love this kind of game. i played it for a few hours and thought it was really stupid. cumbersome control, missing localization and the annoying iso perspective do the rest iso perspective is something like that from 1990 and a solution if you can't do graphics. i returned it and i return games very rarely"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,melhor jogo que j joguei nos ltimos 10 anos. realmente este game me prendeu. parabns!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"good game, but it wasn't deserved the goty, zelda totk was way better and epic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"the game has some glitches and short comings. sometimes the coop can be struggling or small weird ticks are annoying but overall this is a functional masterpiece. i have rarely played a game that was nearly this good, its truly fantastic for anyone that wants a story and strategy driven experience."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-02,"hra je to pardn a neexistuje lep hra na hrdiny. asn pln svt, neskuten variabilita, strhujc pbh, nezapomenuteln postavy, krsn vizul a hudba. milujete nr rpg? tohle je vae jasn srdcovka."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-01,"jogo com lacrao forcada e gameplay datada, um rpg padro sem graa de uma franquia que deveria cair no esquecimento"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"800hrs so far, safe to say i am a big fan. delighted that larian are continuing to support the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"not a great fun of turned based rpgs in general, i like turn based strategy games like civ, total war etc but rpgs, not so much. saying that, i played bg3 over 100 hours, the story is so rich, characters are great, i remember all of them and their personalities even though i finished the game 5 months ago. i thought the first two acts were the peak areas of the game and at act 3 it was kind of all over the place and i could not get into the side stories and exploration too much since the main story was an urgent matter and i was curious about it so i left some stuff unfinished. there are ton of different routes to take an you can be the best guy around or the actual evil. i will do an evil run for my second playthrough sometime this year and experience that route. definetelly recommed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,dnyann en iyi oyunu. oyun bal laf eden  oyuna laf eden fortinayti oynasn karde. adam olun sinir etmeyin bu oyunu aln.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-25,baldur's gate 3 has exceeded my expectations. i didn't know larian could even improve on what bioware has left off..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-25,"deserved winner of goty. choices matter, companions matter, skills and customization matter. terrific writing and voice acting, compelling story. vast amount of content. replay ability. this game has it all. top 15 game of all time for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-23,sinceramente me parece muy sobrevalorado. no digo que sea malo pero fuera de lo visual no destaca en nada ms.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-22,"100 hours for leaving me with nothing technically bad and at the end there is no free flow, you are forced to start a new game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-21,"this game is fantastic, its an all 10, 10 in graphics, 10 in music, 10 in gameplay, 10 in writing,characters and lore, just the perfect game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-20,"terrible game, incredibly poor optimisation, graphics quality are subpar, cutscenes are dull and boring. characters have no depth, and gameplay is lacking massively."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-18,goth
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-17,"i wish multiplayer was better, but other than that the game is pretty good and unique to play. it is much better to play singleplayer though sadly as multiplayer would ruin the experience. if you do play multiplayer, i really really suggest to only play it when all the players have finished their own single player campaign. i also wished there was a harder difficulty mode. hard is too easy, and all the hardcore mode does is make boss fights have a bit more skills on them, but the base difficulty never changes. if they had a harder difficulty mode and better multiplayer design, i would've easily 10 starred even though i'm not the biggest fan of the story at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,"i never play turn based games but my first one really took the cake. amazing rpg with so much variables, decisiones, styles, quests and maps that its almost overwhelming but in a good way. definitely recommend this one for people like who generally do not play turn based games but like rpgs. its new experience that will enhance your gaming life fully. craziest thing is that more you play, the more fun it is. great 9.510 game overall."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-14,"old gamer here. bg 3 is simply the goat, no way around it. congrats larian for another amazing game both divinity souls are awesome too. please keep on making great games and please dont become an ea or something like that"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-10,"a true masterpiece and a game like no other in the rpg genre, every bit of it was near perfection and im so glad i was able to play it, such a special game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-09,this was an amazing jorney! coop jorney! larian did the best dd for me and thanks for that!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-08,"bg3 is a gem. all the praise is rightfully earned. downsides there is steep learning curve for the game controls on console, as well as the 5e dnd mechanics for those unfamiliar. it took me several hours to learn how to play. furthermore, the turnbased combat is not for everyone. that said, this game is a masterpiece. the characters, story, music, and atmosphere are compelling and the level of depth regarding choice and player agency is unmatched."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-07,"while it's not perfect stop running into visible traps, lae'zel! it is very entertaining and i didn't get tired of it before the end of the game. date completed 20240106 playtime 92h enjoyment 1010 recommended most definitely"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-06,a masterpiece in all its ways. love and passion went into this game and its felt in every moment.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-04,any dd fan would love this game. shame only to level 12 but that is more than enough time spent. 150 hours plus and i wanted more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-04,"i wish there would be more games like this one, where the devs actually seem to care for their players... unlike all the aaa studios at the moment. i love all the choices they give us in this game. the characters are solid and so is the music. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"one of the best rpgs i've ever played, i can immerse myself in the story like in no other game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"this game is the greatest piece of art i have ever experienced, i am extremely grateful to have played it and i cannot express the deep appreciation i have for it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,"there's sooo many things wrong with it that i could be writing something new every day. i'll just say that it is nowhere as good as promised and what the fans make it out to be. i went into it absolutely blind and excited as can be, only to realize that the game kept getting worse and worse down the line. i still stayed objective and only rated the game, but even then it's not more than a 7 or 810 if i'd be generous. anyone making this out to be the best game eva!1!1!1 really need to lay off the skooma. it's absurd, and only makes sense if this is baby's first rpg for 99 of people and the professional reviews are just paid. all in all, worth a playthrough, but don't expect anything special. it's only held up because of the insane production budget."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"looks good, plays boring. story is meh, characters are okayish. larians combat starts to feel outdated, youre always outnumbered and have to cheese or use cookie cutter builds. reloading because you started a conversation with the wrong character is annoying. literally everything in the game gets resolved by skill check or killing someone. there is no planning ahead, no outsmarting your enemies. there are much better crpgs than this. even divinity original sin 2 is a considerably better game. the popularity of this game comes down to sex sells and its honestly great graphics and design."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,finished act 2 but very good till now. asdasdadasdsaddadasdsadadadasdasdasda
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-23,"this game is amazing. i wish the romance was better, but that's me being greedy. i was craving dragon age origins, and some things reminded me so much of it... the camp conversations, the romance, combat options, engaging story, decisions affecting the world... anyway dd stuff haha, i loved it so much and i'm still playing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-23,"apparently, i didn't review this after finishing my first playthrough. i don't quite recall why, but i suspect it would have something to do with having so much to say about it that i was promptly overwhelmed with no idea where to start. i'm going to have to take the easy way out and do most of this in bullet points, because there's genuinely such a broad ocean of stuff here that it's impossible to address everything. i'm halfway through my second playthrough, a halfelf fighter dark urge, but my first completed playthrough was a tiefling bard. positives  the companions are welldeveloped, interesting, and likeable. i don't particularly dislike any of them i wasn't sure what to think of lae'zel at first, considering she pounced on my gay as hell tiefling man declaring she knew he wanted to taste her, which was more than a little offputting for both of us, but i warmed up to her by the end. i'm probably most fond of gale, shadowheart, and astarion that first run's romance choice was gale, but i suspect my feelings will vary the more i play and the more i focus on different companions.  the voice acting is broadly praised, and for good reason. i don't think i ever came across a character who was voiced badly or in a way that took me out of the experience. astarion's is without a doubt the one most often brought up for this point, but i also really enjoyed gale's.  the roleplay aspect was certainly satisfying to me. i don't recall a moment where i wished i could do something and wasn't given the option to, minus some obvious ones like wishing i could save someone who dies no matter what which i understand not being allowed to do, and the replayability is high enough that before i'd even finished my first playthrough i'd already come up with 20 character ideas i want to try out sometime.  it's definitely made me more interested in dd as a whole, as well as other crpgs like this. i'd tried a dd oneshot in the past, as well as a brief foray into divinity original sin 2, but neither of them quite clicked with me at the time just because i was a little lost and had no clue what i was doing. playing bg3 helped familiarise me with the rules and controls, so i now feel much more open to jump back into those.  i love that the companions are all romanceable regardless of your character's gender, etc. i know some dislike that, but it makes sense considering bipansexuality is canonically the norm in the forgotten realms lore, and i personally much prefer being able to romance whomever makes the most sense with my character rather than having options that would have fit them most being locked away.  the graphics are gorgeous not the best i've seen in any game, in my personal opinion, but definitely great.  the music. i'd wager most players have gotten down, down, down by the river... stuck in their heads before, and i loved raphael's boss theme enough that i stopped fighting and just sat to listen to it all the way through first. negatives  when i first played, act 3 was borderline unplayable. it was absolutely riddled with glitches and lag, to the point where it would take me a few seconds just to take a single step, let alone get anywhere. this was no fault of my pc, which can run absolutely every other highrequirement game i've ever tried no problem. i would have to exit the game and restart it to experience twenty minutes or so of no lag until it hit the point it started again. hopefully this has been fixed since that first run i guess i'll find out when i reach act 3 again.  pathfinding and ai can be unreliable. you'll likely find yourself going back and forth a lot trying to wrangle your companions into jumping over a gap, with them all jumping back over as soon as you switch to the next person.  the load times... they're so long...  things can be a little confusing and unclear in the sense of the order of quests you're supposed to do or how many long rests you can safely take before certain things are locked off permanently. for the most part, you can tackle quests in any order you like, but once you hit act 3 doing some quests too early and others too late will remove content or get characters killed, and in act 1 too many long rests before completing questlines will result in you failing them. the latter is exacerbated by the fact that in later acts you're encouraged to take a lot of long rests, so mixed messages.  the dice rolls can interfere with roleplay, e.g. if you have a character who would be able to charm their way out of anything but is instead constantly forced by the game to make a fool out of themselves by rolling low on charisma checks.  i wish there was more variety in the items you can find in barrels, bags, on corpses, etc. it's pretty much just endless rotten food or miscellaneous dishes and cutlery, which you can't use or even sell for gold, and it's eventually just not worth it to keep checking everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-22,i finished the game even though it was difficult. 7 points because i liked the story very much. i wish the style of the game was different.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-18,"parabns,  o melhor jogo que existe dentro do possvel planeta em que vivemos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-18,"after get familiar with the combat the game becomes such a heavy hitter. the dialogue is ridiculously fun, the world and lore are fantastic  the various storylines all work really well. the game really  you into it. probably the best game i have played in the last 10 years"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-18,the pinnacle of rpg and the only shortcoming is the writing relative to its predecessors. a timeless masterpiece and easily one of the best games ever created.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-17,"it has been the best rpg, not only dnd but in general for a long time. best fantasy experience of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,i don't have much to say i generally dislike turnbased games but this one feels completely different. the choices are really good the characters and story is top notch and after hearing what the dev sven said in the game awards 2024 this game truly captures what gaming is about and the possibilities it has.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,una delle migliori esperienze rpg degli ultimi anni e no e con quel tocco di dd che piace sempre. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,"larian studios is getting more and more aspirational, and as a rare case their quality keeps up. this game has been praised loud and wide for its scope, world, characters, music and everything else and i will join the chorus on that. one of the best games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,work of pure art. rpg masterpiece for ages. there are not enough words yo describe. a must play.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,the best game ive played in years. have done multiple play throughs and im still finding new things in the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,"i am about 9 hours in and i have nothing but love for this game. i remember talking to a friend and telling him it would be amazing if divinity 2 had more dnd aspects to it then larian studios was like hold my beer i gotchu fam and here we are! graphics are stunning, cut scenes are awesome a big buggy right now but most glitches are funnyyes it has bugs, some are more annoying than others, and some are just down right hilarious fun, but again its early access. however i will remark that this is a more polished early access experience than divinity 2 that is for sure.play with your friends, die with your friends, make sure you dont look that easy looking chest only to blow up a second later because it was boobytrapped! save often and have lots of fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,simply the best game of the decade. truly narrative choice without fluff. amazing char creator. beautiful sound track. ending act that ties everything. i can go on and on
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,you all should be review bombing  games with microtransactions that thinks you are a product instead of a person. 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,"el goat de los rpg por lejos, simplemente cine. un juego con una rejugabilidad infinita, como 20 clases y 50 subclases, abierto a todo el mundo con mecanicas mas familiares, creacion de personaje super pulida y una revolucion absoluta para su estilo. goty en cualquier ao"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,"absolutely amazing game, so much room for player expression and shenanigans! my only critique is that the character creator was too limited in terms of faces you could pick. just wanted something more conventionally pretty. i also wanted more cool outfit options for my character. luckily there's mod support!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-11,very good depthboth tactically and story wise. my issue was that a lot of dialogue leads you down the path of violence regardless of what you want. i got the sense of being a ticking time bomb in populated areas. there needs to be more diplomatic options to a lot of situations. but it turns out smokepowder barrels are your best bargaining chips here.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-10,the best rpg game with high freedom where you can think and do most of what you want.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-10,the type of game that all game developers should aspire to make. truly a masterpiece of the rpg genre. highly recommended.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-06,a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word. the best rpg game of all time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-06,it was a quite joyful journey. i connected deeply with the characters and played the game like i was one of them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-04,"very well made, larian studios has my full respect with their track record so far"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-03,"un jeu trs agrable. j'ai dj fais plusieurs fois l'histoire complte, en changeant le personnage cr et certains choix."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-03,"poucos jogos marcaram minha experincia como baldur's gate 3.  incrvel como um ttulo de combate por turnos conseguiu me prender por impressionantes 270 horas, entregando uma profundidade estratgica e narrativa que poucos rpgs conseguem alcanar. a sensao de gratificao que o jogo entrega  indescritvel, seja ao superar um combate difcil, resolver uma situao diplomtica ou explorar suas inmeras possibilidades narrativas. o nvel de liberdade oferecido  o que define baldur's gate 3. cada deciso, por menor que parea, pode alterar completamente o rumo da histria e dos personagens.  o tipo de rpg que te desafia a pensar criativamente, tanto no combate quanto fora dele. para mim,  difcil imaginar um rpg que supere essa experincia, nem mesmo o to aclamado the witcher chega nesse nvel. recomendo baldur's gate 3 de olhos fechados. no entanto, fica aqui minha dica escolha suas aes com cuidado, porque cada deciso pode ter consequncias inesperadas, tanto boas quanto catastrficas. um ttulo imperdvel para qualquer f de rpg."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-30,"there is no way to sum up all the great things about this game. since it is a year old already, i probably don't have to. i do want to show my support this way as well. larian is a no, the, prime example of a company taking the player seriously and creating a perfect game above all else. since the release they keep supporting it by means of major patches as well, without any form of fee. maybe my only critique is that, compared to act 1, 2 and the first half of act 3, the end game itself felt a bit rushed, but i heard there are also some changes in the end game coming with some latest patches, so i'm going to check those out first. a must buy if you are into medieval fantasy rpg's"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-30,"this game is a masterpiece in many respects, with its strengths shining brightly across multiple aspects of design and execution. first and foremost, it looks fantastic. the visuals are stunning, and the level of detail is genuinely impressive. the combat system is another highlightit's not just functional but deeply satisfying, rewarding both strategy and creativity. the characters are all exceptionally wellwritten and intriguing, adding emotional depth and richness to the experience. the games sheer scope is mindblowing i doubt its possible to experience everything in a single playthrough, no matter how meticulous you are. the story is compelling and engaging, at least so far, and the dynamic nature of both gameplay and narrative ensures that you never feel constrained or railroaded into a single path. this flexibility enhances immersion and player agency, making every choice feel meaningful. the voice acting and sound effects are equally immaculate, adding polish and emotional resonance to every scene. on top of all this, the soundtrack is phenomenal, complementing the games atmosphere perfectly. however, the game is not without its flaws. one of the most frustrating issues is the inability to customize when the game autosaves. too often, id mess up, only to find that the nearest autosave was 1520 minutes old, which saps enthusiasm quickly. additionally, the placement of the delete and load save buttons feels counterintuitive. on more than one occasion, i accidentally deleted a save instead of reloading it, a frustrating error that could have been avoided with better ui design. the camera can also be a hassle, particularly in multistory environments where its positioning sometimes makes navigation unnecessarily tricky. another annoyance is the lack of automatic weapon switching for party members during combat. its frustrating to click on an enemy, expecting a melee attack, only for the character to use a ranged weapon and miss, putting the entire party in jeopardy. character customization, while solid in some areas, feels a bit lacking when it comes to the face options for the customizable protagonist. the absence of sliders for more precise adjustments makes creating a truly unique character more difficult than it should be. romance mechanics are another sore spot. the games rigid approach means that if you dont initiate a romance as soon as the option becomes available, youre locked out for the rest of the playthrough. this design choice forced me to restart my first playthrough and felt unnecessarily punitive. despite these shortcomings, the positives far outweigh the negatives. the love and care poured into this game by its developers is evident in every aspect of its design. such dedication is rare in the modern aaa gaming landscape. while its neither fair nor realistic to expect every game to achieve the same level of scope and quality, this game undoubtedly raises the bar for bigbudget studios, many of which have become notorious for releasing mediocre or buggy products. in a year as tumultuous as 2023 for gaming, this game stands tall as one of the years crowning achievements. for me, its not just the game of the year but also one of the greatest games of all time. if the future of gaming takes inspiration from the craftsmanship and ambition on display here, were in for something truly special."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-29,"a bit overpraised currently but i'd be lying if i say it isn't a super fun game. massive amount of content and the details. the way they added all the cinematic cutscenes into the dialogue shows how much they respect video game as its unique medium. the story is half good and half bad, which makes it not a 1010 in my opinion, because some companions such as wyll and halsin are handled terribly. the emperor came out as an interesting character but they failed to write an interesting ending for its story. but at least you have the freedom to recruit or kill any companion you want except for that annoying squid."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-29,fun game i wish there is more face hair body type in character making because most of it i dont like
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-29,"im playing it for the stories. but the gameplay and turned based even not my muse, but i can still enjoy it. with many of strategic and planning ahead before entering the battle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-25,"baldur's gate 3 comes remarkably close to being the ideal roleplaying game. the game offers immense freedom to create and develop your character exactly as you envision, allowing for a highly personalized gaming experience. whether you want to explore different classes, make impactful decisions, or build intricate backstories, the game provides the tools to do so. however, there is one aspect that stands out as a minor drawback. the character development system tends to polarize heroes into distinctly positive or negative archetypes, leading to corresponding endings. i was hoping to craft a more nuanced gray charactersomeone like a just and powerful dictator queen who balances strength with fairness. unfortunately, the game currently limits outcomes to either wholly positive or negative, which can feel restrictive for those seeking more complex character arcs. despite this limitation, baldur's gate 3 excels in many areas, including its rich storytelling, deep gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals. it stands as a nearperfect example of the roleplaying genre, offering countless hours of immersive adventure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-27,"very solid game, aaa for sure, maybe a little similar to divinity but better, i mostly appreciated baldur's gate 2, but times have changed and the atmosphere is far way different"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-25,unbelievable depth in plot gameplay dislogues everythin. full immersion and freedom. game that echoes a forgoten era of gaming. spit in the face of 3a industry
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-25,genuinely the greatest gameplay experience i have ever had while and after beating the game. amazing single player and multiplayer gameplay along with the new patch 7 adding extremely easy modding for whole new gameplay experiences. the game really has something for most gamers and i am waiting eagerly for the future.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-24,"dnf i feel like a lot of video rpg's are just set up for failure because the rpg, sandbox formula is inherently incompatible with a moderately railroaded experience like a video game typically has to be. let me explain. i recently tried baldur's gate 3. i made a character who i was going to play as like a lawfulneutral evil. basically his schtick was that he was going to be manipulative, power hungry, and vengeful. i immediately ran into problems when most npc's treat the custom player character like . there was no way to play the character as anything but a total pushover. and, the one time it seemed like some inconsequential npc did it and i could like, kill them as revenge, the game gave me two obnoxious warnings from the narrator before throwing me into jail without even letting me kill the character and deal with the consequences. another thing was that, early on, while exploring, i solved this puzzle to get into a semihidden area and was punished by being thrown into a difficult encounter i wasn't prepared for and never would win. so i was punished for exploring in an openworld roleplaying game. these things have turned me off to the game heavily and i can't see myself playing it again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-19,best roleplay game i've ever played since dragon age origins. hours of content and always makes me want more. romance options was diverse but a little limited. romance scenes were also tame unlike the speculations i heard. world building and maps were amazing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-23,this game is not for everyone. i tried to play it and after a few minutes i was already finding myself fighting big monsters much more powerful than me and died very fast. not eveyone will like the turn based combat also. i was a fan of baldurs gate dark alliance but this has nothing to do with it. i think this game is for the experienced players who are very good at this type of game. otherwise i dont suggest getting it. i think it is overrated some call this game a masterpiece but i would not say this. it does have ok graphics but nothing to get crazy about and the gameplay is not awesome and the difficulty is pretty hard for the casual players.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-23,baldur's gate is easily my favorite rpg of all time. the graphics are stunning and the combat is engaging. i bought this game twice for my ps5 and for my pc.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-22,"nothing to add, nothing to take away. 150h on the first attempt, 300h on the second, and despite the fact that i thought i had been everywhere and seen everything. there is always something to be found, something that the creators have somehow interestingly hidden. this is how crpg games should be made. respect, larian.przelij opini"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,"huge, indepth world, tonnes of characters and plots, and generally very enjoyable. having played divinity original sin 2, i think that the dev team really benefited from the dd world, because this game avoided many of that game's flaws. however where it felt weaker was towards the end, wherein the world became closed, player choices became very limited, and it felt rushed. almost to the point that it was anticlimatic not as badly as with witcher 3, though. the postending reunion was nice, though."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,"at all, i did not think that i would like this game. but i played it for hours. the variety of choices and very interesting quests are the strong point of this game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,"baldurs gate 3 is nothing short of a masterpiece, and in my opinion, the second greatest game ever made right behind the witcher 3. its everything an rpg should strive to be immersive, deep, and packed with playerdriven choices that make every playthrough feel  storytelling is phenomenal. every character, from your companions to random npcs, feels alive and has a role to play in the world. the dialogue choices are meaningful, and the consequences of your actions ripple throughout the game. larian studios nailed the balance between freedom and narrative, making you feel like youre crafting your own story while still experiencing a wellstructured epic.gameplaywise, the turnbased combat is rich with strategy and options, and even if youre not a dd fan, its intuitive enough to keep you hooked. exploring the world is a joy, with so much to discover that youll want to search every nook and cranny. and lets talk about the visualsthis game is absolutely stunning, with environments that draw you in and make faern feel real.while the witcher 3 still holds the crown for me because of its emotional depth and worldbuilding, baldur's gate 3 is an incredibly close second. its a game that respects the players intelligence, rewards creativity, and sets a new standard for the rpg genre"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,absolutely love it arguably best game ive ever played great writing great characters almost unlimited freedom to approach combat in anyway only dissapointment is no dlc but can live without it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,"unrivaled choice and freedom to play exactly how you want. you're never left feeling disappointed or wishing for another option. there is no game that comes close to the magic that larian has put together here, and as a very long time gamer i can easily say that this is my personal favourite game of all time, and the new pinnacle of games as an art."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-20,"what more can be said about this game that hasn't already been said? baldur's gate 3 is a phenomenal experience, and the closest one might get to the feeling of playing dungeons and dragons without actually playing it. the game focuses mostly on characters and their motivation, needs, relationships, and more. and in this regard, it is absolutely incredibly written. every party member is absolutely astonishing, and just when you think you might know everything about them, the game adds even more layers to them. the choices you make feel substantial. every small character you save might return to be a huge part of a quest two acts and 50 hours later. and likewise, every small character you kill or forget to save is gone forever. it is astounding how many seemingly small decisions in the game can lead to completely different resolutions of certain quests. it is a shame then that i feel the absolutely gargantuan size of the final act of this game serves as a detriment to the overall experience. it's not a bad act in any way don't get me wrong. in fact, i would say most of it is absolutely incredible. but the game could actually use a more condensed and tightly paced final act. mix that in with a few enemy encounters here and there that i don't really enjoy, general annoyances in some of the parkouring parts, a story that urges on you moving forward quickly, yet with the game's systems actually wanting the direct opposite from you, and quite a few bugs. and i can confidently say that, while mostly outstanding, i believe larian can do even better than this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-20,literally my favorite pc game of all time. it has captured me in a way that no game has since perhaps the original mass effect trilogy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-20,"best game for all times, i like her so much. where big replaying with many choises"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-20,"one of my favorite moments from the game after beating ketheric thorm, was jamming with alfira and the other survivors in the keep as a bard. i often revisit the power from bg3's soundtrack."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-18,"a truly incredible adventure, where every choice matters. easily my favorite game ever!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-16,"um jogo que eu nunca vi nada igual, tudo  possvel dentro dele e isso foi o que me conquistou, no comeo eu no gostava muito do estilo de combate mas com o tempo fui pegando a manha e no final foi bem divertido, recomendo muito para que vocs dem pelo menos uma chance para essa obra prima de arte que  esse jogo parabns larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-16,"one of the best games of the last 10 years. interesting plot, cool characters. many options for plot development."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-16,"i think everything important has already been mentioned by others here. this game is simply overwhelmingly good and the first rpg where you truly feel involved as a player, because every decision you make influences the course of the story. simply brilliant."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-15,this will be my all time favorite game. i did not think anything would reach that again but this genuinely well made experience will stay forever engraved in my brain.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-17,the most fulfilling and thrilling experience i ever had playing a video game quite honestly
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-13,"it's simply amazing. i've never saw so many choices and such an amount of player freedom in any other game. the main npcs could be a little bit better, but it's still an amazing game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-13,"the best game i've ever played, incredibly gripping with its details, story and gameplay, well done to those who made it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-13,"it's like everyone is new to dnd and is playing to express themselves. nobody is taking anything seriously. everyone thinks they're hilariously quirky. everyone is performing and nobody is a good actor. it's insufferable. the gameplay is fine, but i don't want to play dnd with a bunch of horny shallow teenagers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-13,"the most successful rpg game ever released. the story, gameplay, atmosphere and dd rules are great"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-12,"this game hit all the right notes! character choice, beautifully written dialogue, amazing voice acting, engaging combat and fun fun fun! you can truly be anyone you want to be in this game, from a kind and gentle giant dragonborn who saves the entire world to an evil sadistic little gnome who utterly destroys it. if this had a next gen unreal engine 5 sort of graphics i would have died playing this game, you'd see my skeleton still trying to cast that romance gale. i had this game since the early access and the dev support is the cherry on the top. this is one of the few games that i replay again and again and find something new every time. i'm currently at 400 hour  and this number will only increase. thank you larian studios for showing the world how a true rpg should be made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-12,el tipo de videojuego con el cual siempre so. larian studios logr algo colosal con esta entrega.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-12,"so i just finished dragon age veilguard and ultimately survived the five stages of grief that accompanied playing it as a da fan. bg3 you were there for me yet again. after playing nearly 1000 hours already, i turned it back on for an rpg palette cleanse. the second i heard down down down all was right in the world. missed you guys so much. this game will have my heart forever. thank you for all the excellent companions, dialogue, combat, romances, and story. thank you larian studios for all the memories."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-11,"eu simplesmente amo esse jogo, e essa vai ser minha base de nota 10 d o melhor rpg que j joguei e que acredito que vou jogar pelos prximos anos 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-11,"oh boy, what a journey it has been with baldur's gate. great story, great mechanics, great music, great characters, great replayability, great depth, great choices you can make changing the story dramatically! you might wonder why not 1010 then? well, there were some bugs in the game, not gonna lie. including some breaking the game in terms of balance. but larian's been on top of it, patches were frequent and on point, even including some changes and great honour mode!. if you're a fan of rpgs, it doesn't matter if you're reading this in 2024, 2025, or 2026, or whatever year, give it a try, you should not be disappointed. p.s. quick mention on dei in bg3  it has been handled rather well, as the choice is yours. are you a womanizing human who likes women with big boobs? great, this game will let you go this way. are you a gay halfling who prefers bearded wizards? you will get what you want. are you a little perverse and would like to make love next to the bodies of slain foes? say no more. are you a female dwarf who would like to have sex with a bear? larian thought about you too! the game is not preachy about those things, just lets you do you, which i think stands out in the woke 2024 aaa games world. seriously, just play the game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-11,"this game is like an oasis in the middle of the desert. in the middle of greediness of aaa companies, with microtransactions and half baked product at full price, larian proved us that such dedicated, decent studio still exist. the gameplay itself is rather slowpaced, more strategy oriented, but somehow give it gives you time to chill and enjoy the perfectly written stories. but not just stories, the graphics was also quite decent, hopefully they added photo mode soon. the exploration was great experience as well, truly capturing the dnd on screen. i think it is probably on par with the witcher not the tv series and rdr2. there are slightly dei agenda, but atleast it didn't shove it to your face like others u know which my, concern is that they stacked the main bosses at act three, which might be overwhelming storywise, and the level cap, which when you reached higher level the game feels too easy. and my other concern is that they didnt release additional content. oh what a pity!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-09,"finally a game with great combat, well fleshed out companions, excellent writing  directing and a talented cast of voice actors that gave 110. adult video gaming at it best!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,"literally the best game i ever played, deep story with meaningful choices, unique likable and relatable characters, indepth rpg mechanics with many unique items, skills, races and so on. there might be some slight quality of life changes that could still be made, but there are also mods, that can do that for u."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,"baldurs gate 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. the combat takes a lot of getting used to and its definitely more strategy than fastpaced, but outside of combat, the story is deep and the characters are built so well. the plot is simple, but the quests along the way add so much detail and depth, im amazed they could fit it all in. the companions are my favorite part. the depth of the personal quests and romance options for most of the characters bring them to life, especially with astarian and shadowheart. and the ability to play as the companions adds even more insight into their stories. this is a cant miss rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,game of the decade. theres just no way around it it is a absolute must play.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,"best game in years by far. a lot of freedom for the players on how to play the game, no matter if you want to be a hero, the villain or a neutral player."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,"this is one of the best games i've played in my life. in fact, it is the mostplayed singleplayer game i own, at over 800 hours. the story and characters are amazing, the sheer amount of player reactivity is astounding, and now this game has full mod support to enhance it even further. 1010 no notes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"reaches a point where its no longer subjective this game is objectively one of the best and most ambitious games that have ever come out ever pros the story is really good and the game is structured in such a way where you can do anything your brain can think of and the story will goes on smooth as butter for example you can just ignore your companions and the game will goes on without a care or you can kill an important character before the story tells you to..well the story will goes on as normal,i dont know how they does it never seen anything like this before great cast of characters astarion,lae zel and shadowheart are my favorites because those 3 developed so much in my playthrough that they became unrecognizable compared to the beginning of the game and its all because of me and my choices the game lets you do anything you can think of gameplay wise as well... dont have a weapon? you can throw a rock or furniture if you see  about dropping water to the ground so if you're lucky one of the final boss in game can just slips giving you an advantage happened to me visually looks amazing insane voice acting performances, in most crpgs the amount of text you have to read could be daunting but fear not in baldur's gate 3 every text,person and even your character's thoughts are voice acted spectacularly cons none"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,amazing game. i love the freedom these devs give their players. story and main npcs are also good. fav game in years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"this is a true game of a decade with astonishing world design and immersion, thoughtful writing and marvelous plot. gorgeous and lovable wonderfully voiced and delivered characters, with believable and deep dialogues. you can truly be anyone you chose to roleplay either saving the world or driving it to it's sore end. this is a true icon of an rpg game that finally shows players how great a real gaming can feel. it's a whole world of dark fantasy unfolding before your eyes. i am late but not too late to give this jewel my full appreciation. thank you, larian! 600 hours and counting."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,new to this genre. frustrating at first to play. once it sinked in.... no stopping. on my third playthrough. although good i have a feeling we did not get full unfiltered content but a toned down diluted one. would have loved the full uncensored one if ever there was
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"the quality of this game is impressive, something rarely seen in the gaming industry. perfect!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"culturally relevant as 1 and 2. great characters and story, compelling and awesome replayability!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"as a long time dnd player who loves rpg games, it would come to no surprise that i'd recommend this game. however it is my first time playing an actually long game without getting bored, wanting to know more. the game lets you disover it entirely, and each playthrough gets you to discover more, and differently. charactershave personality and your actions actually influence how they feel about you. on top of that, each class or race that you pick can change your experience, each action has consequences, and there's even an additional route with a totally different gameplay. don't get into it if you don't want to spend hours on a game, but if you have the time, it truly is an experience to be had!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,"at this moment, i have played approximately 498 hours in this game, and what amazes me the most is that i feel i still havent seen everything it has to offer. this is truly a remarkable gameone that continually surprises and captivates me with its depth and creativity."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-06,"this game is a concentrated mix of what makes video games an enjoyable form of media. the characters are diverse and interesting, the customization is varied without being gimmicky, the story is yours to make and every way you do each time it's refreshing, fun and new. i've sunk so many hours into the game and every time i play it again there's a mechanic, quest or character build which adds whole new layers to the game. before this game rpgs were my least favorite genre but this game changed my perspective on games and what the ceiling is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-06,"es la experiencia de rol play definitiva, sabe utilizar muy bien las mecnicas clsicas de dd y usarlas a su favor en un video juego lata que sea divertido. toda una experiencia."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-06,"i finally gave in and bought this game after the massive disappointment that dragon age veilguard was. i must say, this game is great and it has been the only thing to sufficiently scratch my rpg itch ive had since dragon age origins. if you're on the fence like i was about bg3, give it a try. it's worth the 70. the amount of content in this game is massive, and the writing is magnificent! companions are soo alive! you also have the choice to do anything! great gameit will go down as a masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-06,"quando si parla di baldur's gate 3,  difficile trovare parole adeguate per descrivere l'orgoglio e la gioia che trasmette. non  semplicemente un gioco,  un'esperienza che trascende il medium videoludico e si avvicina a quello che si potrebbe definire un vero e proprio capolavoro. l'ultima fatica di larian studios, ispirata ai pi grandi giochi di ruolo della storia,  una lettera d'amore a dungeons  dragons, ma  anche qualcosa di pi un'opera d'arte che sa come coinvolgere, emozionare e sorprenderti ad ogni passo. la trama di baldur's gate 3  straordinaria, ma non  solo la storia a colpire,  il modo in cui ogni scelta che fai la modella e la plasma. ti immergi in un mondo ricco di lore, di misteri e di intrighi, ma  quando devi prendere decisioni che davvero ti rendi conto della grandezza di questo gioco. ogni scelta ha un peso, ogni dialogo  una possibilit, ogni alleato che recluti o nemico che affronti ti lascia una traccia. la scrittura  cos profonda che ti sembra quasi di essere parte di un romanzo, dove non sei un semplice spettatore, ma un protagonista attivo."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-03,"what to say. best game. well deserved. no one cared for woke things, because the game just was good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-03,"this game is a masterpiece. i was playing it for very long time. in singleplayer as in multiplayer, with and without mods. it has a big variety of details you barely find in games nowadays. the character creater got some good tools for making you dreamcharacter. there are 12 classes and 46 subclasses without mods. so you have a good amount of combinations to find your playstyle. don't get fooled by the number of 3 acts they are longer than you might expect. every playthrough can also be different you can choose to be a good guy or the most deviant villain this game has seen. their own policy to not add any paid dlc or extra content behind paywalls is the best example of a company that loves the player the game and their work more than money and shareholders. larian studios is already known for great games like divinty and the older parts of baldurs gate. with baldurs gate 3 they deserved the game of the year award. too bad their are overflowing with a feeling to never get close to their previous succes of bg3, so they won't work for another part in the series for a long time. even if you never played any rpg game before, this is very beginner friendly. you even learn some rules and the aspects of the good old pen and paper dd games. this game brought my friends into even trying analog rpgs on weekends. i tried rolling to resist this addictive game but i rolled a 1 on a d20."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-03,"the most immersive game ive ever played and i dont think theres gonna be a game of its like anytime soon it has been a presence, a source of joy and has connected me to some pretty incredible people. as an artist, as a writer i thank you, larian studios, from the bottom of this creative heart of mine, for bringing this story to life and making the world a warmer, just and brighter place for it. everyone, young well, 18 and up and old should play this. even grandma! this game has a story element to it that resonates with the player in a way that most games dont. you take the sword coast with you to work, to school and to the baby shower. ive laughed out loud and bawled my eyes out to this game! i find myself doing chores with a smile because ive incorporated a pc game into my life. thats powerful. and i never thought a turnbased game could feel so dynamic! you choose your adventure and how it ends! and yeah, you might find yourself playing tabletop dd after this. just saying. not a bad sideeffect to trade in for! i realized as i got the hang on things 6th playthrough or so that ive been restricting myself! you can do almost anything! now the player is free to truly utilize the environment, items and tools and try different tactics. being smart with spells is so rewarding especially the illusion ones that doesnt do damage and find ways to utilize them! ive returned to other games, and they feel so flat in this regard! bg3 makes combat encounters genuinely fun! it gives that flair! you really experience the campaign elements! i mean you could complete the entire game with a well placed thunder wave, lol. so, what are you waiting for?"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-02,"what can i say, especially now that over a year has passed since the release? the game is an absolute masterpiece. it has everything you could possibly ask from an rpg game and then some more. so many meaningful options for story progression and viable gameplay styles. consistent and thorough patches and fixes for a full year since release, including the official modding support that adds a whole new level for the freedom of your imagination. none of the paywalls or fomo modern gaming is plagued with. feature complete game on day one  act 3 was ridden with bugs on release. what was at most an 8 on release with subpar act 3, was fixed to a solid 9 in a month with fully playable act 3 but still somewhat lacking compared to the standard the game put with acts 1  2. here and now, after larian finished with all the updates they wanted and stepped away, i cannot possibly rank it anything less than a 10."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-20,"el juego es impresionante, es increible como hay tanto que hacer y tantas opciones siendo que los escenarios son relativamente pequeos. la historia es muy buena y un tributo a dnd brutal. el gameplay es divertido, a veces se hace lento, sobre todo si algn npc se glitchea y se queda pillado unos segundos hasta pasar turno, pero por lo dems se siente muy bien. la forma de contar la historia se mezcla increiblemente con el gameplay, aunque como muchos rpgs a veces abusa un poco de libros y notas que te encuentras. esto para m, es el verdadero potencial de los videjuegos como medioaudiovisual diferente al cine. me gustara que hubieran ofrecido ms posibilidades de aliarse a la absoluta, pero por lo menos han justificado muy bien por qu no se puede. el gestor de mods nativo es muy bueno y le da mucha vida, y el multijugador es de lo mejorcito que se podra haber hecho."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-19,"the scenario of most of the side missions of the game is very good, the characters are above the market and our main story is processed slowly but beautifully without losing its focus. but i got very bored in this game because the battles were very boring in my opinion, but the reason for this is not the game but me because i enter the sleep code in turnbased battles. since the battles do not measure my reflexes or handeye coordination in the slightest, they do not feel like game mechanics to me. i could not enjoy the missions because of the dull mechanics, but despite all that, i can say that it was worth the money i paid. this game is of good quality, everyone should try it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-18,"bon jeu, mais vraiment surct et qui, en dehors de graphismes moderniss, n'arrive pas  la cheville d'un dragon age origins sorti en 2009 ou de ses prdcesseurs. en gros, tout ce qui est bon  prendre dans ce jeu vient du lore dd et de ce qui a t mis en place en amont par bioware, mais en moins bon car  ct de a, il a tous les dfauts d'un larian,  savoir  1. j'aime beaucoup les jeux en tour par tour, mais il y a un je ne sais quoi dans les jeux larian qui rendent ce mode de jeu juste long et pnible. j'ai apprci ma premire partie, mais la rejouabilit sans mods est une purge. 2. j'ai aussi du mal avec l'agencement des zones. je n'ai pas l'impression de vivre une campagne, mais de faire une rando dans un theme park, ressenti que j'ai eu sur les divinity original sin. 3. les personnages... j'accroche pas aux personnages. sans spoil, ils sont too much  mon got, peu profonds et aux problmatiques d'adolescents coucou gayle !. a ct de a, notons quand mme les points positifs  graphiquement parlant c'est beau, et a reste fluide.  en dpit du ct theme park des zones, les zones restent somptueuses et trs agrables  dcouvrir. la ville de baldur's gate est trs vivante.  des animations russies. l'acting des personnages est too much  mon got, en vrai tout le monde ne s'exprime pas en agitant les bras comme dans une pice de thtre. mais ils font trs vivants, mention spciale aux animations faciale de lae'zel  l'histoire est prenante et le scnario de dark urge trs cool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-18,this game is completely perfect. at first the gameplay seems uninteresting and repetitive. but after a while you get used to the turnbased combat and start to appreciate the amount of things you can do in the game and all the skills available. i've played it 3 times already and maybe in the future i'll play it one more time.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-26,"one of the best story driven games i have ever played, even better than the witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-26,"truly a great game that has really proven to the industry that we want true rpgs. too many games these days use the rpg tag when it's some poor attempt at a skill tree that you can end up maxing most of the stuff on in a single play through. baldurs gate 3 really makes every decision matter. with very few times, you level up your character, forcing you to really think about what you will choose to improve when each time you get the opportunity. the story in this game is also highly interesting. making me get extremely hooked onto where things are going. but along the way, the game challenges you to make choices that can lead to major impacts, giving the game a ton of replayability. baldurs gate 3 is an all in 1 package. no dlc or microtransactions. the game has everything and you don't feel like anything was left out. as far as value for money goes, this game really does make you feel satisfied. my only problem with this game is that it assumes you have some experience with dd. my brother plays the tabletop with his friends and if it wasn't for him giving me some help understanding the basics. this game would have posed a much bigger challenge understanding anything. so maybe watch 1 or 2 spoiler free guides before jumping in. i also found at times it was a bit confusing. like during a battle i had no clue if what i was doing was making any difference at all. without spoilers i was attacking an enemy, it was changing his colour but i didn't know if that was making him more dangerous or it killing him quicker. another time i was destorying these portals, and they keep respawning but do they have unlimited spawns or was i supposed to take them out? cos they eventually despawned on their own. why give me the option to attack them if its a waste of time? could you not have 1 of your characters say that seems to slow them down or something? this happens a few times throughout the game but i try to avoid looking at guides out of frustration and confusion. but overall its an amazing game. if you are struggling at the start, i promise its worth sticking with it and if you aren't satisfied by act 2 then its probably not for you. but even if its not your thing, its definitely worth appreciating the love and care that went into such an awesome experience. this is a game for the players!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-26,amazing game. i have spent 400 hours on the game and can't wait to replay with another character. one of the best games of all time.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-22,"having put everything in black and white, however, we must remember one very important thing baldur's gate 3 is always and in any case a larian game and, as talented as it is, this belgian software house is not known for the cleanliness of its works."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-22,"i have heard nothing but raving reviews for this game of the year winner, but the more i progressed through it, i slowly learned this is not a game for me. first and foremost, i see why so many people love this game. this game has so much creative storytelling, different paths, unique characters, etc. you can play the game however you want really. that aspect of the game i do praise and specifically why big dd or fantasy fans love the game. i went into this game with an open mind, but the sheer tediousness of the game tired me out. i am a big completionist and was trying to do as much of the side quests and exploration as i could, but i always found myself stuck and spent ages trying to figure out how to do things on my own, however it often ended up with me googling stuff. there are so many books, scrolls, inscriptions to read and long winded dialogues you need to pay attention to. there is so little in the way of direction in this game with barely any waypoints or markers, you really have no idea where to look for some of these quests, how to open something, where to go next, how to get someone new in your party, etc. one bad decision and your whole play through could be ruined. the game rarely auto saves, so you will lose lots of progress if you try and do things over again. the combat i found to be ok, pretty difficult at times with a steep learning curve. i dont mind some level of puzzles and figuring things out, but this game just takes it to a whole new level. not a bad game by any means, but simply is not for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-02,i liked it well enough. some things not so much other thing i did. if you can find the right mods it can have a better and trie to story play through.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-20,"i don't like baldur's gate 3 because it feels slow and boring compared to other games. the combat is turnbased, which makes the action drag on, and the story feels too complicated and hard to follow. the dialogue scenes take too long, and i often lose interest. the graphics and character animations feel stiff, and it doesnt have the same excitement or fastpaced gameplay that i enjoy in other rpgs, making it hard to stay engaged."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-17,"llevo 10h en el juego y casi ni he avanzado nada pero tengo que darle otra oportunidad. tiene pinta de requerir bastante atencion al jugar, y el sistema de combate es bueno aunque no me engancha. habra que darle otro try"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-13,"my first introduction to larian studios, and it is definitely one of my new favorite developers. baldur's gate 3 is a wonderful surprise among the ocean of aaa games released in the last couple of years. controls on mk, wo mods, it feels like a pointandclick game most of the time, as that is the only way to move your character. in combat this works, but out of combat it doesn't feel 'right'. it feels better on controller when not in combat. gameplay turnbased rpgs, while not my preferred genres, are appreciated for what they bring to the gaming landscape. while bg3 doesn't reinvent the genre, the way combat can be avoidedaltered with the environment, sabotage, and subterfuge allows for different ways to approach queststasks that aren't always straight forward. however, some puzzles are, at times, too simple and others are frustrating. the many ways around them feel fun and thought out, but the puzzles themselves are lacking. story the story isn't anything different then what was seen in gaming. the impending fate of your character isn't as time sensitive as it is laid out for you in the beginning, but with good reason. act 1 has so much to do that it can have some players restart entire campaigns just to see how some interactionsscenarios can change or resolve in different ways. act 2 has the best thematic tone and progression of the game that can leave an impression. act 3 has the most content, but falls short of the tone set by the story's premise and act 2's tone. writingcharacters the highlight of the game! specifically, the character writing is probably some of the best in current games, especially the companions you can bring into your fold. as their respective stories progress, the branching routes they can take are neat and true to them and the previous interactions you had with them. their fleshed out and feel like real people instead of tropes and caricatures of said tropes. while some lack content, which is really hard to forgive knowing that others have an abundance when comparing their importance to the overarching story, most are well written and do a good job on fleshing out the world around them. 910, imho."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-12,"thank you, larian, for the constant work you put into bg3. and for the lack of monetization, in the contrary to many big game studios. this makes people love you!even if there happen to be a bug, we players know that you are going to take care about  is awesome to be some part of the development and to witness how the game is changing with every next patch so keep going!ps. you have made an absolutely fantastic work on graphics and cinematics  shots , frames and lighting are perfect!greetings from poland."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-30,"alright, my first playthrough of baldur's gate 3 is done and dusted. this run weighed in at about 143 hours being very thorough overall. this is a game that benefits from playing it a couple times, so there is definitely still a lot of meat on the bone, as it were. for this initial playthrough, i rolled with a silver dragonborn warlock. future runs will include playing the dark urge arc and probably a more neutral run beyond that. sharedfilesfiledetails?id3046502300 there is definitely so much that can be said about the game, that narrowing it all down into a reviewable format can be a challenge. so, i think i'll begin like this baldur's gate 3 is the epitome of a full tabletop dd campaign, in video game form. it's a sweeping adventure, taking your party through a variety of locations with myriad side quests and a very high degree of cause and effect. almost every action has real consequences and the story shapes itself based on your decisions. the adventure takes you from level one to level twelve. this effectively means that much like the tabletop experience, things can be very challenging until you gain some experience. in my experience, this means that things really start to open up for you around party level four, when you've started to stack both abilities and equipment. by the time you get to 12th level, your group will be pretty op. lae'zal and karlach on their own were taking down bosses in one to two turns in my playthrough. fortunately, your party shares experience, so the inactive party members keep pace with your active members, levelwise. you also have a camp storage chest for equipment, making it easier to gear up characters as you swap them in and out of your active group. you have four active party members, but your complete adventuring party is substantially larger and very diverse. the writing was exceptional. dialogue was on point, quests all made sense, and everything wraps up well. similarly, the world building was both vast and intricate. there is real life breathed into all the different locations. graphically, this game is a stunner that never stops giving, from locations to battle effects and everything in between. sharedfilesfiledetails?id3039236594 similarly, the voice acting was excellence bar none. i can't think of any duds. everybody was believable and evocative. larian did a great job of maximizing their va talent. a lot of work also went into the ost. it's incredibly atmospheric and appropriate. the turnbased gameplay was straight up fun. not only does the game offer a ton of ways to approach each battle, but it does so in a way that allows for a lot of planning, which allows you to apply so many strategies that it actually makes the game more impressive. the environment plays a roll, there is interactivity between elemental effects, and that's just scratching the surface. the possibilities are nearly limitless in how combat plays out. sharedfilesfiledetails?id3046502486 really, i could go on and on and on and on about this game. my favorite location in the game was the undercity ruins, my favorite boss was orin, and my favorite party member was karlach, although lae'zal was just barely behind her in my ranking. i played on the steam deck. it functioned very well, deserves the verified rating being playable out of box, and based on what i'm seeing of experiences on other rigs, it seems like the streamlined specs for the steam deck actually made it perform better in many instances. so, game issues. the main issue i encountered were fps drops, although i noticed that this improved as patches were released throughout my several weeks long playthrough. i had one hard crash. there were a couple weird instances of turns not ending properly in combat. i also never did figure out how to adjust party order on the steam deck outside of removing and readding party members. it seemed to happen randomly otherwise. there were also a few instances of poor pathing leading to clipping and npcssummons getting stuck on things like walls and chests. i will note that while there is a lot of talk about canon vs non canon story, i found that by simply not rush clicking dialogue, you realize bg3 is fully canon. it is however set 100 years after the events of bg2, and i realize that creates a disconnect for some people. for me, baldur's gate 3 was everything i'd hoped it would be and more. is it perfect? no. is it a fantastic and amazing experience? absolutely. it's an easy recommendation. for completionists, this game will easily give you 400 hours of fun. if you only intend to play it once, you'll still easily get over 100 hours out of it. it's a must play for crpg fans and a should play for anyone else. if you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my curator group, it would be appreciated. cheers. curator32549618"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-29,"i don't believe in heaven nor hell, but when i played this game i realized this game is too good to be true. maybe we are blessed by the tyr idk. 1010 definietly play, it is more than a just game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-29,"since 2021, i thought i had grown out of enjoying games, but it turns out that's not the case. most of the games that have been released are just cheap, monotonous, moneydriven projects, and this game showed me that. it's evident that this game was made with passion. the possibilities and combinations in the game are nearly endless, and theres so much you can do. the game is so addictive that i couldn't get away from my computer for hours. it completely wiped out my social life. i couldnt play it while on vacation, and since universities will reopen shortly after i return, i havent started playing again. i'm waiting for the holidays to dive back in and play without any distractions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-29,"this is hands down the best game ive ever played. its competing for my top 3 favorite games ive ever played in my life. never havei played an rpg whereyou can do anything you want, but the game reacts to everything you do. its insane. they arent minor things either, the entire world will shift and change from your choices. so many paths, different endings, and branching choices. coding this must have been a nightmare. on top of that, the game is beautiful.graphics are stellar. art direction is on point. the characters made me forget they were fake pixels in a screen. i got attached to every single person and was invested in their stories. by the time the credits rolled i was not only incredibly satisfied but left in awe at the character writing that was present in this game. there is loads of content in this game. youll never run out of stuff to do even after the credits roll. tons of opportunities for new playthroughs. the combat system stripped and repurposed from dnd 5th edition makes into an incredible tactical video game experience. so many viable play styles with loads of ways to dispatch your enemies. i barely scratches the surface with all of the abilities, builds and strategies you can employ. the music is 1010 incredible. made me super emotional at times. theres not much else i can say. play this game. its amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-28,"the numerous mechanics and systems may be offputtingly complex for some, but those that can wrap their heads around it will be rewarded with an rpg that arguably offers more depth and freedom than any other."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-28,"before i got this game, i really didn't know what i was getting into. but after a few hours i understood why this won game of the year. this game is so intricate and complex that i don't believe that it is possible to have another playthrough the same as your last. every detail and decision is polished and the game has so many different ways to play. now, after playing through once by myself and once with a friend, i am of the belief that everyone should play this game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"the first 20 hours are great, before chapter 3. but when close to the end of chapter 2 you will find it's very easy to game and get bored of this chessplaying. however, this plot is great, which makes me keep playing until the game ends."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"first playthrough took over 135 hours. initially, the game's vastness was overwhelming, and i didn't fully understand the situation, resulting in me missing about 60 of the content in the first chapter. compared to divinity original sin 2, the developers have added a pause feature while exploring maps, which greatly enhances the interactive experience, particularly for looting. based on the game's content, i estimate that it requires at least three playthroughs to fully appreciate its depth and complexity."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"the captivating storyline, diverse gameplay design, and vast amount of content truly make it an outstanding work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"dd the game, what more can you ask for. i constantly find myself playing this game in new ways. the soundtrack is enthralling and the story is waiting to surprise you in new and fantastical ways. dont play dark urge on your first play through though!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"truly deserving of the game of the year title, it introduced a brandnew gameplay style that stands out among countless games. the sense of interaction between players is strong, allowing you to experience the joy of exploring the game world with friends. what touched me the most is that, even though the game has been out for a long time, it continues to receive free updates."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-20,"my first dd experience and i'm enjoying it a lot, the characters are just insanely well written. however, i would prefer a little more guidance as the mechanics are quite overwhelming at first especially the combat mechanics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-19,the best game of the last 10 years. in every category. there is also turkish language. still the best!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-18,"a masterclass in rpg storytelling, blending deep narrative choices with tactical turnbased combat. larian studios has crafted a richly detailed world where your decisions significantly impact the story, leading to multiple outcomes. the characters are complex, with excellent voice acting bringing them to life. the game offers vast freedom in exploration and problemsolving, making every playthrough unique. though there are occasional technical issues, the depth of the gameplay, the beauty of the graphics, and the immersive dd experience make it a mustplay for any rpg fan."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-16,"an excellent game all the way, refreshing to still see deep rpg's done so well nowadays, rafael was the highlight for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-16,"this is the best rpg game of all time, hands down. larian knocked it out of the park. from customization to choices in game play and quest line.. there are hundreds of hours of game play.. you can replay the game differently multiple times.. i have 300 hours and i'm still finding stuff i didn't previously.. if you like this, please give divinity original sin 2 a try. it was also made by larian and is incredible. i recommend trying 2 first and then playing 1 later."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-15,"what more can be said about baldur's gate 3? an incredibly ambitious roleplaying game in the modern era that pushes the boundaries of player choice and freedom in video games. fans of rpgs such as the dragon age series will be right at home. acts one and two are both flawless, 10 out of 10s. my problem is with act three. the whole narrative just grinds to a halt, and the pacing loses its momentum, making the game feel like a bit of a chore. characters don't have much to say. every fight takes forever with huge numbers of boring enemies. you're already overleveled at this point, so fighting feels unrewarding and pointless. technical issues start popping up everywhere. the two villains miss the mark for me, and the storytelling just falters after such a strong first two acts. don't get me wrong. it's not bad at all, but it feels underwhelming sometimes less is more. nonetheless, bg3 is a triumph , in an age of developers not taking risks and pushing out microtransactionfilled garbage. this is a title that should be celebrated."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-13,"lo mejor que he jugado, las ramificaciones que tiene, no solo en conversaciones si no en pasar el tiempo, hacer primero una mision, el sistema de combate para ser basado en turnos es agil y nada malo. lo unico malo el sistema de inventarios, pero buena historia, personajes secundarios carismatico pasar a la historia este juego"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-24,"this won game of the year? oh hell no. if you look at my reviews you'll see i'ma turnbased rpg fanatic, and this was a massive disappointment. let's start it off, it is 2024 2023 at the time of release. moving a character with a mouse is absolutely unacceptable. it is objectively clunky and not fun to control. i've seen people say oh just mod it or oh just link a controller to which i respond its the principle. the story is uninspired, it's a basic dnd campaign. this brings me to the next useless defense of this game, being oh you just don't get dnd im a veteran dnd player, and my response is, just play dungeons and dragons, it's free and more customizable. now if this was some oneoff little title, i wouldn't care. i don't like it. who cares, clearly some people do they can. but the fact that this won game of the year made me lose all my faith in the game awards. totk should have taken the slot, maybe even spiderman 2, hell i've never even seen gameplay of alan wake and its probably better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-23,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-19,"one of the worst and most boring games i've ever played. i don't know anything about tabletop games or dungeons and dragons and i never liked turn based games. the only reason i wanted to play this game was from hearing about it so much, so much praise, and so many awards and people talking about it, how it's called one of the best games ever and how it's 96 rated on metacritic. i also played hundreds of games and i love any game that gives you freedom of choice and multiple approaches and consequences to your actions and different endings... i've played about 3 hours baldur's gate 3 and then i uninstalled. i'll explain why i think it's one of the worst games i've played 1 the combat this is the main and biggest reason why i absolutely hated the game, so you walk around freely in the game like any rpg and encounter quests and characters and chests and whatnot, but then whenever you encounter enemies the entire world literally pauses around you and it becomes a 1999 tabletop game that some nerdy kids in some basement play, it actually turns into raid shadow legends lmao, it's actually hilarious that so many people like it, i guess stupidity knows no limits when it comes to the video game industry. and so it basically kills any momentum and the combat becomes this dice game where you click on an enemy and then your character attacks them and it either misses or hits, so you're not playing the game using your skills or your moves, it's just a dice game. this game is where i vowed to never ever buy or download games based on reputation and reviews, i have to watch a long playthrough in order to decide to get it or not. 2 everything all at once one of the other reasons why i uninstalled the game and stopped playing is because of how much convoluted stuff is in the game from the very start, like 30 different attacks or items in one character, this with 2 turns and it turns this to that for 10 turns and this attack isn't actually an attack and this move makes you hide and that move is a flame that heals and that move is some spell that turns enemies into jelly or makes them scared... it's just soooo much that i went what the fk is going in, what's all of this st?!. i know some games doesn't hold your hand but this is just a horrible terrible game that basically excepts you to be a baldur's gate player for 20 years and also have played the tabletop games, it's insanely dreadful for new players and i'm actually shocked that so many people new to the game with the iq of 2 managed to like the game so much. 3 the story from the start is not interesting the game starts with tentacle monsters and dragons and multiple race creatures and different worlds and so many things happening at once that i just literally lost interest from the start. the beginning  or a in my opinion is the most important part to me, if from the start you're bored and uninteresting because of how much stuff is happening it's a bad gamemovie. games should have a clear beginning where you build up to things and slowly learn what this and that is, this game feels like you're dropped in the third act  where you're already unlocked it all and so much story already happened, it doesn't feel like a new game that you start."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-19,"an absolute phenomenon. baldur's gate 3 is the greatest game in its genre and up there for one of the greatest games of all time. i was hopeful for possible dlc or a sequel from larian but they unfortunately announced that they will be moving on from the ip and it is very bittersweet but i cannot complain too much as they have provided us with a truly unique experience that you'll want to revisit numerous times. i foresee myself revisiting faern a lot, as i have done repeatedly since this games release."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-16,a truly great game. i spent over 200 hours on it and completed lots of the side quests. none of them felt repetitive. the ending is also memorable. i just wish there could be more reference to prior games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-15,"outstanding game. you gotta get into it and learn it, but it's super fun to start roleplaying as your own character. the combat is super juicy, too. i've played with a friend and it was excellent to come together and strategize. excellent game. only issue is the visual bugs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,"fun game, interesting stories but plenty of bugs and weird way of behave, definetly not the game of the year in my opinion due to some very simple but annoying bug, like if you use flyto drop one floor the camera is stuck on the bottom floor and you can't fly back... silly right? i had to reload 1 hr back to last save for this sh,, anyway the game is fun, the variety of the enviroments is cool, i hope next one will be less annoying in certain situations"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-13,"amazing crpg that lives up to the baldurs gate name. great writing, companions, combat, music the fact every line of dialog is voiced despite having so many different choices the player can make is incredible. easily one of my favorite games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-11,"was fr ein monumentales meisterwerk! baldurs gate 3 ist ohne jeden zweifel mein spiel des jahres 2023, mit groem, sehr groem abstand. berwltigend gute, kreative story, eine unbeschreiblich immersive atmosphre, es sind elemente fr jeden nur erdenklichen gemtszustand dabei, sowohl bei den vielfltigen dialogen, als auch den kmpfen, den mannigfaltigen entscheidungsmglichkeiten mit echtem impact auf den weiteren spielverlauf, bis hin zum phnomenalen soundtrack, der das gesamte, riesige spektrum von bg3 grandios untermalt und auch trgt. das spiel ist so gut wie bugfrei ich hatte niemals hardcrashes oder game breaking bugs, unerklrliche frameeinbrche o.., es hat umfassende settings, einen mehr als dndwrdigen charaktereditor, die tutorials sind intuitiv und lassen die lernkurve nicht all zu steil werden. die performance ist gut, die steuerung komplex aber super durchdacht und logisch aufgebaut. die kampagne kann schon mal ber 120 stunden dauern, wenn man auch die vielen, interessanten subquests mitnimmt. es finden sich auch immer wieder krasse plot twists game of thrones vibes im spiel, was mein wtfmeter gesprengt und gleichzeitig die spannung stets hoch gehalten hat. habe direkt nach release zwei durchgnge gespielt und beim zweiten mal nochmals komplett neue regionen, npcs und questreihen entdeckt, die mir beim ersten mal entgangen waren. hierbei geholfen hat auch die wahl von vllig unterschiedlichen charakterklassen, die den spielverlauf durchaus verndern knnen, je nach deren knnen oder unvermgen... bin nun nach einigen monaten pause im dritten durchgang und es macht wieder genauso viel spa wie zuvor. bg3 hat nicht zuletzt deshalb, aber vor allem auch wegen den vielen verschiedenen whlbaren klassen einen tollen wiederspielwert. manche quests bzw. spielmechaniken sind sehr komplex und etwas kryptisch, so dass ich einen guide zu rate ziehen musste, auch charakter skillguides waren hier sehr hilfreich. man kann sich mit den charakteren identifizieren, kann an ihrem leben und ihrer gesinnung teilhaben, es sind nicht nur fahle lckenfller. so viel liebe und leidenschaft fr klassische rpgs steckt in diesem spiel, es ist schlicht berwltigend. mein einziger kritikpunkt sind die meiner meinung nach teils schwachen bzw. zweifelhaften mnnerrollen, denn z.b. ein aktiver gale im team frisst einem den wertvollen loot weg, was gerade anfangs, wo man noch nicht wei, wie viel guter loot noch kommen mag oder ob man sich hier nicht sein konomisches grab schaufelt oder dadurch zu kampfschwach sein wrde, wirklich eine groe antipathie aufkommen lsst. auch wyll ist eher uninteressant, der teufelspakt background mit der berbewerteten, aber dennoch sehr omniprsenten mizora hat mir nicht sehr gefallen. auer diesem kleinen jammern auf hohem niveau hatte ich schon sehr, sehr lange kein solch fesselndes, exzellentes game mehr in meiner possession. ich kann die lowrated user reviews teils nicht verstehen, denen ist das spiel im rundenmodus zu langsam und zu langweilig als wrde man sich bei einem shooter beschweren, dass geschossen wird, manche kriegen nicht raus, wie man die nchsten storyelemente triggert journal  map benutzen, lesen und die entsprechenden leute anquatschen sollte doch kein problem sein..., ein paar wenige finden das storywriting schlecht natrlich kann man es nicht allen recht machen aber es gibt so viele emotionale, philosophische, kritische und herausragende dialoge in bg3, da habe ich schon deutlich schlechteres gesehen, ein paar leuten ist das spiel zu woke. die meisten dieser kritikpunkte sind schall und rauch wenn man sich vor dem kauf darber informiert, dass es ein dnd game mit entsprechenden mechaniken ist. manche punkte sind fr mich auch eher in der faulheit oder linearitt mancher casual gamer zu suchen, die generell in diesem rpggenre keinen halt finden werden. akt3 scheint verhasst zu sein, dem kann ich nicht zustimmen, alles war fr mich genauso spannend und unterhaltend wie zuvor oder danach. ob bg3 zu woke ist? es ist tatschlich sehr liberal gehalten und es gibt viele diverse kreaturen im spiel, auffllig viele frauen haben mchtige rollen, das ist aber eher eine randnotiz und wrde mich insbesondere angesichts der vielen herausragenden anderen aspekte des spiels nicht zu einem low score verleiten. andere sagen, es wre nur mit mods traglast usw. spielbar, finde ich aber in der vanilla vllig in ordnung. ich bedanke mich herzlich bei den larian studios fr dieses herausragende spiel, welches nebenbei bemerkt von anfang an komplett ist und weder mikrotransaktionen, noch dieses lcherliche games as a service modell und sonstigen, consumerfeindlichen irrwitz aufweist. ein vollstndiges, vollmundiges und rundes erlebnis, im prinzip auch schon ohne mods. 1010. bedingungungslos empfehlenswert!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-11,"game of the year baldurs gate 3 showed the fans that true quality games come from non publicly traded, self owned studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,i love this game from start to finish. for me it doesn't quite compare to bg2 but it's an absolutely worthy successor!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,a alright rpg not the rpg for a normal or casuel all typ gamer i dont like or dislike the game to much so a 5 for this not aso good rpg for me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-07,"i pushed a lot of enemies to their deaths, but the real victims were the friends we made on the way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-06,favorite game to play. i essentially got it for the dating sim but it came with so much freedom of choice makes it 10010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-06,"bizarramente bom, imerso absurda.... a experincia e a forma que o jogo te deixa jogar,  fenomenal!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-05,"i went into this game after seeing it was game of the year. the cutscenes are great dont get me wrong, however i dont play games to simply watch a movie, i walked around doing quests for a bit tried the battle and i didnt think the turn based combat that had a top down view matched the game, in fact i would go as far to call it annoying. then you have dialog that takes ages to get past the only reason why i can see this got game of the year is either votes were paid for or people voted for the nudity parts in which case thats just sad"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-03,"best game ive ever played, i truly like care about the characters and larian is just awesome in general"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-03,i love that you can annoy everyone in this game xd a true rpg. i've never played dnd and i absolutely adored this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-30,"baldurs gate 3  a prova que tem como fazer um jogo com muito amor e respeito aos jogadores, um jogo completo, muito bem feito e cheio de possibilidades. espero que outros cenarios de dd sejam explorados dessa mesma forma, porque baldurs gate 3  um rpg que nos remete a uma mesa de rpg de verdade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-30,"never have i played a game that has immersed me so much into a world, allowed me to make choices that actually matter, created characters and story that is so captivating, all at the same time have a fun combat system that makes you strategize in a satisfying and creative way. a must play game for anyone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-29,"this i think was the best game ive ever played, however due to my life style i never have time to play this, i would have killed to have a game like this when i was younger and could sink in 100's of hours into a game. this game has so much polish and replayability its kinda crazy, and if you jump into the moding scene it gets even more vast. even if you do not like turn based, there is probably something here for everyone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-28,"first of all i want to say that i havent finish this game, i spent 60 hours, reached third act and cant do a  cuz of some choices and underlvling, but fighting is terrible, like really terrible. plot is not interesting, small amount of side quests, half of characters are just boring, their lines bad and pretty stupid sometimes. atmosphere and music not good. this game is a must play, but not for me, i enjoyed it a little, but not much"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-27,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-26,"a masterpiece. there are some things that are perhaps not as up to snuff as i'd like camera handling mainly but those are vastly outpaced by the rest of the game. fun combat system, good graphics, beautiful storytelling in a world where the choices and decisions you make matter and change the rest of the world as you have come to know it. it has many different paths you can take, which gives it a lot of replayability and the tons of mods available make it even better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-26,fantastic and enjoyable game. so many options how to play or what to do during the game. everything is seemingly thought of by developers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-26,"i just have to balance out the overrating a but.graphics are only niceish. characters, especially the ones you can create look kind of weird and ugly. facial animation is wooden.inventory management is hell, absolute hell. the game floods you with total useless stuff. i read there is about 800 trash items in the game. i literally need like 2 or 3 mods to make the inventory and selling trash not make me go insane. game presents rooms with 20 containers to you you have to click all 1by1 and loot mostly useless  in hope for something good. leather boots with no armor rating that are just visual, clothes that have no purpose then to make you look ugly. way to much items. i do not like spending so much time in inventory. party inventory can not be sorted, sorting is not permanent and as soon as you move one item its all messed up again so you have to resort all the time. not fun at all. the fact that your inventory and weight is split among characters adds to so much useless pain that i consider a weight limit remover mod on top of my trash autosell and autoloot mods now. the stuff the game throws at you  the fun out of the game for me i can not stress this enough. it feels like intentional annoying the player.difficulty tactician is more like trial and error then to actually learn to be tactical.loading times are  pathfinding is bugged, they sometimes do not follow you jumping. they run into traps, you have ungroup them out of combat to navigate traps sometimes, not very fun gameplay. running into traps and then reloading is not fun gameplay.seeing stupid dice roll screens that are slow af and you already see early on that you passed it but you have to sit through the animations of bonuses all the time. you win 90if these screens anyway. this strict dd stuff for a modern game is the wrong choice imo. could be done better, something that fits a modern game better.game is woke af but even if you like that it for sure does not deserve this insane ratings. not saying its a bad game but its so overrated. its a decent turn based party rpg if that is what you like you probably like that game but acting like this is the best rpg ever made is total delusion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-23,"i have to admit that i have never played the other parts of this series before. therefore, this world is not very interesting to me. maybe that's why the plot and characters seemed rather silly to me. but it's hard to deny that it's an outstanding game. the variety of plot development possibilities is impressive. nice graphics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-22,"as good as video games get. the extremely in depth gameplay and story mechanics will mean that this story can't be enjoyed by everyone, which is sad, because it should."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-22,"this game is highly overrated. story clunky, at best, with tons of deus ex machina. bad world building that bolsters itself on insular knowledge of lore. to the uninitiated, most stories will be an impenetrable mishmash of generic fantasy tropes. the characters are alright, but the writers leaned on crazy to make many characters stand out. gameplay again, clunky. an unwieldly amount of menus makes it resemble an underdeveloped first dragon age. the camera is often uncooperative and there's no way to speed up movement which slows traversal of the moderately openworld to a snails pace. much like divinity, the quests are badly arranged in the bulletpoint hell journal, and the onslaught of names, places, and concepts quickly make the quests a disorienting mess. music beautifully scored, but the ongoing motif, the game's central musical theme, down by the river, didn't really suit the game and got annoying after hearing it in every song. overall mid game. it won't age well. this isn't the breakthrough smash indie devs need to be looking to model their games after. this game is largely propped up by an archaic fanbase of diehards and a game press that seemed eager to be in on the joke. this game isn't for casual gamers, and not every game needs to be, but this game backpaddled on some story and design wins that the dragon age series has already accomplished."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-18,the best game in its genre. it is thought out to the smallest detail both gameplaywise and visually.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-16,"just as an engaging book, this adventure is worth investing your hours into. and there are a plenty. bonus points if you are a returing fan of the previous parts of the saga."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-15,"i've tried to play this game through a few times now. the first attempt at a play through started fairly well and i was enjoying the game, but at some point i found the levelling system very boring and it turned into on big grind that i really didn't care to finish. all of my following attempts to finish the game ended the same way, i couldn't be bothered to finish it due to lack of engaging gameplay. there was clearly a lot of work that went into the game i can tell, even if some of the lead developers walk around wearing bg3 cosplay armouras though that's not cringe. i can understand that fans of dungeons  dragons may really love this game, but i think it's quite a niche thing in my opinion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-14,never saw such a good character writing. an absolute amazing adventure where you feel a part of it and it's this feeling that we are all searching when we're playing a rpg.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-08,i've been gaming since 1989 and this is quite probably the most refined and best video game that i've ever played. a game where choices really matter and aren't just presented in a fake manner which pretends that they matter. the smallest choices can have consequences for the entire story arc and the ending which you receive upon the games completion. the game is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. i love many games but this is the only true 1010 which i feel comfortable giving. i think the phrases and monikers of 1010 and masterpiece are thrown around too frequently. this is one which really deserves it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-11,"absolutely amazing. the gameplay is very creative and deep and it never cease to amaze me. the game has a lot of replayability due to having a lot of secrets hidden everywhere. lots of build options and the story is really engaging and the companion storylines and friendshipromance is very good. the visuals are good, music and voice acting are top notch larian studios listened to player suggestion and is still updating the game to make it even better."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-08,the best crpg of all time. the future of rpg game will have a hard time to be better than this game. the only flaw is that the last act seems stale and not epic as it should. still the goods in this game make it deserve a 1010 score and the best crpg of all time for me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-07,"not my type of game,got bored immediately not so simple to play , i see reasons why a huge percentage of people dont finish this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-06,"similarly to elden ring, the genre and style of game are just not my thing. i highly recommend this to people who are fans of dd though."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"top notch voice acting drives wonderful emotional storylines. slightly a victim of its own success, as it is apparent that some characters get more focus and options than others. graphics are tremendous, but a touch not up to par with other ps5 games, which i found distracting in parts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"the story of this balbug gate is the best part of the game, along with the freedom to take decisions and a range of actions, but it falls down because of its many many bugs, that stop you from playing in 2024, they have had enough time to fix them... if they had wanted to, and a gameplay too slow, too random, with characters missing shot after shot until you die in regular combats that last for ages with anyone doing any damage. i simply can't believe this is the best they could do. edit this piece of crap gets bugged after two hours of tedious battle, as if players had infinite time to waste in this , it's just not serious, who gave it the goty for god's shake. it's not an isolated event, three times already lost my game after long battles because it gets bugged. playing in 2024. i'm out of this crap."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-30,u have to play this game in ur lifetime as a gamer don't be turned off by the timed arpg element as its the best element in the game and definetly introduction to the rest of the games made by larian it's a must buy must owned game very rich content filled with ost beautiful characters and storylines great graphics it has it all

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-27,"it is a dnd but well designed and digital. if someone asks me what rpg is, ill just show them this game. insane variability, intriguing story and marvelous characters makes this game a one of a kind masterpiece. i could have said that the fight system gets boring after some time, but it happens after 150 hours and might not be true."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-09,"hail the king of the role playing genre. it's a miracle how this game even exists, the amount of freedom of choice the game gives to the player, the depth of the writing, the very enjoyable turn based gameplay and all the hidden details and side stories make this game an absolute masterpiece like no other. this is honestly the best and deepest role playing game i've played to date, the amount of content is staggering, it's a huge journey full of surprises, and every quest has multiple outcomes, which is genuinely insane. the overarching plot is actually somewhat simple and even predictable, but what makes it even better is how there are tons of optional quests that are connected to it and retroactively affect the events that are happening in the main storyline, which is divided into 3 acts. act 1 is the most polished and fresh part of the game, it's huge and almost feels like an actual open world game, act 2 is shorter and more linear, but also emphasizes on the main plot way more and has some interesting twists and turns along the way, and then act 3 is similar to the first act, it's full of content, and concludes the story based on the player's choices throughout their entire journey. the best way to experience it is by interacting with the world and doing as many quests as you can, you can change the story massively because almost every choice counts. as for the characters, they are so well written and interesting, every character in the game has their own story to tell, their own struggles and motivations, this game is honestly full of side stories that you don't want to miss. it's worth playing through at least two or three times, because there is just so much content that you can easily miss on your first playthrough, and the different classes make the game even more replayable. baldur's gate 3 truly is one of the best videogames i've ever played, it's a beautiful piece of art that managed to blow my mind multiple times, it made me think about my actions, laugh, or even cry, but ultimately, it made me fall in love with it, simply marvelous, the most perfect videogame experience ever. final rating masterpiece  1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-22,"i just dont get it,the hype the mega scores from reviews. ive tried so many hours its just boring i think its a really niche game. there may be a good game there but its taking alot to find and im still looking"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-22,"best crpg ever made, as simple as that. it has some of the best character development and storytelling ever in any sort of media. this is the pinnacle of gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-21,"usually such long and complex games are very invested games and this is one of the features that make a game a winning game in almost every respect, i personally have never connected to roleplaying games of this type crpgs but i received a recommendation to play this one, and i can say that it is a crazy and amazing gaming experience that i have not encountered before , it's about an unprecedented narrative and gameplay and story, the game opens up a genre for me that i haven't played in before, and in my opinion the impact on such games in the gaming world is enormous."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-20,"baldur's gate 3 is what happens when you give a crpg like the witcher or even mass effect and crank up the player options to 11. it opens up the game to having many different ways to play it and complete objectives. this is by far the most appealing aspect of the game. however, as the game goes on, it's clear that they either had problems or started running out of money. instead of going through all the possibilities, you will eventually reach that level cap and that means nothing beyond 6th i think tier spells. it would have been insane to be able to get up to 10s and all that. there's also the fact that towards the end of the game, you start getting railroaded a bit and the possibilities begin to diminish."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-20,"phenomenal game through acts 1 and 2, but act 3 leaves a lot of gaps and even feels somewhat rushedincomplete. there is also a well known gamebreaking bug since launch pertaining to shadowheart's romance which has yet to be resolved. after putting 100 hours int the game that is honestly a huge disappointment and unacceptable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-19,"best game ever. my top 3 game. so much work have been 's insane! the gameplay is turnbased, best turnbased game ever i was not a fan of this kind of gender but the amount of work that i've been put in the game all the possibilities you can do and the mindset of the developer finally some great people with great heart and great mindset. these people love videogame and the gamers too thank you for this master piece and your incredible mindset"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-19,you can only see how incredible baldur's gate 3 is when you're the one playing it you feel immersed in the vast universe it presents. the phrase create your own story has never been so literal in any video game before.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-19,"this is the clear explanation  with full freedom. let me explain baldur's gate 3 is an rpg where the devs don't force you to follow the questsstory they want, you choose your own ending as well as your own story.very good game letting you do everything, i highly recommend it, even if you don't like rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-19,"good ideas, but the technical issues were glazed over by the reviewers due to them primarily occurring later in the game. the game also promotes bizarre ideas and encounters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-18,"one of the best games ever created you feel the love and hard work which flowed and still flows into the game. such an amazing studio behind this masterpiece . i am at my 10th playthrough right now and still find stuff which i didnt know of. this game is the incarnation of a rpg i have never seen a game made it better then this. this game will be the new skyrim it broke new boundaries and showed how bad aaa gaming studios are these days. no ingame currency, no ingame purchases, no dlcs if you own the game you have everything. it is insane how much you miss on your first playthrough because this game offers to much. i have never seen a story game which is replayable like this game and even if it gets boring alone you can grab a friend and have an advanture together. the story is fantastic in every way a perfect written story with an absolute blast of music which is by far the most beautiful piece of music i have ever heard. i dont think i need to talk about the best companions in gaming history everyone with their flaws which you can help them get rid of or get deeper into it it depends on you. to sum up this game will be a masterpiece forever not only of its story, possibilities or gameplay but it showed us what is possible even with a smaller budget then a aaa title and it has an influence in the gaming industries in the upcoming years because these aaa studios have to switch stuff up"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-17,the only thing that keeps me away from playing it is the combat system. i just dont like it. but anything else deserves its praises
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-17,"i had purchased the early access release some 3 years ago, but later regretted as i did not intent to give larian a 3 year interest free loan. but live and learn. the character development feels shallow at times as there are not that many choices given during level up. not much of a fan of the overly masculine female  femine male trope. additionally, the characters are anything but aesthetically pleasing to look at. i miss the games that put an effort into providing attractive characters to play. also an excess amount of dirt, grime and blood throughout. i could have also done without the explicit choice  representation of character genitalia as well as the omnisexual nature of practically every party member  with no way to turn off. perhaps that would have been easier to accommodate had they been even moderately attractive. but being sexually pursued by a squid, lizard or even a bear was not my thing. honestly, some of the interactions creeped me out. there were many aspects of gameplay i did enjoy and found it tactically challenging and engaging at times. however, in many cases, those pleasurable gaming experiences was tainted by the overt special interest undertones. in fact, it served no plot device or enhanced the story at all. at the end of the day, it felt like a cheesy ploy to pander to special interests and incite media attention via shock value rather than the merits of the game itself. seriously, picking rather your character has explicit male or female parts, their size, circumcision state, etc... had no bearing on the game whatsoever and could have easily been excluded. was nothing more than trying to claim  hey, we are lgbtq friendly because we let you pick your private parts! it was overtly exploitative which offends even if you are not identified as one of the 7."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-16,"baldur's gate 3 genuinely has to be the greatest game i have ever played. while a bit confusing to get used to the battle controls in the beginning, i have played countless hours of this game once i got them down. this game has absolutely insane replay potential, and i have played it many times already. larian did wonders with this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-16,"one of the buggiest games i have ever played, the amount of crashes ive experienced can be combined to all earlier instances. i would often bug the game out whenever i make a decision that would skip progress such as fighting gortash before shutting down the factory. its a shame that a game like fallout new vegas has a better appreciation in rpg aspects compared to this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-14,"its a good game, i can see why people thinks this is a masterpiece but to be honest i don't think it  has great characters and a good story. my main issues with this game are the combat system that is not bad at first but later in the game can make battles to last forever and gets very boring.another thing i didn't like is the act 3, once you arrive baldur's gate city it throws you a ton of quests that most of them feel unfinished and are not interesting like the ones of the previous  graphics are nothing out of this world,doesn't even have daynight cycles and the performance is bad on pc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-13,"baldur's gate 3 plonge les joueurs dans un monde fantastique d'une richesse poustouflante, o chaque dcision pse sur le destin. avec ses graphismes  couper le souffle et son gameplay immersif, le jeu captive ds les premiers instants. les interactions profondes et les qutes varies offrent une exprience de jeu riche et passionnante. malgr quelques dfauts techniques, l'ensemble reste une exprience incontournable pour les adeptes de rpg en qute d'aventure et d'exploration."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-12,"the only weakness is that dnd rules were greatly changed, killing all the vanilla dnd balance"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-12,perfection. everything is good.story gameplay graphics. i hope other games will be like that
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"baldurs gate 3 is a masterclass rpg. an amazing cast of characters, and endless replayability. it captures the fun and adventure of a tabletop rpg. this game is a huge game changer for the genre, and other companies can benefit from taking notes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-11,"this game made me pity pretty much every other rpgs. its that good. from the writing to gameplay, i love it all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-09,"amazing character and story writing with multiple different endings and choices, the character designs are amazing and the character customization, even if limited, is really good. an amazing adaptation of the dnd mechanics and extremely good turnbased combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-08,i love the complexity and replayability. hundreds of hours of content if you just change your character and build. masterious.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-07,a bit too much reliance on throwing so many enemies in thelate game and no proper explanation for some features. choices are plentifulbut still feel like they fall into a bad and good camp. not bad just occasionally very frustrating
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-07,"absolute masterpiece. not unexpected coming from the experienced hands of larian studios, but it's broad appeal was a blindside, hopefully signaling the growth of the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-05,"i love the concept of rpg, the dice roll and the stats.however, the game remains very hard and quickly repetitive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-02,if you like the dungeons and dragons style of combat the game is fine but for people that are looking to play an actual rpg this is a giant middle finger you won't realize until well after the refund period. torrent games to play them first to see if they are worth your money or you risk paying for something you may very well hate and you can always pay for after if you do enjoy them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-02,"i would rate in the negatives if i could it does not have enough ending combinations it only has 17,000 which is the oppisite of breath taking  not breath taking spoiler alert you start the game on the main menu"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-01,"probably one of the greatest rpg i have ever played and im from 86. it seems most of the negativity around the game is based on the lgbt content. dont let this keep you from an amazing experience! sure there are some npc's where it feels a bit forced, but it really isn't as much as some reviewers make it out to be. i am very happy they went with turn based combat over rtwp, as you get to control all your party in detail this way. it also makes all skills and spells so much more fun and usefull, as i always end up with the typical buff and just autoattack in games like pathfinder, icewinddale, bg1 and bg2 etc. considder this a greatly improved divinity original sin 2, with fantastic graphics, huge story and world full of stuff to do. many choices and different ways to complete content. this is one of those rare 1010 experiences you really should not miss out on"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-01,"fun game, i would recommend it to every player that loves immersing roleplaying games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-01,one of the best games ever made. this is the new standard all games should aspire to reach.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-30,i recommend giving it a try!!!perfect!this is beautiful!!! love games i love this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-30,"act 1 was a masterpiece, act 2 was bad, act 3 was horrible. only buy this game if you want to play act 1, the other ones are just not worth playing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-29,it's very hard to make something that exceeds expectations. especially for games that play tens or hundreds of hours that are much longer than movies. but this game did it. it's why it's a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-29,"i cannot stop playing this masterpiece. since 2020 pandemic the only game i truly enjoyed was a very timely released animal crossing on switch. the baldur's gate 3 just blows your mind, allowing to submerge into amazing storytelling, beautiful animations and absolutely insane voiceacting looking at you, neil newbon, why are you so good, i cannot romance anyone else but astarion now xd . just an absolutely amazing game. the only time i was that enticed with a game was during beginning of wow days first 3, with wotlk being best and witcher 3, which allowed one to make multiple choices and have different endings that i experienced for the first time. well, bg3 takes it all up a 100 notches, making seemingly endless possibilities, bringing true spirit of dd tabletop. standing ovations, that's a lifetime achievement to all who put the hard work behind this masterpiece  thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-29,great trip! an amazing world where you always want to return! great game!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-28,"larian has once again demonstrated their mastery with yet another masterpiece. they've managed to incorporate all the mechanics from dungeons  dragons into the game, albeit with some improvements. the storyline is captivating, offering multiple paths to accomplish tasks, which adds to the replay value. upon completing the game, one is compelled to start anew with a different class just to uncover missed details. initially, there were some issues with the last chapter, but larian has been diligent in addressing them and considering the feedback from the community, which truly showcases their dedication to this remarkable game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-28,"incredible game, you can feel how much work they put into it. crafted with love and hopefully will spark more games made with so much care and patience"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-27,i suppose it's the best rpg i have ever played  and i have played a lot. it's even better than the witcher iii. absolute masterpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-27,"it's horrendous. it should have never seen the light of day. i might write a long review, but i don't want to waste my time on this one. there are 3 reasons why this game should not exist. 1 baldur's gate 2 was the end of the story. period. 2 if baldurs gate 3 ever existed, it would be an infinity engineaurora engine game and it would be developed by black isle studios. the game was in development and was named the black hound project. that was the only bg3 supposed to happen. 3 the third and final reason is that games today have evolved differently, and so many things have changed. you should not use the old classic ip and ruin the legacy of one of the best crpgs ever made. just to milk the money and create ''modern games that are tailored for modern gamers so that everyone can enjoy them''. the vision never existed. the artistic component never existed. respect for one's legacy never existed. larian created the divinity game in a dungeons and dragons setting and called it baldurs gate 3. it is despicable and dishonourable, and hence the sole reason why this game should not exist."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-27,"so after more than 20 years, star wars knights of the old republic has finally been dethroned and i no longer consider it the best game of all time. baldur's gate 3 has left that deep of an impression on me. firstly, i am a huge fan of bg1 and even more bg2. i have replayed the latter multiple times over the years and i loved it every time. so i was a bit skeptical at first about the switch to purely turnbased combat from realtime with pause, which was one of the reasons i did not participate in the early access. but i felt like if anyone could make a worthy sequel, it would be larian, so i felt like it was in the best hands possible and i just wanted to wait for the final product. and larian has absolutely crushed it. this is a masterpiece . i think i could replay it forever if i had all the time in the world. the story is great and welltold and unfolds gradually in a satisfying way. the same can be said for all your companion's side quests. i guarantee that you will start caring even for characters you initially disliked and you will feel the weight of their decisions. the music and sound design perfectly emphasize the atmosphere of the world. the combat and itemization are amazing. the game offers an almost unlimited number of builds. my only complaint about turnbased combat is that sometimes it takes a long time for the enemy to execute all of its moves. additionally, there were occasional lags when the ai was calculating its next move. but in general, it feels excellent. if you are a veteran of crpgs or turnbased combat games like xcom, i would definitely recommend playing the game on the tactician difficulty as otherwise the combat gets very easy quite quickly. and if, like me, you decide to replay the game, you should absolutely give the honor mode a try! in this mode, you do not get to reload a save, which makes you play much more carefully and often requires quick thinking to navigate challenging situations. while the graphics are not mindblowing, they effectively convey what needs to be conveyed and maintain a gorgeous aesthetic. overall, this is a mustplay game for literally anyone. and don't just take my word for it, just look up how many different awards it has won."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-25,"by far one of the greatest video games to come out of all time. the amount of love and effort put into this piece is astounding and i genuinely have zero complaints from a story  gameplay perspective. however, what stops me from giving a perfect score is how technically messy the game is. 150gb is insane for a topdown perspective, i've had multiple visual bugs that broke immersion, and it's pretty optimized. 4.55"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-24,"the best game of 2023 for me is baldurs gate 3. it was a great game from the battle mechanism to the vast game world where you have to think and decide on the story content that is extremely rich and varied. there are builds, battle mechanics and story choices that we need to think in detail. if you are going to play the game for the first time, i recommend you to research and enter the game. you don't need to play the other games of the game, but it contains good things for those who know the lor."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-24,"baldur's gate 3 has a strong start but struggle in the later stages. the third act is a disaster, making the game nearly unplayable. combat becomes boring and repetitive, with long enemy turns and limited options. the environments are dreary and uninspiring, making exploration a chore. the story and characters are underwhelming, and the music doesn't add much. resting mechanics are flawedyou sometimes can't even rest in certain zones. it's no wonder that only a small percentage of players finish the game. overall, this game is overrated and fails to live up to its hype. not recommended. i would also bet my life saving that if you couldn't edit your gentals parts, this game would not have that much hype xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-23,"i was new to the dd genre. at first, i wanted something, but as i played about 4 times, i raised the difficulty level and planned a really good strategy each time, and the pleasure of winning was the best. is that all... story and graphics. the actors' performances perfect game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-22,"an amazing game made by an amazing developer. from the characters to the music to the environments, this game is pretty perfect."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-21,"shining example how good can game be when it's not created to squeeze money from gamers. lot of choices, interesting characters, living world. about 100h of gameplay to complete main story and lot of side quests. however, there are some bugs, camera sometimes makes it hard to target object, coop conversations are hard to follow and after reaching max level 12 early in third chapter in our case exp. is useless so can't give 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,"baldurs gate 3 made a lot of noise with the video of sex with a bear, but thats not why it won all the main awards last year. larian studios is an experienced developer, having already proved their level by creating divinity. but baldurs gate 3 made a big leap forward, allowing larian to take its place among the greatest studios today. let's take a closer look at separate parts of the game to understand why. visual 810 the game features many amazing and vivid visual effects such as explosions, various spells, and strikes. fighting scenes look really breathtaking towards the end of the game when dozens of highlevel characters from various classes use all their tools and items. the appearance and mimics of the charactersnot only the main ones but every character in the gamelook beautiful yet terrifying. many items and models in the game look unique and stylish i even chose a hairstyle for myself while looking at one of them in the game! its an important note because drawing hair is one of the most difficult tasks in computer game graphics. however, there are still many games with a more impressive set of items and, more importantly, enemy models. a lot of weapons and armor in the game have the same icon and model, which is not good. landscapes are interesting and varied, but not exciting. narrative 810 under 'narrative,' i mean not only the main story but every piece of lore, characters consistency and development, quests plot, and the overall suspense of the game. all these components are very solid and nicely executed. all the books and stories in the game connect to form a comprehensive and logical picture of the world. almost every first and secondtier character has traits, weaknesses, and other features typical of real beings, which sometimes make the screen characters even more human and interesting than real people. i really loved my companions, and after almost 200 hours, it was very sad to finish our shared journey. the story hooks you from the intro video, develops and unfolds evenly throughout the game, and concludes by answering all the questions. there are no supersurprises or deep philosophical questions although there are some political and social ones, but also there is no nonsensical content like parallel universes, etc. gameplay 1010 obviously, thats what made this game so great. its hard to highlight specific gameplay pros because nearly all aspects of the game consist of polished, diverse, balanced, and progressively complicating gameplay mechanics. i played for 200 hours, and every minute was fun and moderately challenging i played on 'tactician'. i am going to start a new playthrough on the highest difficulty level soon. the main indicator of highquality gameplay is that i experienced emotions throughout the game. almost every action and event made me feel happy, excited, afraid, or sad. almost every battle introduces new mechanics and abilities of enemies, and every new level gives you unprecedented abilities. every act is absolutely different from the others. when encountering a strong enemy, you are shocked by his strength, but then you figure out how to win and feel like a genius. this leapfrog continues throughout the entire game. it has a lot in common with divinity 2, but is more diverse and vibrant. there are no dull quests like 'kill 5 trolls' or 'talk to my father'. sound 1010 there are three main components in this criterion the performances of voice actors, the sounds of actions, surroundings, and the music itself. the music is amazing i recommend you find the game playlist on spotify and add it to your library if you like instrumental and choral music, as i do. i saw many videos on tiktok about people who just sat in the main menu and listened to the main theme, and i did the same. the voice actors in the game are brilliant, especially those of laezel and astarion. i really loved them. overall 1010 as a fan of rpg games, i can say that this game is one of the greatest rpg games of our time. this game has already made a huge contribution not only to rpg games and dd but also to the entire game development industry thousands of people have discovered that games like this can be fun and interesting. all these newly minted fans of rpgs are joining the industry with their money and attention, which raises the probability that one day the financial success of rpgs and other games made with soul and talent will surpass that of conveyors like ac, cod, and fifa. there are still some issues in the game, but they absolutely dont matter compared to the contribution of larian in raising the bar of expected quality for a game priced at 70 dollars."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-17,replaced divinity original sin 2 as my favorite game of all time. i am so glad this came out so close to starfield so they could showcase just how badly companies like bethesda are by what should be modern standards.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-15,i dont understand how you can give this game anything less. gripping story telling  amazing rpg and overall after 120 hours left me wanting more
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-13,"apenas, goty. no ironicamente. sem criticas, no tem como, os cara fizeram o melhor jogo disparado."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-11,"a perfect game, this is how games should be made, no micro payments, the full game is finished and released, and no sweet babu inc. worth every penny"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-11,"like seriously the most detailed and replayable rpg ever. this is the only game that have replayed more than once because the outcomes are so wildly different that it's almost not the same game. no other game i have seen that makes actions have this much of a consequence. 95 of char don't have plot armor, and you can skip major chunks of story and replace it for something else for a playthrough. go pickitup and play well worth the price. this is the aaaa game that ubisoft thinks they can achieve in a million years lol."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-10,"not much to say. one of the best rpgs ever made if not the best, probably is though."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-09,"an incredible epic of intriguing paths forged by the character you create. as you invest in the story and gain experience your character's strength grows, unlocking more skills and making combat even more fun. once seemingly onesided acquaintances can become friends with intricate backstories, or they can become foes with contrary beliefs to your own. what truly blows my mind is the sheer number of ways to play the game through character creation, and how each character type can lead to an advantage or disadvantage in any battle. coop with a friend is extremely fun as well, allowing multiple players to feel as though they are simultaneously living out their own version of the story within the same world as their counterparts. if i didnt know what dd was before this, i wouldnt know that this was a dd game because the story, mechanics, and gameplay are all so welldone. this game is a masterpiece on every level. hogsmeadejones"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-06,"i am a big fan of dd and i thought this would be a fun game to play as it is one of my favorite tabletop games come to life. but it really isn't. half the good stuff from dd is removed, like all the best classes, some weapons, and the ability to jump, but most importantly half the spells are gone. and the game is so boring too. the combat is even slower than in dd. and after a decent second act, i thought there would be an epic finale, but instead they had this absolute excuse for a third act. act 3 is just so slow, boring and anticlimactic. the pacing is crap and while the story is good, they throw it all at you too fast. and the obvious criticism is that the game is just divinity original sin 2. you thought nintendo was repetitive? baldur's gate 3 should just be renamed divinity original sin 2.5. and the gameplay is just awful, too. in dd there are dozens of options at every turn. in bg3 there are 6 or 7 at most, and those are usually just options you don't want to do. i can't believe got the goty from this. tears of the kingdom was way better. if people seriously think this is a masterpiece then i am concerned for how brainwashed society is. story 710 gameplay 210 combat 110 pacing 110 uniqueness 110"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-05,"this game is awesome, i played through it 5 times, doing absolutely every mission possible, and each playthrough took me over 100 hours, it was one of the best gaming hours of my life, and i will play it again and again because even after 5 playthroughs there is still content that still needs to be found. thank you larian for this masterpiece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-05,"a thousand hours of play in his amazing journey is testament to my appreciation of the genius larian has poured into converting dd tabletop into a computer game. there were , of course, but the sheer boldness of the game, and that they pulled it off, simply outweighs any negatives."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-05,"this is the best game of 2023! i think in 2024 no one can beat this fantastic quality of game design, storytelling! the gameplay is outstanding.. this is 1210 !!! really just a best game! sven vincke is my hero! other studios have to learn how to create games from larian studios, not just creating money . right blizzard?? hello, look at this game! everyone should try this game its just bestof the best! top!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-04,"disclaimer that i don't agree with modern ratings. 6 is good for me, not great. 9s and 10s are for things that have passed the test of time, and i can safely say 10 years from now this isn't going to be one of those games. it's excruciatingly boring and the combat is excessive flair dressed upon a 1 trick pony. i understand that this was a huge fan service to dd players. i'm not one of them because i always thought you all came up with the same boring ironies for your characters if not directly ripping from lotr or some other pop culture. dd itself was originally just a way to play the lotr without using any of the trademarks but apparently it's gone far beyond that into the realm of losing all principles and logic with  jokes about space hamsters and frogskinned space pirates. the voice acting was notably better than average while the writing was trying too hard to appeal to various people while at the same time being everywhere all at once in the dd lore space. the dialogue is critical levels of cringe with badly timed, immature quips and innuendo that only someone who misquotes han solo lines could come up with. characters just don't make any sense...there's no point going on. i don't judge anyone for playing it, but i really hate dd lore and that's obviously going to have repercussions when playing a dd game. since the turn based system is the same as past larian games, going to have to give a hard pass on the next one.their passion is commendable and i like that they have a spirit so many others are missing, but they just lack the ingenuity required to make a compelling game and they need to read some syd field and robert mckee before attempting another to write story again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-20,"good game, best choizes in ddialog in all game industria normis ti ppoganiii"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-15,"combat  in this game, it can take over a hour to defeat a couple of mobs. i don't know what is going on most of the time, there's to much stuff you have to keep track of. all spells look same, constantly need to camp to recharge spells. the acting is good, dialog is funny. game is made for dungeon and dragons fans. i wish the combat was faster. i put like 30 hour into the game and it just felt like a chore. only played that long cause i spent 70 dollars. no idea how this won game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-03,"baldur's gate 3 es un juego de rol en el que la definicin de aventura se lleva a su mximo esplendor. desde que eliges a tu personaje ya sientes que ests siguiendo tu propio camino. la cantidad de ramificaciones, decisiones y acciones distintas que puedes llevar a cabo en cada partida es algo nunca antes visto en este medio. no tengo palabras para describir la libertad que he sentido al vivir mi propia historia, la cual rebosa de epicidad y momentos nicos que he vivido junto a mis compaeros del grupo y que no olvidar jams. las misiones secundarias podran pasar por principales porque todas tienen arcos interesantes donde conoces a personajes maravillosos. la jugabilidad por turnos se me ha hecho divertidsima y la multitud de opciones que te brinda junto con la interactividad con el escenario del combate hace que la misma no se haga repetitiva en ningn momento. la banda sonora tambin es muy buena, con temas picos y pegadizos que te transportan al universo de dragones y mazmorras. artsticamente es muy nico tambin ya que posee zonas muy variadas y variopintas y con un estilo fantstico que hace sumergirte ms en el mundo. es cierto que el apartado tcnico es bueno pero se puede mejorar, sobre todo en la parte final del juego, cuando se producan algunos bajones de frames y errores visuales. cabe mencionar que a veces el juego es poco intuitivo a la hora de resolver acertijos o algunas misiones de formas no convencionales, pero eso tambin contribuye a una mejor inmersin. el juego me ha durado unas 80 horas completando muchas misiones secundarias. en definitiva, baldur's gate 3 es una obra maestra que lleva al gnero rpg a un nivel superior y que ningn fan del videojuego se debera perder. 9,810 032024"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-02,"the only thing i don't like about this game is how it has risen a bar for anything else i am trying to play, since i did 300 hours 3 walkthrough in this wonderful world of bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-31,nicht so schlecht! allerdings etwas berbewertet. die vielen bugs bei verffentlichung haben mich schon schwer geplagt. es ging immer irgendwas schief! wer kam nur auf die idee mit den vielen fallen. so ein bldsinn!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-31,"this game could've been a masterpiece, but is heavily plagued with bugs and broken mechanics, which break the game and ruin immersion. this game is 'murphy's law'. everything will always go wrong. i have never been more frustrated playing a single player game. lots of poor execution, lack of quality assurance, and oversight. the game has been out for a while officially and i am still dealing with lots of issues, even after multiple patches and many hot fixes. gets extremely infuriating and annoying. the game was not properly play tested, as well as the patches. you are entirely at the grace of rng every time, which will mostly fail you. the worst is when something goes wrong and ruins your playthrough usually through no fault of your own and you have to reload a save file to find that the last one was 3060 min ago. you are forced to spam quick saves. the pathing and hitboxes are so janky. it's hard to select what you are trying to, between looting small items, attacking certain enemies, and trying to make precise movements. you try to make an attack, but the enemy you are selecting is still in midanimation and their hitbox ever so slightly moves, so point blank your click ends up attacking the ground or not attacking at all and instead running in a circle or away from the fight. looting is a disaster, how are there no proximity loot, group loot options, or loot filters for a modern rpg? early game combat is very frustrating, missing all of your attacks or doing almost no damage as certain classes. companions and especially petssummons are consistently getting stuck on ladders or nothing at all, to find that they got stuck 10 minutes ago. it is a constant battle of making sure everyone in your party is actually following you. it is seriously bad. had issues with not being able to progress a few quests due to no fault of mine. lots of qol is missing that you would think is common sense which is a shame. there are way too many traps and puzzles in this game, it just gets very annoying instead of fun and exciting. there are no indicators for any available quests or conversations, etc.. i ended up having to interact with every object, book, or person in fear that i may miss important content throughout the whole game. this should be way more easily done. transitioning the camera between levelsfloors is abysmal, to the point i want to uninstall the game. you have to fight it every time, especially when you are in small multilevel structureshouses. it is almost impossible to make combat maneuvers if you are between floors because of the camera. it also constantly gets stuck in walls where i am unable to move it for about 10 seconds. once you get to act 3, all of these issues get exponentially worse. maneuvering through a very tight city with tons of npcs and clutter. most of it is meaningless. it is not well made mechanically at all. also, really bad performance with lots of lag here. at this point, you can really feel just how rushed and crappy the game starts to become. the incompetence and neglect from the devs is almost tangible. not sure if most of these issues can even be fixed due to the engine and bad principles. these are only my major complaints... there are still a lot of other issues. overall, the game is rich with story, writing, art, creativity and customization which is mostly well made, but heavily undermined by the horrible mechanics. it still needs a lot of work which will most likely never happen. it is still a fun experience half of the time, but the other half i wonder why i am even playing this mess.. this may be goty for 2023, but there definitely wasn't any fair competition. totally undeserved in my experience. not sure if most of these people that voted for that even played act 3endgame. i expected much more, especially with that title. while they are working on improvements, it is a slap in the face that new patches bring dumb little quirks like new animations for kissing and your companions at camp instead of entirely focusing on fixing the plethora of bugsissues first... some of these new features they introduce are also buggy and poorly executed. example the new bartering update just makes any items offered disappear out of my inventory without actually offering them. if the game left early access, it should feel mostly complete and polished, but it doesn't. gives me a very sour taste in my mouth. 510 at best  would easily be higher if the game wasn't half broken and the devs actually had more compassion, quality assurance, and qol features. i could make a video that is a couple of hours long explaining the plethora of issues and frustrations. not recommending due to how frustrating this game is most of the time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-30,"a game for all dd fans! baldur's gate 3 is an incredibly captivating game, especially for fans of roleplaying, fantasy, storytelling, or strategy games. its a game you can spend countless hours on, with so many ways to approach it. youre truly free to play however you likewhether you prefer powering through the story with brute force and a thirst for combat, navigating situations through dialogue and clever strategies, or sneaking around corners to avoid battles entirely. every approach is valid its all about your preferred playstyle and what you enjoy most. the story is rich and deeply engaging, shaped entirely by your decisions as a player. playing the game multiple times can offer entirely different experiences. for instance, if you kill a character early in the game, you might realize six hours later that he could have helped you navigate a critical part of the story. but on a second playthrough, if you spare him, the storyline shifts and opens up new paths and outcomes. its also highly recommended to play with a friend or in a group. its a fantastic way to bring people closeror to cause some hilarious chaos when someone makes a silly mistake. no matter what, its guaranteed to bring laughter and fun to any group of friends. baldur's gate 3 is 100 a game worth playing if you enjoy this genre!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"meh, unplayable without a few key mods, glad i waited a while too the list of bug fixes and updates is really just pathetic. no one comes out with working games anymore they just release garbage and expect you to wait years for fixes. might actually finish this one unlike that garbage elden ring that isn't even an rpg, its arcade hack and slash. update 5 the unreachable items problem that they created from some patch has now ended possible progress, the game is broken."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"im sorry, i can not say any negative about this game, i love it from everything! every aspect of the game is amazing, the world, the npcs, the items, the weapons, the skills, character design, enemy types, the story, just everything! nothing of the world is like with the same ingredients, so you never know what will happend, what will you see. every part of the world can be dangerous, peaceful or both. love it! it feels like im playing a old fallout12 game and thats gives me such positive chills. i do not really rate a game 1010 but this game deservedit totaly! divinity original sin 2 was already a fun and good game, but bg3 is just a masterpiece! well, maybe one thing i could say is very negative, the bugs, but with such a big and complex game, it can happend, so its okay. love you larian studios! goty 2023!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-24,"got this after all the hype. and so far i don't get it. the game itself is good, and maybe it's not for me but the combat is dull. i just am not excited to get into confrontations. it takes for ever and is not exciting. i do a move and then 10 other characters make a move and then me again. it's slow and just not engaging. again it is probably my tastes but when you are a foot away from your enemy and it says miss,is just not for me. rolling and chances and all this is just makes combat dull. i honestly don't know if i am willing to push through what is a very engaging game otherwise, as any time a combat scenario occurs, my engagement just drops. hopefully it gets better, but this is from of fighting mechanics that is too slow and not engaging at all. but again the sheer choice, story flexibility and world building is epic. i hope if i stick with it and it clicks like it hasfor others."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-23,everything is super slow. i become afraid of skirmishing of any appearing creature because it was just so slowing down the story. the hidden things are really hidden as you need to go with the old pixel by pixel thing to find sg just in 3d and constantly rotating the screen. the dices make you feel that you have some chance to solve anything but it just won't happen every time and if you don't save before every dice roll it makes you take extremely difficult paths compared to that if you simly had luck.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-21,"absolutely love playing the game baldur's gate 3! it's so engaging that i can restart it a hundred times and still have fun with new characters and different choices. the game's treatment of characters based on their race and the decisions made is impressive. it's a game that my family members and i played together, and we had a blast! the character development is phenomenal, and i have even introduced it to friends who have never played dungeons and dragons or video games before, and they were thoroughly ecstatic. baldur's gate 3 takes dndbased games to the next level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-08,this game is inspiring it actively involves the player in the story and allows the planning of strategies all accompanied by stunning graphics and maniacal attention to details. the characters are exceptionally well written reaching a depth that very rarely is found in nowadays entertainment.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-19,"while act 3 felt a little rushed, the game is a masterpiece. i do prefer dos2 combat over baldur's gate 3 simply because it's not 'dd 5e, but better.' but even against all odds and without following the recipe every modern game seems to adhere to, they managed to secure a place in gaming history as the best there currently is."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-18,"it feels impossible that this game even exists. it is one of the first branching path games where the paths actually branch and the decisions actually feel like they matter. the open ended combat is incredible. i'm not a huge fan of turn based crpg combat normally, but bg3 has done what i thought was impossible. they made it engaging and fun. the game is constantly being updated in meaningful ways by the devs, at a speed usually unheard of. the first 2 acts of the game are basically perfect in every way. act 3 is still a bit rough around the edges, but only in the sense that it isn't perfect like the first 2 acts. in comparison to just about every other rpg out their, even the third act is pure gold."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-17,"great story, good music, op voice acting. but... if i could give 8.5 would fit more due glitchesbugs i came across, more consistently on act 3 slogfest and the still standing enhance ability autoupcast on dialogue checks to resort to friends cantrip for advantage dice on charisma checks. all else respects my time and creativity to engage stuff feeling rewarding with no restraints unless isnt intended to, else it breaks something due massive tools given to player. bad ui on leveling up imo... it ramps up graphical usage for just the avatar and a lame waterfall landscape as background covered by poor abilities description, it could be toned down and even a bit blurred or changed to give our rig a break while reading those poor explanations that you end up learning better on fightsreading battle logs and guideswiki. godbless withers to be there to respec at will. more polishing and ez 910 vote update. polishingbetter ui and 1010. stop the minthara fan service pls. she fits as villain and spoils stuff as i read somewhere."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-16,"it's a great game, but playing on a console is frustrating. they should have tried harder to to make it work with a keyboard and mouse. autosave needs to happen more as well. i spent so long redoing sections because of bugs or surprises that locked me into a fight i couldn't win. still a lot of annoying bugs 7 months after launch. act 3 is a slogfest."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-16,"a true masterpiece  not the easiest one to get into when you are unfamiliar with dnd mechanics but 100 worth spending time learning it. once on board, easily one of the best game of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-02,"this game is a true masterpiece, the only flaw is that they adopted the world view from the novel instead of baldur's gate 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-14,"baldur's gate 3 is a good game, it deserves a high rate. but there is one problem that larian cannot make this good. co op connecting. i hate that. nothing works when it comes to your solutions on support page. i am trying to play on lan with friends, the game is crashing at least 2 times per gameplay, sometimes i cannot connect even when i am using radmin vpn, in dos 2 i had the same issues. also hotfixes that larianmake are terrible. i wish not to be annoyed by your coop connectivity anymore, i just want to be happy..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-14,"this game is a masterpiece. so rarely do i stumble upon a game and feel empty for having beaten it, knowing i'll never experience it again. i've been gaming 26 years and i can count on one hand how many times that has happened. it dawned on me, after beating it, i need not be dismayed because the replayability is off the charts. the attention to detail in this huge world is crazy. every word has a purpose, seemingly mundane items can be gamechanging, seemingly small interactions can turn into much, much more. if you were curious if you're able to do something, you can do it. if you're curious if you can try a different tact, you can do it. the companions you find yourself with, you will find yourself caring for. the combat is super fun and creative  why not pick up a halfling, as a barbarian, and throw them at the enemy for the final kill. what about a teddy bear? the story is highstakes and engaging, and the big bads are truly big and bad. larian's got a knack for writing the most evil characters, as well. larian's also got love for the community, adding in community jokes after the game has been released, giving us updates, listening to fans. give this game a try but be ready to devote a lot of time to it. i beat it at around 120hrs and there were still things i missed."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-12,"the game's sprawling openworld design can lead to moments of aimless wandering, as players struggle to find direction amidst the vastness of the game world, because of the lack of great map design. additionally, the narrative pacing can feel uneven at times, with certain story arcs dragging on while others feel rushed or underdeveloped, such as the start of the game was rushed. as a new person to the series, i had no idea where is where. they just jumped into the game. after an hour of slow, boring, gameplay i just stopped playing. this game got goty, because of the nudity, the gore, and the romance in it. this game should have his own title. its unfair to bring a romance simulator with nudes, onto the gaming industry, of course this game is gonna win everything expect, best art direction, best narrative, and best game direction. because this game has no art, no narrative, and no direction. a game where you can design the private parts of your character is not a game. its an overhyped romance novel."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-11,"the best role play experience ever. it is the perfect game for me. a piece of magnificent adventure with countless details, and interesting gameplay design. thank you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-11,"overall a great game and deserving of game of the year. the combat is fun with a number of different ways of approaching boss fights and different difficulty settings allow you to customize the experience to your skill level. the story overall is solid and is strengthened greatly by one of best cast of characters in gaming. biggest critique is that the game is very buggy on console, this game is no doubt a much better experience on pc. while not the ground breaking experience some people claim id still give it a strong buy recommendation as the best game of 2023"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-09,its good but dos2 was better. the impact of your choices is so overhyped. builds are non existent you are forced into very liniar playstyles. had do force myself to keep playing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-08,"the main things that really bring this game down from a 10 are a few things. the game is pretty over hyped and i'm surprised it's as universally approved as it is. 1 very unfun and annoying late game battles 2 missing attacks even with a 94 advantage and having key defensive auras broken by concentration due to rng 3 having to load files sometimes 5 times to choose a dialogue option you want. lots of fights in this game are very annoying and unfun to deal with. mainly because most of the late game battles fill an entire arena with enemies who all silence and blind and stun and sleep your team constantly. most of the act 3 battles are very unpleasant to fight. while i loved the complex branching story you can craft by choosing dialogue options it's so god damned annoying to lose dice rolls. the rng aspect of this game really really brings the quality of it down for me. i understand it's based on a table top game with dice but it's a video game. have rng in combat but not in dialogue options. and no i won't accept a dice roll and play the story out based on the outcome. i want to choose my character path. the pros are definitely the insane attention to detail in environments, and the performances of the actors. but the combat and dialogue dice rolling is definitely a huge problem and i don't agree it should have won game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-08,"good story, some fight have too many enemies making combat too long like 3 min enemy turn, actions dont recharge after combat but you have to rest wtf is this in some zone you cant even rest so you are more limited in a limited combat, act 1 is boring af you cant do nothing in combat low level few actions taking to long to kill even basic enemy, act 2 story get really good and act 3 it drop at bottom, very very over rated game nothing special cant see how this won game of the year over other 2023 games much better then this. also all this ppl saying this is a good game according to steam only 20 of players finished the game, 38 finished act 2, and 50 finished act 1 so i mean what are you talking about you dont even played the game  dont have other platform stats but i cant see far from steam ones."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-07,"the ending battle is largely boring, but that's okay  it's incredibly immersive until the early to mid game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-06,"just finished this game. 139 hours later i can say this is a good game but over hyped and no way a 1010 realistic score is a 710 pros several dialogue options endless possibilities story beats can be interesting graphics can be pretty flawless voice acting you will get your money's worth meaning very long game cons because its so long the story is not coherent it can be a mess especially by the end the game just looks like it was partially made by ai not polished graphically, wonky animations still bugs. lots and lots of bugs"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-01,"baldur's gate 3 , sem dvida nenhuma, e com folga, a melhor converso de um rpg de mesa para um jogo eletrnico. difcil dizer algo sobre baldur's gate 3 a essa altura que j no tenham dito, ento vou analislo baseado na minha experincia.o jogo eletrnico mais prximo que eu joguei de um rpg de mesa tinha sido disco elysium, que apesar de ser mais baseado em texto  um jogo incrvel. j baldur's gate 3 no traz apenas textos, mas todo o tabuleiro e seus acessrios para o mundo digital, com cutscenes e cinemticas de tirar o flego  de 170 horas delas, mundos abertos e batalhas de turno, tudo baseado no universo de dungeons  dragons se voc j jogou dd voc estar em casa. eu nunca joguei um rpg de mesa por falta de oportunidade e agora fiquei com vontade de jogar. voc tem um nvel de liberdade em baldur's gate 3 que eu jamais vi em nenhum outro jogo. aps criar o seu personagem como quiser e passar pela fase tutorial, voc meio que pode fazer qualquer coisa, moralmente correta ou no. ningum  invulnervel no jogo, nem os npcs de vilarejos, independente da raa, sexo ou idade. voc pode literalmente tacar o terror se quiser, mas tenha em mente que voc ter que arcar com as  interaes com seres e npcs costumam ser bem imersivas, alternando o ngulo de cmera conforme voc dialoga com eles. os personagens possuem grficos e expresses bem realistas para um jogo desse tipo. d uma surra no star30. algumas escolhas de dilogos voc vai precisar rolar dados e ter uma pontuao mnima para concretizla, e o xito disso vai depender muito dos atributos do seu personagem e do seu grupo. embora parea que  s nos dilogos que voc faz a rolagem os dados, todo o background do jogo funciona assim, principalmente nos combates. por exemplo atacou um inimigo e tirou 6 de dano? voc pode consultar o log de batalhas e ver as rolagens que ocorreram e que fizeram voc tirar 6 de  combates deste jogo merecem um destaque a parte, mesmo comparado a outros rpgs com combates em turno.comeando pela trilha sonora, que em muitos combates so soberbas, aquelas msicas picas com corais, transformando combates triviais em verdadeiros eventos hericos. e no pense que em todos os combates voc s vai escolher o que cada personagem do seu grupo vai fazer e depois s assistir. muitos inimigos podem te surpreender no meio de um turno de tal maneira que voc pode simplesmente no jogar o prximo.ento antes de algumas batalhas voc precisa bolar uma estratgia de ataque e defesa. voc  livre para ir somente na porrada se quiser, mas sua vida se tornar um inferno em algumas batalhas, mesmo jogando no modo explorador fcil.baldur's gate 3 tambm se tornou o rpg de turno com a maior durao de batalhas em turno que eu j joguei na vida. algumas delas demorando de 40 a 60 minutos sem reload de save. e  extremamente gratificante quando voc ganha uma batalha dessas, mesmo se no tiver nenhuma recompensa aparente.embalando o recorde acima ele fez outro o de maior quantidade de inimigos para se enfrentar em uma nica batalha de turno. em alguma situaes voc poder enfrentar mais de 40 inimigos de uma vez. os cards dos inimigos preenchem a parte superior da tela e ainda aparece um 25 do lado, porque no couberam todos. ento imagine voc, com quatro personagens no grupo, tendo que enfrentar uma legio inteira? this is sparta!outro aspecto que eu nunca tinha visto em nenhum outro jogo  o suporte ao controle. mas d para jogar no controle? voc deve perguntar. e aqui eu preciso bater palmas para o larian studios. quando voc joga com o controle, no pense que ele vai apenas trocar os layouts dos botes os desenvolvedores construram um hud inteiro totalmente focado para quem joga no controle at porque o jogo seria lanado nos consoles, e essa adaptao ficou incrivelmente bem feita.jogando no pc, voc pode alternar entre controle e tecladomouse quando quiser. todo o hud se adapta. confesso que ambas opes ficaram to bem feitas que eu no sabia com qual jogar. no final, acabei optando pelo controle, porque voc consegue mover o personagem livremente no mapa e dar zoom, transformando um jogo originalmente isomtrico em terceira pessoa. j no teclado voc move os personagens clicando onde eles devem ir, s conseguindo dar zoom. mas no teclado, voc tem uma opo que ajuda muito que  pesquisar o nome de um item e descobrir em qual inventrio ele est, algo que no tem no controle. enfim, cabe a voc testar ambos, avaliar os prs e contras de cada e decidir com qual jogar."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-01,baldur's gate 3 is the new game of the century for me with all the detail the game has put into it i can't wait for mod support to make this already fantastic game even greater
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-28,"i literally cannot say enough good things about this game. the story, the characters, the openness are all spectacular. the turn based gameplay may not be for everyone, but i cant get enough of it. one of the best games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-27,"great game that delivers tons of adventures. my only minus points would be that there are still some  bugs in the game, some of which make it hard or impossible to complete certain missions. and the third act... is something. it offers a lot, but it just is too damn big for its own good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-26,"the worst part is that bg3 constantly switches me from one activity to the other, all of which requires a lot of focus, so i'm not able to focus on anything for more than 57 minutes. this is opposite to gaming, crush immersion, it prevents me from having fun, and with few other unnecessarily complicated activities which gives you freedom to play as you want it is opposite to fun. and everything is very, very slow. countless slow, meticulous activities, no matter what you're doing you will spend a lot more time on it than you want and will have to sleep a lot, constantly. larian does not respect player time. i prefer to make dish washing than play bg3. to give you some context, i played divinity original sin 2 for some time just to compare the two and it's miles better than bg3 in this regards. it may be worst as a game, but it's playable and it's fun!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-24,"masterpiece, a new reference in the genre and really unique. if you haven't played party based rpgs or dnd and would like to get a sample try this one, it's a blast to play. storywise the game is brilliant. you progress story through the main quests but really fill the gaps and expand through sides and exploration. the world is telling you a story of its own, and it's so cool to go out there and discover it. decisions matter, and they will greatly influence your playthrough. origin characters are really charismatic and interesting to play with, i loved having them around. the same can be said for lots of the secondary characters. the vas are amazing, they really live the characters.graphics and settingslevels are amazing, it is so immersive. the music and sounds are really good too, i hope they had added more voiced tracks like the one in the house of hope.building your own custom character while being able to respec easily at any moment is a joy. i really like the mechanics, rests spells  equipment etc. it was really cool to build my party over time, unlock abilities, use new equipment and strategies, mastering the party gameplay over time. you build your own strategy and feel it like your own, as well as how you carve your path. agency feeling is high on this one.i like how chaotic, complex and unpredictable the game can be. if you've played outer wilds, this one also has that feeling of accompiishment when you discover how something works, or how to smartly play an encounter. for the curious and picky, it's wonderful. you will be rewarded for going the extra  the final mission, i dislike how ally help is implemented. you need to call on them per fight, and waste an action doing so. it is quite discouraging to the point i barely used it. i would have strongly preferred allies to show up along the way as you progress through it if you have that ally available.inventory management is a bit of a mess, and there are many things that shouldn't be there. why do i want food in my inventory? it's useless, i just want it to go to camp for me to be able to long rest effectively. also, i'd like to have more distinctive bags to put stuff in scroll bag, weapons bag.... i missed some important mechanics due to the game not telling you about them, like the possibility of going to camp mostly at any time or the idea of sending all food to camp since it is only useless there and it weighs quite a lot making you encumbered often ps karlach is a good mule. i dislike how the game makes you feel a bit too much urgency at first, thorugh cinematics that are kinda encouraging you to take haste even though you can rest as many times as needed. it made my first act more difficult as i was trying not to waste spells. you may skip some cutscenes because you didn't long rest at that precise location too.a tip, don't hesitate to use scrolls, potions, elixirs and such. i had the typical need of hoarding them to be used in the future and ended up by not using most. make use of the resources at  game leaves me with a feeling of mastery of my particular party, but with an urge to try out other combinations and learn about different paths and strategies. also, can't wait for steam workshop support. this game will greatly benefit from modding. act 3 still has some bugs that need to be addressed and some things were left unfinished infernal iron?.looking forward to play this coop at some point, if you are looking for an adventure look no further."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-23,this is literally the best game i've ever played. it redefined how good a game can be.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-23,"it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close. i almost never buy games on release, but this was well worth the full price and more. it's a phenomenal single player experience for the story, voice acting, gameplay, and 100 other things. and even better as a multiplayer experience for the pure shenanigans. it's like dd if you and your friends could be even more unhinged. i can't say enough good things about this game that haven't already been said before. just know that everyone gassing up this game is 100 correct."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-23,baldur's gate 3 is goodgame but the length is too short. i hope there can be a larger dlc
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,simply the most perfect game i ever played in 30 years. what will i play after this?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-22,"they gave up on the character storylines in act 3, as if they weren't already bad enough. often the acting direction is unbearable. voice lines taking 2x as long as they should because there needs to be a 5 second pause after each sentence for no reason, lines that sound like they were written for a middle school reading level fantasy book, entire characters that are completely bland and uninteresting like wyll. weird plot holes and inconsistencies and the stupidest twists and nuances. the gameplay is alright enough, but the bland story really drags the game down as a whole. the game is rated for adults and has violence and nudity, so it should be written with adults in mind as well. i cringed so many times listening to dialogue and by act 3 was just spamming space bar to skip the lines and get to the end of the game. just inexcusable for a game this big to have such poor overall writing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-21,"one of the best games i've ever played. great story, great environmental design, great character design, great game play. i cannot think of one thing that i can call bad. definitely recommended."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-21,"this game is utterly incredible. i have nearly 500 hours under my belt and i am still not bored with it. yes, i agree, the combat takes some getting used to as its turn based and its not a simple point and shoot, you have to think and plan for each fight and the outcome of some attacks are based upon the roll of a dice just like dd. but when you get the hang of it, its great fun. the characters are interesting and well developed, some of their stories are heart breaking and beautiful all at once. the overall story of the game is very well written and its a stunning game to look at. the music is very well composed and some tracks are just perfection. the voice acting is top notch, with neil newbon as astarion the stand out star. there is massive replay ability in it due to the large number of species and classes you have to select from. its also wildly funny at times, and at others you will be crying with the sheer emotion this game brings out after spending 100 hours with your party members. oh, and for people complaining about how woke it is because you have the ability to romance any of your companions, well if you don't like a gay relationship, then don't romance a companion the same gender as yours. its a simple as that. 500 hours in and i'm still going strong. finished it twice and now on my third run and i am still finding surprises and new things. this is my favourite ever game and a true masterpiece. i can't see anything replacing it for a long time...until maybe a sequel...please larian....i can hope!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-21,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-14,"mi opinin sobre baldur's gate 3 no es la primera vez que alguien la va a decir, pero considero que este juego es la mejor experiencia que un juego de estas caractersticas puede ofrecer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-20,50 hours in im on act 3 and just finding it hard to keep going . reallly feel like im going through the motions and skipping a lot of cut sceens. right now id say 6.5 out of 10. ill probably try to get back into it soon. but right now ive had enough.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-20,"the game is literally perfect in any way. it has great variety of classes and races, the combinations you can make with multiclassing are totally insane! the game is 100 must play for everyone. even if you never tried turnbased games you're gonna get used to it within 25 hours which would still be in the prologueon the nautiloid. the best thing about it is that it's very replayfriendly. make a new character and be an evil guy or be a hero who's saving everyone not asking for a single coin. make someone who likes sticking their nose into every hole or the guy who's gonna be 100 neutral. the choises are up to you. the characters that you meet in the game are so wellwritten. gale's, astarion's and shadowheart's stories are best in my opinion. but i'd be foolish not to admit that every single character is fearfully wellwritten. try it out and you will see how great it is!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-20,"wow, so this was goty 2023? i basically fell asleep in the first act. it's a functional, yet boring game. the writing is also atrocious and contrived, although no less than i would expect based on other larian titles. they are the kings of cringe in that department. further, the game has incredible performance issues for not being particularly goodlooking. i'll just have to replay rpgs from before 2010 with mods to get my fix if this is the 'new standard' for wrpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-19,"this review takes place after beating the game after patch 6 launched. i've spent 30 minutes trying to write a genuine review for this game, im just going say the one thing i wish i could do is experience how this game ends all over again for the first time. people say the endings are horrible but thats because of how the game was at launch. they've patched in an interesting epilogue that helps close chapters with your companions you've traveled with throughout the game. i highly recommend you to play this game, and it might be easy to just rush through the game just to finish it, but i suggest you to take your time and complete all your companions quests, and when you're doing a quest for a companion, bring them along to do the quest with you. thats about it. also karlach is my big muscle mommy who protects me, a tiny bard, from the bbeg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-18,baldur's gate 3 is an incredible rpg for pc and ps5 that's true to the dungeons  dragons experience as well as the sheer possibilities that tabletop games allow.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-17,"game is good, but playing on a ps5 is pain in a butt. scrolling the inventory with tons of useless stuff is pain, camera is pain, choosing the right scroll is headache cause of reading descriptions over and over again. and overall let's be honest  this is more like a turn based tactic game rather than rpg. whole 2nd act is just a series of long fights. i dropped after 2nd act. well, the game is worth playing, but not for me i have 25 years exp started with fallout 2  just fyi"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-17,"this game is not to describe with words, it is there to explore a new gen of gaming quality in all categorys. it will bring a lot of new potential for this type of games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-17,this is the 1st baldurs gate i have played im hooked to this franchise this game is the best game i have played in years you can literally play this game over and over with different outcomes or you can take you time be evil be good do what ever you want andenjoy this game this game is good i will be enjoying this game for years to come
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-16,"fantastic game. so much to explore, so many options. this is really a game for every rpg enthusiast that enjoyed games like the original baldur's gate games or titles like dragon age originals. combat is turn based, so if you don't like that, stay away."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-16,"one of the few games where you can murder a bunch of goblins, and then flick beans with an orc, elf, or a demon right after."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-15,"it's no exaggeration to say this is one of the greatest games of all time. this comment box would not do it justice. gameplay, voice acting, exploration, story, soundtrack, all top of the line. it does have that crpg jank, with bugs and glitches, but it can all easily be overlooked. the last act of the game also shows some signs of it being rushedunfinished, which is a shame, but it's really such a minor downside given this game sheer scale. definitely give this game a chance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-14,"first review here. it's true, its the best game ever. you should try it. i played about 300hours and i still don't finished the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-14,"in my opinion baldur's gate iii is that kind of rpg where you find all necessary elements to fully experiment a game masterpiece. of course baldur's gate iii is not a perfect game and there always will be things which can be improved but nevertheless this game is a real piece of art. i love how much attention the creative team paid to all game details such the graphic design of characters and environment the characters features, expressions and their voices fully performed by artists the rich story and history of the faern realm the complexity of the plot, main quest and other side missions and last but not the least, the wonderful music score of the game, one of the best game soundtracks ever made. my rating for each section of the game is this gameplay 4.6  5 story 4.5  5 characters 4.8  5 video 4.6  5 audio 4.5  5 user interface 4.7  5."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-13,"i didn't think that beeing over 20, i would still feel the magic while playing that i felt as a child. this game restored my faith in today's gaming industry. it is still possible to create games with a believable world, deep, real characters, an intriguing plot line, an interesting combat system, the choises that actually have consequences, without today's clumsy microtransaction systems , without treating players as an idiots and without the culture of ending the game after its release. chapeau bas larian."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,one of the best games ever made. i started with huge hate but after 56 hours that hate turned into love
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"i have mixed feelings about this game. i played the first two parts of baldur's gate back in the day, but this game doesn't give me that baldur's gate feeling. maybe it's because of the mediocre story, the poor character introduction or the obsessive adherence to old rpg mechanics. i'm not a dnd player, but i am at least a passionate board gamer. nevertheless, i can't understand why the dnd system had to be implemented so precisely. it's a crpg after all, and i play it because i don't want to roll dice. the inventory is overflowing with useless stuff, 35 longswords, longsword 1 and then maybe a legendary variant with a completely negligible attribute. it feels like it makes no difference at all. the spells are boring, the combat mechanics are uninteresting and tedious, the limited camera perspective is annoying to say the least. i admit, the way spells, environment and weapons can be combined is creative and fun, but that was already in divinity original sins 2 and it was more fun there because you weren't slowed down by the limitations of the dnd system. there are often many ways to solve a situation, but i still feel like i'm on rails. i really have to force myself to keep playing because neither itemization, story nor character development give me any incentive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"fantastic, engrossing, gripping game that i keep replaying and that i will keep coming back to for years to come. it has everything  great story, fascinating characters, strategic gameplay that keeps challenging and surprising the player. it's fun and thanks to how the mechanics are implemented had me playing classes i've never played before, like the barbarian. tossing things ... and people turns out to be a lot of fun. there is a lot of tough choices to be made in the story and i find myself challenged as a roleplayer in many situations, debating on what my character would do! the ost is also incredible, its the best music i've heard in a while and every location theme turns out to be my next best liked piece. the vas work is amazing and the fact all characters are mocapped makes them very believable. i love the story, love the character, love the battle systems, love the quirks of larian's writing and just overall, this is one of the bet games ive ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"baldur's gate 3, the highly anticipated continuation of the legendary rpg series, unfortunately fails to live up to the lofty standards set by its predecessors. larian studios' ambitious attempt to revive the beloved franchise is marred by a multitude of technical issues, lackluster gameplay mechanics, and a narrative that struggles to engage players on a meaningful level. in addition to its technical and gameplay shortcomings, baldur's gate 3 also struggles to deliver a compelling narrative that resonates with players. the story feels disjointed and unfocused, with poorly developed characters and lackluster dialogue that fail to evoke any emotional investment from the player. the narrative lacks the depth and complexity that defined the original baldur's gate games, leaving players feeling disconnected from the world and its inhabitants. baldur's gate 3 is a missed opportunity that fails to live up to its potential."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"what even is this game. you start up with no knowledge about the game then, the story just starts randomly, nothing was said how to play it. the story was cringe, the gameplay is slow, and the characters are so weird. everyone is horny and weird... my character died by stepping on a small amount of ember.... everything is gore, slow and just boring asf. a romance simulator. check out the honest game trailers of this game. they always say the truth. this is the start of the downhill of games... well done bg3...."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-10,"one of the best games i have ever played in my whole life, i love it oh my god"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-10,"if you don't have anyone to play dd with then you must play this game, there is a reason why it became goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-10,"baldur's gate 3 is a remarkably polished game, offering a very solid experience. while it may not break new ground, its attention to detail and refinement set a new standard in rpgs. from its intricate storytelling to its strategic combat, it delivers an immersive journey for players seeking depth and challenge. in my opinion, it's simply a very wellexecuted game where we'll spend many enjoyable hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-10,"okay, i'll be the negative one here. first of all, i have to admit that i had avoided bg1 and bg2 for most of my life and only played them when i learned that bg3 was in development. ironically, i had played almost all other isometric rpgs of that era. it's also worth mentioning that i started the first divinity game from larian twice and never finished it either time. i just couldn't get into it. so when it turned out that larian would be making bg3, my first thought was please don't let this be divinity 3! and unfortunately, it kind of is. long story short, bg3 has its flaws, but it's still a very solid rpg and a definite mustplay for fans of the genre. however, others have already praised it here, so i'll focus on the criticism. what bothered me about bg3? the overall plot choice, where i felt like i was playing a scifi rpg like xcom rather than another installment in the baldur's gate series throughout the first act. the second act, which is praised by most players. i didn't like it at all and i was looking forward to getting out of it. it wasn't until the third act that i finally felt like i was playing baldur's gate. until then, it was a wellcrafted game for me, but i didn't see baldur's gate except for a few characters and references at all. however, the third act is buggy and unfinished. for this, i would hang the guys and girls from larian by their genitals in the draft. how many years was it in early access, for them to release a game with a buggy finale? some quests couldn't be completed under certain circumstances, some dialogues were bugged in a loop. in short, i finally got to the real world of baldur's gate, but at the same time, we went from excellent craftsmanship back to buggy early access. i knew i shouldn't have bought it right after release and should have waited at least a year. but i didn't listen. companions  poor number, poor selection. if i compare it to bg2, how many recruitable characters were there? maybe twenty? in bg3 there are 6 at the beginning and more will be added only in very advanced stages of the game. some of them are de facto near the end, just before the finale. some companions are downright unlikable and there's not much point in combining the likable ones because they have very similar uses. this is also due to the fact that in bg3, unlike in the sequel, you can only have a fourmember party. in the end, it limits your character selection quite a bit, because if, like me, you don't like the only rogue companion in the game, you have no choice but to play as them yourself. total change of game mechanics  okay, larian is not entirely to blame for this, but the evolution of dnd rules as such. larian just followed the approximately current dnd rules. for me, this simplification was a shock. again, it felt like it was in the spirit of the trend of let's make games for lazy, incompetent morons who can't be bothered to learn the extensive rules. to sum it up, despite my criticism, bg3 is a great rpg. it's just a lousy baldur's gate. it's more divinity than baldur's gate. if you want to play a solid baldur's gate, play pillars of eternity, because it's more baldur's gate than baldur's gate 3. and that's a shame. pros graphics craftsmanship fun environmental interaction options in and out of combat cons buggy act iii only fourmember party, poor companion selection most of the time it doesn't have the baldur's gate feeling at all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,indeed it's a great triple a game under many aspects but because of the terrible d20 system implementation which seems utterly scripted can't be a 10.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"definitely not for me, i love turn based combat but this is taking it to the extreme."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"exceptional set of tools that are fun to use in this extremely detailed world that is very fun to explore. while the game is very good, it still kind of feels like a beta in some places. tons of really good content and stories, but no really great moments that wowed me that keep it from feeling truly special. but that doesn't take away from what they accomplished with this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"larian studios respects the players and the source ip, delivering something truly magical and fitting of the forgotten realms universe. it really does feel like the books, and i love the amount of options the developers gave. they did not skimp on the playability of this game, and i have many hundreds of hours still to go on this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"i've played the original baldur's gates and enjoyed them thoroughly. this one was no different. the rpg element and storywriting were terrific. the level designs were gorgeous. what brought the score down was the fact that every character in the game is pansexual, and my companions repeatedly tried to get into my pants. it was so contrived and distracted from the plot. i don't understand the need for such an unhealthy focus on sex in a video game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"baldurs gate 3 feels like the perfect culmination of decades of research and passion. beautifully bringing together everything that the previous games did well and enhancing them, building upon existing frameworks and achieving a fully fledged package. character design is phenomenal, the facial animations however do feel out of place alongside otherwise stunning graphics including those of the wider environment. the story can be a confusing one and i urge those who have not played previous titles to take their time to come to terms with the worldbuilding and characters therein. once the pieces begin to come together the immersion takes over and one becomes lost in this fantastic universe of seemingly infinite possibilities. the games many branching paths are accessed through a largely underutilised random mechanic, stemming from the games dd origins. however, this can allow players to replay the game as many times as they like never quite knowing the experience they are going to get. this ensures that any worries of repetition on subsequent playthroughs is not a worry as the game has what is essentially a builtin randomiser. this randomiser applies to skill checks and their chances of being applied in combat, chances to hit, chances at critical damage etc. all of this can be seen in real time onscreen. not everything however is out of the hands of the player of course. skills you choose when making your character and subsequently level up will lower the threshold you need to hit for said random chances to apply. the game remains random but can be tilted towards your favour depending on the situation and aptitude of your character and party to said situation. overall the characters you party up with are also rich in detail. i warmly recommend this title to anybody, i shall not expand on the nature of the characters as i would only do them a disservice, the magic is in discovering them for yourself."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"it's an amazing experience. a great game with a lot of variation, great characters although i think they were more lively in dao, an awesome combat system, and great wagering. deservedly the best game of 2023, and as far as i'm concerned, possibly of the whole decade"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-06,"o game  perfeito, no tem oq dizer, a gameplay no  chata, as interaes com os personagens so perfeitos e bem construidos,a historia  magnifica, conseguiram elevar dd a outro nivel, oq antes era s o barbaro levantando seu grande brao e sacudindo sua grande espada, virou uma historia maravilhosa, linda e digna de choro, esse no  s o jogo do ano, nem da decada, mas sim o melhor jogo j lanado em todos os tempos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-06,"obviously the turnbased combat mechanics and dice rolls for dialogue options aren't going to be for everybody, people like different styles of gameplay so no matter how great a game is that's going to be a hurdle for them if it's not the type they like. bg3 for me is one of the best games i've played in years due to the characters and attention put into the world. the story is good, it's not perfect. gameplay depends on preference really, but for what it's trying to do it does it wonderfully. however as previously stated the characters in this game, particularly the companions are extremely well written which makes them feel more like people that characters and the attention to detail that's spread across the maps in this game is phenomenal. also one thing larian did that should be standard in games going forward is motion capture of almost every single character minor or major in the game as it really helps bring them to life rather than having someone trying to animate the character in a realistic manner."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,"gaming is on a downhill. i started the game and got no tutorial, nothing. character creation was more about, private parts, than anything else... i start the game and the cut scenes had no sound, only the ship, and other things. nobody was talking. the game is slow. walking 20 meters is 67 rounds... of course the game is very long... the map is the worst i ever saw in games... i was walking around and around.... my character died after stepped in a small amount of ember... this game is the lowest of lows... a romance simulator.... with useless gore... it was not good and pointless. everything was gore and nothing was looking good. alan wake 2 was really good, did the horror, the gore in a different way than any other game... yet it does not have any nudes, and its only on epic so people start hating it while they didn't even tried it out. i was shocked about why only epic so i started searching. the cost of the game was 80 mil... epic founded it... its that easy. if no epic  no alan wake 2. that game made me fell in love with the remedy universe. and alan wake 2 is the goty for 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,"baldur's gate 3, the longawaited sequel to the classic rpg series from bioware and larian studios, has finally arrived, and it's safe to say that this game is a mustplay for both newcomers and veterans of the genre.first and foremost, the game's narrative is engaging and immersive. the storytelling is rich, with intricate worldbuilding that draws players into the fantastical world of faerun. larian studios has managed to capture the essence of baldur's gate while introducing fresh and innovative elements that keep things feeling new and  gameplay mechanics are another high point. baldur's gate 3 features a deep and complex combat system that allows players to strategize and adapt in realtime. the character development is also noteworthy, with a robust skill tree, extensive customization options, and a dynamic class system that allows players to shape their characters in meaningful  graphics and visual effects are stunning, with beautiful environments, detailed character models, and impressive animations. the game's sound design is equally noteworthy, with an atmospheric soundtrack and immersive voice acting that bring the world of baldur's gate to life.however, despite its many strengths, baldur's gate 3 is not without its flaws. the game can be unforgiving at times, with a steep learning curve and high difficulty level that may frustrate some players. additionally, the game's lengthy campaign can be overwhelming for those who prefer a more streamlined experience.despite these minor issues, baldur's gate 3 is an impressive achievement that showcases the best of what rpgs have to offer. with its rich storytelling, engaging combat system, and stunning visuals, this game is a mustplay for any fan of the genre. for those who are willing to invest the time and effort, baldur's gate 3 promises an unforgettable adventure that will leave a lasting  conclusion, baldur's gate 3 is a modern masterpiece that builds on the legacy of its predecessors while pushing the boundaries of what an rpg can be. with a score of 9 out of 10, this game is a testament to the power and potential of storytelling through video games. whether you're a seasoned rpg veteran or just starting out, baldur's gate 3 is an experience that is not to be missed. review score 910"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,no microtransactions is half the score for me. but this also has a really intriguing story and deep gameplay. voice acting is on point. i wish they wouldnt have pandered to you know who so much but its near impossible to get a game that isnt forced to push some woke agenda these days. wouldve been a 1010 otherwise.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,role playing games will never be the same for me. my biggest regret is not playing this sooner.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-04,what is there to say about this game that hasn't been said? it's a masterpiece and its clear everyone who worked on the game was passionate about it from start to end. my only possible complaint is that while the game is amazing some of the content they cut is heartbreaking to hear about and would have elevanted the game just that much more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-04,"the best game of our generation. it is like playing actual dd with an actual dm, and each time you play it, you get to play the same basic story but in a totally different way!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-02,"i think its one of the best games in all of gaming history. great story, gameplay, voice acting and desition making."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-01,"bringing crpgs to the mainstream, all in all as close to perfect to what you would want from crpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-01,i started this game reluctantly just due to the hype it was getting and the awards it won at game of the year. it has now become one of my top 3 games of all time and there is an argument for it to be my number 1 if i remove nostalgia from the equation. voice acting and story are top notch and the combat is fluid and entertaining. i would say this game is going to become a prerequisite to calling ones self a true gamer.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-31,"oyun gerekten muhteem sinematikleri , oynan , taktikleri , derinlii oynadka beni benden alyor sadece 200 saat yeni karakter ap oyuna batan balamakla geirdim her karakterde ayr ayr keyif aldm gerekten diyecek daha fazla bir ey bulamyorum. aheser..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-31,"absolutely amazing game which is a worthy continuation of legendary bg1 and bg2 which i loved and play as a young teenager. i just finished my first playthrough and i have enjoyed it all the way through. game is huge. i have tried to visit every corner and finish every quest and it took me 220 hours to do it. but it never gets boring. main story is amazing and you are really making it your own based on decisions you take during playthrough. sidequests are entertaining and engaging. there was not a moment when i felt like doing chores. i have two things which i would prefer differently though... 1. lack of party members and small party  only 4 party members give you very little space for experimenting and varying your set up. 2. max level is only level 12 which doesn't give you access to most powerful and interresting spells and skills. also, as a veteran of genre, which i probably am as i played many dd type games, i made a mistake of picking balanced difficulty. well, it was really easy. only one hard fight in game was raphael, but still fell on first try. and for example dragon ansur didn't even get a turn. strategical element of game was kind of nonexistent due to it being so easy. and things like buffing are totally useless on balanced difficulty. also kind of nonexistent in game. concentration during most of buffing spells i didn't really like neither, but ok, it is what it is. but none of my complaints are game breaking or preventing people from fully enoying beautiful and engaging story. it really does not have competition in this genre regarding quality of visuals and voice acting. also, lower difficulty and simplified rules are great for people with no experience in genre. it is really easy to get into playing bg3 even if you have no clue what dd is about. i see here some negative reviews regarding story or lack of tutorial  even probably written by same person under different accounts. well, it is absolute bs. if someone says that story is missing, then it is absolute delusional idiot. and if you can't figure out how to play this in like 1 hour tops, then stay away from any game which requires at least slight use of brain forever. king of the genre stays for me convincingly pathfinder wotr. and in terms of game mechanics i also prefer other games, like for example pillars of eternity, neverwinter nights or even divinity original sin. but in terms of perfect storytelling, baldur's gate 3 has no equal and it is absolutely worth playing. i will play definitely again, although i will pump my difficullty up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-30,"this is a mastethis is a masterpiece. the last word must be said from the beginning. it might be the best game i've ever played. frankly, i didn't like the cinematics released in the last year and i didn't have high expectations, but larian proved me wrong. it's incredible that such a smallscale studio can achieve such great quality work! it was a real source of surprise and happiness, especially after the recent disappointing works of the big studios such as diablo 4. thank you larian, they are now on par with blizzard north for me...rpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-29,overrated. its not a bad game but every fight is a pain every simple fight is like 30 min. story is good but the storry telling is complicated you need to try hard for learn story. no tutorial or smthng there is no reason to love this game expect for romance or nudity.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,"very good game. what's amazing is that larian studios created the game knowing that players may not even know about 20 of the content. thus, individual approaches to games become original. we also have many character classes to choose from, which also significantly influence the game. to be honest, when i bought the game i was confused and unsure about its great ratings. fortunately, it turned out that the game is really worth playing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,eh.. not my cup of tea. i enjoyed the music and astarion... but other than that lost patience some 1520 hours in.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,"i never thought i would enjoy a turns based combat game let alone putting it on my best game ever played list. i played the game, i watched the game, i discussed it with my friends and as far as i can see we all played a different game. i only played two runs and cannot wait for the next one and the next one and the next one... as a person who suffers from not knowing what would the other choise lead me, i can safely say that i don't get that anxiety from this game rather i think it like ok in my next run i will roleplay as a character who would make this choice instead."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,"baldurs gate 3 is an embarrassment of riches for everyone who can at least tolerate turnbased combat and the isometric perspective i started up the game and spent the next hour in the warm embrace of the incredibly powerful character creator, clicking through a host of classes, subclasses, traits and spells as well as trying on a smorgasboard of faces, skin tones and other anatomical options, i was soothed, delighted and a bit ashamed of my lack of faith. larian have proven their credentials as master craftsmen of the genre at least twice, i knew this game was my jam. yet only when i finally dove head first into act i and resurfaced at the end of act iii about 130 hours later, i truly understood how astonishing a game this is. baldurs gate 3 is an epic level crpg 5. wherever you go, you are surrounded by excellence. the very first master stroke i noticed was the incredibly detailed implementation of the dd ruleset with its many, many complexities. larian went incredibly far to make sure that, just like in an actual roleplay session, you can use all these skills and traits in almost all kinds of ways to solve all kinds of problems the game throws at you. whatever kind of character you play, you can find a way to succeed in most situations, and even your failures feel unique. during the third act, this very depth of simulation makes your avatar feel terrifyingly powerful and the escalating level of challenge increasingly scary. there are builds out there that completely break the game, of course, but in my experience, bg3 walks the edge between character growth and challenge escalation really well and with unprecedented variety. next i noticed beauty. bg3 is not flashy the isometric perspective doesnt lend itself to spectacular vistas and the most cinematic it gets are simple shotreverse shot compositions during millions of conversation scenes. but every inch of scenery on screen drips with detail work and atmosphere. the character designs, oh, those are just wonderful, oozing charisma and vision from every pore. its a feast for the eyes, while the ears languish in an epic score and truly inspired voice performances. the main cast is world class, but even the bit players execute their lines with warmth and emotion. this game knows how to wow the senses. the plot takes a bit more time to make its worth known. the hook is truly bonkers, but then things slow down a bit and the worldending conspiracy on the horizon is crowded out by more immediate concerns and stories appropriate for newbie player characters. this feels like a letdown at first, but soon i found myself sinking into the spirit of languorous adventuring and things were just fun. the script is excellent, and the starting area held a lot of low stakes drama and locally sourced excitement. all the while, the game slowly, slowly ratcheted up the tension, until all through act ii, the pedal hit the metal for real. act 3 shifted gears with an audible clunk. the high octane ramp up of act 2 was replaced with another open world, do anything until the final door opens for you kind of narrative structure. this noticeably relaxed the tension and was quite unwelcome at first. it took me a while to recover the sense of directionless adventuring that was so helpful during act i, but when i was over that hump, i noticed something wonderful so many people and stories i had met during my way to the big city had followed me here. so many tales were braided into mine, so many fates were intertwined with that of my characters. and none of it felt forced or tacked on! its a marvel of story crafting, and it does result in a grand, no holds barred crescendo complete with heroic speechifying, gathering of the troops, grand gestures, grander battles, and a very satisfying ending. the denouement could use a bit more polish, though. so much praise and i havent even mentioned the main draw of the game for me the few, the happy few, this band of brothers and sisters, the party. six excellently written characters full of charm, wit, flaws and secrets, all with their own epic quest line which grows along and intertwined with the main quest line, all with sympathies, antipathies, deeply held convictions. i have my favorites, but if none of them melt your heart then it must be made of stone. these are the people giving you the opportunity to play the role you chose for your protagonist, and they are wonderful collaborators. this, for me, is the core of the bottomless enjoyment bg3 has for me that all its wonders are braided together to paint a marvelous stage for me to write an extraordinary fate upon. do i have quibbles? yes, i do, most of them having to do with a few interface weaknesses. none of them matter, though im already kneedeep in concepts for further playthroughs. tldr do you like rpgs and the words turn, based and combat dont send you running? play this game. there is none better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,"story is fine, but the game is bugged to all hell. i'm in act 3 and i can't play the game. during combat it freezes and i can't do anything. i have to force quit, reload and hope the game doesn't freeze again. constant saving and reloading just to get through one combat encounter. it's absolutely a pain in the backend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,"howd this win goty?! i remember when this released and everybody was like whoa look baldurs gate 3. then i bought the game and was dumbfounded by the boring gameplay, cant believe i spent 70 on it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,its amazing how your story can change not just based on yours choices in game but from character creation in the beginning.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-23,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"i love dnd but this is just boring, slow, too much gore, and too much romance. overall the game doesn't say anything about where you are and what is the motive behind your doings. the story is built up on cliche, and the map design is bad. i played this game for hours and it was just cringe. the gameplay was something else... i was walking around in circles and my character stepped on a small amount of ember and died xd wtf.... people play this game because of the fear of missing out. i'm glad on which game i'm playing for the third time and seeing the details of that game. not this one"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,very addictive game. when you play bd3 then every game seems 2 levels under
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,"incredible game, the best one in the genre for me. unfortunately, it still has a lot of bugs that really affect gameplay in a negative way, but as time passes i'm sure this will go down as one the best games in the public eye."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"good story, super lovably designed characters and everywhere you can discover something but the turnbased combat was chosen is terrible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"while it may be intimidating or overwhelming in its first few hours, once you get into the combat system and story, there is nothing quite like it. this is a game that has been clearly made with so much love, filled with so much to do and see, that it truly earns its 60 price tag unlike so many of the aaa games releasing recently."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"um jogo que beira a perfeio. grficos lindos, histria cativante e profunda, todas as misses, das mais simples as mais complexas, so todas incrveis. os companheiro e viles so muito bem escritos e voc se fascina e quer saber mais e mais sobre todos eles. o combate  complicado no incio mas com o tempo voc se impressiona com a quantidade de opes de como lidar com os inimigos!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,un jeu avec un scnario et des choix vraiment utiles. je suis  70h et j'en vois pas le bout. c'est vraiment le pied ! ma premire fois que je joue  un genre pareil mais le tour par tour en combat permet une stratgie exemplaire. et l'exploration est rcompens. vraiment un jeu qui donne envie de s'investir et de continuer pour connatre votre fin.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"one the best rpgs ever made, the roleplaying aspect is the highest over seen, the massive amount of voice lines and dialogue options is astounding, the combat is engaging and makes you think of your next move, the only downside would be how they go about battles sometimes they put too many enemies in one battle and the game is rather unforgiving even with the difficulty down, all in all one of the best games ive ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"used to like this game, the first 3 hours was good, but then it just went downhill. from the start it was interesting, loved the great atmosphere and the characters were amazing but the story was not that good, and just overall built upon cliche. sad to say this but this game is not worth the goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"started the game with great expectations of the overall hype around it, but after playing it for hours it was boring, and too much gore, nudes, and bad map design. this is the reason gaming is going on a downhill... romance this, romance that! romance even a bear! like what in the hell is this... no story, cringe characters, too much gore and cheap map design. not a good game. this something robbed many games from game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"i love dnd but this was one was not okay. the game was not telling anything about the story so kinda i just went with it... the to much gore was not okay... and the overall map design felt really bad, and the whole game was confusing asf. the main problem is the lack of action, and the over romancing everyone...from a bear to a demon to anybody... the game sold wit the nude scenes pretty good and mainly thats the reason it became goty... the game drops you in, not telling you anything and boom go. this game is far from being the goty. very sad where gaming is going."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"its the first time ive ever played dnd and im in love. this game is just amazing. i can feel the love and efforts that larian team put into this game. this thing has so much soul in it, from each characters dialogue to their personality and face expression, everything is amazing and their vas totally nailed it and i personally love the narratives voice so much. and ive never seen such game could offer this much creativity in gameplay. u can basically do anything u can imagine. and the turnbased combat system was new to me so i had a tiny bit of hard time at first but after a few hours im so hooked and atm im on another playthrough to try other classes and ending. other than a few bugs which the devs always pay attention to to fix, theres literally nothing to complain. totally deserve goty. graphic, story, gameplay, all 1010. but beware for the nudity and seggs lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"bg3 the biggest surprise for me in years. i knew nothing about this game before it came out. the only reason i heard about it is because it was getting such positive buzz, and it was all deserved. ive spent hundreds of hours in this immersive story. from the characters, to the story, to the exploration, this game blows every other rpg out of the water. this game released around the same time as starfield and it made me realize how boring starfield is and made me forget about playing it. you can choose from so many different classes and every little decision you make matters. this is honestly probably the game of the generation, and larian keeps improving it constantly. thank you so much larian! we dont deserve you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"i wanted to play first 2 games but system used there is just too old so i was a little worried about this one. but oh god i was so wrong. this game have everything. music,story, great characters, great fights. just try it and you wont regret"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"very big fan of the first 2 games, i was impatiently awaiting this 3rd episode!the results are very positive endearing characters, interesting main and secondary quests, we really enjoy progressing through the game. a few downsides though, the last act is slightly buggy and much less work than the first two. i felt like i was doing quests without really understanding them sometimes. no daynight cycles yet present on bg2. sometimes a little strange interactions especially in the last act. and then a recruitable character who arrives very late in the game and who has difficulty integrating into the story. in short, the game is very good but will be even better with the release of corrective patches  completed in 80 hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-18,materpiece demasiado bueno para esta industria que cada vez saca juegos mas rotos que el anterior
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-18,"a good game, with good story and a lot of real choices for you story but i'm kinda disappointed of my ending, it seems cuted and i expected a bit more after 80hrs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-18,"gewaltig groes budget, aber fr eine deutsche synchronisierung hats natrlich bei einem so groen rollenspiel nicht gereicht"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-16,"this is not a game, this is a masterpiece! congratulations to larian for providing us with such a magnificent game!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-16,"though i'm not typically a fan of dds, bg3 has completely won me over. the storytelling is fantastic, immersing me in a world where every decision feels impactful. i'm constantly obsessed by the whatifs of the choices i make i save scum few times lol, and i love how the game allows for resultsanswers ranging from the utterly silly to the cunningly  character creation is a highlight for me. it's as if i'm crafting my own fantasy avatar, embodying my ideal persona in bgdd world. the depth of options is surprising, especially with mods that expand the possibilities to seemingly no limit.admittedly, the game had its share of bugs at launch, but the developers were quick to fix these issues day by day and week by week after release. by the time i reached acts 2 and 3, most major problems had either been resolved or significantly  narrator amelia tyler  the voice acting for me is simply perfection. the quality of the voice work elevates the entire experience without it, i will never play bg3 and simply will watch the game on twitch rather than playing it myself.after spending 180 hours to 1.5 playthroughs lol, my conclusion is clear bg3 is an absolute musttry or musthave game. its immersive world, engaging choices, and exceptional voice acting make it a standout title in the crpg genre and goty and game of the generation if i can say so myself.  gameplay 8 sound design 8 voice acting 10 music 8 visuals and environment 9 story 9"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,a game where you can create a million stories by playing in a different way each time. the best game of all time. you have to play before you die.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,"the best game i have ever played. i created this account just to spread how good  this is. i've never been this exited since skyrim 2011. this will be a classic for many years to come, and larions moral compass is just the icing on the cake. unbelievable what an amazing studio and product."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,"baldurs gate 3 is an excellent computer rpg that defines the genre. baldurs gate 3 brings an immersive dd lorerich experience with several hundred hours worth of gameplay, and several different playstyles."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,"this game is what triple a games should look up to. everything you could possibly think of when quantifying a game's quality is an 1110. larian, thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,best game i ever played . its one of the best game i ever played no matter which game genre you like you can buy and play this game without hesitation
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-14,"this game is simply amazing, great gameplay, i spent a lot of hours enjoying it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-14,"first game in a while that has made me feel emotionally invested and completely immersed. the world feels real, combat is exciting and creative, and the art in general is the best ive see. i wasnt interested in turn based combat before but now this has to be my favorite game ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-14,"what can i say that hasnt been said? this game is quite literally a masterpiece in every facet. dialogue, plot, direction, combat, customization, immersion, characters, and so much more. the only point against this game is sometimes fights are begging to be cheesed instead of played true, but at the end of the day, winning the fight by any means necessary is typically encouraged regardless."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-13,great game! wish they included some additional subclass options but doesn't detract from the story. would be 1010 but final act was buggy when i played through.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-13,"baldur's gate 3 strikes me as a complex love affair, much like my experience with dragon age origins. both games captivate me with their compelling narratives, engaging game mechanics, and the emotional connections they foster. however, i find myself questioning the developers' inclination to incorporate excessive blood and gore. am i alone in finding this aspect offputting? one feature i appreciated in dragon age origins was the option to turn off blood effects, a choice seemingly absent in bg3, except in its japanese version. to clarify, i'm not inherently opposed to blood and gore when it serves a narrative purpose, such as the humorous yet grotesque 'brain pet' scene in bg3. nevertheless, the constant display of blood, especially in act 2, is something i'd prefer not to endure again. interestingly, while nudity in bg3 generated significant discussion, the abundant depiction of blood received comparatively little attention. it strikes me as odd that the game's limited nudity seems to overshadow the pervasive bloodshed in media coverage. i believe that games should offer customization options for elements that aren't central to the experience. for instance, while i wouldn't expect a game like gta 6 to have a violence toggle, given its core theme, games like bg3 and dragon age origins could still shine without nudity if deemed offensive or excessive blood. in summary, bg3 is akin to a cherished partner whose qualities i adore, yet certain aspects, like an unpleasant odor, are hard to ignore."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,"great story, great gameplay, loveable characters. beautiful visuals and music. i don't remember when did i enjoyed a game so much. there are some smaller bugs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,"this game took over my life and i'm not even in the 3rd act. i haven't felt this much wonder while exploring the game world since skyrim and breath of the wild. at first, i wasn't too sure about the turnbased gameplay, but it grows on you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,it should be clear to most of us that this will go down as one of the greatest games of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,"la verdad que juego mas caca. estaba jugando en mi compu que compre con 2000 dolares cuando escale el volcan de santa ana, y la vaina solo medio entre a un cuarto y gran combate loco que se hizo que no entendi ni caca. saludos, me ire a jugar fortnite o free fire."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"a masterpiece. that is all. a game that will ruin you for all other games. this is how all studios should approach games with love and care wanting to actually give something to the gaming community and to show that games are and can be so much, much more than fortnite."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"what amazes me is before the wave of morons came to play this game because of media hype. this game was rated practically the same between publications and users. so for the youngins who grew up playing nothing but looter shooters, cod ad fortnite. there was a time when games had variety and depth to their gameplay. not always an adrenaline rush for short attention spans. baldurs gate 3 is a masterpiece with some of the deepest gameplay mechanics in the gaming landscape today. for those too unintelligent just go back to playing copy and paste looter shooters and leave the real games for people who love gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"boring story, and extremely annoying characters. i hated playing this game so much i didn't even finish the first act, which many people said was excellent. astarion  punchable2, gale  punchable, shadowheart  punchable, karlach  meh, wyll  eeyore, halsin  punchable. i liked lae'zel  she has kahunas she is the reason i gave 110 instead of 010. larian, you should be embarrassed, and i disagree with you winning goty in any category. poor performance, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"this is the worst game i have ever played. its boring, if you dont play dnd do not play this game. legitimately i had no idea what to do or how to play at all. i spent more time on youtube trying to learn how to play then playing and even the youtube videos were unbearably boring and over complicated. and i like rpgs and this broke me. it has all the frustration of a dark souls game with less hope. dark souls you can get better at the game. this is just bs dice rolls if you do well or not."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"on december 7 i looked at baldurs gate 3 as the game that stole the game of the year award from spiderman 2. i continued to view it like this for the days to come but slowly my interest started to increase. if this game won game of the year it had to be good. only the greatest of games gain the privilege to acquired the prestigious game of the year award. finally on december 27 2023 i purchased baldurs gate 3. after 50 hours of gameplay let me tell you, this isnt a game, this is an experience no this is a phenomenon. something that emerges every once in decades that shape the gaming industry for the rest of existence. this game is the culmination of everything larian studios have learned over the years of game development to craft the ultimate experience. fun fact the wait for baldurs gate 3 was longer that the wait for gta 6. baldurs gate 2 released in the year 2000. it took them 23 years to gain the knowledge and ability the craft this, and it was worth it. the advances in gameplay that this game offers are beyond anything conceivable before this. the turned based combat that this game, sorry, this phenomenon offers is nothing short of perfection. every race, class, and subclass offers unique gameplay that makes this game replay able for the rest of your life. like the decisions you make actually matter. games before have tried this when they say, your decisions impact the gameplay. hogwash, they dont actually matter but this phenomenon actually does that providing that level of gameplay to you. each run through of the game will be completely different. this is a true adventure. and i havent even completed act 1. that is insane. i have put 37 hours into my regular run and i havent even completed 13 of the game. that is insane. the remaining hours have gone into other runs with the gang that are the funnest times ive ever had. its so funny when me and my friends make our characters look goofy as heck and running around like we own the world. thats another thing, the character creator. nearly millions of different combinations came be crafted using this intricate system. holy crap if i compared the story of spiderman 2 to the bible its only right that i compare this game to the story of life itself, now and the rest of time. if im saying this and i havent even finished act 1 i cant wait to see what happens in act 2 and 3. this game deserved game of the year and i am not afraid to say that this is the best phenomenon that i have ever experienced. im sorry spiderman, maybe next time. thank you if you read this entire thing and i hope you have a good day, and please if you have the opportunity to, play baldurs gate 3, do it. final score, infinity out of 10 i dont even care if thats allowed this game deserves it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"upon acquiring baldur's gate 3, my initial expectations were unclear, guided mainly by friends' recommendations and its recognition as the 2023 game of the year. having a background in tabletop dnd, i was familiar with concepts like rolling for initiative and turnbased combat, which appealed to my preference for turnbased strategy games. what pleasantly surprised me, however, was the exceptional quality of the story and  depth of dialogue and information provided for each npc is remarkable. random npcs offer hints for upcoming missions, and the order in which you tackle quests yields diverse outcomes. noteworthy is the attention to detail, evident in actions like reading looted books that can unlock unique dialog options with main and side characters. bg3 is a testament to the meticulous effort the game studio invested in its  enthusiasts of lengthy story campaigns, intricate characters, and replay value, this game is a gem. although multiplayer is an option for up to three others, i suggest limiting it to two players to avoid hindering story progression with main side characters that are required to be in your party to progress. the audio design is superb, complemented by topnotch visuals, showcasing what a game studio can achieve when not fixated on  of now, i've invested approximately 120 hours into the game, juggling three different storylinessolo and with friends. while i'm yet to complete the game, i am already certain that baldur's gate 3 will continue to captivate me. it stands as a testament to immersive gaming, free from the distractions of microtransactions. simply put, grab it and thank yourself later."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"one of the best games i have ever played. gameplay is impeccable and satisfying, the fights have amazing flow. you get freedom like no other game. story is beautiful, characters dub and story are executed so well giving every character its own personality and uniqueness."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,i actually didn't play this game for ages because i thought i wouldn't enjoy it. tried it and fell in love.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"this game will waste your time. rhe first 2 acts are amazing, the third is a buggy mess that takes a dump by having major story beats not even trigger for the dumbest of reasons or for glitches. amazing how in act 3 i realize i wasted 80 hours of my time. screw this game. it's got mire bugs then 2077 had on launch."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"this is a really good enjoyable game. it is very well designed. it looks fantastic with really interesting areas that are exciting to explore with quests that never feel  writing is really fantastic and well done in this game with very good well written characters that aren't 1 dimensional. i absolutely love rpg games that have a lot of depth, choices and content. i can do many playthroughs.this game helps to fill the hole of the deep narrative rpg that bioware was once good for. as biowares recent games after being aquired by ea lack the depth  rpg and instead have been average open world games with lacklustre meaningless fetch quests.i just hope ea doesn't buy out larian. as any studio they buy become soulless zombie shells of their former selves.i abosultely love raphael's song. it's such a creative touch to the game.there are things i dislike though. inventory management is terrible and annoying, every item has weight even gold, keys, paper and potions so you are limited to what you can carry. most other games don't put weight on currency, keys and potions. i didn't realise at first why my character was encumbered as was hardly carrying anything until i checked that the 10k of gold i was carrying was what was encumbering  is also a bit buggy. long rest often doesn't work unless you have at least 40 camp supply in your inventory for it to work and doesn't seem to acknowledge camp supplies in the camp chest.i did not have any crashing. but the game does have bugs. such as was trying to destroy a crumbling wall and the character on a swing and hit ended up behind the wall stuck on the other side and the wall was not destroyed yet and was just stuck in  annoyingly for some reason lazael stopped following me even though she's chained but when i control her everyone follows her, it happens with various party members occasionally. closing and restarting the game seems to fix it.another annoying thing is when i had halsin in my party transformed to an owlbear after the shadowed spirit of the land fight he totally obliterates any cutscenes so all you see is this massive white blob of an owlbear taking up the entire screen and you can't see anything else in a cutscene or dialogue screen and you also end up inside the owlbear seeing these massive freaky golden orb eyes. so i don't have him in my party anymore. this probably happens with any druids in your party that are shapeshifted and it needs to be fixed.i also dislike that you can't see the spells and skills of those in your camp and can only see them when they are in your party. it's annoying having to switch out just to be able to see those.romances are poorly done and forced onto you from just being friendly and nice.bioware did romances a lot  1 is done very well, the pacing and exploring is spot on. act 2 was suspenseful but a bit dull. act 3 felt different, it is chaotic, overwhelming, too busy and all over the place. it feels like they tried to cram everything into act 3 and it would of been better if they had more acts and spaced things out more. i thought the ending was good enough and i liked the 's still a good game, but no where as good or as amazing as people make out.i try and explore every nook and cranny and my first playthrough took me over 200 hours as as i wasted so much time opening every crate and barrel i come across.because of chaotic act 3 and bugs i can't rate the game higher."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,the art of game. baldur's gate 3 are the best experience of crpg's in the last decade.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"i love dungeons  dragons, however, this game felt, boring and slow. i'm used to play, turn based games, but this one was boring. any other game such as shadowrun dragonfall is just so exciting to play. i played baldur's gate 3 for an hour and nothing happened. i was being bored the whole time. the cut scenes are built up on cliche. for example a plane, that's been going down with many explosions, what you escape just in time, where you land in the unknown.... i'm seeing the same problem here, with overwatch 2. the game doesn't show you, nor tell you anything. this loses the fun part of the game. i was lost many times, and because of this bad map design, i was walking around the map clueless. the game is full of gore, and pornographic scenes... this is why people in the 80' said that dungeons  dragons is bad for the children. and this is why the game is famous. this game robbed alan wake 2 from the game of the year award. alan wake 2 is this years, best game. a game with a dark tone, with beautiful graphics, and with a brilliant narrative. and with 0 pornographic scenes! this game, baldur's gate 3 is an over hyped ren'py visual novel game. do me a favour, and play alan wake 2, and see what this game robbed."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,"enjoyed the character creator but everything goes downhill fast from there. no opening hook, a glacial story pace that genuinely feels boring, and characters whose interactions feel incredibly overhyped. dnd mechanics make for irritating combat, general lack of well written lore, this game is a mess. dont get me started on all its bugs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-07,"as someone who doesn't play turned based games and dnd, i was blown away by how many hours i've sunken into this game. the freedom that the game let's you do is amazing and i love the dice roll mechanics to change the outcome of what happens to the quests and story. i can already imagine the replay value this game has, i've played a lot of skyrim with many different classes and never got bored doing the same quests, baldurs gate 3 takes it to a whole other level when you develop relationships with npcs. astarion, karlach and shadowheart are companions that i absolutely adore. all the hype from this game got me  in and i do not regret it one bit. it is truly a breathtaking game that redefines the rpg genre. game of the decade without a doubt. there are just too many words for me to come up with to justify this masterpiece. it is truly a title that deserves all its praise and its studio, staff and voice actors. if you haven't played it, don't think, just get the game, you will be instantly hooked on it this is an experience that should never be missed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-06,"i played this game in a very old laptop and i have to say this game is so unbelievably optimized that i can run the game. with that out of the way i've always wanted a game that truly would let you do whatever you want and this game is that. there's several times that i thought it would be funny if i could do this and the game would just let me. i love this game, its characters and its story."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,"the best game i have ever played. period. its hard to put into words how good, deep and polished this game is. a true masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,"the industry darling larian gets away with stuff, no other developer would get away with. if cdpr, bioware, ea or activision released a game with so many bugs, and even a bug where your save file gets randomly deleted, people would get their pitchforks out. but not larian. not our prescious larian. negative opinions are not allowed. how is this game getting a 9.9 score despite your save files being deleted. this is a catastrophic bug that's been first reported on release and on 01052024 still isn't fixed. larian claims it's an xbox issue despite almost every xbox game managing not having this bug. not our prescious larian. it just can't be. again, imagine if this was a bug in an ea game. i've seen this behaviour in the 00s with bioware, then in the 10s it was cdpr and now larian is the gaming industry's saviour that will rid us of all gaming's sins. give me a break. the game itself isn't anything special either. most people praise the branching story lines but i don't see it. this is larian's most streamlined game to date, with the most dumbed down mechanics. i feel like most favourable reviews were given as a statement towards the wider gaming industry, not because of the game itself. the story is servicable, not more not less. and act 3 is downright terrible. i gotta give it to larian though. they made a very inclusive game with lots of options to express who you are. rightoids predictably are seething but that's a plus in my books."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,"one of the best games i have played of all time. the rpg mechanics in this game are perfect with so many impactful choices to choose from and character and quest arcs to explore. the overall gameplay takes so time getting used to but once you get used to it, it does feel amazing especially when you level and gear up your characters. it does feel great to see the progression of your characters both story and gameplay wise. all the acts are amazing and they each get better after the other. music, voice acting and animations are a bit buggy. finding loot or cool items in this game is the best it has ever felt due to the fact that you have 4 or more characters to gear up with so many ways you can actually play the game. areas and enemies are also very diverse as well. the only critiques i have for this game is that it can be slightly buggy at times and you cannot backtrack to previous areas in previous acts would have been cool to revisit some areas especially to see how they would have changed with the story but overall it is understandable why they did this. overall a masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"after 82 hours, i have just finished my first playthrough of baldur's gate 3, and let me start by saying that i will probably never experience an rpg like the third baldur again.i'll start with how my adventure with this game began. as a fan of rpg games even before the release of bg3, i knew that a series such as baldur's gate existed, but i had never played it because i was not born yet when the first two parts were released. i wasn't interested in dungeons  dragons either, so i was completely new to turnbased rpgs. i knew about bg3, but i wasn't interested at all because i had never played a turnbased rpg and i said it wasn't for me.well, i said so until i decided to buy baldur's gate 3. encouraged by the good reviews of the game, i decided to buy  what can i say, it was one of the best gaming decisions i've ever made.during the first hours i was learning the entire turnbased rpg system, but after a few hours the game was so enjoyable that i couldn't stop playing. the turnbased combat system, which at the beginning was the main reason that turned me off from this game, turned out to be one of the game's greatest advantages.there are so many possibilities for customizing combat that it's unimaginable. it's a total sandbox where you can do whatever comes to your mind.moving on to the general part of the game, there is nothing to criticize about baldur's gate 3. this game does everything perfectly. hundreds, or even thousands, of dialogue choices that completely change the course of your adventure. perfect character creator that allows you to create the character you want in addition, there are numerous mods that add new visual things such as faces, hairstyles, clothes, armor, etc., i highly recommend installingas i wrote at the beginning, it took me 82 hours to complete the game for the first time, which is completely unique when it comes to singleplayer games. moreover, during these 82 hours, i never once felt bored or tired from  even after finishing the game for the first time, i already want to play it again, with a new hero with a new class and subclass, with new companions and with new choices throughout the entire plot that will radically change its course.i could go on and on about the positives of this game, but there's just too  sum up, baldur's gate 3 turned out to be my dream rpg game that i had always been waiting for."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-01,"ugly, stupid and riddled with cliche. the animations in the cutscenes, the armor, the plot, the choices, the companions, all of it is of the lowest level. the worst choice is to give the making of the third part  series to the larians. in the end we have what we have  a visual generic harem fanfic"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-01,best game for now i already played 260 hours but there are still lots of content i did not see maybe

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-31,"the impact of baldur's gate on my gaming experience has been profound, altering my perspective in ways i never anticipated. it has transformed my preferences, showcasing a level of depth in choices, dialogues, and decisions that i had never encountered before. with over 100 hours invested in this masterpiece, i can confidently say that i've never witnessed anything comparable. the precision of the choices presented is aweinspiring, leaving me in a state of perpetual astonishment. i find myself reluctant for the game to conclude, dreading the return to a world saturated with uninspiring titles like diablo 4 and ubisoft games, which pale in comparison.larian, thank you. my attachment to this game is profound, and i intend to carry it with me beyond the realms of gaming. elden ring and bg3 stand as the transformative pillars in my gaming journey. the ability to form emotional connections with characters, remember npcs, and genuinely care about every word, place, and detail is a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of this game. in short, words fall short to express my gratitude for the experience you've bestowed upon 've irreversibly influenced the gaming industry, setting a standard that rejects mediocre and hollow creations. i cherish the profound impact you've had on my gaming life, and for that, i extend my heartfelt thanks."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"in a world full of aaa game studios that offer halfdeveloped games that they still offer for fullprice with microtransactions, baldur's gate 3 is a long anticipated and much needed breath of fresh air. this game offers not only an incredible amount of value for the price of the game, but offers a rich and infinitely replayable experience that will undoubtedly set the new standard for rpg games from here on out. if you are looking for a game so rich in content you can play for over 100 hours without even reaching the end of the campaign, all the while having a blast, then this is the game for you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"i've been in this game since last week. this is overall the best game i've played since i started gaming back in 1991. i've played a fair amount of turnbased games, i still playeverything else, from racing sims to fighters, from 5, indies to massive 3d open world games, but bg3 is just like the golden standard above anything else. i can't even describe what this game is to me. like it's made by overenthusiastic video game lovers with a big love for  something? i'm not going to go in detail. litterally every second is a fest."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"the story, the characters, the voice acting, everything about this game is absolutely fantastic, barring the gameplay but that's more a personal quibble regarding crpgs. i was skeptical going into it on that account, and while it hasn't shifted my opinion on the genre, everything else about it is worthy of the praise it gets."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-29,"the love for the game is apparent in every minute when playing baldurs gare 3. just the fact larian were able to deliver game in this scale and level of polish a small miracle. pretty much the whole playthrough is just pure fun coming from exploring of different options and hidden details in the story. even the third act did justice for me as writers were able to connect all the pieces of the story, they laid out in front of me before. definite recommendations."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-29,it's a timeless classic that has been perfectly presented in 2023. i think this is the 10 points category!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"advantages  a great story,  living companions, having their own backgrounds, stories, troubles,  well done cinematic dialogues,  player choices influence world, companions, other persons,  visible and strongly felt consequences of player actions,  solid team management,  a wide choice of ways to proceed, not always fighting,  when you can't avoid fighting, you have a wide range of fighting methods. defects  very laggy act 3, lags limited using dx11, now fixed also in vulkan,  too many dice rolls break immersion dice rolling should not be literally visible, at least option to disable that would be reasonable,  a little too complicated inventory tabs would be much more efficient than bags. despite above disadvantages i'm giving 10, because so well done games, having rich content, consistent world, filled with many interesting quests, persons, places, histories are very very very rare. last game so well done was witcher 3  a pity so few developers are able to make rpg of so high class."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"tldr a masterpiece on the first run, if you want to experience the classic hero story. 1010 on first playthrough. 710 afterwards. good  combat system. many spells with epic realisation in effect design and synchro. hearing gale yell ignis! doesn't get boring even after 100 times. enemy variety. especially the fights against creatures are all unique. you never fight a creature twice. this makes exploring the game on the first run super exciting. unfortunately, the fights against humanoids are all the more frequent. in the third act in particular, i would have liked to have seen more recurring enemies from the first act. heroic story. the story for the classic good playthrough is very well told and logical. you start your journey as a small but potential hero and truly become a saviour. if your role fits better, the game experience feels even better. healbarde was it for me. dungeons. there are only a few recurring dungeon themes. many are very individual and it is great fun to explore them and find out which enemies are lurking within. equipment. never have i played a game with such exciting equipment. you don't feel much of it at first, but the further you progress, the more specialised the equipment becomes. it doesn't just boost stats, but contributes to your individual play style. characters. most of the npcs are very likeable. especially those who  at the beginning undergo a great development. laezel and shadowheart are very annoying at first. but shadowheart probably has the most elaborate background story of all. laezel's development is rather predictable, but still nice to watch. karlach's story is simple, but all the harder. gael and astarion are super likeable time companions. i even prefer gael to the fan favourite vampire. his wisdom and knowledge regularly contribute to the worldbuilding and his dubbing is in no way inferior to that of astarion. but the best character by far is the devil raphael. halsin, on the other hand, became a joke character after the first act, who would have been better suited to a harem game and became very intrusive. class system. hammer, despite all the overlap. boss fights. every boss feels unique. that's exactly how it should be.average dialogues  story. the writing is very erratic. sometimes it's topnotch, sometimes it feels like it was written by an inexperienced teenager. in general, the story is very stereotypical. there are no plot twists and almost every character fulfils their clichs. in a game with this much flexibility and freedom, this is probably the necessary sacrifice. the genius lies in the details. no matter what you choose to do, it feels like you're experiencing the real story. and there are big differences. but since the story itself is so inconsequential, i can't rate it as  bad story. the game pretends that there is a bad story. in my subsequent playthroughs, i tried to experience the bad story. in the first act, you are presented with a ridiculously terrible decision. except that the evil story ends abruptly. act 2 treats the player as a double agent throughout. you are not allowed to become an evil identity. you can only indulge in your lust for murder as dark urge, without any direct connection to the story. and with that, the game's genius disintegrates into hypocrisy. there is only one story. decisions only have selective weight."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,"fantastic game with the most freedom for players ever  you can be good, you can be completely evil and the story is going to be different ever single time. also gorgeous graphics, fantastic, quirky characters and some of the best voice acting in any game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-25,"the game itself is fantastic but with it having save bugs, gameplay bugs and constant crashed that temporarily freeze the console it terrible. unfortunately it's one of the worst games i've played this year scratch that it's the worse game i've tried to play due to crashing constantly."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-24,"game that rewards you if you're willing to invest into it. with that said, i found divinity original sin 2 to be better in almost all aspects.. character development and interaction is much more superficial than i expected  and lots of story hiccups, poor available choices and consequences... sometimes lead to not really caring about the outcomes. combat also is only interesting for 13 of the game  the first levels are just a grind, trying to survive with crap characters and quickly you hit max level and then there's barely a challenge. it also felt there was a lot of production value and effort put into looking good, but ends up feeling just clunky and superficial. anyway, still had fun."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"i found the first 30 hours to be somewhat interesting, but after that, starting with act 2, i suddenly started to become very bored and over the game. the environments are depressing and boring. the combat starts to get repetitive and is very slow and boring. the story and characters are uninspiring and boring. traversal is awkward and very pointandclick oriented. none of the music is interesting. the graphics are great though. i just couldn't bring myself to keep playing and lost interest. at least i gave it a real chance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"most people should see for themselves whether they like the game or not, by that i mean actually playing it without any bias. i personally have no complaints, as the story writing and the story itself was amazing. a lot of games dont have this as far as ive seen, but besides all the fighting you can romance a choice of diverse characters and get to know the character more personally than the others. the details in this game are great, characters expressions change based on your approval rating and the way they act towards you if a companion's approval drops to 50 or lower, they will leave the party permanently, taking with them anything they had equipped. the contents of their inventory including story items will be returned to the player character in a backpack. you can change the characters outlook and actions based on your choices. not just that, but a lot of the choices you make in this game can affect, for example ascended astarion. the voice actors really showed themselves here and i appreciate it, it felt realistic and although some would say another game had better voice acting, i must disagree, as this stays on top for me for the most entertaining. gameplay might not be for everyone turn based which i understand, i was a little skeptical myself, but it turned out to be something more and id see hours pass before i knew it. bg3 has good representation, it showcases trauma, the healing process, as well as the hope for getting better. very replayable. lots of options to choose race etc which slightly also changes dialogue options though not something crucial. some parts of story youll miss either way cutscenes also which you can simply get by making a new run, might sound tiring, but the new saves are what i love about this game. i get that this isnt for everyone, but it really is moneys worth.  may i add the mods can add to the experience of fun, if anyone is interested. this game definitely deserves all the rewards it has gotten, some call it overrated as it didnt live up to their impossible standards, but it just might be, because they didnt immerse to the game as much, or didnt resonate with it also as much. each to their own with games, opinions differ and thats fine, i just think its okay to accept something like this game, is in fact, worth winning, especially with the impact it made also considering everyones talking about it, whether it be good or bad. the devs also listen to the players as far as ive seen so thats also a bonus to the game.i cant think of a better game with a better community to win, any other game and i feel people would be even more disappointed. in conclusion dont let something so simple ruin the game experience for you and enjoy it for what it is, as it is still a game in the end, meant to be enjoyed and played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"another game i'm looking at you starfield which ruins your saves. don't waste your time and money on this, if you don't like your 30h of playtime to be deleted."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,playing on ps5 splitscreen mode. so many bugs and crashes. at the moment it is literally impossible to play as the game instantly freezes once the second player tries to join. yes there might be a good game there but the devs dont care about their local multiplayer mode edit splitscreen seems to be fixed now hardly any issues anymore fun game play with my wife but we aren't very far into the story yet
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"just like star wars in 1977 changed our expectations of what cinema was capable of, baldurs gate 3 is a lightning in a bottle cultural moment that is likely to change how we look at what is even possible in video games. the sheer depth and bravery of design, the utter attention to detail in both plot and gameplay mechanics, the freedom to create completely new outcomes and stories with each individual play through which incidentally im on my third of at the moment with hundreds of hours of play, its simply phenomenal. as is the respect with which it treats its audience, i might hasten to add. and why do games like this come around so rarely? because it is unbelievably rare to find a studio like larian who will go so far out on a limb and expose themselves so publicly and financially to purchase a licence for a littleknown and little caredabout franchise outside the mainstream pap that is fps and football games, and turn it into the immense success that this game is, through their hard work, willpower and love. no sony, no nintendo, no other major gaming software house or developer can do this because none of them will expose themselves to the financial risks involved. thats the price for lightning in a bottle. youve got to have the guts to seize that lightning in your bare hands and cram it into the bloody bottle! nobody cared about scifi fantasy in the mainstream before george lucas came along. there were just niche enthusiasts who were into authors like arthur c clarke, robert heinlein and isaac asimov. swen vincke is the new george lucas of video games. i salivate at the prospects of games like neverwinter nights 3 empire strikes back! or divinity original sin 3 return of the jedi! to come yet. and just like when star wars came out in 1977, there are lots of people saying the equivalent of huh, i dont get it, why is that man shiny? why can they move things just by thinking? i dont get it! i dont like it! thats fine, its ok. you dont have to like it. theres cod and fc24 over there, just for people like you and of coursetheres always spiderman 2if you rolled a natural one when it comes to the imagination stakes, thats none of my business! well just keep enjoying the greatest game ever made over here, while you do you, and the rest of humanity plays this wonderful, wonderful video game, over and over and over again. everyone involved in this games production is a hero in my eyes, whether they set out to be or not, and that is in essence what the game harnessed by buying the dungeons and dragons licence. we can all be heroes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-20,"this should be a aaa title, very very very very well done. awesome experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-20,"i've never played a game that even comes close to giving as much meaningful choice as this game does. from character design, to dialogue options, to how you approach resolving quests, you're given a litany of options, and somehow, the game seems to respond to them. it feels truly incredible to be granted this much freedom. the writing is absolutely top tier. sharp, hilarious, touching, or just plain weird, this is some of the best dialogue you'll ever find in a game. the combat can feel a bit overwhelming at first, given how many options you have, but you can really just make of it what you want. the game responds to however you want to approach it, and there doesn't seem to be a wrong way of doing things. i think bg3 has the potential to change how games are made in general. larian seems to have a lot more respect for the abilities and choices of its players, and it would be great if more game studios would follow suit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-20,"an absolutely incredible game. may not be for everyone especially if you prefer more actionbased combat and games, but i absolutely hated turn based games before bg3, so do with that what you will. give it a try, it might change your mind. genuinely one of my favorite games of all time. hope game studios can pick up a thing or two from larian. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-19,"this game in my book is an 11. the gameplay is so good. perfectly reflects dd mechanics, and with a sprinkle of larian magic it also considers environmental effects, height and the like in an unforeseen at least to me way. the writing is superb, the characters have super interesting archs to follow. the consequences of your actions come up very organically later down the line. you can also see the care the developers put into this game as it seems they considered almost every possible action the players could take and there is a reaction from the npcs depending on what you did even when you really go out of your way to do crazy things. i congratulate larian studios on this masterpiece ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-19,"i started playing thanks to a friend's recommendation. i have never been attracted to these types of games before. it has been 90 hours of gameplay enjoyed from start to finish. the main story is incredible, but that level is maintained even in the secondary missions. any npc has more personality than main characters in any other game. one of the most immersive games i have ever played, a masterpiece. highly recommended, even if you don't like rol games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-19,only for the most fanatical turn based purists you are in for a ride with the most dull slow paced gameplay i have ever seen who has time for these slow ass slow paced games? certainly not me bored out of my mind not surprisingly their other game before this one divinity original sin 2 is the same try that one first on a deep discount and see id you are going to like it watch a gameplay video dont fall for the hype
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-19,just play it you will not regret it i promise you that! just a fantastic game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-18,"going into this game, i watched videos and was very concerned that the dialogue would get a little dry and really start to bore me. after 20 hours, the dialogue is probably the highlight of the game and what truly makes it stand out compared to most other rpgs. the writing is fantastic, the acting is fantastic, the response selections are fantastic, the consequences to your responses are fantastic, and the dd dice mechanic based on your stats is fantastic. its a very immersive  gameplay itself is also great. i love a good turn based system, and this one makes you feel like you're in control with the vast amount of skill and spell options. however with that being said, i'm a little torn about the difficulty of the game. i love a game that is a good challenge, including one that takes a few tries to complete some of the tougher levels. with this game, you definitely get those challenging areas, but what i don't really get is the satisfaction of feeling like i overcame the challenge  instead, i get more of a feeling like the luck was more on my side this time around compared to my previous attempts. that's not to say the gameplay is bad, its actually pretty good and enjoyable, but i would not feel comfortable saying its anywhere near perfect. its very good and adds a lot of variety. the exploration is a bit linear, which threw me off. i wasn't expecting a wide open world game, but not something where most of your journey takes place on one guided path. the graphics are really good. i do feel like some of the characters look really pasty or like they're made of clay, and the facial animations vary a lot in quality some are exceptional, others are comically bad but generally they're still within the same ballpark as a bethesda release. potentially worse. the music is great, i wouldn't say its a highlight, but it certainly compliments everything that is happening in game. i did notice a lot of bugs though, just graphically the game has a lot of glitches. i never cared in other big open world games like fallout of elder scrolls, but its really hard to look past some of the glaring flaws. one element i didnt particularly care for was the itemization. its there, its present in the game, but the amount that you come across new items throughout the duration of the game is really infrequent. it almost feels a bit pointless. maybe i just didnt know what to expect here, but i feel like the items in the game were painfully underwhelming. the absolute most obnoxious part of the game was the romance options that are constantly being thrown at you. i always thought romance options in games were a little strange, but they always felt like options. in order to experience them, you have to pursue them. not in this game. every single character is constantly trying to have sex with your character. its beyond character development, it just happens so much as you progress through the game that it makes me like the characters less. this was by far the biggest immersion breaking point of the game. you can outright be rude or mean to characters, and then out of nowhere you'll be in a weird sexual tension cutscene. it made me realize about halfway through act 2 that the characters don't actually have that much depth, they just come up when their time is ready to either try to have sex with your character or do a huge lore dump before disappearing again. i got about halfway through act 2 before i quit the game, because i realized how shallow the story telling actually was, and how all of the companions are programmed to try to have sex with you regardless of your options. it made me feel like i'm playing one of those weird hentai anime relationship games one too many times. there is magic in trying to create a theme of getting to know the party you're traveling with, but when they are all programmed to have sex with you by default, its just silly. all in all, its a decent game. its a very unique experience in 2023. it honestly takes me back to gaming in the 90's and early 2000's. its a very immersive experience until the glaring flaws start to shine through so much to which its hard to look past it. what i enjoyed about the earlier part of the game is that you don't really feel like you're making much progress  i would turn on the game and play a couple hours and feel like i went nowhere, but still enjoyed it. after a certain point, i just realized the story is very simple, and when i realized the companions are just vessels that will try to have sex with you regardless of your actions, it ruined the game for me. i originally scored this about a 78, but this within itself ruined the game so much for me to the point where i had to lower it to a 67."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-18,"there is nothing like a perfect game, but baldur'sgate 3 got really close. yep"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-17,"utterly overrated game. extremely glitchy with many technical issues, the most annoying being the abysmal battle mechanics and camera e.g. enemies hitting, running and shooting through solid objects, such as furniture, pillars, balconies, etc. at its best the game is a 8,0, at its worst a 5,0. since thes issues increase the longer you play, i'll give it a 6,5."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-17,"first things first is baldur's gate perfect? no. of course not. act three was especially janky at times with numerous restarts needed and lots of visual and animation glitches. it is absolutely not perfect... but it's damn close. what is there to say about baldur's gate 3 that has not already been said by tens of thousands of other critics and players. it really is something special. i've never played a single second of the previous two games, nor have i ever held an actual d20 in my hands so i knew nothing of the dd universe heading into this game. baldur's gate 3 drove me to look into it. the lore, the culture surrounding it, podcasts, movies, you name it i'm now a consumer of it. this game is masterful as a crpg and phenomenal as a narrative adventure. every character you meet is a convincing, living being in this enormous world. almost every companion drew me in and urged me to see them overcome their personal demons in some cases quite literally. i've been playing solo in my downtime and in a coop campaign at the weekends. both runs are already greatly varied and i've fallen head over heels for my player characters. essentially a blank slate, but the dialogue options, class specific interactions and animation in cut scenes brings them to life and i will genuinely miss them when the final credits roll... before heading right back in and rolling somebody new. i know that the slower pace of gameplay and the turn based combat might be a massive turn off for some, i used to hate it too. however, if you consider yourself a fan of rpg titles, you are doing yourself a disservice by ignoring this game and the world that awaits and adapts based on your actions. buy it. play it. love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-17,"larian studios is at it again, giving us a great game. this time however, they went up and beyond. there are no weak sides in bg3. game made those small indie studios uwu that is biggest companies panic due to how good the game is  this should be review enough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-17,"i decided to give this game a try since my friends , which we have many games in common , told me to do so... i always felt intrigued by games like baldurs gate, diablo and neverwinter nights so i thought its time. so i purchased the game and started. the conclusion in my 20 hour long playthrough is that this game is heavily hyped. from all these perfect scores and also the goty i expected so much more. starting the game you realize it has a very steep learning  tutorial is almost non existent and at about 10 hours i decided i had enough and turned to google to answer my questions. the in game menu help is really clanky and unhelpful. the graphics are really mediocreeven for its genre.scenes seem to be classified into cinematics and non cinematics with the later being so bad the characters half the times decide they dont need to move their mouths to speak.... speaking of graphics the camera doesnt do  seems the camera is confusing random bushes and tree branches with pary memebers because it gets stuck in those so often its gets frustrating. the game interface is confusing and without some google help you ll have a hard time understanding it in less than 20 hours. controls are just ok. battle system is nothin spectacular.i expected much more from this fantasy tabletop rpg world but i was disappointed.everything is flat and plain boring.boring attacks , boring spells. story is mediocre as  main plot is ok and the side quest seem better option.still nothing to spectacular.theres a lot of branching paths that lead to some meme worthy finales. the music was great overall. i didnt came across many bugs although i had 1  friends though had many and one of them even some corrup save files. for me the biggest let down of the game were the  never encountered so cringy dialogues in any game , show or movie really. i could believe my eyes and ears reading most of these dialogues between charachters.i dont know if it was deliberate to do this but the end result is not even funny , its just...cringy.... after 20 hours of playtime i decided i had enough.i saw some vides online just out of curiosity. for meits really weird and suspicious that this game got goty and so many positive  has some undeniable major flaws."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-16,"brilliant game. just across the board. an almost perfect 11 translation of 5e to video game form with an indepth story, choices that matter, and fantastically written characters with wonderful voice actors acting them out. only thing keeping this from a 10 and it really would be a 9.5 or a bit higher if i could is while the narrative is really good, it is in my opinion, outshown by some of the origin characters stories, and there are some glitches and bugs that really shouldnt be in a game that is ostensibly complete. that said, the many patches that have already been released have improved it   state of the industry that this is acceptable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-16,"what can do justice to the masterpiece that is baldur's gate 3. every little thing is exceptionnal, character that are alive music you can't forget every dcisions you take impact every little aspect of the game later on. just wow clap bow to larian's"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-16,"whilst the game isn't perfect and starts to falter at the 3rd act it is still a decade defining game for its endless choice and player freedom. the implementation of dungeons and dragons mechanics was faithful whilst making it easy to grasp for newcomers, and with a gripping story that you cam mould with your choices, overall worth playing for anyone interested."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-15,crashes every 20 minutes. larian forums are flooded with complaints from other platforms. wish i looked there first. just glad i got my refund
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,"the most overrated rpg in history. even the witcher was good in some ways, but this game is a complete mediocrity. it's a visual generic like any korean mmo, with goofy looking slow overacting unrealistic animations. boring companions consisting of nothing but clichs. childish plot with an obvious black and white moral."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,"i tried playing turn based games before and didn't enjoy them.however, i really enjoy playing bg3 and it made me change me perspective on turn based games. the gameplay is great even though it might come off as a lot to domanagelearn straight from the begining. the story almost finished with act 2 is really great and the characters are likable. honestly this is one of those games that i will end up going back to again and again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,"best game i ever played, more than 200 hours of fun and im still playing it, this game has a soul, the voice acting, the gameplay ... everything is on point"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,"i just finished the game today with 122hrs in game. i see some recent reviews rating zeros or ones... the game is not 100 perfect, if i'm being honest i would rate it 8.510 but seeing rerds do that makes me want to do the same in the opposite note though y'all get it the story for me is very solid and you realize that most of the choices you make will have an impact on it. the characters are all well written, the whole game has cutscene dialogues where most, if not all, crpgs have only texts so it adds a lot in terms of immersion. the gameplay is solid. sure the movement can be a bit slow sometimes. but one thing that people hating on the game don't realise is that it is a game where you have to take your time, read books, talk to npc's, explore every corner. this is not a fast paced game. if you are a fan of adrenaline games cod, fortnite or any multiplayer shooter or even fast pacedsolo third person shooters bg3 is not for you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,"what is happening? this is one of the worst games i have ever played. what part of this garbage to people enjoy? the traversal in this game player movement is beyond awful. your character feels like a rotten sack of potatoes that's being dragged around by a disabled turtle and his pet snail!!! on top of that, larian decided that it would be a good idea to put traps everywhere, slowing you down even more! then there's the combat. there isn't much to say about the combat, because it's the most boring combat in any game made since the 1990's. it's turn based, with a ridiculous wheel of action choices. slog through the gigantic menu of actions to pick the action your character will do, then they will do it. would have been groundbreaking two decades ago, but now it's ancient and boring. the graphics are great. seriously top notch. the shadows and plant movements are amazing. the story seems okay. not great, but adequate. but the parts that make this a game traversal and combat are the worst i've seen in any game for at least a decade. it's truly amazing that a game this objectively awful won goty. it's like people were told to like it, so they did. oh, and i got this game for free. so don't think i'm salty about paying for this garbage. even free is way too much to spend on a game this bad. but maybe that has something to do with why i see the flaws. i don't have the sunk costs fallacy that others might have. if you payed 60 bucks, you might want to find something you like about a game that has no redeeming value whatsoever. just a thought."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,my god. im blown away by this game. if you were on the fence buy it. i was a little skeptical of turn  entire game is captivating
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,that's the best game in the last 15 years or so. i can't remember the last time i had so much fun playing together with my girlfriend. baldurs gate 3 is one of the best games i have ever played.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-13,"such an intense game with extremely complex characters is a blessing from a studio that seems to truly care about its players. my pc hates it, though. act 3 is virtually unplayable at times, but i was so invested, i had to struggle through 5 fps sometimes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-13,"baldur's gate 3 is one of the best rpg games ever released. a brilliant and perfect demonstration of the limitless potential surrounding the rpg genre. baldur's gate 3 will make you feel like you are genuinely a part of the story with friends to follow you and help in every encounter. the game's massive world, overall length of the game, replayability, and immersive fun coop make this a game to be remembered only fondly for decades. my only gripe with this game would be that i didn't buy and install the game the moment it released."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-13,"i have to dare to say that this game was one of the best titles that i experienced this year, i was not a fan of this style at all, but after playing baldur's gate, i completely changed my mind and this game became one of the best games of my life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-12,"well deserved goty2023 winner. the reasons who rated low score on bg3 in meta are 1. turn based  yes, it makes combat slower, but gives you more options to fight creatively, i let one character to create an icy surface, then another character push or throw mobs into the icy area, if mobs failed saving throw, they will fall prone and lost their turn. i also play ff14 with real time combat, players set their own rotations. on every fight, they execute their own preset rotations with minimal cooperation. basically, everyone doing their own thing based on their role. even in savage mode, it is just a positioning game, if you are a certain role, go to a certain position at a certain time. this is not creative cooperation that bg3 offers. 2. boring story  i have no idea how many hours these people played and how they played the game. none of them explains why they feel the story is boring. the story is far from boring. a good story telling is not giving out the whole plot on your first npc encounter. the rhythm of the entire story and how the chain of events fall into place were executed perfectly in bg3. 3. bugs  have to admit, there are bugs in bg3, but none of them game breaking. save often and you will be fine. 4. too much freedom  players too used to linear game play. cannot help those who have difficulty to make choices when these choices will really alter future events. i really enjoy the freedom which makes the game replayable."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,"imprescindible. baldurs gate 3 es, sencillamente, magistral. el nivel del componente rpg como tal, la capacidad de rolear que tenemos como jugadores, es algo que no haba visto nunca antes. podemos asesinar o dejar morir a los personajes principales desde el principio mismo del juego, podemos matar a cualquier npc, incluso a los importantes que desarrollan las historias. todo el tiempo estaremos tomando decisiones, con la posibilidad de hacer avanzar cada trama y subtrama de tantas maneras diferentes que es abrumador, cada dilogo con actuacin de voz. en serio, las posibles ramificaciones consecuencia de nuestras elecciones son muchsimas. el combate es divertido, pulido, adictivo, y entendible tras la primera hora de juego. dan muchas ganas de preparar estrategias y ver cmo stas funcionan tenemos muchas herramientas, muchsimas, y si tenemos la imaginacin suficiente para saberlas usar... no quiero entrar en spoilers, pero es magnfico. el diseo del mundo es muy, muy bueno, hay muchsimos lugares por explorar y no se siente vaco en absoluto, as como nada se siente como relleno el juego tiene carisma de sobra en este aspecto. quers dar un paso en x direccin? perfecto, preparate para encontrar unas ruinas interesantsimas de explorar, un npc que te va a dar una excelente misin, o un grupo de enemigos que te van a hacer dar lo mejor de vos para vencerlos. llevo ms de 60 horas, y no me he cruzado con ninguna misin de relleno, y jams sent que estaba perdiendo el tiempo o que no mereciera la pena explorar. por ltimo, en lo que a este tema respecta, hay diferentes biomas, localizaciones y dems, todas sper diferenciadas la una de la otra. para terminar con la resea, la banda sonora es buena, as como el diseo de audio. en cuanto a los grficos y la esttica, si bien no es un portento grfico como otros juegos de la generacin, es lindo y cumple con creces. baldurs gate 3 es, sin lugar a dudas, de los mejores juegos de la dcada y, sinceramente, no tengo problemas en reemplazar la palabra dcada por historia. jugalo, no te vas a arrepentir."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,pros  freedom  dnd rules implementation  lots of skills and spells to play around with  looks and sounds very solid for a topdown rpg  tactical combat  secretsexploration is rewarded  lots of options to solve quests cons  lacking act 3  tedious and clunky movementinteractionsanimations  story and characters are honestly average at best which is a big minus considering it's an rpg character wise dao and me are still miles ahead  overall feels like a most 'playing it safe' and generic dnd campaign ever  number of possible endings is farfetched

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"unbelievable, i know youve heard the story before its not for me im not gonna play it but it was my story. my friends genuinely harassed me to buy the game, i bought it and refunded it before my 2 hours were up. but something was  at me, i had such a large urge to buy it again and give it one more try, refund be damned. best decision i could have made. i wasnt working at the time and i put 60 hours into it within a week and a half, it became one of my favorite games of all time within the first month and ill never be the same again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"this game is a true masterpiece the story is great, graphically its looks awesome, and the amount of freedom and choices you have in this game is incredible the character creation did feel a little limiting with you not being able to really customize your body outside of choosing 1 of several body types but this is made up for with the amount of customization you have with your class and playstyle but the combat is probably the worst part of the game not because its turn based but its instead because of the rng dice roll mechanics that could cause you to miss 3 times in a roll for no real reason outside of bad luck that said there are so many option in combat that it almost makes up for it but not quite the multiplayer works great once you figure out how to play with a friend but it can also make the already frustrating combat even more frustrating if you are playing with somebody who doesn't understand what you can do or if they made an awful build without realizing what they did wrong"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"aside from optimization and glitches, the flexibility and impact the players have is astounding. good replay value and gameplay is rewarding!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"este jogo  uma obra prima, cada momento que passei nele foram simplesmente perfeitos, a imerso que o peso das suas escolhas tem na narrativa  assustador. no  o mesmo de sempre de alguma parte do mapa mudar, ou algum personagem morrer ou no, no  apenas isso...  o impacto de uma simples coisa que voc achou por engano desencadear uma serie de eventos com novas misses e historias totalmente novas e bem construdas, com fechamentos memorveis, dando impresso de ter jogado uma dlc, como uma parcela nova do jogo com uma histria a parte, simplesmente por ter parado no lugar errado. os grficos so lindos, as magias so perfeitas de se verem. e alm de tudo tem um fator de rejogada surpreendente, sendo impossivel fazer tudo ou ter acesso a todas as misses nas primeiras 5 vezes que jogar e finalizar. bg3 vai estar no meu corao pra sempre"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,"baldur's gate iii is so good that other video game developers harped on it for setting unrealistic expectations with it being jampacked with content for a set price without any microtransactions or suplementary content. it's a game with seemingly limitless replay value as you could play it hundreds of times over and never get the same playthrough. the characters, settings, story, and gameplay are all phenomenal and deserving of all the praise it gets."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,"i honestly don't even need to leave a review but i will consider this my love letter to baldur's gate 3, and even more to larian for the incredible work they have put into this game. people talk about technical issues and glitches but don't understand that these are issues actively being fixed every day. the amount of hotfixes and bonus content larian studios has given to us is unthinkable before bg3. baldur's gate 3 is an epic story with rich script and dynamic reactions to how you the player decide to act in the world. for people to be so mad that it swept the awards category is laughable. i knew back when i played divinity original sins 2 that larian was going to do something even greater one day but for them to turn out this masterpiece was unthinkable. to say you don't like bg3 is like saying outright you are unempathetic unable to attach yourself to a beautiful dynamic realistic world of angst and beauty . we will not get another game like this in a very long time. unless larian decides to suprise us again."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-06,personal top game of 2023 and one of my favorite games of all time. you can tell larian was passionate about this game and i hope to see more improvements in future updates!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-06,"the most beautiful game i've ever played in my life. obviously baldur's gate is a game that can be analyzed in many different ways, and even though i finished the game once and played it for about 70 hours, i'm doing this review without knowing much about the content of the game. why? because this game tells a great story of at least 200250 hours. not only that, but it makes you the leading role of that story. almost every character in the game makes you feel fully alive. they're not just mindless friends walking around with you. they have their own characters, histories, goals and aspirations. through the conversations, choices and actions you make in the game, you form different bonds between the characters. and these bonds lead to different endings or attitudes within the scenario. this works not only with the characters we are with, but also in the world of the game. whether you do something or not, how you do it, how you communicate with people or other beings affects everything. even with all the rest of its good features, i think these are enough to make baldur's gate a masterpiece. the art design of the game is simply amazing. from big spaces to small spaces, from temples to palaces, from shops to caves, there was nothing in the game that was just made for the sake of it. and the game is extremely big, which means a really huge workload. but i'm not only talking about the fullness, the locations are really well designed. even though i played a bit too fast the fast version of the game takes about 70 hours to explore many of the locations and characters in detail, and even though i didn't get involved in many of the scenarios at all, i don't think i've ever been so satisfied with a production. voices. the game's voice acting is just as great as the ones mentioned above. aside from the perfection of the voices and the emotions of the characters, the music is breathtaking. i felt like i was in a disney musical while playing the game. in addition to all these and hundreds of other good things such as the beauty of the action and combat system, the important characters, the script and plot outlines, there is one very important thing that this game does that no other game does you play and live the game at the same time, so to speak. this game is a masterpiece that everyone who says i play games should experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-04,"with compelling characters, great gameplay, and an awesome open world, baldurs gate 3 is game of the year hands down"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-03,there really isn't any need to toot the horn on this game any more that it already gets it. it is that good. end of story.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-03,"excelente jogo para amantes de rpg. possui muitas horas de jogo, bastante explorao, customizao de personagem, vrias possibilidades de dilogo. um dos melhores jogos que j joguei."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-03,"esse jogo  muito bom, a larian studios fez um trabalho surreal com baldurs gate, espero que o jogo continue crescendo e se popularizando para que mais pessoas sintamse com vontade de conhecer esse jogo"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-03,greatest rpg game ever made i hope there is more to come ..i now am a huge dnd fan
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-02,"the quality, the depth, the size of this game is really incredible. i was stunned and i'm still very excited about this fantastic masterpiece! the mainstory, the sidequest, the npc's, the enviroment, the sound, the breathtaking music ... everything is on a high level and you can see and feel the devotion of the creators. i enjoyed every minute in this game when i was talking to my companions, when i was running around in dungeons, solving quests  riddles or interrogating animals or deads. the only thing about the story that bother me was the end, it was to short for me. but with patch 5 they gave us a additional ending, thanks a lot for this! i can understand if people are angry, if the encounter a gamebreaking problem, but i played bg3 without any trouble from act1 to act3 and never have seen a single bigger bug or lag. a game with this quantity have always some bugs, have always some problems ... there are so many other programs running on a pc, it is close to impossible to adapth a game to every computer, to every pc adjustment. also a lot of people prefer to condemn the developer  the game than to take a look on their own adjutsments or installation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,"i'm so glad that i could play this masterpiece, for almost 3 months exploring its awesome world, knowing the characters, and somehow, transforming them into killing machines for the combats, sometimes frustrating but always satisfactory when they end. at the beginning, the plot may look simple and shallow, but as the story unfolds, you realize that it's so deep and rich that you always will want to know what the hell happens next. characters such as astarion, shadowheart and karlach are one of the reasons that make the game so deep and full of things to do and discover, and all of them, includind npcs have they share on the game, i mean, experience. sometimes they feel repetitive, but somehow amusing, like when you send gale away to the camp and he says idling away the hours, a quote that i took to myself on these 3 months playing baldur's gate 3. the soundtrack is awesome in all aspects, and the mind flayer theme is so much better than many oscar awarded musicians. thank you, larian studios for making this piece of art, that almost made me lose my mind in these 3 months of this great experience that i haven't had since red dead redemption 2. and you guys could do what rockstar didnt on grand theft auto 5 and red dead redemption 2 some dlcs with new chapters and revisiting places and characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"incredible systems at work. bland narrative and poor characters, at least in my oppinion. gameplay is good and deep, but everything else is not as brilliant. specially in the ps5 version i played some elements are a bit lacking ui, performance,camera...."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,233
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,"this game screams care, care for narratives, care for the player, care for the lore of the world its made for. ive waited a long time for this and its finally here."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-30,"this is the greatest rpg i have ever played. i am 90 hours in, and i'm not even close to bored. a must play for any rpg fan. the combat and gameplay is spectacular and groundbreaking, incredibly revolutionary. anyone who says it is slow is wrong. if you don't like turn based combat, you wont like this game, and thats fine. but calling the gameplay bad because its turn based is just stupid. this is the best turn based combat i've played, very few flaws. the story and characters are incredible, and the side quests are not treated like chores with boring stories you don't give a  about cough cough skyrim. the dialogue heavily effects the world and characters around you, and there are so many features that really let you carve out your own unique playstyle. leveling up is kind of satisfying, but it could have been better. especially if you're playing a melee class, leveling up doesn't really do much. plus the music only has around two stand out tracks down by the river and raphael's final act and the rest are pretty forgettable. every bit of dialogue, even with random ass merchants is motion captured, so you never get the ubisoftbethesda npc stare. the npcs feel much more alive than in any other game. act 3 has had some bugs, but they are constantly being fixed and i have only experienced minor visual bugs. larian is constantly updating and supporting this game because they are a great developer. if you have a pc that can run it, and the spare cash you have no excuse not to get this game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-29,"yes, there are still a couple of bugs  glitches in my current playthrough, wyll was nowhere to be found after the initial scene at the druids grove. but considering the overall scope, i can't think of anything they could have done better."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-28,nothing to say.......................................................................
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-28,"winning game of the year almost seems like an understatement  to me baldur's gate 3 is, after 30 years of experience in gaming, easily the best game i ever played. the depth of the storytelling and the fact that every decision you make alters the outcome. 17.000 possible endings! the compagnions' growth along the way who over time began to feel like true relationships due to their authentic conversations, character archs and talented actors. the astounding graphics and the rich world full of details and possibilities to interact in every way you can imagine. the masterful soundtrack. what a powerful journey."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,"i went into this game skeptical even with the critically acclaimed reviews because it was a turnbased game. i have to say first of this is one of the best games i have ever played. the story has many different layers and complexities that keep the game interesting. the amount of choice that is in this game is crazy and makes for high level of replayability. the combat grew on me battles were engaging and fun and kept me thinking about what my next move was going to be. this game will define rpgs going forward. the game is not perfect, but the game deserves a 10 out of 10 and i look forward to what larian studios will do next."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,"game of the year, not even a debate. this game has way, way too much in it. despite having 10 or so hours in the game. i've barely scratched the surface. the characters, the customization, everything is so in depth it's scary. i haven't been a fan of these types of games until i played this one. hope this helps"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,"it has been years since i have been as thoroughly obsessed with a game as i am with baldurs gate 3. the story and progression are deep, and the ripples from your choices and interactions insure replay ability, as every choice can change the way your play through unfolds. i only wish the level cap was a bit higher."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,"put simply, baldur's gate 3 is the best and most wellrounded rpg i have ever played. it has incredible combat, incredible quests, incredible reactivity, outstanding characters, great writing, a good story, i could go on. this game is so strong that anyone who appreciates rpgs must play this. video games by their very nature are not capable of fully recreating a ttrpg experience, it's a fundamental limitation born out of the lack of a dungeon master. that said, baldur's gate 3 is such a dynamic and reactive game that it is the closest any game has gotten to emulating a ttrpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-26,"i'm a rpg enthusiast and i've played a lot of games, but this one is the best i've ever played. thank you larian for incredible gaming moments and a expierence like no other."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-26,"it's rare you find a game that so obviously is beloved and cared for by the developer, but through every quest and combat encounter of larian studios' baldur's gate 3 you can see the love the dev team have for both the characters and bg3's unique, freeform gameplay. quite simply one of the best games, of any genre, that i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,best game ever made. almost 200 hours played and without a doubt this is my number 1 game of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"no offense that baldur's gate 3 will be one of the goty contenders in 2023. typically, freedom in dungeon  dragons is hard enough to translate into the game, but this game made it really well and i can see a lot of ambition in them. you are free to build your characters, respect them, and play what you want to play, there are a lot of possibilities in this game. it may be hard for newcomers but i really enjoy reading the guide to build the best of me. so, why not 10? i think the huge issue that keeps it from 10 is the huge amount of bugs. even though i understand that this game is really huge, i cannot really get past it. the minor thing that concern may be the pacing and balancing in the first arc and second arc which is a little bit steep and the third arc which is too rushed. in the end, i give this game between 8 to 9. however, i really love how they work hard to improve the game after the enormous number of bugs, and the innovation of this game is 1110, i slightly give this a 9 rather than an 8."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"baldur's gate 3 is an ambitious endeavor that dazzles with its detailed world and deep narrative, true to its dungeons  dragons roots. while the game excels in storytelling and stunning graphics, it's marred by occasional bugs and a steep learning curve, particularly in its strategic, turnbased combat. these issues, coupled with pacing inconsistencies, hold it back from being a masterpiece. nonetheless, for fans of the genre willing to navigate its complexities and overlook its flaws, baldur's gate 3 offers a rich and rewarding rpg experience, making it deserving of a solid 7 or 8 out of 10"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"obra de arte do rpg definitivamente um jogo para ficar na memria. a larian entregou um jogo pleno, como a junto tempo no recebemos. a indstria dos games precisa reaprender com eles o que a comunidade precisa e deseja"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,"diving into baldur's gate 3, i was seriously pumped for a wild gaming adventure, but man, the excitement quickly fizzled out. the story feels like it's moving at a grandma's pace  slow and steady, but honestly, more like a snail's crawl. i'm all for a good buildup, but this was like waiting for water to boil. trying to get into the game was a real struggle the characters and plot took forever to get interesting. and it's not just the story  everything, from exploring to leveling up, felt like wading through molasses. sure, the game has potential with cool graphics and mechanics, but the slow storytelling just ruins the whole vibe. i want to be on the edge of my seat, not yawning through cutscenes. until they fix this pacing nightmare, baldur's gate 3 is just a frustrating tease of what could have been an epic gaming experience."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,"giving this a 5 because im only able to play half of the game due to larian updating the game with a patch that completely broke act 3. the lag is insane taking 30sec to a minute for npc and party members to respond this is offline, mind you, then you move your character a bit and it happens again, and again, and again. crossing the lower city is a half hour exercise in pure frustration. some encounters actually cause the game to crash altogether, and thats not a oneoff. ive had the same encounter crash the game on my ps5 4 times. i tried deleting and reinstalling the game  no change. the first half of the game was great fun and ive played it through twice, but then running into gamebreaking performance issues upon arriving in baldurs gate has ruined my initial impression of the game. to add insult to injury, more than 2 weeks after that gamebreaking patch larian has yet to comment on it in the media, their own forums, or anywhere else despite a large player outcry. so now ive spent money on a game the developers actions have prevented me from completing and that same developer has nothing to say. ill think twice before buying any title from larian in the future."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,this game is amazing. you can play it over and over again in different ways. if you are a fan of dd you gotta check it out.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-21,"this... this is... i don't even know what to say. i am in absolute awe that this game even exists. this is the pinnacle of crpgs and dare i say the pinnacle of gaming. larian studios have proved themselves as one of the greatest game development studios of all time, and this is by far the best game i have ever played. period. the characters, the graphics, the replay value, the music, the combat and above everything else the story are perfect. i genuinly cannot find a single flaw in this game. if you haven't bought the game yet, do yourself a favor and buy it. if you own it already, do yourself a favor and play it again.congratulations and thank you to larian studios for all that they've achieved and given us. and hopefully i'll see you when bg4 releases.tldr game is good"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-21,"i tried playing this game for like 20 hours and it didn't get me, maybe i don't like turn based games or maybe it was too slow for me, but the story as long as i got to the windwhil part wasn't getting me excited. i also think this game is for a very specific niche so if you don't like slow games, turn based games, maybe you should look elsewhere."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-21,"characterisation, voice acting and dialogue is unmatched in gaming. story is great music is great one of the rare games with great narrative that actually has fantastic gameplay. dialogue choices and consequences are rich and meaningful. turn based combat is particularly great because positioning is very tactical and the amount of creativity and options open to the player is beyond any other game i have played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,"right up front i'm a huge 'narrative crpg' fan. games like torment tides of numenera and disco elysium are among my favorites of all time, having put in hundreds of hours and multiple playthroughs into both. i also highly enjoy crpgs with a tactical combat focus, such as wasteland 23 and pathfinder wrath of the righteous. on paper, therefore, baldur's gate 3 seemed like a dream game for someone like myself. unfortunately, after rolling three very different characters halfelf bard, human fighter, halfling monk and putting a combined 80 hours into bg3 over the past three months, i find myself totally bored, occasionally irritated and ultimately indifferent. for me, it's a combination of  milquetoast, overly horny companions whom i have zero affection for the asinine 5e rules camping and the 'long rest' system are incredibly tedious the unbalanced combat the monotonous environments the underdark! inventory management and companion swapping systems that are puzzlingly archaic in the year 2023 ultimately, a main story thread that doesn't motivate me to keep playing in the least. supposedly act 1 is the strongest in the game  yet i've not been compelled to start act 2 with any of my three characters, based on my experiences outlined above. what does that say for my prospects actually seeing this thing through to the end? bioware's dragon age origins  a spiritual successor to baldur's gate, that released 13 years ago  does many things fundamentally better than larian's baldur's gate 3, in my opinion. i care about the lands of ferelden the nuanced, wonderfullywritten companions like alistair, morrigan and lelianna the numerous characterracial origins and their effects on you throughout the game a storyline that is at once both epic and deeply personal in scope...aaaaand a decent, sensible inventory management system. i'm glad so many are enjoying bg3 i sincerely hope it provides a gateway to other classics of the genre that players haven't tried yet! ultimately for me though, it's been a pretty 'meh' experience, despite wanting to enjoy it  multiple times! 610"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,"baldur's gate 3 is a genuine masterpiece in the world of rpgs that i believe has set an almost unattainable standard for the genre. from the deep character relationships, to the amazing world building, this title deserves more than a couple playthroughs. the ability to attack a challenge at any angle and in anyway the player wants, will surely make any tabletop player an immediate fan of this title. complete game of the year contender. if you haven't played this yet, and my review is the first one you happen to come across, please take my word for it, and enjoy this complete spectacle. hondo afterburner"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,"i'm a true rpg fan, played a lot of them in my old days. and i can say that bg3 is a good game, but not as good as i imagined it. the building system is imbalanced, a random system devalues all your skill leveling, a lot of inconsistencies in the plot, lack of reactivities. i love larian's other games but i was a bit disappointed with this one"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,"it's a very unique game, its really not for everybody. more like 50 talking and 50 playing. too linear and sandboxed. i'm aware that the long rest is part of having a strategy but it's atrociously annoying  tiresome"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,"as a longtime rpg and newtime dd fan, this game blew me away. especially after the disappointment that was final fantasy 16 for me when we're talking about rpgs. final fantasy was a huge let down as they had abandoned their rpg history in favor of a purely cinematic experience with some action thrown in. then bg3 came out and it saved the year for rpgs. the combat is incredibly fun and diverse, giving the player multiple ways to win and interact with the environment and their spell lists. ground effects, afflictions and conditions, special martial skills vs enormous spell lists, stealth or rampaging, using terrain and elevation buffs, debuffs, and even permanent party member deaths, this game's combat is the best of any rpg ever made, hand's down. then you get to the story, the voice acting, the world, the characters, it's all incredible. the amount of love that went into this game is evident from every angle and it truly is a title that was stand the test of time and be remembered in decades to come like we remember the original halo, pokemon games of old, grand turismo, mario kart, dragon age or mass effect, skyrim, it belongs on that pantheon of gods. the only reason i'm not giving this a 10 for me is the sex and horniness of the characters. it pulled me out of the story and the experience for a brief moment, but it's a minor complaint. i'm playing this epic rpg and i go back to camp ready to learn about people or magic or the world or the story and instead some green lizard girl wants to taste my flesh and it's like... oh... or yeah i guess we can talk about that. i wanna know more about the githyanki's culture but sure? we're all about to die from tadpoles in our brains, let's do each other's brains out. logical. idk. anyways, great game. minus the horniness of the characters, this would be an absolute 1010 for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,"the combat is mind numbingly dull 90 of the time, and absolutely frustrating the other 10. hardly anything in between at all. the strict adherence to dnd 5e ruined what could have been a good game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,i never wasn't excepting for baldur's gate 3 to change rpg completely but here we are. this game has so much to offer for rpg fans. i played this a little and i well in love with this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"this game is mediocre by every metric possible. the combat isn't bad, but fighting 4 enemies is tedious, because you have to wait for the turn of all of them. it shows why bioware decided against a full turnbased type of combat 20 years ago. the 5 ed dnd system isn't the best, but also not the worst, and i don't think it helps but i don't hold it against the game. the story is bland, uninteresting and poorly executed. i just read that they rewrote the whole plot in the last second because they were afraid that people would find it too difficult to understand. idk if it's true but, dear god, the writing is atrocius. absolutely boring companions with 0 diversity and generic backgrounds. everyone is 20, hot and ready to bang. all mediumsized humanoids, no dwarves, halflings or gnomes because they're short and ugly. the ui and the inventory are the worst i've ever seen in a videogame, seriously, not even close. it's one of those things that you take for granted in every game that they'll be at least, bearable, and it shows in this one. it's obvious that the developers are incompetent when it comes to the qol issues of their games. even basic things that anyone who has ever played a videogame knows how they should not be addressed. as for the environment, atmosphere and aesthetic... meh. nothing interesting or eyecatching in the good sense. it looks like one of those mobile games that have a lot of people in shining armor, and the scenery usually shows big buildings with massive statues and a lot of gold, shiny brand new looking places, that are suppossed to be millenia old. it has a lot of stuff and effort put on unnecessary things while also lacking basic stuff that is required for making an actual good not even excellent game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,a masterpiece. from start to finish an engrossing world that never stops giving. at some points there's so much content you need to just absorb it and stop thinking about completing everything. possibly one of the greatest rpgs of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,"as 'bout a perfect representation a person can get of not only a dd video game, but an rpg in general. following the formulas and tropes of dungeons  dragons as a tabletop roleplaying game, everything is decided by chance and dice, with modifiers determining consistency. as most people are, i am an avid enjoyer of dd on the tabletop, so its turnbased combat and many things revolving around its core gameplay mechanics came naturally to me and felt natural and intuitive. as for the story and characters, it is what you make of it. everyone's story will be different based on the choices they make, and the characters the prioritize. for me, i find all of the characters wellrounded and believable, moreso than i believe any game out of a few exceptions have ever been able to achieve... even characters i wasn't personally drawn to have an intrinsic charm that i can still recognize and say yes, someone out there will like that. the game is as deep as a i believe a game can be, its difficulty is fair but manageable and fluid, its cast are alltimers and the characters they represent are instant classics. if all games were this good, this polished, and this entertaining  i would preorder every aaa release in a heartbeat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,"i havent been so immersed in an rpg in years. at a time when were saturated with empty owrpgs, bg3 not ow feels immersive and alive. the story, combat, player choice, companions everything is immaculate. i hope we see more crpgs come into the mainstream. im 240h in on my second play through and still finding new things to do! undoubtedly, my personal goty"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-16,"a must play. coming from someone, who has never played dnd before and someone who is not a huge fan of turnbased combat in videogames, this game is great. the performance runs stable and the game looks great graphically. the sheer amount of customization and build options alongside the amount of freedom the player has in the story and various questlines is unlike any rpg i have ever played. the story is also pretty interested and executed well, starts to lose cohesiveness in act 3 and some of the late game villains like gortash and orin are not as interesting as they could be. there are a fair amount of bugs, but larian studios does a great job at listening to player feedback and putting out regular patches. some encounters are overly difficult, not because of layout or enemy strategy, but just enemies throwing everything at you and spamming which can feel a bit cheap."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-16,"bg3 is a complete masterpiece, from narrative to sound assortment, from characters to scenarios, the attention to detail is inmaculate, the game is a love letter to the rpg, providing easily with over 200 hours of pure and original content, it is definitely one of the greatest rpgs of all time and one of the greatest games in history."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"fcilmente uno de los mejores juegos de lo que llevamos de dcada, es simplemente un excelente rpg, donde tus decisiones si tienen importancia a diferencia de otros juegos del genero, adems que larion tiene unos estndares de calidad claramente mas elevados que otras compaas de videojuegos cof cof."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,this game is easly the best crpg mandkind has ever created. it's near perfection with every aspect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"o jogo no inova em nada o gnero,  mais do mesmo, infelizmente, o que no torna o jogo injogvel, mas no consegui passar mais de 5 horas jogando."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"this is how games are done, i was very worried about a turn based rpg and didnt do anything with the divinity series, however i saw the reviews real ones not those fake critic reviews, and i must say i was beyond supprised! this game is done so extremely well i cant believe how this one blew me away!! last time i really enjoyed a story and gameplay was since the last of us!! if a dlc comes out i can only say... take my money!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"meilleur rpg, du jamais vu. le jeu d'acteur incroyable, la bo merveilleuse, la rejouabilit infinie. premire fois qu'en plein milieu de jeu j'ai hte de le recommencer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,the amount of choices that seem minimal but affect the whole game is amazing. every time that do something outlandish and you think there is no way the devs implemented this you are proven wrong. this is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"the story is well paced with many things to do. there are some issues i had with outcomes in the 3rd act since they felt a bit more restrictive when compared to the rest of the game. some characters did not have enough time to be fleshed out like others leaving me with no reason to use them after completing their story. gameplay is great allowing creative planning and ways to deal with scenarios. there are some bug issues in the 3rd act that made my game crash at times. some details don't become rendered in during the 3rd act just due to the shear amount of things on the map. i am bummed that i can only have 4 characters in my party at a time but it makes sense just due to how long it can take between turns. overall, a great rpg that would recommend to any player."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"i lost my faith that anything near the caliber of bg2 could be released 20 years later. i lost my faith in today's rpgs, until i got the bg3 experience. there is no reason to type down why this is a totally acclaimed game. thank you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"i have never played a game like this. although some riddles are too difficult for me,i think it is very entertaining.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"everything is just so perfect in this game. the level design, the songs, the cinematics, the fights. i enjoyed every single minute i spent over it. i just can't wait to replay it all over again in a different way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"baldur's gate 3 is an interesting game that showed me first hand the world of dungeons and dragons a nice introduction, if seeing that some developers from other houses critic this game for overdelivering, affirming that we shouldnt consider this as the new standard shall tell you that the story here given is complete and wellmade. a point and click game with many storylines a lot of replayability and different dialogues making you wonder how the hell did you miss all of this on your previous walktrough. the characters are interesting and marvelously potrayed by va's who are keen on giving their best for the players i am looking at you two expecially samantha bart and neil newbon. p.s seeing the bad reviews using mostly the word woke to describe the romance interactions made me clarify something, this game doesnt force you to establish interactions valorized in the lgbtq community, but it gives you the option of doing it, treating this side of romance and personality without gloryfying nor denying it completly, its simply treated as something that is normal in the world you play in and you as the players are fully in control of your character's persona, treating it like your own let the pissy zelda players cope on their own xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"i have never played a roleplay game that was inspired by dungeons and dragons board game but i have to say that i am amazed by what i saw in baldur gate 3, the game feels phenomenal and at the same time i like the freedom to choose from more options. the cinematics are a 10, they are above those from diablo 4 in my opinion. this game completely impressed me, from the cinematics to the character creation, from the interactions with the npc's to the wide variety of dialogue options. the music and voices are not from this planet, you can see how much passion they put into every thing they did. i'm glad i bought and supported this studio and i will continue to do so as long as it puts the same passion and dedication into the next games. f blizzard and the other studios that spoke badly. everyone should take notes on how to make a triple a game without microtransactions or dlcs at launch  story and gameplay well done i highly recommend this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"before the release of this game, i was confident that zelda totk would secure the title of goty 2023. despite not being a fan of turnbased games or dd, i decided to give it a try based on numerous positive reviews. to my surprise, the reviews didn't fully capture the exceptional nature of this game. after investing 120 hours in just one month, i can confidently declare it a masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"it was so hyped everywhere but it's so boring to me. too many skills, too many useless endings. the game is unnecessarily prolonged and tedious"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"when i passed the first act, i thought the game was over because i passed it for 14  then new adventures..i still haven't finished the game yet... i'm going to start a new game..."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"this game is what all other games strive to be. phenomenal. till date i find things i have missed in my previous playthroughs and be amazed by how larian thought of how the players will think and react to different scenarios. all of it with a one time payment, no stupid stuff like battle pass or loot box or micro 's like the developers really care for the game and it's player base. which results in a great community overall."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece that exceeds expectations on every level. from the moment you step into its richly detailed world, you're entranced by its stunning visuals and masterful storytelling. the character customization is unparalleled, offering depth and nuance that shapes your unique journey. the turnbased combat is both strategic and visually spectacular. larian studios has seamlessly blended oldschool rpg elements with modern design, creating an immersive experience that pays homage to its legendary predecessors. with a vast, interconnected world and morally complex choices, baldur's gate 3 stands as one of the best rpgs, setting a new standard for the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"fantastic game with a lot of diffrent mechanics, charismatic characters, emotional music and a wonderful story! bethesda should learn how to make games from larian. well done!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i am a very big fan of baldur's gate 1 and 2, so as many people i was expecting a lot from this game. i'm not disappointed. the music, the scenario, the characters, the gameplay, the possibilites, i'm loving every part of it. well done larian, that's how a good video game made with passion should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"an old school game well done. no dlc, no microtransactions. you get the whole package from the getgo. the list of awesome features and virtues goes on and on, so i'll just say this game comes fully recommended by most people. it's a game loved by almost everyone. one of those rare gems. we don't get games like this one anymore. enjoy it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,300 hours in with several full playthroughs i am having so much fun constantly discovering new things! my all time favorite game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"simply incredible, one of the best games i've ever played. just finished my first playthrough  yes, after three months and almost 240 hours on steam. though my actual playthrough was more like 160 hours... but i did basically everything possible. and even that's not really everything, since many options that are available are based on the choices you've made earlier in the game. i've seen some criticism directed towards the game's ending, but i thought it was perfect. short and succinct it covered most of my lingering questions. i'd like a more extended epilogue, sure  a postbattle party, a shot of my character and their love interest off building a new life together  but its absence is by no means an indictment of the story they wanted to tell. besides, it just means i'll have something to look forward to with the enhanced edition! personally, my only criticism was that it got pretty easy for me at the end, even on the hardest difficulty setting. but then again, i did literally all the content i could and got as op as i could've gotten. but still, i took out the end bosses in like two turns without ever really feeling threatened. on the other hand, i was pretty ready to wrap things up by that point, so i'm not really complaining. still, if there's one thing i'd like to see added, it'd probably be a new, harder difficulty setting. overall, just a incredible experience. lives up to its title as the third baldur's gate title and feels like a worthy spiritual successor to dragon age origins funny how that works, huh?. great gameplay, graphics, story, acting, music... well everything, really! highly recommend, even if you haven't played a crpg before. if you have, well... why haven't you played this yet?!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"one if not the best gamesi played since years, i had a great time involving myself with the great written charactersand story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-08,"don't read scores, go get the game and play it! this part is just for the 75 character rule."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-08,un juego increble sinceramente pienso que es el mejor juego de rol creado hasta la fecha.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-08,"great game, no doubt, but... if you played divinity 2 is almost the same gameplay. larian has improved a lot the dialogues and the gdr mechanics in the story but sometimes you may find some gamebreaking bugs. if you are a lover of the genre is a must play, otherwise is a good game with some limitations"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-08,i played this for 200 hrs  until i got sick of it and now im making a break until deffinitive edition comes out. it truly is the best crpg yet. i truly hate turn based combat but i didnt mind it as much becouse i loved everything else. only pet peeve i have with it is that the third final act felt to me like it had a lot of cut content and it didnt feel as good and complete as forst two chapters. but i hope they will fiz it in the future
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-07,best rpg game ever. roleplay is perfect. items perfect. dialogue is perfect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-07,this game is the definition of all fluff and no substance. this is nowhere the game that either bg 1 or bg 2 were.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-07,"de la part de larian studios, un jeu bourr dambitions au pluriel ! et la rsurrection et suite en quelque sorte dune vieille franchise quon croyait morte et enterre mais sur la base trs discutable il est vrai des divinity original sin hlas. le jeu en porte en effet tous les stigmates et les dfauts des original sin comme les pics de difficult inexplicables et linterface trs perfectible. la carte par exemple est quasiment inutilisable tellement elle est mal faite de mme pour la minicarte, encore pire les voyages rapides dune rgion  lautre sont trs mal faits eux aussi puisquil nexiste pas de carte du monde !mais ce nest pas le pire le pire est cet inventaire, le pire inventaire jamais conu, encore bien pire que celui de dos 2, un comble ! que ce soit au clavier ou  la manette, cest lenfer !! le suivi des qutes, leur prsentation est comme dans les dos,  savoir peu claire, alambique et pleine derreurs etou de bugs et nous y voil dailleurs, car le bg3 est plein de bugs ! y compris encore 3 mois aprs la sortie. comme par exemple, un personnage qui ne suit plus le groupe ou ne saute pas un obstacle et reste bloqu comme un con cest rcurrent. des bugs qui touchent aussi quelques qutes, notamment lune des qutes principales nous fermant du coup lune des rsolutions possibles de la  puis, techniquement, on a toujours ces problmes de performance dans la ville et cest encore pire lors du grand final mme le son saccade !. le jeu est certes bien joli mais reste assez loin des tnors dans le genre. en outre, o sont passes les voix franaises ? cest vraiment embtant pour un jeu de rle occidental aussi bavard ces griefs nombreux ayant t formuls, le jeu nest pas exempt de qualits indniables comme par exemple son criture brillante et inventive, ses personnages remarquables et attachants, ainsi que son systme de persuasion ou tromperiemensonge  base de lancers de ds en direct !le systme de combat est globalement moins lourdingue que dans les dos, ce qui constitue certainement un progrs bienvenu et tactiquement parlant, les possibilits sont nombreuses et plutt intressantes dommage que linterface soit aussi rtive. enfin, il est  noter une ambiance  la fois trs intrigante et souvent cruelle  le monde de bg3 est toinnamment brutal et peu amne en verit ! et un brin obscne aussi, si, sivoil donc dans le fond un excellent jeu, captivant, passionnant  suivre et  jouer mais dans le fond seulement ! il faudra en effet attendre une definitive ou enhanced edition pour arrondir comme il faut les angles et dbuguer correctement tout ce bazar. et peuttre galement amliorer lpilogue escamot et un peu bcl pour linstant  car aprs 150h de jeu, on attendait autre chose quune poigne de cinmatiques convenues et trois lignes de dialogues !"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,amazing crpg. definitely different than its precedessors baldur's gate 1  2 but great at its own right. definitely recommended.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,"a very special game. the turnbased combat might not be for everyone, but i certainly liked the strategic aspect of it. the story is amazing, even tho i do feel like the ending is somewhat meh. characters feel really flushed out, player choice is absolutely massive which makes the game very replayable, soundtrack is amazing and the graphics are honestly better than i initially expected from a turnbased game. definitly plan on replaying this from time to time. it's a 9.5 for me as of the date of review, as it does have quite some bugs near the end. nothing gamebreaking, just minor stuff."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,how can a game blow you away and then blow you away again. this game does it again and again and again.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,"the game is interesting, but the battles are sometimes tiring. there were almost no problems with optimization, but there were a lot of bugs. in general the game is worth 8 points, but for the future 9. of course, this is an estimate when bugs will be fixed and such"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,"after end my first run, i can only say that this is a masterpiece, i can't tell all the thing that was really awsome in just this post, the narrative, the character growth, and the fighting. personally i didn't like too much the turnbased combat, but in this game they made me adapt and love that combat mode a lot since they also make it very good and fun. in addition to saying that your character really feels like yours, you really have many options of what to do and your decisions will really affect the story in the short and long term. the missions are magnificent because in addition to the fact that they don't seem like missions, they make you interested in them and really feel part of it, making you take secondary missions that don't seem secondary, keeping you entertained in other things without realizing it. the only thing i can say is that if anyone is thinking about playing it and there is anything stopping you from doing it, just try it, you won't regret it, i guarantee it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-05,"oh my god! you got used last years to the standard clearly good, but replaceable und foreseeable open world rpg like games. now this is a disruptive game concerning story telling, level and quest design. you feel the passion and fun of the developers every minute. no need for vr to get total immersion  bg3 is enough. a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-05,esse game  simplesmente a melhor coisa do sculo. da pra jogar esse jogo vrias vezes e ter uma experiencia totalmente diferente! as empresas de games ubisoft realmente deveriam aprender com a larianstudios.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-05,"this game lacks the charm of both its predecessors. in the first game, you could feel your character grow in power as you progressed, and there was a real chance that you would not survive the encounters as the game progressed. in the second you knew if you played it right you could use the encounters to gather items and experience to increase your power. lastly, if every character can romance every other character, then none of the romances are special."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-05,"no game is perfect, technically but this game is an extraordinary experience. the story and the characters, the branching plot, your choices... all the possibilities... when you are playing this game, the feeling that you have is that whatever choice you want to make about the characters and the current events, the game is going to allow you to make it what an amazing game wonderful there's no way it doesn't get goty i've spent 140 hours the last 3 weeks playing it the only bad thing about this game is that you have to work and sleep sometimes. so you will have to stop playing at some point"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-04,"el juego es el rpg que siempre uno a querido jugar, de verdad hay un impacto en tus decisiones, la historia es atrapante y el combate es muyestratgico, a pesar de no gustarme los juegos de este estilo, pero tiene muchos problemas de rendimiento, el juego se puede congelar en medio de un combate , me lleg a pasar que  30 minutos en un combate para que se trabe justo cuando ganas ,ms de 4 veces me paso, por eso baja a 8"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-04,un juegazo lo mires por donde lo mires. una calidad pocas veces vista y un mimo increble a todos los detalles y posibilidades.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-04,"baldur's gate 3 is the pinnacle of what an rpg can be and everything an rpg fan could want. there are no flaws, story, gameplay, acting, music, environment, building system, notable npcs, memorable locations and scenes, the player can choose a variety of paths in the game, high replayability and most importantly, it is a game that you feel the love of the creators in every detail and that was worth it in the end, i will remember the characters and the story of this game for the rest of my life.game of the year 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-03,"mon premier rpg en tour par tour et quel jeu... mais quel jeu!!!! je n'ai jamais fait de jdr, que ce soit dd ou autre donc j'tais completement novice dans ce type de mecaniques et cet univers.. et c'est juste fou ce que larian  su faire, la qualit d'criture est completement dingue, vos acteschoix tout au long de l'aventure et la rpercussion de ces dernier sur lales fin du jeu est impressionnante car vous sentez vraiment une fin crite pour vous. bref j'ai t subjugu du debut  la fin, bg3 arrive  faire ce que seuls certains jeux inds arrivent  faire  ne pas prendre les joueurs.euses pour de cons, proposer une aventure passionnante, rythm, joliment ralis avec de vrais partis pris et finalement pas si difficile  jouer que a. c'est une relle claque pour moi bravo larian studios et merci."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-03,"larian has managed to show triple a game developers that video games with quality and class still have a very high appeal in contrast to the assembly line games of other studios looking at you ubisoft and ea. baldur's gate 3 manages to deliver a fantastic experience to both crpg veterans and newcomers to the genre. as someone who isn't a huge fan of turnbased combat systems, i was very entertained in my almost 200 hours of playtime. definitely a game of the year contender and hopefully a winner. my rating 910"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-03,real rpg.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-03,"only had the game for a couple of weeks and over 100hrs in. when my bro suggested it, i was like meh..roleplay.. not my thing. but then i thought, well, i used to play tunnels and trolls and dd when it first came out, so i wonder what its like on ps5 so, so glad i did. the mix of turn based and group movement make the game move along smoothly. i find the coma at fun and challenging. i normally steer away from magic as im a hacknslash kinda guy, but here its necessary and enjoyable to use. however,, what makes this game stand out for me are the depth of the character choices and the way that decisions really do have significant repercussions in the game going forward. character and group decisions mean you have to approach combat scenarios based on your party skills, allowing for multiple playthroughs however, im still in act 2 after 110hrs. but the main thing is the writing and scenario design. some encounters are beautifully designed with stunning graphics some are really challenging and some are really funny. the behindthescenes dice rolling is seamless meaning some traps reallydo take you by surprise. the characters have real depth so that some that i didnt warm to at the start are now my favourites take care though, my bro was a bit careless in his early interactions and two of his party upped sticks and left for good!. i would definitely say this is the most pleasantly surprised i have ever been about a game..ever well, that i remember.. silent hill 1 was a long time ago!. add to that the continued support and updates from the devs and this, for me, is the one absolutely must have game on nextgen. it has something for everyone. i havent tried multiplayer yet, as i like to do first play through alone so still got that to look forward to. a masterpiece imo and a bargain at the price."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-02,"not for smooth brains. the deepest, most complex  not complicated, and engrossing roleplaying game ever released. i have played the originals, i played dragon age, and i played just about every other crpg out there. baldurs gate 3 doesnt just build upon its predecessors, it doesnt just take the next step in progressing the genre, it perfects it. it completes it. in the decades to come, other crpgs will require a disclaimer stating roughly dont expect baldurs gate 3 levels of depth. not only is the current version of bg3 the goty, but the developers, larian studios, are constantly patching and adding new content to the game for free. when a uniquely superior developer creates their magnum opus, and doesnt attempt to extort money from their customers, you end up with something no other studio out there will ever have. a masterpiece made just for the fans."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-02,goty 2023. the game is much better than i expected. the complexity of the characters is captivating.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-02,"incredible rpg, the level of depth in the rpg elements combined with a fun well made turn based combat system creates an unforgettable experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-02,incredible game!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,more than i would ask for!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,"a pleasant surprise. this game, at least for me, came out of nowhere with a ton of hype and expectations. what could go wrong? well... a lot of things. most 2023 games are launching incomplete, with terrible optimization. and that's only the technical matters. only multiplayeronline, bad plotdialogue, useless lore and hollow gameplay are pretty common nowadays. fortunately, larian studios is different. first of all, the game is absolutely playable. 4k high settings with balanced dlss made me so happy. my 2060  ryzen 5 1600 are still good when the game is well optimized. also, the hdr looks amazing, and the gameplay with a controller is impressive. i mean, that's a turnbased rpg and, somehow, it works beautifully. but what about what matters the most? plots in video games are rarely as good as some toptier movies, even when the focus is the campaign. seeing genuinely good characters' backgrounds, with solid development and plausible dialogues, made me feel so lucky to have the chance to experience it. they look so real, with motivations, ethicalmoral clashes, ambitions, etc. also, their dialogues are rich with subtext content. along with what is most explicit about the sentence, there are elements that complement their culture, feelings, and motivations. it reminds me of a song of ice and fire dialogues. if i am comparing bg3 to grrm's writing, you know that the game is good. i cannot forget about the voice acting. it is so good that it made me like characters that i usually would not like just by their voice astarion and lae'zel at first. also, their development comes mainly from personal quests  which are amazing. and talking about them... that's probably the first time that a game made me play the side quests from the adventure itself. i really didn't give a damn about the rewards  and that's an amazing complement, since the game is challenging, and you have to pay attention to those types of stuff. i explored a lot around 65h of gameplay, and i still want more. they were memorable, fun, sad  all of those feelings together sometimes. the gameplay was challenging, immersive, and pretty variable. i never thought i would like a turnbased rpg so much. it's crazy how much you can do differently just by having another approach. also, i loved the bosses. bg3 made me feel a lot of things. i felt manipulated, happy and sad about outcomes, characters' destiny, excited by some fights, in love with the ost, intrigued with the worldbuilding, and, most of all, a true fearless wizard fighting for his and their friends' freedom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,best game i have ever played! i love all of it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"an extraordinary game. long, wllwritten story with great characters and endless possibilities. a true rpg masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,it's ten of ten cause i've never played game like this before. i love board games and now i live in a place where it's difficult to continue my hobby. now i can play this videogame instead. played about 200hours i'm in second passthrough rn. i've never played any single player games so long in a month.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"baldur's gate 3 is an obvious home run for larian studios and a constant delight to play. from the combat, to the acting, to the puzzles, to the quality of the graphics, the amount of polish and creativity put in to this game is astounding. i have already started a third playthrough since launch. the game is not without bugs but the dev team is attentive and works hard to fix as much as they can with each patch. the game's third act does suffer from a bit of drag in the storytelling department and even higher end pc hardware can experience framerate dips in the titular city. plus, the sheer volume of things to do can feel overwhelming. is it still worth it? 100 and then some. the preorder bonuses for the game are incredibly lacking and do not need to be purchased for anyone other than diehard larian fans. these are literally my only criticisms of the game. bg3 encourages players to interact with the game world creatively and curiously, explore as many options as possible in combat and rewards players who excel or learn to excel at both. the sound design and cinematography in the game is elite and deserve their own reviews. overall baldur's gate 3 deserves universal acclaim and has become an instant classic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"a good game, but the top down view and the turn based combat really is a bad thing for me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-31,trs bon jeu je pense mais le tour par tour nest dfinitivement pas ma tasse de th jai vite lch laffaire dommage car tout le reste est top.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,"i reopened my metacritic account from 2013 just so i can review this game and thank the development team. thank you for making a game with no need for in game spending. thank you for the voice acting and amazing dialog. thank you for taking the time to makea game that you love, and therefore we loved. thank you for not solely thinking of the bottom line, and thinking about making games people will treasure for years to come"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,"it is as incredible as the reviews say, the only downside is that there isn't more to do after you've beaten the game 3 times."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,"amazing stories told through an amazing interaction with the world that depends on your race, class and skills."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,i've never played an rpg game before and this is simply amazing. definitely one of the best games ever played
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"story unlike anything, actors who love what they're doing and not getting exploited. a ceo who loves what he does. no messy day 1 fixesdlcanything, no loot boxes, no microtransactions, no random anything you have to grind for, but a great handcrafted experience. 2010, game of the year and probably game of the decade"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"it's not going to be a super long page and i'm going to list the disadvantages more, because why write about the pros.i'll point out right away that i'm a big fan of bg1 and 2, completed many times, with all the expansions, mods, things that make the game more difficult,  first and biggest minus for me is definitely the camera, its work and throw. not acceptable. 1 i move the mouse to the corner of the screen and the map doesn't move, after 2 it's terribly unreadable, because of these levels, floors, for me the nightmare takes away the joy of the game, in general it's easy to get lost, you go from some settlement to baggna, you don't even know when. 2. as for me, the whole inventory build is a failure, tons of rubbish, it's a shame to collect it because there is nothing to spend money on, a lot of crates and other barrels. 3. not all items, barrels, chests are highlighted, as for me minus, ok, i understand someone doesn't want to have the option to turn it off and wio. but i'm a fan of tags. 4. the game is simply easy on the highest level of difficulty. 5. they annoy those dice rolls 6, it doesn't make sense that some actions have to be done from scratch, i mean, for example, this opening, disarming traps, somehow in bg2 it worked better, i'm talking about the whole procedure. 7. i miss the real legendary stuff, the kind that has its own history, the kind that immerses us in the world of bg 8. the lack of any historical, booklike characters that refer to this world. the encounters with drizzt and artemis were fun in bg2. you really felt satisfaction when you slaughtered them 9. as for me, the side characterscompanions are average, i honestly prefer the solo game i gave it as  , but it didn't affect my rating 10. you can play as a drow for example, which i also chose, but it doesn't work, almost no reactions, there's no hatred. 11. it's easy to miss something, in the sense of a man boer some item somewhere, like in the case of druids, the whole village pounces on you, you kill them and lose 23 quests 12. the funny thing is that it doesn't really matter what weapon you wield, it does a similar amount of dmg. too bad and finally, i honestly didn't feel connected to the world of faerun while playing this game. it's just a game called bg3 and that's it, from the bigger advantages i can add that you can mix character classes at any  i give it an 8, but it's kind of farfetched. honestly, i expected more from the reviews and review  the way, as bg3 announced, i had doubts about this project, in terms of the atmosphere of the game, and it worked. to be fair, i don't take anything away from larian, it makes a very good game, but making a game from 0 that doesn't have a story in the session that it's not in any particular universe is one thing, and making a game that is with the story is 2. i understand that there are a lot of players who, let's say, licked older bg much later and evaluated the games in terms of graphics etc  i don't drink to it here, because actually the graph is the last thing i pay attention to for me, unfortunately, but the atmosphere of bg3 is weak,unfortunately, but larian won't pull the wool over my eyes with some romance or great immersion with  that's my opinion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"rpg at its finest, the only thing is that you cant play in the city lol, fps goes to 15"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"jai beaucoup aim le jeu, le systme de combat est plutt cool et original le ct rpg du jeu cest videmment son gro point fort, les graphismes sont trs beaux par contre, on va pas se mentir que les menus et le journal de qute est absolument  chier, tout les menus sont atroces, on comprends rien, cest mal fait, des fois ya un curseur sur la map, on comprends pas ce que cest, des fois ya des qutes qui sont marqus, des fois pas, le journal de qute, il est horriblement mal fait cest le gros point ngatif du jeu. je pense que le jeu aurait frler la perfection si il avait des menus convenable, mais bon histoire au top, personnage au top, libert de tuer, de discuter et de faire  peu prs ce quon veut, cest vrai que par contre on comprend trs bien ou on doit aller, je demande pas  mettre une flche prcise, mais on prend vraiment du plaisir  jouer  ce jeu uniquement au moment o lon comprends que il faut juste ce balader comme on veut et quon croisera des qutes, des histoires etc je donne mon avis mais je suis loin davoir terminer ce jeu, je suis  25h de jeu  peu prs et pour linstant il mrite 810"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,"this game is like dragon age origins on steroids. the care this game got from the devs is unreal. so many things have impressed me. the story with its plottwists, the dialogue choices you can make, the music, the voice acting, the dnd style combat and many more aspects. i can honestly say that this game is a masterpiece and succeded in giving the true spiritual successor of dragon age origins. da2 and inquisition failed to deliver big time. da dreadwolf is not needed anymore and probably can't compete with bg3. i will enjoy this game many years to come. playthroughs with friends, dark urge and whatever ideas i will get for a third or fourth playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,"having finished the game, i know i will return to the world of baldur's gate 3 again in the future, as time is wont to make the heart grow fonder. with all it's bugs i experienced near the end of the game, baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece that proves why i fell in love with gaming and stories. it is clear that the developers making this piece of media put their heart and soul into it. the game is a milestone of storytelling, dynamic characters, and immersive dialogue. the game is a delight to play and offers a stunning and diverse world to explore. baldurs gate 3 is not just a game, it is a love letter to the fans of the baldurs gate series and dungeons  dragons. baldur's gate 3 exceeded my expectations and captured my heart."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-22,this is the real game of the year winner right here.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,"baldur's gate 3 is the most polarizing game i have ever played. never has an rpg been this immersive since the elder scrolls v skyrim, and the sheer amount of quests, characters and choices you can make is ludicrous. you have complete freedom in how you want to approach quests and when you want to approach them. you rarely have to follow markers, and can get pretty much anywhere in multiple ways. there are too many builds to count, too many areas to explore, too many npcs to talk too, it almost feels unreal. the world is beautiful, the objects and environments are detailed and the story keeps you interested throughout. your party members are very well written and come with their own captivating personal stories. they react to the world around you through quests you complete, engage in late night conversations and are generally a treat to interact with bar a few. every act ramps up in narrative and world building, and act 3 presents the most captivating plot in the game with great villains and even better sidequests. but, for all the effort that was spent in making the game so ambitious, it feels like none was made to make the game function properly. this is probably the most buggyglitchy game i have ever played, and i played cyberpunk 2077. quests will not start or end properly due to scripting bugs or npcs being at the wrong place, your party members will get stuck on terrain or refuse to jump after you, lens flares and texture sometime spazz out or arrive late to the party, getting in a room with a big door is a nightmare and the camera can be wonky in some fights. but in the face of the following bugs, these are minor issues as you approach act 3, the game starts breaking down, big time. textures will sometime just not load, the game will start lagging unbearably, meaning you will take 15 seconds to pick up an item or talk to an npc. my character was suddenly unable to drop items at some point, and some npcs just start disappearing from important quests. these are not minor issues they actively harm the game's pacing and kill your motivation to play. larian needs to get their  together and fix these numerous bugs. the dice roll mechanics, while an essential part of the dd experience, can become really annoying, especially early on in fights. you will be facing enemies at your level or higher in act 1, and since your characters are very weak early on, you will have low chances of hitting anything, which can result in fights being miss contests until someone finally hits someone else and loses half their hp bar. it is bad game design to have such a rough early game and a considerably easier midlate game. larian should rework the percentage system and give players an easier time early on, especially when they haven't fully grasped dd combat mechanics. with that being said, the ambition is clearly here and realized very well, and like fallout new vegas, i am willing to overlook the numerous bugs, making this a top 10 game of all time."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-19,i've got a little over 300 hours in this game now. i never want to leave the bg world. i haven't loved a game this much since i first logged into the everquest world in 1999 and i've played 100's of other games since then. prior to this i wasn't a turn based fan at all. but i can't tell you how much i love this game.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-19,"starting with the graphics and overall design... for this kind of game and the amount of things you can see on screen, the graphics are truly amazing. everything shines even more when these graphics are combined with a flawless environment and excellent level design. the maps are wellcrafted and not too entangled, making them perfect for both nonexplorers and those who love to explore every nook and cranny. additionally, the various races, mobs, and characters have a really cool design. argument, storyline and the general course of the game is really good. but the thing that really impressed me was the fact that decisions can make the game really really different for each person. in addition i gotta say that, the thing that really got me, was the different kinds of relationships you can have with every single character, and the implications of those relationships have with the storyline, the consequences and even the end of the game. it is just unbelievable. everything that happens in the game, every single moment and every interaction gets reinforced by and amazing sound design and most importantly, really accurate music that makes you feel the fear, amazement, epicity or sadness depending on the situations you are living. now... i gotta say i don't like turn based gameplay, but this game was the one that changed my mind. just as hollow knight or hades changed my mind regarding metroidvanias and indies.speaking about of mechanics and generall gameplay, the feeling of freedom and do wathever you want is really something else. it really feels as an alive world, causeyou can do almost anything, and it will have a reaction. bad things? almost not. i only had like 4 bugs that forced me to reload a previous save, but nothing really bad happened. and i really think, this had a lot of potential to be the most bugged game of the year. it is a technicall marvel. totally recommended."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-18,"this game is a mustplay phenomenal masterpiece. no, it is not perfect, but it is easily the best gaming experience i've had in a long time  up there with elden ring, the best zeldas, rdr2.. you name it. it's up there. larian has put in immeasurable amounts of effort into making it the best game they could possibly make and it's paid off  and they're improving it all the time with patches. there's no filler, no padding, every side quest has purpose, good writing, good characters. the story and companion quests become intertwined at times and i've never felt more pressure to make the right decision in a game before. it's not good or evil  it's, how do you want to be good? how do you want to be evil? much more nuanced, and nearly every side quest has some decisions to make that could come back to you later on. buy this. the combat is a bit slow at first, but once you level up a few times it picks up. the writing, characters, story, is all worth the gameplay which i found to be a blast especially later game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-17,"massive amounts of story, character and world building, tons of lore, exploration, and robust class system and spells. thats baldurs gate 3 in a nutshell. i think some will either love or hate the dnd style gameplay, but i will say it does lend to some tense fights and some really good dialogue choices. i love the game, but it aint perfect. i think there was a huge opportunity missed with the crafting system. there is only alchemy. no crafting armor, weapons, and the like. you end up looting so much crap figuring you could eventually craft something out of it, but that is simply not the case. larian studios poured their heart and soul into this one, and it really shows. i put something around two hundred hours into my first playthrough, and i am eager to go back a second time to see the different outcomes. truly, this game is one of a kind."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-16,"i'm still trying to finish this game and i already want to play it again from the beginning! if you play dd, this is the nearest approximation to the real one. it is full of systems that combined, creates a freedom sensation, not just for the battle, but also for a lot of situations. it is plenty of references, and you can see how much care and effort developers have put in the game. the bad thing is that this game has bugs too, and as far as you progress through the story, the bugs get worse. this may be common, because the game is probably very complex internally, but, as a developer, you shouldn't make players repeat some minutes of gameplay just because there are bugs, that's not fair, that's why i put a 9 instead of 10. anyway, every rol player should give it a try, for me it's a goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-16,"the story is pretty good, and the character's arc's have built up nicely, but the gameplay and customization have been pretty disappointed, since it's another mmo style, and you can barely move around much in terms of the openworld exploration."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-16,best ever
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-16,"never played dd. never played a crpg. never played the first two games. i wasnt even that interested in this game when it came out this august because i figured the turnbased combat wouldnt be able to hold my attention. but after hearing about the unanimous hype and the accalim and watching a few interviews by larian and the vas, i purchased it. im 50 hours deep and only just finishing up the first act. ive already started a second play through as a different race and class. and i find myself thinking about the game all the time when im not playing it. this game is a masterpiece. i hope everyone involved in the making are very proud of themselves and their creation. theyve done an incredible job."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-15,"i was not sure at first if i wanted to play this game, mostly because i was concerned about the da and mechanics coming from dnd a rpg that is a to my opinion a bit old school fantasy with has been visuals and mechanics that don't work so well anymore. but ho boy i was wrong on this one. finally decided to give it a shot after seeing how well it was recieved by the community. worth it all the way ! here i am 214 hours later after two runs advising you lads to play it. do not fear the turn base mode or da or rpg's usual failures, i promise you that you'll get grasp by this game as many of us did. gameplay is working, even better than in dnd to me, it might be scary a bit looking up at the game with all those spells and stuff but since the journey is longue u get along with it very easily. rpg aspect, characters, stories, char dev, choices possibility of this game are top notch 1110, to be honest i've not seen so much life given to video game characters and story ever. every single one companion is well written, deep, evolves and procure a unique experience boarding with during your playthrough. we shall wait long before this game is outclassed in it's gendra. graphics are nice, some cool scenes and huge level art work definitly a great achievement on this side. bug free yes it's still achievable apparently. many endings, as great as the rest of the game choices, the game even offers you a truly alternativ story with the dark urge origin, what a banger. two downside tho. the first one is the explanation of the mechanism and game systems. i you've no experience with dnd or pathfinder actions, spells slots, states many thing will be challenging to really understand. the game lacks tutorial for newcomers to the franchise. you'll manage no biggy but you won't fully enjoy and understand. second aspect is the loot gestion and tools when it comes to sort it out and deal with this mountain of items, spells, clothes .. and so on. be ready to spend time managing your bags if you're a loot goblin as much as i'am. overall one of my best experience in gaming, loved it, it's a must do."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-15,"one of the most important factors that make a game great is having it developed by people who love the game, and their interaction with players through small details within the game. these small details within the game show the developers' passion for the game and elevate a game that already has a good presentation to higher levels in the eyes of players."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-15,excellent game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-14,"despite not being familiar with baldur's gate before the release of the third installment and having known larian studios primarily for their divinity games, i must say that i didn't expect baldur's gate 3 to become one of the best games my fiance and i have ever played. the story is incredibly diverse, original, and unpredictable, making it impossible to anticipate the consequences of one's actions. alongside the highly interesting characters, there isn't a single npc who lacks some form of 's important to be aware that every action can influence future events, and in the midst of all the backandforth, one can sometimes make decisions that impact the game in ways they didn't intend.moreover, baldur's gate 3 is a game that has provided my fiance and me with a shared escape from the outside world. despite the limited time due to work constraints, we've spent over 100 hours on our first playthrough. it's not everyone's cup of tea due to its turnbased gameplay mechanics, but i recommend that everyone give it a try to see if it resonates with  me, it's already a strong contender for the game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-14,"this is what an rpg should look like, you have to think about the choice and all the time, its always courage, what if i do this"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-14,a masterpiece. this should be the new standard that game developers everywhere aspire to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-13,"can't help but to absolutely lose myself while playing this game. 90 hours in, first playthrough finished and i'm about to start another campaign with no site of slowing down. however as of now while the first two acts ran virtually flawless for me on ps5 the third act is another story. it's definitely better after the update but there are still plenty of issues. the final fight was pretty laggy and rough for me as well and characters literally appearing upsidedown during dialogue. i will admit that did leave a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth as it completely rips you out of this immersive adventure you've put so much time and effort into, especially egregious being at such a pivotal time in the game. even with the negatives though this game is nothing short of incredible. an absolute 9 and would be a masterpiece ten if they can continue patches fix the third act to match the first two."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-13,"while the story is amazing and act 1 and 2 are a pure joy to play, act 3 is what separates this game from being a piece of art and a 10, to being an 8. from plot holes, to bugs, and incredibly broken quest chains act 3 is a disappointment. otherwise, the music, ambient, ui, graphics is 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-13,one of the best rpgs i've ever played.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-13,"baldur gate 3 has exceeded all my expectations. graphics, plot, characters and the world of the game are made at the highest level. the atmosphere of dark fantasy is conveyed stunningly, and the story is addictive from the very beginning.i would especially like to note the depth and elaboration of the game world. it is filled with interesting details that continue to amaze even after many hours of playing. exploring the world brings a lot of fun, and each new location brings something new and  character creation system allows you to create a unique hero, which makes the passage even more interesting. and the ability to choose the path of development and skills gives the player freedom in  combat system is quite complex, but this only adds interest to the game. tactical battles require the player to take thoughtful actions and use all the capabilities of the team.music and sound effects are on top. they create a unique atmosphere and help to immerse yourself in the world of the  only negative that i noticed is a small number of bugs and technical problems. but the developers quickly fix them, so it doesn't really interfere with enjoying the  general, baldur gate 3 is a masterpiece of the rpg genre that will not leave any fan of this genre indifferent."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-11,my new instant favorite
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"literally one of the most accessible ways to consume dd lore. dm of 19 years, cut my teeth on add and do love my previous bg games. while not perfect in each facet, it can be argued more time could have been taken  compared to every crpg especially with this scope this is the definitive experience for someone to have playing a crpg. i do hope there will be a few patches to sure up a few glitchy bits and add future content but as is, this is still goty. this is a game , this is the kind of game that will be mentioned like dark souls, like final fantasy, like chrono trigger. people will come back to this as their comfort game. i am truly sad for people who can't take the time to enjoy this but, not everybody appreciates art the same. game of the decade!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"the only games that i have ever played and enjoyed to the extent which i do bg3 are skyrim  wow, both of which i played for a decade straight, and they honestly pale in comparison to the enjoyment i get from this game. i've never played a turnbased game or dd so i was a little unsure of how much i'd enjoy it. as a 33yo w a full time job, i've got over 140hrs in on my first play through and i still spend most of my workdays looking forward to getting home  hopping on. can't wait for playthrough 2  and 3 and, let's be honest, 4"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-03,"baldurs gate 3 brings me back to an era where i fell in love with games like dragon age origins which at the time was simplified. but great regardless after generations made me wish of that next gen experience with depth in choices, transforming my experience based on how i play and how i can transform a situation to my benefits. makes for a highly replayable game. i'm a goblin in my second playthrough you always try something different. i missed having special runs like that since the mass effect trilogy. so this feels extremely rare for modern gaming. we've seen a great wave of crpgs reviving the genre via crowdfunds. with high praise pillars of eternity, tyranny, shadowrun, pathfinder and divinity larian studios always caught that depth. so it was a surprise when the next ip was baldurs gate 3. i played the beta and was impressed by their switch to a more cinematic touch. cutscenes were mind blowing and the lore was ever so richer. i could say i didn't expect the final product to be that rich in production, personalities and roles. its the richest in those terms. i would've given it a perfect 10. but i started when it had its bugs. and i would be lying to say its a perfect game. but its damn near it. im considering my third run with all the current fixes. i have to say larian has been full on improving the game constantly and honestly there's no game at this level in the market. the high praise is earned. it is from me. crpgs are stronger than ever and bg3 flags itself in what crpgs could be like. even harder to deny on how fun it is to see the results from the consequences you took. i laughed and smiled so much through my experience. i felt nostalgic. this is a great evolution for games. the buzz it generates on what other players experienced. its hard not see this getting awards in a era where saturation is driving the industry on uneven directions. we needed a shift to open the market."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,goty!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,it's actually insane that i'm on my 3rd playthrough of this game and still discovering world building options. really fun though you have to be a fan of the game style since it's not like a first person or anything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,together with dos2 this is fighting for the spot of being my favorite game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"gaming for 35 years and this game is in the top 10 for giving me pure joy, tears, and laughter. i feel like a kid again. this game allows the player to find any way they can to deal with a situationbattleroute. in my opinion, this game is the ultimate game in all ways. graphics, gameplay, and options. i've played over 300 hours and am still finding new things every play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,proves games can come overflowing with content at release
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"best game ever. this game scratches that tabletop itch. the game has a lot of nonlinear and linear content you can play with. you can also play with friends! maybe you want to play a villain, the hero, or the anti hero. maybe you like to throw things or wreck quest items. do it! who's going to stop you? i recommend buying the game at least twice  once for yourself and again for your best friend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,amazing game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,this is my first review  on metacritic. i was motivated enough to actually do a review because of how amazing this game is. i have played part way through the game and i am aware of the issues with act 3 but even act 1 is enough to have me give this review. i also want to reward a company that's not greedy with dlc and micro transactions. thank you larian studios for such a fun experience.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,love this game. first game in a while that i was excited for before it released and wasn't let down once it dropped. already spent nearly 100 hours in game and not even close to done playing. larian did not disappoint.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,i've barely got into the 3rd act but i am having a blast with this game. i'm playing three different campaigns with my friends and each one is unique. i really wish more rpgs had this level of detail.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,brilliant adaption of 5th edition that will revolutionise level design for aspiring and advanced dungeon masters. can'twait for a sandbox style to make my own campaigns.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"this is by far my favorite game. the fighting mechanics are fun and less stressful to me than real time fights, the design of the characters, setting, and other details are so good, the story is unique and enjoyable, and the dating mechanics are really fun! theres so many things you can do, so many places you can go, and so many different ways you can play this game. if youre ok with playing a mature game, this one is an amazing choice. i highly recommend it and have almost 350 hours logged at this point, and i intend to add many more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,the best crpg i ever played
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"one of the best games i've ever played. its a masterpiece, with incredible story writing and acting, and the best adaptation of 5e dd in a video game that i've ever seen. partly writing this review to counteract the wave of fake botwritten reviews on this game published on 1092023  28 reviews written with 1 letter or a string of random characters, by accounts made the same day with names that are strings of random characters, and those accounts have no other reviews. most of those reviews happened in the same part of the day as well, so they were almost certainly one person or one small group of people writing reviews maliciously to artificially lower the score of the game. before those reviews came in the game was at a 9.2, so whatever it is at currently, its probably really at .3 higher than that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"watch out for negative reviews with zero explanation left by bots. in a sea of soulless cashgrabs designed by marketing reps and accountants and developped by 'outsourced' sweatshops, this game should win game of the year purely based on principle. it was a joy to play and easy to learn with 0 experience with dnd or the bg series beforehand, exciting even during my third playthrough, and it's a game i will continue to return to over and over again, just like sykrim or fallout4. the difference is that larian didn't add an ingame store and is working hard on fixing bugs. months after the realease, when we have all paid for the game and would be forgotten by any aaa studio, larian is still adding new features, and improving the game. 1010, no microtransactions, fun combat and exploration, no monetised mods, characters so real that they trigger my social anxiety, the best roleplaying game i've ever played. make sure to check out the divinity series too, folks. larian deserves all the love and most big game studios deserve none of it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"the best game of the year, if not the entire decade, without a doubt. great story, great gameplay, just wonderful."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,an awesome game would love to play something like that again
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"baldur's gate 3 is a triumph of storytelling, worldbuilding, and gameplay mechanics. it is a testament to the passion and dedication of its developers and a love letter to fans of the rpg genre. with its captivating narrative, deep roleplaying mechanics, and stunning visuals, this game sets a new standard for what an rpg can achieve. baldur's gate 3 is not just a game it's an unforgettable journey that deserves universal acclaim and a permanent place in the pantheon of gaming greatness."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,so good
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,"as a big baldurs and crpg fan it's almost a perfect game, sure there are bugs and fps issues, but just sheer amount of content and posibilites you are offered overcomes all of it. i want to fully finish my second run to decide if it's a 1010 game, but for sure it's close to it. i can tell you it's worth every penny, even if you are not into crpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,"massively overrated due to how good act 1 is. dont get me wrong the game concept in itself is really good. i had a huge blast in act 1, despite the miserable camera controls and companion ai oh how many times have they been left behind because the ai decided that it cant suddenly jump over a half meter gap. however at act 2 i started being disappointed. there was only 1 map and some kinda dungeon and thats about it. the story and choice quality started to slowly decrease but thats fine game was still overall solid. however then act 3 started  which also led me to give it only a 5 rating  and everything went downhill.. countless bugs some even to a point where i had to restart from previous saves. blackscreens and textures not loading. unfinishable quests and the list goes on. for me it becomes very obvious that act 1 was the only really tested thing  as it was available for early access for years  and i will probably wait for the definitive edition before making a second playthrough and reconsidering my rating for it. as of now it is beyond me how this game made it to best rated game on this platform."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,"despite the many bugs and crashes, bg3 earns a spot in my mount rushmore of gaming. this gave me the feeling of being immersed in the story while giving me a rewarding tactical experience something that hasn't happened since final fantasy tactics, which is my all time favourite game. warnings the beginning was very slow. i was new to crpgs, so i had a hard time getting into it initially. i would play an hour, drop it, then get back to it hoping i'd get hooked. acter 45 hours i was hooked and could not stop playing."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,"greatest game ,i have ever played. was not a fan of turn based combat but after bg3 im a changed man. act 1 purely perfect,act 2 was a bit anoying due to the dark, but after getting the lantern act 2 was also amazing,act 3 was perfect. this game above all prooves that gaming is an art form, games can be art. this game is a masterpiece. amazing wring awsome loverble charectors awsome combat system puts rp in rpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,probably the best game of the decade
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,"baldur's gate 3 is one of the best games i've played in a long while. with some of the best player to character interactions ever and some of the most intuitive and fun combat. it feels great to just jump into some combat and mow down enemies with a well coordinated attack. the acting is top notch as every voice actor brings their agame and no one trips at the finish line. my favorite character, shadowheart. is a prime example of this. a character that is fleshed out as the story comes along, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast. the player in this makes their character with whatever you feel like doing. you have the lawful good character looking for the underdogs and overall golden retriever character. or on the opposite, the chaotic evil character. the fireballs and lightning bolts even if my allies are in the vicinity. you can play a troubled cleric or a astounding leader. it doesn't matter, the beauty of this game is it's freedom of choice and action."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,"la mejor experiencia que he tenido desde la salida de elden ring o monster hunter world , me vi totalmente atrapado en este juego , obligado a entregar todas las horas libres  y no tan libres , hasta terminarlo la primera vez , para volver a empezar la aventura para resolver de forma distinta las diversas situaciones en las que me encontre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,"i believe this game has defined what passion means when making a game the studio loves. it doesn't have all the modern gaming tropes. it is just an awesome game overall, and i bought not just the pc version, but the ps5 version as well. larian deserves it. i will be playing baldurs gate 3 for years to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"amazing, larian studio's leaving the aaa studios in the dust"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,this is def the best game of the year. i love zelda but this one is something else.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"i've been in rpgs, since eob, dungeon master and bard's tale and expected bg3 with great anticipation. somehow, it couldn't manage to hook me. i didn't like the continuous dice throwing to proceed the dialogues, the too long loading times, the overtwisted character stories, the long turnwaiting in battles when the enemies were more than 4 or 5, the hardwarestraining graphics, the omnipresent, sometimes forced diversity. i liked the story was well plotted, the maps and levels well designed, the graphics excellent underdark was a jewel, atmosphere was great and the classic dnd characters coexisted nicely with the player team."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"quite literally art in form , dnd is probably not everyones cup or tea, yet most people even fan or not will agree that its a great game and surpass expectations, no witheld content, no micro transactions and play able offline. its a gem"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"i love the old baldurs gates and icewind dales. this is not them. combat is a chore, slow, boring. environmental affects sound cool but do not scale past act i as a reliable way to deal damage. story is hairbrained and wild and gets worse and worse. almost every character you can recruit is a slutty beta twink. game is completely linear after act i. class progression completely linear after level 5. end game battles are just giant slogs of turn waiting  not epic. boasts 17000 endings but they are all either the good guy hero or murdering homeless band  no evil or chaotic paths  no nuance to outcomes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,new standard for arpg games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"amazing game, great graphics, choices impact the story, tons of replayability"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"amazing. thereare stillt quite a lot of bugs, but nonetheless this game is a masterpiece. please produce more games like this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,"honntement une master classe, une leon dans le domaine du jeu vido et du rpg en luimme ce jeu mais allemande. tous ces gros studio triple a. je nai jamais vcu une aventure aussi forte et aussi intense depuis 10 ans, autant par le gameplay que par la narration rien elle 10 ans, autant par le gameplay que par la narration, rien nest laiss au hasard dans ce jeux et est un exemple dans la gestiondquipe et du combat, tour par tour. une claque vido ludique qui restera dans les annales comme meilleur jeu de lanne 2023, ainsi que sur 10an larian studio nous a pondu un bijou qui je lespre, va mettre un grand coup de pied dans cette fourmilire de studio avec leur licence indigeste et non novatrice"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,what a journey.. what a hell avernus?  i will never forget. one of the best games i ever played. i dont have the words to describe all the magnificence of baldurs gate 3 so i will juste say thank you larian studio for creating this work of art. 1920.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-05,the game i have always dreamed of making and playing. the height of crpg so far. perfection.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"this game is near perfect. there are some big bugs still in act 2 and 3. and overall act 2 feels far shorter than act 1  3. but let's be honest. this is what a aaa game should be. choices, consequences. dd is an experience where a player can do almost anything, and bg3 is easily the closest game based off dd that gives you that much freedom"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,masterclass
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"the best and most complete rpg you will ever play. this isn't a game for everyone, espeacially for being turn based but if you get over this you will experience one of the best games ever made. don't throw this game out because it's turn based, give it a chance and you will be surprised off whay it has to offer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"impossivel esse game no ganhar melhor rpgdo ano... a questo  rpg total, trazendo nostalgia da galera q jogava no papel o famoso dd no mundo grafico com jogabilidade na nossa telinha! com os demais jogos do ano, isso aqui  uma obra de arte... nota 1000"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"2023 is the year of abandoning conventional wisdom of games for me. it was the year where believing the hype, as well as preordering certain games were actually a good idea. and that's for the simple reason that those games turned out to be amazing. baldur's gate 3 is one of those games. i was contemplating which game to start playing first  bg3 or starfield. i was more inclined to starfield because fps style games are my jam. and while i did love dnd and bg2, that was like more than 20 years ago. i even thought that given it being well received, starfield had a better chance at game of the year than bg3. i was wrong. i haven't enjoyed and loved a game so much in recent time after the witcher 3. i see now why people were gushing about bg3 and calling it game of the year. bg3 also reminds me again why i loved dnd rule sets for rpg. you can truly play your own character as you design it. your choices in actions and dialogues have real consequences. the npcs and quests have depth and their stories draw you in. combat is challenging but there are so many ways to approach them. the graphics and voice acting and music are top notch. bg3 is just an all around fantastic game. one thing i absolutely hate though. camera control. especially when verticality is involved. larian needs to improve and fix it. we need camera verticality control!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,"never played any dnd nor any crpgs. tried this one out because there's nothing new coming out in my niche, and this has been eye opening. this is now my favorite game of all time. i don't have any words to describe the game that others did not already mention, but what i can tell you, is that it brings me back to my childhood. the feeling that you just want to play this game all the time. when i'm at work, i can only think how the story is going to progress, what am i going to discover next, what is going to be the next step in my relationship with shadowheart, and etc. it's crazy how this is the first time that i can honestly say, that this is game one must try, even if you are not a fan of turn based games, please try it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,games like this are still possible! thank you!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-04,one of best games i have ever played. thank you larian

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-03,absolutely adore this game. the only downside karlach can't be my friend irl.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-03,"i did played the others baldurs gate games with a friend, that sadly i had to drop for reasons, so i already knew i would like this game. but what i played blew my mind. its legit one of the best games ive ever played in my life, and ive played a bunch. i can only be thankfull to that friend that introduced me to this saga. goty wikthout a doubt"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,this game was amazing and worth waiting for.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,the best game i've potentially ever played.suikoden 2 was my previous favorite and this may have toppled that  you love games with story depth character development and infinite choices that affect everything to the tune of thousands of potential endings this is probably the best game you'll ever play to  you like fast paced grindy insta loot games this may not be for you.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,"great story, interesting characters, and plenty of sidequests to keep you running all over the place. one my favorite games since witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,"really great, but kinda dipped in quality in act 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,"guys there is nothing to say, its just that this is now one of my favorite games of all time, it has literally everything that is worth loving and appreciating video games, larian thank you for your efforts!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,wow. love it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,the best watch?vmeurnvroh74
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,"baldur's gate is actually great. it is not the bestoptimised game out there and may potentially suffer from freezing on older systems. between its release and the early access of release of starfield, i put in about 300 hours into this game. it was not enough. there is so much that i still want to go back and do. and even with the sheer size of the game, very little about its content will leave you wanting. sure, some stories are not as interesting as others. karlach and astarion's companion quests are far better written than wyll and the other companions' quests. however, you may not even realise this due to the stellar performance that the cast put in. the game's graphics are excellent and shine through cutscenes with expressive characters that will captivate and have you invested in their stories for days. i am on the fence regarding the battles but that is not enough to take away from this game. baldur's gate 3 being developed by larian studios was inevitably expected to live up to the highs of the studios' previous divinity title. boy, did it knock it out of the park!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,"well, bg2 was a real time rpg with the option to be played as turn based back in 1998 or so. bg3 is turn based only, in 2023. there are absolutely no camera options to chose from same as in 1998 and you have to move the camera manually just like in 1998, great! there is no way to customize, with a script or something similar, the way your party members approach combat by default, so that you don't have to micromanage every combat round. unlike bg2 which in 1998 had the aforementioned option. i couldn't imagine myself playing a first person rpg back in 1998 it seemed ridiculous then because of the horrible 3d graphics. i can't believe people would play a non first or third person rpg in 2023 when graphics are so good. all in all this game feels and looks dated. combat is absolutely horrible pausing every millisecond waiting for your input with no way of automating anything. the camera needs your constant attention moving and rotating the view continuously using the keyboard. offcourse dnd 5th edition rules don't do bg3 any favor but they are what they are. i expected a game with 2023 standards and got less than 1998 bg2 release. the story is very good though. now all we have to do is somehow get this story to a first person, real time rpg where you could customize your party's combat behavior, that would be perfect."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,the best game i've ever played in my life. i suggest you look at their music.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,"this is my new favourite game of all time, a title that used to be held by ff7  you know how fan boys like me can be about ff7! i'm currently half way through my second playthrough with about 180 hours under my belt and already planning my third. must play!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-01,"sinceramente, un juego por turnos nunca debera valer 70. he visto juegos de navegador muy similares, no me parece innovador."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"i just created an account on metacritic for this game, to try and get the user review a bit higher, because this is simply the best game i have ever played by a significant margin. of course it is not perfect i am mainly talking about performance issues or shortcomings linked to the way the game works with npc aggro range or story elements, but this game is so far above everything i have seen to this day, it diserves more than a 10 in my opinion. the voice acting is out of this world and should redefine standards for years to come. what's more, the motion picture capture for every character makes the game feel so much more alive than any other, it feels impossible to play a rpg without this feature in the future. the difficulty curve is masterfuly crafted, and i was very surprised to find build defining items up until the very end of my playthrough, always taunting me to spend another hour to find the perfect build to include them all, and thus keeping me to the edge of my seat until the very end of a lenghty 120 hours first playthrough. the world you get to navigate in is so beautiful and true, ever changing and yet seemingly linked to your choices, in a flury of quests where you feel things could have truly gone other ways, where you feel your choices have true impact. the pricing of the game is so fair, without any microtransaction, it is simply an example to follow for any other. i cannot fathom how someone could chose to give this game less than a 1010. i strongly suggest everyone to play this masterpiece, and reward larian studio for what is an example to follow for years to come in the industry. thank you larian for showing that great video games can still be made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,hands down one of the best vide games i ever played!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,goty
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,i have dumped countless amounts of hours into this game. it is by far one of the best video games ever made. its unfortunate that other game studios refuse to follow in larian studios footsteps.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"wow, nicely done"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"pour le coup, je grimace parfois quand je dois acheter un jeu  60, parce que je me suis tellement fait escroquer par ea games  ubisoft  blizzard activision que maintenant je rflchis  2 fois avant de mettre une telle somme dans un jeu,  90 temps j'ai regrett... je me suis dis, je retente cette exprience avec bg3, tant pis le jeu avait l'air bien et j'en attendais rien perso, j'avais aim divinity 2 mais les mcaniques armure magie, armure physique a m'a gav, quand j'ai vu qu'il n'y avait pas a, dj a partait bienet bien aprs avoir fini bg3, j'ai pas regrett mon achat, et je pense que c'est le seul jeu qui a su lav ma frustration merci car j'ai senti que le jeu a t fait avec passion, avec attachement aux persos, que chaque dtail est  suis donc reparti sur une second run, peut tre mme une troisime, je ne sais pas encore mais je veux continuer ce jeu, il n' y a pas de fin pour moi"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"the best crpg i have played in a long time, the way it presents it's story cinematically hasn't been seen since the dragon age days and i've never seen a game react to and accommodate player actions like this one does. the world feels alive in a rare way. character and quest writing is superb, and turnbased combat is addicting and so much fun. highly replayable. only held back by significant bugs, crashes, and framerate issues."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"this is what all developers and game publishers should strive to make. insane play variety, amazing voice actors, you can basically do anything you want. you can fight using a salami, you can throw cats off clifs, you can do anything! this is the goty 2023 hands down. no game this year comes near."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"well thought out, beautiful to look at, deep interactive stories, and fun to play, you control everything and face whatever choices you make. what more could you ask for."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"a good game, but it's not for everyone, depends of what you expect is a masterpiece or boring and confusing, slow pasing, i just prefer games with a little more action and flow. but when i reach 70 hour mark, i was sold, i have 135 hours and it's amazing, but the start was rough, sorry."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,"overall a fantastic rpg, one of the best and deepest in years without question. yes, some stuff in act 3 needs refinement, but its nothing so severe that it detracts from the overall experience in a significant way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,"i overall absolutely adored this game. it is genuinely hard to pick out any flaws though there were a few small ones in terms of some gamebreaking glitches or frame issues. but other than that, it was an incredible experience, with the possibility of having so many more incredible experiences. thank you larian studios for such an incredible game! tgg  9.510 audio 1010 a beautiful soundtrack along with incredible sound effects. the combat feels so much more satisfying with the well thoughtout sound design, and the music in every area of the game and dialogue scene feels impactful and emotional. visuals 1010 beautiful environments and use of colour. i found myself just stopping and staring at the views for a few minutes, much to the annoyance of some of my friends. the magical effects in combat and the motion capture of the characters in the dialogue scenes were amazing! playability 910 the mechanics of the game are very easy to understand and are very smooth, with the choice of using mouse and keyboard or a controller. that is to say, there were a few minor issues with framerate, small glitches and one gamebreaking crash. all of which were patched very quickly! delivery 1010 amazing story with so many different ways of experiencing it. its a game that can be played over and over again with the sheer amount of detail in every single area . an s tier game through and through."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterclass in rpg and gaming in general . outstanding in everything. actual open world rpg's are full of , i don't want to look all the wolrd to find cosmetics hogwarts, jedi fallen order or survivor you want a rewarding exploration, even if you die trying to. this has elden ring, but this game is awesome in the liberty and how you face each challenge. every moment makes you think how you will appproach. and i'm sure i will not find all the secrets but each time i play i know that something interesting will happen and i will discover something. you just don't want to stop playing. i had 30 hours just in the firstsection of act 1 and enjoyed every minute. since witcher 3 didn't feel this type of excitement playing video games. i haven't finish yet and i don't want to."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-28,"bad game like the previous ones, without some cool cgs, but the game play is quite boring and tiring. i don't understand how it can be so acclaimed, i think wasteland 3 is much better."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-28,what an epic story. amazing ! it was my first experience with crpgs and i was really nerveus because i dont like turn based games but baldur's gate 3 broke it.. i finished game after 120 hours and probably ill play it again and again every year maybe many times..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-28,"a stellar experience in this day and age of lackluster games, larian at the top of their game and i followed it from the early access to now. a drop in quality in act 3 but what can you expect when there's so much choices and things to tie up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-28,"honestly i think this is one of the strongest games in a long time. the story is very handcrafted, the world is full of small details and hidden things. this is a rare game that rewards you for paying attention to story and your dialogue choices. i have never played a game for 100 hours and them immediately started replaying as a completely different character the moment i finished. it wont be everyones cup of tea, if you don't like turn base games or rpg you wont like this but for those who do you will be playing thsi game for ages"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,"melhor jogo que euj joguei, fds. confesso quem me desanimei quanto soube que o combate era por turnos, mas mordi minha lngua. simplesmente sensacional. no comeo as mecnicas podem ser um pouco complicadas, mas conforme tu vai pegando o jeito do jogo, tudo fica cada vez mais maravilhoso."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,"a beautiful and faithful dd campaign. gameplay is nearly exactly as tabletop play, and the writing is superb. some difficult challenges, but i've rarely had to resort to metagaming. if you are a dd fan or have played the previous 2, this is a mustplay."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,"most negative reviews i see are by people who don't enjoy turnbased games as a genre but still bought it anyway and are then mad they didn't like it. they could have saved the bucks. but i love this game. i'm already over 200h in and close to the final fight. there's even stuff i didn't do and will focus on in my next play through. lovely character writing, there are so many creative ways i won fights without actually fighting a lot since i play more for the rpstory than the challenge of battles. as a huge dragon age, roleplay and ttrpg fan i can recommend the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,i have already spent almost 500 hours in this game. i absolutely love baldurs gate 3!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,"un gran juego, muy completo y hecho con mucho cario, algo que se hecha muchsimo de menos en esta industria"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,es el perfecto juego de rol.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,best game ever
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,maybe the best game i've played so far in my life time both as a fan of games and as a person working in the industry. this game is a love letter to dd the epic story that people tell and merges it with larians tested and proven fun of their divinity mechanics. the developer has lead this project and released this game with massive amounts of integrity and amazing communication. larian is one of the few studios left people can still actively root for and support knowing they have a team that reflects their passion and love for the game. its insane how much content is packed in this game and how many variables they have taken into the account. i cant under state how much i love this game and what larian has made. i would easily purchased any additional dd adventures delivered in this way by larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,a true ode to dd and baldurs gate series
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-26,feature complete thank god no battle pass bs no random game breaking glitches matchmaking is seamless so much content
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,"so devs make only 1rst act as a variative dd story rpg but 2 act and 3 act are some kind of joke. 2 has very poor variations 3 looks like the alpha buildbugs, game design, tech issues etc i feel deceived by the developers because only 1 act is really wellmade next are outbalanced classes and buildscharisma op, disbalanced artifacts, low difficulty at midgamethere are 0 enemies that could impress you on level 12, and a lot of situations when you are searching some locations for some potato or silver ore or something like this. in 3 act you will be impressed by how silly is enemy ai."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,"wow, just wow. this was my first time ever playing a turnbased rpg and i didnt know anything about dd going into this. i usually play games like gta, fifa and shooters, so i did not expect to like or understand this game. i was wrong. the first hours were hard. i did not understand the fighting mechanics and i was close to giving up. as you can see from this review, i did not.. i decided to play a little bit more, and 2 hours turned into 5 hours, and 5 hours turned into 50 hours, and 50 hours to 100 hours. this is the best story i have ever experienced in a game. all the choices, mistakes and accomplishments matters and i am able to craft my own story. how is it even possible to make a game where there is a story line for ever possible outcome? i cant wrap my head around how much time and passion the developers must have put in to this. i played it for so long and did so many quests, but i still feel like i just scratched the surface of the game, and i am ready to play it again and do things differently. i usually never want to play the story from a singleplayer game more than once, but i feel like i can play this 5 more times and have completely different experiences and outcomes. i still dont understand half of it, and the game is hard, but that is just fine. there is so much to learn, so many more stories to experience. i finally understand why so many people like these type of games. 1010! btw, remember to backup save all the time! i learned that the hard way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,idk how my laptop can handle this... it's an amazing game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,one of the best rpgs of all time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,"just incredible gaming. loved every second of it, the quests, the lore and the characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,"goty for sure. this game is a slap on the face for every aaa publisherdev out there, it's disgusting what the likes of bobby kotick, andrew wilson et al. have done to this creative industry, and it's sad that we don't have more passion projects that put the players before the investors who are ripping everything that makes gaming good, out of gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,obra prima!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,"a great rpg with a lot of versatility in roleplay and combat, without microtransactions and just for 60. i do not care what other game developers telling. that's how great game should look like!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,i was giving this game 9 because of the bugs i faced but after i looked at the negative comments i decided to give it a 10. if there are 5 negative comments 4 of them is like turnbased is so boriiiing its baaaad and it is utmost ridiculous. why you bother with the game if you do not like turnbased game? and how can a person criticize a game in the matter of game's genre? will you start criticizing fps games with this game is so boring because it is fps game now?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,how people give this game negative review is just beyond me ... altho i have to say the game does fall off a bit after act 1
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,juego del ao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,very awesome
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"it's addictive. after 115 hours on 3 different playthroughs with different friend combinations and solo, i am still wrapping act 1."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"le jeu est tout simplement incroyable. je n'avais jamais jou  un jeu imprgn dans cet univers de donjons et dragons mais j'ai juste ador la proposition de larian. la direction artistique est magnifique et les zones trs jolies  explorer. pour ceux qui affectionnent les rpg offrant plthore de choix, ce jeu est fait pour vous. je me suis surpris  rejouer certaines squences et c'est juste fou de voir  quel point des dcisions pouvant paratre mineures  l'instant, aboutissent  des consquences tonnantes et trs diffrentes plus  dans l'aventure. que dire  propos de la narration qui est juste  couper le souffle. tant au niveau des possibilits qu' celui du doublage des acteurs notamment neil newbon qui joue la voix d'astarion ou devora wilde dans le rle de lae'zel. le gameplay au tour par tour peut surprendre au dbut c'est vrai mais une fois que l'on comprend la plupart des mcaniques, on ne voit plus le temps s'couler. alors oui, ce jeu n'est pas conu pour sduire tout le monde. il demande beaucoup d'investissement mais il en vaut largement la peine  mon humble avis. ct dfauts, honntement, il n'y a pas grand chose  relever. nanmoins, il faut s'accrocher les 10 premires heures de jeu car si vous ne connaissez pas du tout les rgles de dd ce qui tait mon cas, vous pourriez vous sentir frustr par certains combats et il est vrai que larian aurait pu selon moi, un peu plus expliquer certaines situations afin de moins galrer au dbut mais je pense qu'ils ne voulaient pas donner cette impression de trop assister les joueurs en les harcelant toutes les 2 minutes d'informations. pass ce cap, le jeu devient vraiment plaisant et la difficult normale demeure stimulante. juste  titre d'informations, vous passerez beaucoup de temps  visiter des lieux et ramasser des objets environ 50  vue de nez. l'autre moiti du temps de jeu sera consacr aux combats et aux cinmatiquesdiscussions avec des pnj je dirais. raison pour laquelle, je prcisais d'entre que bg3 reste un jeu qui ne plaira pas  toute la communaut mais si vous recherchez une exprience unique, vous devriez tenter le coup. je lui attribue la note de 10 car mme si je n'aime pas trop donner la note maximale, je trouve important de valoriser le travail d'un studio quand il est rellement bien fait. les belges de larian mritent amplement ce succs et je me rjouis des ventes actuelles qui semblent trs bonnes encore  l'heure actuelle.  mes yeux, on a clairement le futur goty. et si cela peut permettre de faire se rveiller quelques studios trop prompts  la paresse, et bien tant mieux si bg3, comme d'autres grands jeux, devient un de ces jeux rfrences aujourd'hui. si larian parvient  le faire alors je ne vois pas pourquoi bethesda, ubisoft, ea, rockstar games et tant d'autres ne peuvent plus suivre la cadence alors qu'ils ont infiniment plus de moyens. ah oui et j'oubliais, les musiques sont trs belles comme tout le reste de la bande son. si vous tes un fan de rpg, vous devez imprativement y jouer au moins une fois dans votre vie. au risque de passer  ct d'une exprience incomparable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,best rpg of all time!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"bg3 starts strong with impressive gameplay and narrative structure but completely falls off by the end. with features like a detailed character creation, dialogue choices and interactive companions, the game delivers crucial ingredients necessary for a successful rpg recipe. with such parallels, fans of older rpg titles will experience some fond nostalgia early on. however, most of the dialogue in bg3 is often lackluster and smarmy that ends up hurting the atmosphere and cheapening the experience. as the game progresses and i go through more quippy dialogue, i find myself comparing the written dialogue to games like dragon age origins where bg3 just pales in comparison. each act brings about an entirely different experience and level of enjoyment. act 1 really highlights the great polish combined with the freshness that gives it a very solid 910. duration was longer than expected but who cares when it is delivered well. act 2  dialogue and story falls off but the rpg gameplay elements continue to give a good sense of progression, especially when your character gets strong. wavering between 710 to 810 at this point. act 3  everything falls apart. terrible narrative, dialogue, pacing, and zero sense of character progression after hitting level cap. a very noticeable amount of performative inclusiveness which is usually like whatever, i get it  diversity might allow some to appreciate what the devs are trying to do, but the amount of it just eats into the immersion. in a world where githyanki culture and slavery exists, it is hard to believe that a city would be so overwhelmingly tolerant, harmonious and filled with girlbosses. most ending choices did not make sense and the amount of cut content was extremely abrupt to the experience when the narrative obviously does not flow. act 3 was a chore to play through, and the reward for completing it was a series of clumsy and unfulfilling endings. 5.510. i thought about giving the game a 6 since it is closer to my experience by the end but there are still other good qualities like a large playtime and a reasonable selling price. overall, a low 7 is a fair score."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"venturing once more into the world of baldurs gate 3 review has been an enthralling odyssey. with over 20 hours invested since our last exchange, i stand on the precipice of completing act 2. a chapter  in mystery and tinged with an eerie allure that has truly transformed the games  metamorphosis in tone and visual craftsmanship is striking, breathing new life into act 2 and setting it apart from its predecessor. the landscapes now cloaked in shadows exude a unique aura, offering challenges that diverge remarkably from the explorations of act , its the ingenious design of encounters that truly defines baldurs gate 3. each skirmish, a carefully woven tapestry of tactics and strategy, presents an artful blend of exasperation and exhilaration. its as if the encounter designers have mastered the orchestration of challenges that leave me simultaneously yearning for respite and craving more. read full review here baldursgate3review"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"this game is frankly unbelievable. a lot of people say that act 3 kind of ruins the experience, but when you look at act 3 without directly comparing it to acts 1 and 2, it is still leagues above the best content that most other modern games offer. this really feels like the next witcher 3 the next generationdefining rpg experience. it's been 8 years since witcher 3 and i doubt we'll see another game come close to bg3 for another 8 years. this may very well maintain its position as game of the decade, and that's not even to mention the frequent patches larian has been releasing as well as the community mod support."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,a groundbreaking rpg that raised the bar even higher than witcher 3 did.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"baldur's gate 3 is hands down my favorite game. it's immersive, the story is beautifully written, add in the characters and the insanely amazing voice acting. as all games do bg3 has some bugs and imperfections however the amount of time and passion that has been put into this game shines through in all aspects of this game. i'm on my 4th playthrough and i'm still enjoying it and exploring the expanse of choices you have and the impact it has on the world. it's fun to play solo and with friends and does feel like playing dd. honestly can't express how much i love this game and the excessively perfect casting for every character. such a joy to play!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"after the latest patch, it keeps crashing, fix your game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,muy bueno xd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"of all the games over the decades that had great replayability' label attached to them, this is the only one that i actually played again just to see what i missed.... and oh boy, i was so surprised how much content i missed on my first 140hr playthrough. the attention to detail is just unmatched by today's other aaa games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,baldurs gate 3 is one of the best games i have ever played and i have played alot of games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,best game i ever played
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,i literally made an account because this game is that good. highly recommending for any fans of rpgs in general.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,"at a time when big, rich studios carefully groom reviewers to award them overblown and unwarranted positive acclaim to what are dull and unspirited releases, along comes larian studios with a simply perfect rpg that blows the standards for what makes a great game out of the gaming waters. this is the best pc game i've played possibly ever. while the graphics and music are wonderful, it's the depth and breadth of bg3's content, it's tactical tenacity, and the way larian breathes life into virtually all of it's npcs that inspires a sense of wonder, adventure and life into this magnificent achievement. it stands so tall, in my estimation, beside everything else there is to offer out there today."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,just play it! dont doubt it! ive never played rpgs involving dice roll before and i was skeptical if id like such game. i bought it just cause the reviews were so good. now im almost hitting 200 hours playing it and theres still plenty of more wonders and adventures i cant wait to experience! just buy it now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,spettacolo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,baldur's gate 3 completely relieved my longstanding insensitivity to games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,the best rpg in the last 20 years. a masterpiece by fans for fans. time and thought was put behind every decision made.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,"baldur's gate 2 es lo mejor que he jugado en mi vida, y aunque bg3 no est exactamente en ese punto, s es un sucesor que roza la perfeccin en tantos y tantos apartados que ya se ha convertido en uno de los grandes, grandsimos videojuegos de la historia. as que s. 10 en narrativa, 10 en personajes emotivos y complejos como pocos, 10 en jugabilidad, 10 en epicidad... no dudes en comprarlo ni un instante."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,"no game is perfect, but there are some games that still deserve a 1010. this is one of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,"perhaps if it weren't turnbased, it could have been a masterpiece. battles take way too long. it's the most boring turnbased game i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,god game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,played until the goblin camp in act 1. found the fighting and leveling very unsatisfying. character classes didn't seem very distinct. the rogue basically acted like a squishy casterrange class just like the rest of the spellcasting group.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,best game in history
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,honesty to me top 5 games ever played. you can beat the game start a new game and still feels that you're playing it for first time there so much content.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,"melhor jogo rpg que j joguei e ainda por turnos, nunca gostei de jogos por turnos, mas bg3 fez um sistema por turnos muito bom mesmo que at quem no gosta gostar."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,probably the best rpg video game ever created.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"i made an accountjust to give this amazing game a 10, it has everythingyou want from and rpg and then some. do yourself a favour and buy it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,fantastic in a word 70hrs in first playthrough nearing the end of act 3 enjoyed it throughly redeemed my faith in games...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"this game is exactly what we imagined the gaming industry would become 30 years ago, and even more so, to be honest. it represents a muchneeded breath of fresh air amidst the cursed addiction that studios have to 'games as a service' or the idea of 'buy 500 dlcs.' not to mention gacha, which is a pocketdraining trap!gone are the days when games were complete and satisfying experiences right after purchase. the times when you unboxed your game, and the whole world unfolded before you, without microtransactions or content locked behind paywalls. baldur's gate 3 is a response to that nostalgia and a reminder that games can be a work of art in themselves, without the constant exploration of players'  game is truly impressive, from its technical choices to its creative ones. the quality is undeniable. i'm on my fifth journey through the game, and i still find myself surprised by new discoveries every time i play! it's an experience that never loses its charm.baldur's gate 3 offers a rich and complex narrative, memorable characters, and gameplay that challenges and engages the player. it's a breath of fresh air in a world of games that often seem to focus more on sales numbers than providing a genuinely captivating experience.this is the kind of game that reminds us why we fell in love with video games in the first place. a modern masterpiece that honors the roots of the rpg genre and leaves us eagerly anticipating the future of the series. baldur's gate 3 is a true treasure in the world of gaming and an example of what the industry could be if it prioritized quality over greed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"the game feels like the devs have actually cared for there craft,there is passion,struggle and hard work that can be sensed every second of the game,the story and the way to progress and engage in it is soo inovative yet very similar one of the best releases we have had in years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"one of my favourite games ever! wonderfully written characters, deep tactical combat, excellent voice acting, such varied gameplay possibilities. experienced a few bugs but nothing game breaking."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,rpg of the decade.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,baldur's gate 3 is one of the best rpg's i have played in the last years.i dont evan remember the last time when a game made me wann start again to see what will happen if i go left instead of right. 1010 must play!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"this is the best rgp i've played. i liked something more in pathfinder wotr, something was cool in divinity, but here it was implemented differently and definitely deserves 10 out of 10. of course, there are questions about act 3, there is not enough epic, the city is somehow too big, there are a lot of lags and no tensions within the city. after act 2 the temperature drops. i want to express my deep respect to the developers. for the first time in many years, developers are doing things for players and not for money."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"this game is everything i look for in a game. fantastic story, music, characters, liveinteracting world and the real gaming experience."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"ihave never written a game review, but i felt compelled to in this circumstance. baldur's gate 3 is an amazing game. it just absolutely  you in to the dungeons and dragons world. i keep seeing articles where other game developers are crying about bg3 being too good. unbelievable. instead if using the success of one of your peers to motivate you to meet the new standard, you whine that it's not fair. gamers constantly get tricked into buying games that are halfassed, and then milked for more money, via micro transactions. how dare you. i hope it hurts, that bg3 is as good as it is. i stead of crying, get better at your job."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,this is one of the best games i have played in years. i'm only about half way through and already thinking of my next play through. the story is excellent and game play mechanics are great. prior to playing this i had very little experience with dd and worried that i would not like the game. i will say there has been a bit of a learning curve for those aspects of the game but it has been totally worth it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,"o melhor jogo de rpg dd da vida, espero que todos os outros jogos que esto por vir, tenha como base o que bg3 entrega. no mac m2 pro, roda com grficos no ultra sem nenhum tipo de problema. historia cativante, arsenal de itens e  s sucesso. que ganhe o the game awards 2023 em todos as categorias"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,so boring can't play it....4 hours in falling asleep.... combat is so bad .... camera keeps zooming in and out can't see anything ... jogging so slow it's.  is there no sprint ??? trust me if fun gameplay is your thing avoid....this game is basically one big story book . if that's your thing go for it. graphics are great good music and interesting characters just pity gameplay itself is so bad it is unplayable for me wasted 80 bucks .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,simple the best game of 2023. perfect history. perfect gameplay. excelent graphics. no more.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,"the best computer roleplaying game ever made! immense game world, very fun game mechanics and combat, amazingly gripping and emotional story where your choices really do matter and change the story accordingly. replay value is incredible, as each choice you make changes the story in many different ways. different races and classes play totally different and each time you play a new character the game experience changes. it's like 20 different games in one! 60 euros for this masterpiece is an absolute bargain as i will be playing this game for years to come! everyone needs to play this, as baldur's gate iii sets a totally new standard for all future rpg's. 11 out of 10, absolutely remarkable and without a doubt the game of the year in 2023, and by a wide margin! maybe even the game of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,"from the moment i launched baldur's gate 3, it was clear that this wasn't just another gameit was an experience. while i don't typically gravitate towards games of this genre, something about bg3 gripped me, pulling me into its lush, intricate world. visually, it's a masterpiece. every frame feels like a meticulously crafted painting, breathing life into the rich lore of the forgotten realms. the character design, animation, and the sprawling, intricate world of faern have been crafted with such dedication, it feels like stepping into a living, breathing dd campaign. but it's not just the visuals that stand out. the storytelling is impeccable. choices matter, characters have depth, and the voice acting brings every dialogue and cutscene to life. this is a world filled with moral quandaries and challenging decisions, all set against a backdrop of political intrigue, magic, and mythical beasts. the gameplay itself, while complex for newcomers like myself, is rewarding once you get the hang of it. every skill, spell, and ability has its place, offering countless strategies to overcome the challenges ahead. larian studios have outdone themselves, seamlessly blending traditional tabletop mechanics with modern gaming innovation. even for someone who doesn't usually play games like these, baldur's gate 3 is an enthralling journey that has caught me, hook, line, and sinker. this isn't just a gameit's a testament to what modern rpgs can achieve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,wow what a masterpiece. absolutely amazing and lots of game here for a long play through. and perfect for multiple playthroughs with an amazing story
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"bg3 has faithfully recreated the experience of a 1990s era crpg. you drop a worthless lute, then spend hours searching for it. you travel to camp to rest only to be prohibited from returning to the game because somebody somewhere in camp wants to talk to you for no apparent reason. you are warned that progressing between areas will close off some open missions. which?? what you think you are cool for not telling people what the consequences of their actions are? this has more in common with wasteland 1988 than it does with divinity original sin 2. and play issues aside, it shows that dd 5e rules are really boring. how the heck is this mediocre and very annoying game scoring 96??? probably because the reviewers haven't played it for more than a couple of hours. rather than a step forward in rpg gaming, this is a massive step backwards in game reviewing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"it has been a very long time since i had a game running through my head all day. damnit i am a grown man with a job and still managed to put in 30 hours within a week. i find this game so spectacularly good, that i cannot even imagine why some people gave this a bad review. this one is going in my top 5 games ever, you know, those are the ones of which you cannot decide which one should receive the number 1 spot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"baldur's gate 3 is not worth of goty, it's worthy of gotdecade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,truly one of the most memorable games. im getting sentimental over various choices i have to make. kudos to larian for quickly fixing the cruel heartbreak at the end.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,excellent jeu depuis longtemps je n'avais pas dcouvert cela
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,the true representation of playing a dd games without the wait and arrangement of our busy schedules with drop in drop out mechanics now i find my self loosing time while playing this game in a way i havent felt since i was a child 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,one word goty
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"the best rpg of 2023 larian studios has demonstrated how to create a superb game in an era where many big companies primarily focus on profit, often neglecting the quality of their products. they frequently release games with subpar optimization and quality improvements, leaving players wanting more, on the other hand, has shown a commitment to quality and improvement by constructing a captivating narrative that rewards players for exploring diverse paths and objectives, whether they are related to the main plot or the characters in the story. while the game is not without its bugs, as no game is perfect, the developers are dedicated to addressing issues and enhancing gameplay. this dedication places baldur's gate 3 among the best games based on the dungeons  dragons tabletop rpg franchise."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,best game i have ever played. 1010 doesn't do it justice. such a complete game and larian have to be the best game developer for the players not the fat cats. great to see in a rng loot box and microtransaction era.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,i havent had so much fun since divinity original sin 2 larian really knows how to please rpgdd fans 200 hours played and my only complain is that it's too easy even on the tactician mode
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,juego gigantesco. es simplemente increble la cantidad de opciones que ofrece para los jugadores. es muy divertido.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"baldur's gate 3 offers compelling character development, balanced combat, and abundant dialogue options for diverse endings. it surprises with unexpected twists and a varied finale influenced by choices. however, its complexity may deter more casual rpg players. excessive wealth and limited spending options lessen the importance of currency. quest navigation lacks clear markers, and the level cap at 12 leaves the player longing for more character growth."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,game of the year
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"from the first day of ea, i have loved this game. since launch, i have played the game every chance i got and i simply don't want to stop."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,finally an epic game! i love it!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"this isnt a 1010 because its flawless, there are bugs and some mistake of course. but it is truly the best crpg in decades and is so much better than anyone even hoped it could be. i know it will be so much better after a few months of patches but it truly deserves the 10 right now even."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"baldursgate 3  a experincia definitiva de um rpg. o jogo  extremamente envolvente e imersivo. a larian studios criou uma obra prima. a quantidade de contedo nesse jogo  surreal. tudo tem sentido. cada canto que o jogador explora  recompensador. cada escolha gera consequncia. todas as misses secundrias tem propsitos. o combate  muito bem construdo, e as maneiras de agir em cada situaes so muitas. definitivamente o favorito a jogo do ano."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,game of the year 100
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,best rpg experience in the last decade atleast!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"one of the greatest games i have truly ever played. i do rate it a 1010 for how it is. however, i truly hope that larian studios gives act 3 the same treatment that they did for dos2. if there is a total rewrite of the final act with the same quality as their last major title, then i will be genuinly surprised if there will be a greater rpg than bg3 withing the next ten years. each and every playthough i have done, i have discovered something i missed. this game truly has enraptured me and the sheer effort put forth by larian studios to encompass as much of dd 5e as possible in a video game is something i habe never seen from a aaa studio. of course the main goal of making games is to sell and make the company money, but i personally feel that this studio has made providing an unforgettable experience to players to be a greater priory than sheer financial gain. the transparency that they have given in thiercommunity updates and acceptance of coding mistakes and bugs far outrivals any game company i've seen to date. i expect many more future great updates to bg3 and many more amazing titles to cone from larian studios. while there still are crashes and bugs in this game, the same can be said for every game in existence. therfore, i rate this a 1010 for how amazing this game is and how amazing the studio has been towards their players. other companies should take note on how to make a truly incredible game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,this is hands down the best game i've played in the last 20 years. i've loved every second of it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"i had been teetering on the edge of ok this is definitely in the top 5 games i have ever played. the more i played, the more it went up. ok, definitely in top 3. no, its now cemented itself as 1 best game i have ever played. larian gave so much attention and detail to the world and story that you can tell they really love what they do. they treated the world and characters with such respect that i cant recall seeing in recent memory. most times if its a revival of a old series  its a cash grab. not with them. they revived it because they loved it and the dark urge redemption is top tier what story telling should be in an rpg. every character you meet, you end up caring about in some way or form. i cant get over how much i love this game. i've played it 5 times, each time  i find something new."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"a 120 hr investment scared me off, but i am considering playing it again. it took me a while to get into this game. i attempted to play divinity original sin 2 and disco elysium and never finished those. there is this initial hill you need to get over and i would recommend using some guides. looking at some guides you realize how many different things can happen. know that i got comfortable with this game i may go back and play those other ones now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,you can lose yourself in this universe
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"even after more than a hundred of hours spent in faern, baldurs gate iii continues to offer another interesting story behind the next corner. after six years of work, larian seemed to have achieved what other developers rarely cant and even more wont do these days to create a truely unique experience with unlimited replay value that excells in design, gameplay and meticulously precise writing  no matter if you experience it on your own or with a party of friends and strangers. baldurs gate iii is not only a clear candidate for game of the year 2023, but also continues to define an entire generation of gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"certainly one of the best games i have ever played. it shows what is possible nowadays by combining the best of writing, voice acting, animation, game design etc. if there is enough money and a lot of heart."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"in a gaming landscape cluttered with microtransactions and uninspiring gameplay, this game stands out as a refreshing exception. with its captivating narrative, intricate worldbuilding, and replayability, baldur's gate 3 sets a new benchmark for what a toptier roleplaying game should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"best rpg i've ever played. a bit confusing at first if you're not familiar with dd, but i was never so frustrated i wanted to quit."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,"it's certainly a good and very mature game but not for me. the lame turnbased battles are just not my thing. in addition, the graphics are too oldfashioned and colourful for me. i returned it and now play starfield. it comes off much less well in the reviews, but is a lot more fun for me personally."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,one of the deepest games i've ever played. goty
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"i love this game. it is easily one of the best gaming experiences that i have had in my two decades of gaming. particularly, act 1 and act 2 were an absolute joy to play through. unfortunately, act 3 fails to provide a similar experience to the two previous ones. immediately upon starting act 3, i have faced numerous game breaking bugs. the act is plagued by massive fps drops, dialogue drops, texture loading problems, and broken quests. as much as it pains me to say, this is another game that was released at an unfinished state. larian created something amazing with this game, but we should not overlook the fact that the game is unfinished. this practice has become far too common among publishers nowadays. they deserve praise for what they have accomplished, but that does not absolve them from deserved criticism for putting out an unfinished game. due to the length of the game, many critics did not progress enough through the game to experience these major issues before giving it glowing reviews. hopefully, larian will fix act 3 soon."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"not a turn base fan, but this game made me stop playing the worst game on steam you know which and i am so addicted, you can do whatever you want with rich story this is the best game evermade."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,a once in a generation kind of game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"very good larian! larian has become the best rpg company in the market, after their great divinity original sin games. baldurs.gate 3 is another great game, with awesome maps, full of surprises and sense of humor. for me the worst is the music not bad, but not at the same level of the rest of the game, and also compared with the osts of the first two baldurs gate games and also the extras of the special itemsweapons, armors, etc, are not too much interesting, even in the best items i think it is because they dont want to overpower the characters, but lacks in interesting the people. apart of that, the game is really good, although for me, divinity original sin 2 is better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,this is the best game i ever played and it sets a newstandartof what should be expected for a triple a game. no season pass no ingame shop etc

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"best rpg, friends who never liked table top and hated it like with xcom. they love this game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"the game is crazy, i have tried to be cheeky and it was still part of the story without breaking immersion. i have done several playthroughs and i still end up finding new things, makes me wonder what more hidden content is there. overall it was a lot of fun, the story was a bit rushed at act3 but it was still very good, i am also extremely satisfied to have bought a game and got it in full."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"i very rarely purchased a game on release date. upon hearing the excitement that many criticsyoutuber shows, i decided that i will support the studio regardless by buying the game although historically i was never a crpg type of game player. and oh boy, this game didn't dissapoint. it's a masterpiece . i was never a crpg type of player. not because the lack of interest or effort. i did try playing pillars of eternity a few time, tyranny,divinity original sin. but none of those actually catch my interest long enough for me to invest in the game. most of the time, i lost interest in those games very quickly. either because lack of interest in the lore story or i could not get into the battle mechanic. bg 3 on the other hand, feels very welcoming for me. i fell in love with the character design even from character creation stage, and the story is very welcoming for someone new in this genre dnd. battles are not overwhelming, sure i died a few times at the beginning and have to reload here and there. but it was never overwhelming. even though when my party got wiped, the game gave me a peak of what i can do better. there were battles where i think oh man, i will never go through this battle, but somehow it encouraged me to keep trying a different approach to battles. and it's really exhilirating when one finally breakthrough the battle. it felt exactly like how from software games reward you for managing to finally beat their areabosses. and when it suddenly clicks for you, you will just admire larian as a studio and just fall in love with the game. for me, that moment is when i finally clear goblin camp in this game. i entered the area thinking how the fck am i going to clear this, and once i've beaten that area, this game has become my game of the year for 2023. and don't get me started with the attention to details that larian has invested for this. the npc designs, the quest designs, the story chef's kiss. goty contender for 2023."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,the best game i've ever played. there are some minor flaws especially in act 3 super slow texture loading and minor glitches that sometimes required from me to reload previous save but still comparing to how i enjoyed this game is still not enough to lower the score.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"closest you will get to your dream dnd campaign ever. act i and ii are amazing, in act iii it seems like the devs were finally overcome with an amount of possible outcomes, but i hope for a fixes. how do you know it's an amazing game? you save scum only to get character you like to survive because you could miss hisher story  also... it's hard to be good. also a note, some ppl seem to hate turnbased combat but imo it makes the game feel even more like dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"just a masterpiece. i love so much, that we have a couch coop at ps5. i am enjoying the game this way. all glitches that we have experienced earlier are fixed with a new patch. kudos to developers for hearing out the community and taking care of the game postrelease.after performance improvement, the game seems flawless in terms of both story and gameplay and deserves a pure 10!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,the 1st 10 hours was extremely frustrating and overwhelming and confusing but push through it. the hype is real for the game and at some point the greatness of the game  you in. story and gameplay are perfect but the camra movement is my only problem  some bugs with broken quest. overall the game is spectacular other than a few bugs but larian will iron them out.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,absolutely stunning. will play it for years to come.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"this game gives you the freedom to take the story the way you want, you can choose to do something or not and if you decide to do it you can choose several different ways of doing it, simply incredible, the best rpg game of the year for sure. 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"an absolute masterpiece. the story follows a typical adventure narrative, so there isn't much to elaborate on that aspect. however, every character undergoes their own unique development, which is intriguing, accompanied by numerous captivating side quests. the game also offers unparalleled freedom. players can progress in ways previously unimaginable. this depth in the storyline and the breadth of freedom does wane slightly in act 3. rumor has it that this is due to the game being unfinished, which is unfortunate. nonetheless, this is more than compensated for by the vastness of the baldur gate city. considering i've already invested nearly 120 hours by the end, adding even more content might have been a bit overwhelming. overall, it's a truly masterful experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"extremely good game mechanics which are recognizable if you play dungeons and dragons 5th edition, and managing to translate that into a wonderful video game experience. i cannot reccomend this game enough."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"i would give all 10 points, because the game is great, but bad ukrainian localization spoils the impression, so i give 7 points. p.s. i urge you to improve quality control, not to cancel ukrainian localization. if the game didn't have ukrainian language, i wouldn't have bought it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,the turnbased combat completely destroys immersion. most overrated game in years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,"bravo larian! what an experience. just hope that in time the performance will be more acceptable in the 2nd and 3rd act, right now is kinda busted and i'm waiting on a real fix to the problem so i can start another playtrough with my friends. i playing on a high end pc with 120fps average on ultra but a lot of times my game dips in to the 40s, i can't even imagine what people with consumer level hardware are experiencing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"not for me, the hype train has inflated the score beyond what this game deserves. i find the graphics to be decent, and ambient music suits the game, but these are better elsewhere. dnd is better played with friends. i find traversal, inventory management, combat to be dull. this is overrated, niche and doesn't deserve the acclaim. sorry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,master piece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"utterly fantastic. easily my favorite piece of entertainment media, hands down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,balders gate 3 is not just a game. it's an experience. one that can be an emotional roller coster depending on the route you take or character you romance. it is glitchy in some areas but larian is working on fixing them as soon as they are notified they are there. some of the party characters do have a more flushed out story then others but that's not necessarily a bad thing as for those characters it kinda works for them. it leaves us to interpret their story in our on way for our game. i love how even the smallest of choices can drastically change your route in the end game and how your romance partner acts and behaves with you.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"my benchmarks  visual 55  character 55  story 45  gameplay 55  music 55  voice acting 105 overall 4.85 set a new standard for rpg. potentially 55 and game of the decade if all of its kinks are fixed. the final act was a bit all over the place and undercooked at the time of writing this review, as well as poor performance on underpowered pc. despite this, the remaining part of the game is so well done and polished that it kind of doesn't matter."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"masterpiece of an rpg. feels like playing an actual dnd campaign. there are some bugs yes but nothing major and i'm sure they will be fixed. larian you have taken the turn based rpg genre to new heights for a second time. the writing, the world, the voice acting, all top tier."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,fantastic game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"the game that brought sexy back to western games...there are chicks in this game you will crush on and lust over. it's an experience that has been missing in games that were not japanese since the appearance of darth sarkesian in the gate wars. its so great to go on an adventure that takes you through a wirl wind on emotions just like bg2. i never though there would be a character as memorable as aarrie from bg2 , then i meet shadowheart from bg3"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"all i have to say is this game is amazing!!! best game i've played in a  time, the immersion and all the different possibilities is insane to me. the graphics are great, the story is great, i think the only thing i can say is the customization could be a tad bit better, as in you can't reconstruct your characters face, you have to puck from pre made faces and go from that. other then that game is perfect!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"i'm only on part 1 and i've become addicted to the point where my body is trying to fall asleep and my brain fights to stay awake. that right there is a mark   i don't even really like these turn based games. the learning curve is steep, but after a couple hours you quickly get a handle on it. the ps5controls were wonky at first but now i rifle through the menus very quickly. i do need to stop save scumming the game so much though to leave content for other characters story arcs. i'd give it a 10 if it weren't for me not being down with the game... i also don't have any clue as to how for i'm even into the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"the pinnacle of crpg, one of the best games of all time, masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,it is by far the best game in years and it deserves all the praise it gets. i was waiting for a game that would captivate me once again. haven't had that for a while now. until baldurs gate 3. this game is everything i wanted it to be and more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"baldur's gate 3 stands as a monumental achievement in the rpg genre. its vibrant world, from the bustling streets of baldur's gate to the enigmatic underdark, is alive with intricate stories and atmospheric details. the game masterfully weaves an unpredictable tale filled with moral dilemmas, bolstered by deep character interactions that make choices genuinely consequential. drawing from their experience with divinity original sin 2, larian melds classic dd mechanics with fresh combat innovations, creating tactically rich battles that feel distinct each time. the mesmerizing score and exemplary voice acting elevate every moment, making it evident that this is not just a game but a loving homage to dd enthusiasts. in essence, it's not just a game play, but an unforgettable journey, setting a gold standard for modern rpgs."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"i've been playing video games for well over 40 years, and this is by far the best rpg ever made. let me repeat that. the best rpg ever made. this game is like larian studio's love song to rpgs. you can tell this was so much more than just a game for them. act 1 of this game by itself would have warranted the price. act 2 and act 3 are like getting a buy 1, get 2 free expansions. while technically, yes, there are still some nongame breaking bugs, they are easily overlooked because of the sheer depth and breadth this team implemented. i've got 542 hours played in the game so far, and i'm getting ready to sit down and start another play through. so many variations to try and enjoy. choices matter. thank you sven!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"i bought bg3 in ea last year and played most of act i. since its release, i've spent hundreds of hours in this world and have found countless activities, plot lines, and characters to get lost in. the turnbased strategy of the game was a huge seller for me. i also got to dip my feet into the world of dd which i have never experienced before. i haven't played a game that was this immersive for me since skyrim. thank you, larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,half baked story and endings. rather play dragon age or the originalbg games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"i'm not usually a fan of these games, but i've really been enjoying my time with this and all the different possibilities and chat dialogue and just all the stuff you can do if you so chose !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"very well made game. you can tell, the devs had passion for their game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,best game i've played in a while. i never thought i even like this type of game but it still blew my mind away how good it is.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"the perfect dnd game, i'm addicted to it already after 10 hours. the story telling in this game exceeds many else. full of content and side quests' were amazing. i would score 1110"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"e jogvel com os amigos, fora isso no  grande coisa."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"believe the hype. it takes a little to get used to how the game operates like maybe 12 hours, but once you're comfortable with the mechanics it quickly turns into one of the best rpgs ever made. there are so many fun surprises, amazing characters, and varied ways to complete any quests that i don't think anyone will ever play bg3 the exact same way as someone else."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,un chef duvre tout simplement
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"one of the best games i have played throughout my life. truley a successor to it's previous installments, and outshines other isometric tabletoporiented rpgs. to keep it short, if you were looking for a dungeons  dragons game, this is the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,too many bugs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"many companies claim player choice matters. so often it is an empty platitude designed to sell copies, but really things are on rails. bg3 is an achievement of choice. between opportunities for failure, true evil playthroughs, talking your way out of situations, speaking with dead, animals, and interactions with the environment you have more freedom than any crpg before. the story, music, combat is great! it feels like an actual tabletop game of dd. amazing game easy 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,great game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"this should be the goty, a love letter from larian studios to the fans. this is the proper and correct way a game should be made completed, without any microtransactions and with as few bugs as possible. really complete game with many, many paths to follow and many ways to play it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,everything is perfect even the flaws in my language we say jdf jeu de fou  crazy game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"es el juego mas trabajado que he jugado nunca, la libertad de elecciones que tienes esta vez de verdad, no como en assasin's creed, la capacidad de actuar como quieras en medio de un combate, la programacin interna del videojuego de afrontar la aleatoriedad ya sea que mates a cualquier personaje, o que varios personas medianamente importantes mueran en batalla es asombrosa. no encontraras 2 partidas iguales de bg3, jams pens que se podra llevar acabo un juego de rol con una historia inmensa y tan bien hecho. sin duda bd3, es un ejemplo a seguir en la industria y deberamos pedir videojuegos asi de completos, hacia tiempo que no senta esta sensacin de estar jugando a algo serio y adulto, normalmente esta industria te recuerda en cada saga que debes apretar x botones, seguir x ruta y simplemente observar la pantalla."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"i went in with medium expectations after trying it in early access. after 1 hour, i was completely hooked. now, after 70h, i finished my first playthrough. it was amazing. i don't often do many playthroughs, so for many that's enough. however, there are so many things that i know that i didn't see. if you like dnd especially the newer version 5e, this game is that 100."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"simply one of the best rpgs ever. the combat system can be a little complicated for people who have never had anything to do with the world of dd like me, but don't worry because the game introduces the game mechanics quite well in any case if you don't understand something there are always guides on yt. while for the story the game offers thousands of lines of dialogue, all different from each other and therefore each run will be different from the previous one. you can literally do whatever you want and the game really rewards lateral thinking. and the lore is nothing short of fantastic. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"i wish the writing in act 3 was a bit tighter. inventory management is kind of tedious because there's so many consumables that you need to split among your party. there's too many characters in the game and i can't bring myself to care about them all. but hey on the flipside i found myself doing every side quest. when i had an hour or two of free time i would start up the game to do merchant runs and manage my inventory. and i exhausted all the dialogue options. the game had me completely engrossed. the characters are great, and the core gameplay is extremely fun and varied. not quite xcom but very very good. there's so many ways to approach every quest, it really makes me want to start a second run, to see how different things could have turned out. and try different party compositions. go wild with multiclassing. hm... i think i'll hop into the game right now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"masterpiece, everything i've ever wanted in an rpg and more. all the plotlines are interesting and engaging, the main characters all have their own subplots which are tied to the main themes. the level of detail of relatable and appropriate loredetail throughout the world is insane,idont think i've ever been as engrossed in a game world as this. i am a lifelong, heavy gamer and i will contend that this is the best game ever made, knocking larian's previous game divinity original sin 2 off of my top spot. the turnbased battles are far more engaging than most action rpg combat and way more strategic and interesting than any rtwp title. larian, you have ascended to the top of gaming, and rightfully so."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,what an amazing game. thank you.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"act 1 is 1010 but after that the game is kindof barely holding on. i think in a year or two once larian releases the definitive edition this will be a 1010 game. the writing isn't amazing, but it's good enough, the voice acting is inconsistent but nails the important moments and the storylines that weren't clearly rushed or bugged are satisfying. the small flaws are all more than made up for how much freedom this game offers in what you can do. there's basically nothing else like it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"it's a great game. most fun i have had in a long time on a video game. movement can be a bit clunky, but that's my only real isssue."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"simplemente maravilloso, un juego que te debes de jugar por lo menos una vez en tu vida."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"considering all the options you can make in the game, the unique ways spells and actions can interact, all the decisions that affect your party members and side characters, the various endings you can get, the level of detail put into each area, the quality of va workwritingmotion captureexpressions, and the sheer level of customization and personalization for any class you run, this game deserves every accolade it's gotten so far. there are some issues with bugs on pc that are regularly getting ironed out, and the game does have some content cut, but that content will be restored in upcoming major patches. larian has outdone themselves this time around, and baldur's gate 3 may very well be the best game of this year, and definitely one of the best games of this decade. i don't believe in 10 scores representing perfection they signify being the best in their category and what they offer. that's why this game is a 1010, and there's so much you can quantify that supports that. get this game. now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,its legend
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,the game that makes you think of your next 10 playtroughs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"good game, but definitely not a perfect 100100, both bg2 and dinivity 2 were better. gameplay is great, really got a nice dnd feel and character customization is awesome. mind need a bit more rebalancing. art direction is cool, though nothing special or new about it....just the samey fantasy type as most games. music is okayish ambiance is great, but combat tracks kinda meah story is the biggest dissapointment for me,not that it's a terrible story per se, but just predictable, cheesy, feels too much like a rom com or a fan fiction,had to quite the game 3 times because it got too cringy. gets worse as you go towards the ending of the story. since the early access the community essentially tested act 1 and it's almost bug free, but act 2 and 3 are really telling that was larian on their own so it got a lot of issues, hopefully they fix them though. story not really fixable for me, but others seem to enjoy it more, but adding some more to the ending will probably make everyone happier i think."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"bg3 gave me the opportunity to play dd on my pc. unlike others games in the crpg category, this masterpiece makes you fall in love with the party, the gameplay, de ost and the lore of the game. explendid. my fav of all time. yes, i had to leave bloodborne in 2nd place."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"besides a slightly lacklustre ending and a few too many bugs throughout, baldurs gate is a near perfect rpg experience with some of the best written characters in all of gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,higher rating is possible but act 3 really falls short and just doesn't really work.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,espectacular game work of art
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,work of art.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"goty material through and through. honest gaming with no bs, easy to run on most pc, visually stunning, simple yet complex mechanics, easy for newcomers to dd and generally a worthy successor to the epic series of baldur's gate. minor gripe is that the character should have voiced lines and that i really hate mindflayers in any dd setting..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"amazing tactical gameplay, great freedom of choice, awesome rpg elements. excellent characters, voice acting and cinematics. a great story, with good graphics, and hours upon hours of content that is all of high quality. great replayability, you can play solo or with friends and approach things so many different ways. goy2023"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,definitely game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"the sheer amount of things you can do in this game is staggering. tons of replay value, so many creative interactions with the mechanics of this game, and a good story full of stellar characters. theres truly something for almost any kind of gamer inbg3!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterwork of cinematic storytelling with compelling, deep characters, uniquely crafted tactical encounters and a new secret behind every nook and cranny. but the most fascinating thing is, how many options you as a player have in solving quests or handling conflicts, making every runthrough an impressively unique and memorable experience. there is no filler in this game, every sentence feels impactful and important, every quest feels fresh and intriguing, every item you get has it's place in a build you just have to try. baldur's gate 3  the borders of what we thought to have been possible in rpgs and videogames in general, and this seemingly with ease. i don't think we will see a game like this in many many years, if ever. just be aware, i don't know a single person that started this game and didn't get lost in it. you will not be able to stop playing once you started. so make sure you only start the game if you truly have the time to spare."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,larian studios has created a crpg that will be the bench mark for years to come. never has a crpg encapsulated the soul of non linear gameplay so elegantly.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"registered just to give a rate to this fascinating game. its marvelous in a different ways thats why i was cofounded when first played it. creators, developers, actors and all people who took action in making this game put their souls into this project. i really want to express my gratitude towards these talented and dedicated people. thank you for your hard work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"it's a 10. was never a fan of crpg games, yet this gem kept me playing for 150 hours and still going. there's some strange magic going on where i actually care about charactersstories unlike other rpgs of recent years. and all small things suddenly matter instead being a filler. was worried about the turn based combat, but it turned out really great and am enjoying it currently. if this game doesn't win goty then something is wrong with the industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,this will go down in gaming history as one of the greats. here's to larian making such bangers for years to come!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"despite some bugs, especially in act 3 and a few unfinished questlines, this game is a masterpiece and will hopefully pave the way for future games. here, we finally have a truly great rpg that actually feels like an rpg, where players can make decisions freely. your choices finally carry weight and meaning, unlike in other games. outstanding achievement."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"if we are fortunate, then once a year, we may stumble across a game of such incredible charm and design, that you cannot help but fall in love. furthermore, you curse yourself that you cannot simply forget the memory to experience it all over again. baldur's gate 3 is a triumph of gaming. the dialogue, story, music, combat, choices, and ui have all been distilled to provide a seamless and unforgettable experience. after playing this game, you cannot help but compare it to all others that come after it. my first playthrough was over 205 hours and i have only three gripes with the game. the first is that the epilogue should be more fleshed out, that is given more content if this game is not going to get an expansion. the second is that the ending fight sequences should be much longer, that is more bosses and more fights. there were 2 major fights in the ending, but i would prefer if they expand upon it. the third is that even though most aspects of the ui are extremely aesthetic, the party loot system is incredibly cumbersome. out of my 205 hours of playthrough, 10  20 hours must have been figuring out the party loot. there should be an opinion to check the whole party loot at camp at once, and to dismisssummon companions faster. overall, there are very few things in this game that i dislike. you can feel the passion, energy, and love that the game has been crafted with. truly, the work of a sublime master gamecrafters. if i can create a wishlist for this game, then first it would be for two expansions 1 level 13  16 expansion 1 and level 17  20 expansion 2. if anyone can pull it off it would be larian. 2 custom campaign editors i would love to host custommade campaigns and play previous baldurs gate games on this game engine. 3 higher difficulty unfortunately this is something larian needs to work on a bit. apart from a few bosses, most fights are trivial in the mid to late game. i hope they truly spruce up the challenge in new ways and also add more enemies. 4 ironmanhonor mode one save for all the savescumhating masochists. pointwise breakdown of baldurs gate 3 level designenvironment 95 musicsound fx 95 storychoices 100 graphics 95 gameplay 100 uiux 90 difficulty 60 content 100 120 hours for casuals, 175 hours for completionists microtransactions nil i know right!! mindflayed!!!!! total 99100 sublime. as close to perfection as it can get. divine acclaim!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,excellent.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"you can tell the developers put their heart and souls into this game. in the beginning it is a bit overwhelming, but keep in mind this is a dungeons and dragons game. meaning go explore and talk to folks. blows my mind the amount of different, well acting voices you hear in this game. the game did have some bugs here and there, but this was when it just released and i see that the developers are still hard at work patching the game. one of the best games to come out in a long time and hope to see more games like this from every aaa developer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"it has everything an rpg should have. simply love the game and the game values players time! no subs, no online play unless you want to party up etc. full freedom"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"one of the best games i have played in a long while. i spent a lot of time with xcom and dos2 so i already like these kind of games. but the story, the quality of the voice acting and the replayability really set this one apart from similar games. my first playthrough took me roughly 160 hours and i am currently playing my second one."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,incredible game! so many loveable characters that are beautifully acted. it's like a grand endless interactive movie that can be replayed over and over again with new results every time. after a couple playthroughs i recommend a difficulty mod combined with a party size mod for added chaos and hilarious party banter.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"este juego ya tiene lugar como el segundo mejor juego en mi corazn. cuando empeze el juego y conoc a shadowheart decid ir por el romance con ella y no me arrepiento, pero creo que karlach me enamoro y la pienso conquistar en mi prximo personaje. los personaje secundarios son divertidos y interesantes con la personalidad de astorian siendo la mas interesante con sus reacciones y comentarios me hicieron rer en voz alto y estn bien elaborados con sus historias personales. lo unico que no me gusta del juego es lo faciel que es el romance entre los personajes masculinos cuando intentaba ser amistoso y llevarme bien con ellos por ejemplo con wyll hay una escena donde terminas bailando con el y cuando lo rechazo se va triste y decepcionado y me doli mas de lo que me esperaba porque me cae bien, pero todo eso no cambia lo mucho que amo este juego."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"an actual rpg where choices really do matter. amazing story. interesting characters. phenomenal voice acting and animations. it's mindblowing that an rpg of this scale with so many possible scenarios has cutscenes and animated dialogue. exceptionally wellwritten and performed music. very fun gameplay. great amount of quests and enjoyable bosses. high replayability. a game brimming with passion, love, and magic. extraordinarily good."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"baldur's gate is an amazing game with really amazing characters and a world. i wasn't a big fan of turnbased crpg until now. aside from pc performance in act 3 and few crashes i did not find major bugs or issues. it took almost 120 hours to finish the game and almost all quests were well designed, felt organic and handcrafted and the story was truly amazing. the ending that i got was really satisfying. this game remains with all the legendary games like witcher 3, rdr2 and elden ring. this year's 2023 goty for me. truly amazing creation from larian! 9.510 from me"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"some pros and cons for those who don't want to read huge elaborate. starting with pros  game is really enjoyable when you play with your friends mostly because of roleplaying stuff. character creation is complex and enjoyable. every single action counts and shapes your world. when it comes to cons  this game is just a buggy mess from the start to end and i'm not even talking about small bugs graphics glitches etc. but about gamebreaking ones like need for duing a quick save load f8 because of boss reward bug. camera is working very poorly especially in closed areas like caves. fights are boring because ai is taking a lot of time to do it's actions and if there is nothing to do it lags a lot for example monster cannot strike you but he waits 1015 seconds and skips turn. pathing of your team members is really bad, especially when they need to jump a lot. i found myself ungroupping them and moving one by one because of indivitualities lagging behind. political propaganda was injected into the game and i'm not talking about relations between your character and the others, it's about main story..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,the best game ever
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,probably the best thing i've played this year. a huge development compared to the previous larian project. also many thanks for the ukrainian localization.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"a must play for dd and rpg lovers all around, very little in the way of shortcomings with a very deep level of variety found across the entire game. the game is very easy to get lost in and with the content and options on offer that can span multiple playthroughs it is the best value for money this year. while the game may offer a little less than expected in the way of a ending it should not be looked down upon for this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,a masterpiece that every gamer should play not just an rpgs fan.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"i played baldur's gate 3 with a certain degree of skepticism towards turnbased combat, a type of combat i hadn't particularly warmed up to in the past. however, this game managed to make me fall in love with this mechanic. nevertheless, i must admit that some battles can become excessively lengthy, to the point where i found myself getting up from my chair and doing other things while the enemies took their turns.baldur's gate 3 boasts an incredibly engaging storyline with a wide range of choices that influence the course of the narrative. unfortunately, this narrative flexibility loses some momentum towards the end of the game, but it remains a strong point. the allies and origin characters in the game are all fascinating and distinct, integrating well into the game world. the only aspect that feels less immersive is your own character, who, due to the choice not to voice all the dialogue lines likely to expedite development, can sometimes make the player feel like an outsider in the game world. however, it's important to note that this is a common issue in games with a customizable protagonist. for this reason, i recommend selecting the dark urge origin at the beginning of the game to have a better integration into the plot and the overall  conclusion. baldur's gate 3 has proven to be one of the best rpgs and games in general that i've ever played. with a gripping story, a vast array of choices, captivating characters, and turnbased combat that pleasantly surprised me, it's a remarkable gaming experience. i can confidently say it's the best game i've played this year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"this game is a must play for any fantasy lovers, who enjoy a good story with captivating characters. ive spent more than 200 hours playing this game and i simply want to keep playing  the replayability is insane. your choices make a real difference  what would happen if you went evil instead of good? what would happened if you got involved with the mage instead of the vampire? so many possibilities and if you are someone who enjoys games, youll definitely enjoy baldurs gate 3."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"here's my impression of baldur's gate 3 after over 240 hours playing. i would rate the game 9.910. would i recommend this game to friends and family? yes! would i replay the game? absolutely. in a nutshell, the game is very fun to play and never gets old, because there are tons of content, and every gameplay is different from the last. here's my take. likes  i seldom played turn based combat, and usually shy away from this kind of system, but this is easy and intuitive gameplay even if you don't know anything about dnd or it's rules. it's all transparent to the player, as it should be. as it turns out, gameplay is super fun!  every decision you make in the game matters, and you can do whatever you want in the game.  amazing character creation, you can literally spend hours in cc alone.  amazing soundtrack and cinematics.  nudity and diversity in character choices.  the city of baldur's gate is an actual city with multiple layers  a ton of content, even on my 3rd playthrough i'm discovering quests and scenes i didn't know existed.  feature complete, no microtransaction, no battlepass, it's perfect!  multiple ways to play your character, you can choose to be good or evil and anything in between. you can play as origin characters even, or something darker. game mechanics allows you to do almost anything you can think of. dislike  act 3 is slightly unpolished compared to act 1 and 2"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"u can tell this game took years  years to make  the level of quality is unmatched in todays games, it gives the player choice  the replay value is absolutely nuts, i usually dont review games, but this game is great, definitely will go down as one of the best turn based rpgs ever made, its the type of game where each time you play, each mission, is exciting  fresh  thats unheard of in this day an age, i cant find a fault, other then it maybe to deep, but you can get as wet as you want, 10 out of 10 easily."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"undoubtedly, the game of the year in my heart!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,a genuinely great sequel to probably the best rpgs ever made. as a long time fan of bg12 i was really worried about game and what it would mean as a sequel but i can honestly say that it has turned out to be the best version of a sequel to a story i considered finished. the style of play is turn based so takes some time to get used to but i started on casual to learn the ropes and i love it. definitely a contender for goty 2023
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"act 1 is one of the best in gaming nowadays. act 2 is ok, but act 3 drops the ball hard in comparison to last acts. most of the problems with this game that reduce its score for me is that its ridden with bugs, bad combat design, and story half baked after act 1. in comparison, in act 1 there are many battles that any player can use anything at their disposal, but in act 3, where the epic combats happens when fighting the 4 last bosses? in giant 1plane rooms with nothing more than the boss, and some minions.exactly the boring 3x3 room combat that is a sin in dd tabletop dming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"in just a few hours of gameplay, baldur's gate 3 has completely captivated me. as i progress, i uncover deeper layers and details that only heighten my enthusiasm. this game is quickly becoming one of my alltime favorites. the magic of its story and mechanics never ceases to amaze. highly recommended!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"it is literally they best rpg to release in modern times. decisions matter, exploration is rewarding, and most of all everything feels handcrafted. the encounters and environs aren't just procedural filler or copy and pasted assets populated with random respawning enemies. it has the cumbersome baggage that crpgs tend to all come with in terms of controls, ui, and inventory, but bottom line, its just a blast to play and get lost in. it it's just so good, period."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"too easy on tactician mode. im not wellversed in bg3s mechanics or how larian studios ls has done things with their past games regarding combat yet, im destroying it on tactician mode. create water  lightning bolt, much? hundreds of scrolls and potions in my inventory, much? i cant imagine how mindnumbingly dull the lower difficulties are. the user interface ui is clunky, sometimes unresponsive, and glitchy. you get scrolls and potions up the ss, but theres no autostack feature? are you kidding? i need to take a 10minute coffee break to sort through all the crap in my inventory. ill select a party members portrait, hear a click, but it doesnt switch over. i'll have a character selected in the merchant menu, highlight a weapon from the merchant, and then the weapon will be compared to a weapon from a different party member. then ill rehighlight the same weapon and it'll compare it to my selected party member's weapon. are you using dice rolls for the ui? according to morte from planescape torment pt, tieflings are oftentimes addled or have a mean streak through them because they're a mix between a human and a fiend. fiends are evil creatures from the lower planes. all of this was reflected in pts world. in bg3, they're just furries. and that goes for the rest of the nonhuman npcs except for creatures like goblins and ogres. different species with different alignments and behaviors is a big deal in the forgotten realms, and some of these species dont like each other. how did you mess that up? you never watched lord of the rings? you dont remember how dwarves and elves didnt like each other? tolkiens work and the forgotten realms are two different things, but ive made my point. sexually degenerate content. in bg2 and pt there's sxualromance content, but it was done tastefully. these games relied more on innuendo and colorful language as opposed to hitting the player over the head with, hey, wanna go to a secluded area and f?, after knowing them for only a day. also, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but most of your customers are straight men. we dont want hmosxual npcs badgering us for sx. its weird. the people who post on your forum about romancing astarion are in the minority, just like theyre a minority in the general population. too many female fightersbarbarians and too many females in leadership positions without good reason. human women in the forgotten realms are no different from women in the real world, which means theyre much smaller and weaker than men. therefore, a regiment of female soldiers in heavy armor wielding great swords looks stupid. it looks as stupid as if there were an allchildren regiment of soldiers wearing heavy armor and wielding great swords. im not saying there shouldnt be any because there are always exceptions however, when i see a group of flaming fists it shouldnt be 50 male and 50 female or 2575, favoring females. under normal circumstances, no sane civilization would create a 50 male and 50 female military because theres this thing called chivalry and another thing called biology. men by nature want to protect women, and women by nature want to be protected by men. thats chivalry. one woman can have around 15 children in a lifetime by one or many men the number of children a civilization can produce will only go up if the number of females goes up. thats biology. consequently, it makes absolutely no sense for a civilization to send women to the battlefield. doing so weakens the military and the future of the civilization. as for leadership, in the real world most leaders are men because men have more testosterone. testosterone makes you bigger, stronger, and more confident, which inspires others to follow. do you think ketheric thule would be as cool as he is if he were a 52 female with a highpitched voice? when i see a 52 female npc barking out orders to 62 chads in a voice that shes obviously trying to deepen through inflection, because shes aware of her physical inadequacy, i cringe. only people who have grown up sitting in front of netflix can take this kind of thing seriously. stop letting your human resource department control your artistic vision. why do many of the dwarves, gnomes, and elves have the facial features of races found in human beings? they're an entirely different species. this feature makes as much sense as having a cat with an african natives facial features or a human that looks like a duergar. this only makes sense with halfelves, tieflings, and halforcs because they're mixed with humans who may have looked african, asian, etc. elves, dwarves, and gnomes arent humans. theyre humanoid. humanoid means they have two arms, two legs, two eyes, a face, etc., and not that theyre human. thats why the human option is separate in character creation."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,the crpg of the decade. highly recommend. rise the game development standard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,an amazing rpg that should be the new gold standard for the genre moving forward
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,what kind of gameplay is this ? this is such an boring game. it s allmost strategy game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"great game, i love cutscenes, and story. i like this tactical turn based combat playstyle, it suits me, with complexity similar to battle brothers. also romance with shadowheart is dream come true, i wish i would met such a lovely and sweet woman."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"it's a good rpg and a true successor of baldurs gate and the divinity series. the downside of this game is, that there is nothing really new. the story is good, but typical, straight out of stranger things you might say. the game is not so good as everyone says though. there are some story branches that are basically dead, not everything you think should work actually works, its quiet limited actually. it has graphic glitches and a simplified game world. there is no replayability but trying other story branches or characters. it's strength is the story when played as intended. it has quiet a lot choices for a story tunnel game, that are interesting. especially when you decide to leave the path by not doing certain quests at all or killing characters instead of take one of the two to three given choices the game usually allows it, but the story is just over, everyone around it reacts not really realistic. it's like divinity, its like baldurs gate i  ii. it's not much more, it's just that. which are amazing games, but a little disappointing for the new 2023 ultimate version of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,you can kick squirrels and throw children into the abyss... what more could you ask for?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"i spent 250 hours playing through the main quest and 6 origin character quests using a wizard build. not my first larian game, and certainly not my first crpg, turn based outing. i was blown sideways by the inventiveness, the production quality, the attention to detail, the fun and the originality. i hadn't played anything from the dd stable before, and so the dice rolls were a bit strange to begin with, but i ended up loving the wee extra thrill they gave. just started my second playthrough, and even just a couple of hours in i'm seeing things i never saw before. such depth, such care taken. it even has a fantastic controller implementation for those of us who like that. absolutely game of the year for me and yes, i have played starfield."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"i want to start by saying that i havent played any other baldurs gate games. i had played very little of divinity original sin 2 and that was all of my exposure to larian studios. i honestly have been blown away by this game! the story, the characters, the world, the sound and graphics design, the gameplayeverything is on another level. this is easily the most complete rpg game i have ever played. the freedom you have to literally play the way you want and do whatever and however you want is amazing! i have never seen anything like it. i would recommend this game anytime to anyone. i am not even an rpg fan and i love every minute of it. the only gripe i have with the game is the performance in the baldurs gate city. it is bad. the gpu utilization drops in the 50s and it isnt pleasant, i hope larian can address it with future patches. speaking of patches, they have released 5 or 6 already and have addressed a lot of issues. good job guys. overall, this is an amazing game and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a proper, completed, feature rich rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"breathtaking, true rpg, true diamond and masterpiece, this game has everything and just perfect."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"first of all let me say that i am a huge nerd and love playing pen and papers mostly dsa and dnd 5e. and pen and papers are usually most fun when the players get really creative or go completely of the rails or both. seeing how that is the most fun aspect to me i greatly enjoyed the freedom the game granted the player. on my first playthrough i played as a bard who was somewhat mischievous but ultimately good for the most part. i was surprised when i found out that i could finish some bosses of by simply doing what bards do best. talk  and trick people into doing your bidding. i was stunned. i finished the game and was really happy with it for the most part. then i started a second playthrough with a mate of mine. we played as people who usually did what was best for them but who ultimately weren't evil and i was stunned how different not only the story but the world itself were. so obviously we had to also play an evil campaign. most fun one in my humble opinion. i like just how much freedom i had in the way i approached pretty much anything. and it didn't feel like the devs just hadn't thought of what i did but rather that they were prepared for pretty much anything. i don't feel like i caught the game of guard once. i gotta admit that even though the first and second act were phenomenal i experienced some bugs in the third act. the story also felt like it lost some steam. but ultimately when i ask myself what i would want from a dnd videogame, this is exactly what i would want. add to that that there are no microtransactions, no season pass and no other bull like that and i can confidently recommend this game to any dnd and rpg fans. this game is for sure game of the year if not game of the decade contender. tldr is it perfect? no not at all. is it fun? hell yeah. do i recommend it? you bet your sweet bippy i do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,very polished modern masterpiece! movement took a bit to get used to but seriously what games should be. not just fantasy games but madden etc. the stuff you used to be able to do in gsmes. no monetization.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"one of the best game ever made. i'll buy 5 copies and any dlc or anything they want. just to support good game developers like this one. if your on the fence, buy it, kick back and just play it whatever way you want. you're in for a treat! enjoy definitely goty"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game was extremely buggy on release, with corrupted saves and game breaking quests ruining my experience. it is an enormous rpg that is far too big, with at least half the quests and places of interest being average to below average. the game would have been far better if they trimmed 30 of the weakest quests and tightened the game significantly. there is a huge amount of filler in the form of books, quests, npc's and unnecessary dialogue. for example, you walk into a pub and there are 15 npc's standing or walking about. you have to talk to every single one because one or two of them will either give you a quest or will be required for a quest, but at least half the time the game will not indicate if an npc is important or not. so you talk to each npc in turn and 90 of them have absolutely nothing interesting, important or useful to say. but each one forces you into a cutsceneesque dialogue which wastes loads of time and completely takes you out of your immersion. also the combat, while decent, takes absolutely forever with 50 monsters each taking 20 seconds per individual turn, making you watch monsters glitch about for at least 5 hours per turn before you get to move. the game has countless problems like this and they only serve to waste your time. wait at least 2 years until mods and updates have fixed all the issues, then play this game, for a much better experience. however, understand that even with all the problems fixed it will only be an 8 at best because of all the filler and averageweak quests."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"i enjoying this game so much and i was not used to turn based combat in rpgs, yet i get used to it almost instantly. love the excellent quest, superb writing, extraordinary characters... every companion is different with their goals, morals, quests, characteristics... last time when i felt something like that was in witcher 3 and that is few years ago. i must recommend this game to anyone who have no problem with turn based combat, have enough time and enjoyed dragon age origins, witcher 3 or mass effect trilogy. this game can take so much time... but where else you can scratch dog and owlbear in same time ? anyway, if you missing a feel when playing rpg with good story, great quests, interesting world, amazing characters, then this is a must have game for you. if you prefer fast paced real time combat, then this isn't for you, yet i can speak for myself, that it is easy to get used to it, so you may give it a try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"it's one of my favorite games of the year. the amount of choices you can make yourself to change the outcome of almost any battle is excellent. there isn't exactly one style of play, as you can experiment with all classes and races, with whatever cantrip or spells, etc. the music hits the feeling of the game, and the comedy in some parts is hilarious, and sometimes it does have its most serious moments, too. the multiplayer is also fun with main friends, but there are great times to have with even randoms, with everyone having their unique build or just doing individual actions with their character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"there is no base building, 010. unfortunately, i've seen comments in a similar fashion. unlike some people, i enjoyed the level cap in a crpg. in the dos series, i enjoy minmaxing. since the maximum level is uncapped, i felt pressured to kill some characters that i wouldn't otherwise. here, i felt more freedom. compared to the dos series, the combat feels less bombastic however, it's not necessarily a bad thing. there's much less crowd control, which means fights resemble actual battles rather than one party stunlocking the other throughout the entire fight. the story is marvelous in my opinion. i don't like games where my character wakes up one morning, and for an hour, the game tries to tell the backstory. the game starts with action and ends with action. one issue is that, until act 3, the story flows intensely along a narrower path. in act 3, the game takes you to a very large city where you need to slow down and adapt to new stories, unless you want to skip all the content and rush through the main story. i felt a bit conflicted about it because i didn't want to miss out on side content, but i really wanted to follow the main story. however, i can't give it a low score because there's so much content in the game, lol. also, i must mention that the romance aspect is terrible. i completely ignored it throughout the whole game because the dialogues are too amateurish. i wish they hadn't included it at all if they didn't have the time to align it with the overall quality."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"reading the negative reviews of this game really makes me lose braincells, it deserves all the praise and even more i can only hope da dreadwolf will be as good."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"gioco insensatamente bello. lo sto rigiocando per la seconda volta ed ho ampiamente superato le 130 ore. i larian si sono superati nel costruire un mondo interattivo con  realistici ed interazioni valide. l'unica pecca sono alcuni bug che affliggono il gioco, diventando via via peggiori nel secondo e terzo atto. ma stanno patchando il gioco con frequenza e sono fiducioso che risolveranno tutto. sto giocando la seconda partita con molta calma, nella speranza di vedere il terzo atto completamente funzionante e non senza texture come l'ho finito la prima volta.... per il gioco  talmente realizzato bene che riesco a perdonargli anche problemi tecnici gravi."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,easily one of the best games that i have ever played in the last 30 odd years. no microtransactions... no performance issues... no dlc... perfect in every way!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"bellissimo sia per gli amanti del genere che per i neofiti. io ho giocato a uno dei giochi, a mio parere, pi belli ma sottovalutati della fine degli anni '90 hall of dead faery tale adventure 2. ovviamente, in quegli anni sono nati baldur's gate e diablo, che sono stati i padroni assoluti del genere. tuttavia, baldur's gate 3, con la sua modalit di combattimento a turni e il suo potenziale sistema di esecuzione di qualsiasi tipo di azione, oltre alla grafica fantastica di oggi e all'ambientazione fantasy originale, per me  da considerarsi uno dei videogiochi pi belli di tutti i tempi. grazie. italian user beautiful both for genre enthusiasts and newcomers. i played one of the, in my opinion, most beautiful but underrated games of the late '90s hall of dead faery tale adventure 2. obviously, in those years, baldur's gate and diablo were born and they were the absolute masters of the genre. however, baldur's gate 3, with its turnbased combat mode and its potential system to perform any type of action, in addition to the fantastic graphics nowadays and the original fantasy setting, in my opinion, is to be considered one of the most beautiful video games of all time. thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"this is a game changer for the whole genre. graphics, plot, characters  everything is on game of the year level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"im usually not a fan of turn based rpgs, but this is some next level experience. absolutely fascinating, one of the best things i have played in the last few years. 200h for the first playthrough and i still haven't seen it all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"definitely not flawless, but it's not my condition to give 10. it's rather how the game made me feel and damn, this game is good. didn't have that much fun playing in a long, long time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"it is clearly the best game ever, it is the best in every branch mentioned in its category, and will it come again? very difficult. i was playing with one character and i came act 3 then i created one more character to play again until act 3 of course i played different way and this time like i played different game there is too many things that i had never seen before. so we can't just call game baldur's gate this is masterpiece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"this game is just amazing, great story, characters, world and gameplay. nothing hidden behind a pay wall or any micro transactions. this game represents every good in gaming, just go and buy it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"ive never played turn based games before, and ive never played dd. i was a bit afraid of trying baldurs gate 3, im an mmorpg veteran, soulslike fan, and sometimes i play shooters. this is an entirely different genre, yet i have to say, this game is one of the best things ever made, one of the most amazing experiences ive ever had. saying this as a person who has 15 years of hardcoresemihardcore gaming behind them, and works in mediacreative industry. its a true masterpiece, this is how gaming should be. elden ring and baldurs gate 3 are the 2 prime examples of what developers should aim for."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"for real roleplaying games it is a really good title and deserves a 10 out of 10. especially when you play dungeons and dragons you immediately feel comfortable and can enjoy the adventure. as an rpg beginner it might be a bit difficult, but then why should you get baldur's gate 3?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"master piece i cant say nothing more, you can play the way you want but this time with so many posibilities, larian did it again."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"great gameplay, great amount of content, amazing replay value, overall great experience. the only problems i have with it are some weirdly inconsistent performance issues and the visual character customization could be better. goty for me so far."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"this game is simply an epic triumph! the invitation to gather the group and return to the forgotten realms was an unforgettable adventure. the tale of friendship and betrayal, coupled with sacrifices and the struggle for survival, had me captivated from start to finish. the intriguing twist with the mind flayer parasite, which bestows mysterious abilities, took the game to a whole new level. the choice between resistance and temptation, between battling evil and the allure of absolute power, kept me constantly engrossed and immersed in the story. the developers have undoubtedly captured the essence of dungeons  dragons and transformed it into a nextgeneration roleplaying game. the magic they demonstrated with divinity original sin 2 is palpable here once again. the world is vibrant, the characters are profound, and the decisions one makes actually hold meaning and consequences. i was enthralled by the visual design, the musical score, and the immense depth of the narrative. this game completely drew me in and exceeded my expectations by far. an absolute masterpiece that keeps pulling me back into its fascinating world."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"a game in all regards. great story writing, characters, visuals, sound. this was my first crpg and dnd experience, little bit confusing getting in to it, but there are plenty of resources out there to bring you up to speed and explain things in detail. i do feel the developers could have offered a more comprehensive guided experience for new players, as i'm sure some might quit due to feeling overwhelmed. this game captures that feeling that great games had back in the golden era. it's still possible, larian have proved that. forget what the aaa industry tells you and stop supporting their misguided efforts."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,it is the masterpiece that we have all been waiting years for. no microtransactions. no live services. just a masterpiece  that every rpg player deserves.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"se perdurar como referncia, tanto em games, filmes, series e animaes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"by far the best game i have played in the past 10 years. it gives me great hope for the future as i had much given up on the game industry with all of it's microtransactions and unplayable games on release. instead baldur's gate 3 is a complete game with hundreds of hours of content. your choices matter. sure there are some required interactions to still tell the intended story, but this does not mean the interactions don't play out vastly differently. failure does not mean you miss out on content and instead can give you an entirely different set of content. it is the same for only succeeding. among your choices is your character creation. i chose a drow and i never expected so many interactions changing because of this. there is a goblin camp you go through in act 1 and my experience there was widely different purely because of my race. i was immediately treated with respect and authority without having to do anything where as my friends playing other races had to prove themselves. the game really takes into account the world as a whole that they made the game live inside. all of this breeds so much opportunity for multiple playthroughs. i've played through the game solo and with a friend and each time we were both learning new things, interactions, and getting new dialogue. it often felt like i was playing a whole new story, though of course with the same larger story beats. it was very refreshing. at this point i have played over 80 hours of the game and i look forward to putting even more into it. larion studios is actively making updates and adding new cutscenes and interactions. i can only imagine how the game will have only further improved and evolved in a years time. all that to say even now if larion did not do any other updates or fixes, it is already a masterpiece. it doesn't need any fixes or additional content, but all the updates and added content is most welcome. it feels like it needs to be mentioned that this new content is all free. this is not dlc content. there are no microtransactions. i've never been a fan of turn based games, but that did not stop me from enjoying the game one bit. the story was so gripping i often found myself reading the books to get a better and looking up wiki articles to understand who these mysterious factions were. the world feels alive and i want to know more about it. this all coming from a person who played ff14, which most of my friends rave about the story being the selling point, i instead skipped all cut scenes because i couldn't immerse myself. baldur's gate 3 has had a huge impact on my ability to sit down and just learn about the world. i tend to prefer 'high octane' gameplay. fast paced and no time for my brain to feel idle. i had no troubles slowing down and just exploring. i found myself instead wanting to really savor all the interactions. see what all my choices would do. reloading just for the extra little bit of knowledge dialogue. i felt upset failing history rolls because the little tidbits of knowledge was truly interesting. i am now hooked on the universe and will definitely be looking into the forgotten realms horde of novels. baldur's gate 3 really knocked this one out of the park. the gameplay is fantastic. the world is so well built. the characters feel alive. the main critique i could give about the romance optionsorigin characters is that they all have some huge insane backstory that makes them all 'interesting' and 'mysterious.' it can feel a bit over the top, but when i think about dnd they all perfectly recreate what a dnd character background would be. each player would want their character to have an interesting back story and some motivation in the world. they're not all just there to accomplish what the story wantsneeds and has their own interests outside of the main story quest. obviously i love this game. it has brought back a feeling from gaming that i thought was long dead. i can only hope larion studios continues game development. i will definitely be playing divinity original sin 12 after i finish my adventure through baldur's gate 3. i cannot recommend this game more. i believe it has something for everyone. it is truly a masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"pretty much everything baldur's gate and dungeons fans dragons fans have been hoping for years. maybe a little heavy on the romance, buy you can always toggle off what you don't want. looking forward to a dlc or whatever larian has in store next."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"the perfect game does not exist but baldur's gate 3 really comes close, a true rpg where the story based on your choices has a real impact in the game world. i've finished the game 5 times i'm starting the 6 run..... and every time something new happens andor i find something new or events i already know that have totally new consequences opening up new questsdialogues or new movies to me simply sublime! companions are perfectly characterized with a background, feelings, reactions to you and react to how you treat them in one run shadowheart came to my camp to kill me!!! simply wonderful. very nice graphics and animations the closeups in the face in your companions really convey the feelings they have never seen anything better in a video game. flaws i hate the inventory menu and find its options a bit cumbersome but nothing that bad. sound the music is perfect in all situations. ladies and gentlemen this is not the game of the year but the game of the decade!!! immense, deep, strategic a game where finally you don't have to hit random keys but reason about the dialogues, in the fights and a boundless lore it feels like you are really in the forgotten realms. thank you larian studios for this wonderful game and i hope and pray that all software houses learn from the best!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"i never thought that turnbased strategy would fascinate me so much that i would play 60 hours. this is the future standard for rpg games. the developers did an excellent job, took into account every detail and created an rpg exactly the way it should be. an rpg in which you can really play any role, with different options for completing the game. great, interactive environment, lively characters. thoughtful reactions of elements and surroundings. brilliant! the developers really thought about their players, and did not pour slop on them like other huge companies. thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,one of the most boring games i ever played. it s slow gameplay liek you playing chess.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"this game is unreal. i didnt know if it would be my cup of tea but my god its just mind blowing how engrossing it is. the amount of options available to you is amazing. think you could play through it 10 times and not find everything. time just melts away when you are playing it. the writing and voice acting is perfect i dont think ive recognised a single voice twice. you will be disgusting, angry, elated, cray with laughter, vomit. everything! the game so far has run with no issues except one bit of screen tear when we literally caused the biggest explosion ever. the combat is challenging and one missed place person or rubbish decision can literally lose you a battle. the world is beautifully crafted with so many things you can easily miss or will need a different class to access. its mind blowing. for me the best feature is the online coop, i love playing through a narrative with my mates. they laughs and arguments are unbelievable. it causes conversations you thought youd never have and find out personality traits you never knew you mates have. it is absolute gaming perfection. i am in no way and rpg fan. i love racing, football, platforming kind of guy but this has changed my look on rpgs. the fact i get to enjoy it with mates just secures it as the best game i have ever played in my life. keep up the good work larian. fantastic"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"grandsimo juego, larian aun siendo un estudio con pocos recursos han conseguido hacer un juego excelente, no lo juguis en ps5, va fatal, en pc si es como se disfruta"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"crpg on an extreme high level. story telling is insanely good, voiceovers are stunning. combat is good even if turn based is just not everybodys cup of tea, the companions are really nice and interesting. of course, the game still has some bugs, but i haven't encountered any game breakers. but larian works hard on fixing issues, much harder than bigger companies. the camera has some design flaws, some work on this topic would be nice. bg3 has even more potential 13 more origin characters with different backgrounds like a halforc, dwarf, halfling, the content cut from the game, especially in act 3. i'm not much into preordering, but i would order a dlc just now even without knowing about it. for some years, i had not much fun in gaming  the last game i had fun with was vanilla wow classic, but now with bg3 i could play the whole weekend  if you are into story based rpgs and don't mind turnbased combat, i can recommend this awesome game to you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"baldur's gate has the potential to be nearly as outstanding as kotor, but within the context of the dnd"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"man, when i thought dos2 was one of the greatest games i ever played then bg3 has to be top of the list. im a  for crafted roleplay experiences and this game is a dream come true. some people might say this is a once in a lifetime game but i think this might be the single greated gaming experience to ever be made by artists. ai will make designing games like this even more uneconomical so that bg3 might be the peak for humancrafted rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"thats probably the best game in the last 10 years. better than any nintendo bs, deal with it my brother in christ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"nothing short of a masterpiece. deep, interesting story arcs, meaningful companions, and brilliantly animated throughout. at time of review i've put over 120 hours into the game and i know there's still hundreds of things to do that i skipped past first time."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"bought this for mac one early access, played it on windows since its not fully released on mac yet and then bought it for ps5. my fave rpg of all time. if this doesnt win goty, id be surprised."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"it is good game only the last act still needs some polish. those who do not have bg3 yet, still waiting something for a great game 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"sadly cant give more than a 10, this game is the epitome of love for creating video games, roleplaying games, rpgs. without a doubt one of the best video games of recent years, excellently well polished, both in mechanics, history, character development... and the music, god how can i forget the music, majestic. a game that will be a cult game and an example to follow for many years to come for video game developers. this game has a unique ability to make you think about your next play through while you're still playing your current one. the narrator voice is always on point, bg3 is the kind of game we, players have been waiting for so long. no microtransaction, no halfcooked trash, fun and enjoyable game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"idk what i can say that hasn't been said about this game. for dnd and strategyrpg lovers buy it. for people unsure think about it and watch tips and tricks videos about the mechanics of the game so you understand it better before diving head first and so you avoid that feeling like you wasted your money because the game is too complex, as gamers we all know that feeling that you were lied to by the fan base so ill be straight, it's complex but not in a bad way. this game is complex in the level of options of how to handle the situations you can find yourself in. strategy and understanding the tools at your disposal can be key to demolishing a boss or barely surviving some damn goblins. the more you understand and experiment with this game the more efficient or ridiculous your tactics can become which maximizes my favorite factor when playing games fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"the best rpg i've ever played, and i consider it one of the greatest video games in history. the rpg aspect is simply perfect, filled with decisions that shape your path in the story and carry weight. incredibly charismatic and human characters, with whom you can easily form a bond, which speaks to impeccable character development. the turnbased gameplay, which was considered outdated, is revitalized in this game, making it incredibly entertaining with numerous possibilities and ways to play, including a wealth of builds, combinations, and items that aid in battles. but for me, the biggest highlight of this video game is its ability to make you feel like a part of its world. you truly immerse yourself in the game with every action you take, whether you choose the path of good or evil, you feel that you leave your mark on the game world with your decisions. every technical aspect is very well done, with an outstanding soundtrack, wellcrafted atmosphere, and world design, and it's graphically beautiful as well. in summary, it's the best rpg i've ever played and a game that sets a new standard in the genre and in video games as a whole. whether you're not typically drawn to this type of game or turned off by turnbased mechanics, you should definitely give it a try it won't disappoint, and you'll discover a truly marvelous world."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"as a dnd lover i'm satisfied with baldur's gate 3, in fact my friend and i were looking forward to bg3 when we played bgdia about two years ago. and besides, do you know how excited i was when i saw jaheira and minsc and boo once again?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"truley outstanding best game iv played in forever the gameplay options and builds. options in combat and conversations. more patches adding extra endings. finished game on 300hrs played still playing a multiplayer game, and started a new playthrough with another class. so much to do and see i really hope theres a bg4. this is like the old days of gaming updated to modern days. other games telling me that new gammers need all action non stop to be popular and us old gammers are no longer worth catering for now a game like this pops and young and old are playing it and loving it. truley awesome."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"el juego tiene un mundo abierto lleno de vida y detalles. los personajes son carismticos y bien desarrollados, y la historia es emocionante y atrapante. el combate es desafiante y estratgico, y las opciones de personalizacin son casi infinitas. baldur's gate 3 es un juego imprescindible para los fans del gnero de rol. es un ttulo que te mantendr entretenido durante horas y horas."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"de lo mejor que he jugado, es increble la cantidad de decisiones que puedes tomar y la cantidad de partidas diferentes que puedes tener. el sistema de combate me ha gustado mucho y la historia me ha encantado, para m un 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this game made me feel like a little kid, trying to beat the genius of our dm in our old dd gang again. story is amazing. you can lose yourself in the side quests for hours. the fact that it allows you to have creative freedom to tackle any challenge thrown at you is exactly how a dd game should be. in every sense, bg3 delivered on expectations and more... well done!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"um jogo espetacular, sem dvidas um dos melhores jogos esse ano, est viciante, quando mais voc joga, mais voc quer, grficos, mecnica, designer, udio, tudo perfeito"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"anyone who played the original games is going to notice a lot of issues with the writing, they literally use the same excuse twice for why two human characters are still alive well after they should be dead. the irony is that the returning elves from the previous game look far older than what they're supposed to chronologically. honestly, the returning characters just feel like needless pandering since they really have no baring on what feels like a completely new story perhaps they shouldn't have made this a baldur's gate game considering that refers specifically to the bhaalspawn trilogy. then you've got the issue with the ending i've heard they've patched in new ones since i last played, you've essentially got two generic endings goodbad which don't really have any bearing on your characters alignment neutralchaoticlawful and it honestly wasis about as lazy as the controversial ending of the mass effect trilogy. i'm not the only one who noticed the hamstringed romance not to mention the bestiality option that felt rushed and honestly like it was an afterthought, it's literally one of the biggest things the community memes on... the gameplay doesn't feel like a crpg in the baldur's gate franchise either and the choice to go for turn based combat was a mistake. the graphics would have been good if the game was made in 2014, the game came out looking dated and having technical issues which still haven't been addressed for higher resolution monitors. as it stands i know a lot of people have artificially pushed this game because of the controversy surrounding the bear sex, the console wars sony fanboys unironically thought it was an exclusive and the belief that this game broke modern aaa conventions because it's slightly less exploitative then most modern releases so far no forced dlc or microtransactions, just ignore their use of preorder culturebetas which anyone born before 2005 would view as a bad thing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"attention, longtime gamers! finally, there's a game that reignites the childlike excitement within me! it's a game that exudes the same love, attention to detail, and quality reminiscent of classic rpgs from the late 90s and early 2000s, yet it seamlessly blends in the modern gameplay and visuals of 2023. this true rpg offered me a great sense of freedom when it comes to how i approach and resolved quests. very rarely did i feel like i was limited in how i tackled a problem. the storytelling, scenarios, and visuals are nothing short of superb, and the game has lots of memorable and interesting characters to interact with. baldur's gate 3 is divided into three acts. unfortunately, the third act experiences a dip in quality due to a handful of bugs and some inconsistencies in quest progression. these hiccups are a result of the intricate web of choices available to players. additionally, the pacing takes a hit towards the end, making the game feel like it drags on a bit. these issues prevent it from achieving a perfect 1010 in my eyes. nevertheless, baldur's gate 3 remains an absolute mustplay for any rpg enthusiast."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"one word is all this game represents and it is excellency! this game do not punish you if you do your own thing, rather it wants you to be you. do your crazy and dumb stuff and it still rewards you. insane!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this is about as close to a perfect game as i've found in a long time.  there's tremendous freedom, and the world reacts to your choices. it delivers on the oftpromised by rarelydelivered choices matter idea.  the voice acting, music, artwork, models, and animation are all high quality. environments feel like detailed dioramas, a joy to look at and navigate.  i bounced off dos 2 due to a muddy story and simplistic combat. neither are a problem here quite the opposite.  in tabletop dd, i get bored with combat. in bg3 there are a wealth of tactical options.  i often feel bored in dialogue trees in most games. but in bg3 dialogue feels meaningful since it reflects your past actions, your class and race, and you're able to use skills to affect it, as if dialogue were a mini game within a game.  it should be shouted from the rooftops how larian studios are offering a complete, polished game without microtransactions, a battle pass, and the rest of the greedy, cancerous filth that the aaa industry tries to abuse their customers with. i do have minor gripes. it should have ui scaling not just cinematic, but scaling for the main ui. it mildly suffers from the classic you have a big mission, but here's all these side quests that realistically wouldn't be done by someone on an urgent mission. and the game can feel overwhelming at first there are so many spells, abilities, items, dd rule quirks, etc. but, overall, this is some of the most fun i've had playing a video game in ages."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"one of the best genredefining rpg games ever. it overpromise things in act 1 and don't deliver in act 3  plenty of quests end very abruptly and there are plenty of loose ends. they also decided not to include endslides. but all of this is not important, really. game is brilliant, funny, interesting, challenging and pretty. story is nice, character writing is really good even if miss some diversity in character races  i mean where is all orcs, dwarfs, gnomes and halfling companions?. why 10? because actually game is much bigger than it should be. they cut plenty from act 3 and still game is huge and much bigger than level cap. so ... in the end they delivered much more than i expected. and i hope in year or two larian will fix act 3 with director's cut edition or dlc. ot make act 4 or something."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"it is better then dos2 when it comes down to scale and cinematics, however playing conjurernecromancer is damn boring, since they nerfed necromancy of thai. you still likely to enjoy the game if your favorite class is warriorbarbarianrogue, not so much with orhers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"i played the original bioware baldur's gates on released and replayed them about a year ago prior to playing baldur's gate 3. i really enjoyed those games. i am disappointed that bg3 is more like newer crpgs and doesn't completely scratch the itch but it is still a great game. i believe it's the best rpg of the year. starfield and diablo 4 can be fun in their own ways, but this game really does feel like an actual roleplaying game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece . the graphics are stunning, the world is detailed, and the characters are wellwritten. the story is engaging and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. the combat system is incredibly deep and complex, and the game's world interacts with you in interesting and unique ways. the puzzles feel truly unique, and the exploration of the world is a rewarding experience. the game is full of digital delights such as weapons and items, interactive stories and characters, minigames, crafting, and so much more. i've had countless hours of entertainment and i love the fact that the game is upgradeable with new content. baldur's gate 3 is a fantastic rpg and i highly recommend it to any fan of the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,i bought the game in early access und never touched it until the full release. for me the absolut best game i ever played. thx larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,tiene que ser increble poder jugar a este juegazo. solo me llegaba para una series s y no por ello voy a criticar la grandiosidad de este juegazo. aburrido de las pantallas de carga al atravesar cada puerta y de las cinemticas entre cambios de planeta de starfield.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,juego increble. la historia es una de las mejores que yo recuerde. una pena que no est en todas las plataformas.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"simple. it's dnd. but a videogame. almost anything you think you can do, you can. the game reacts to it. very good game. super fun. wish they would add in encounter creator so this could be used for online dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,the best role playing experience i've ever had. i'm 110 hours in and still haven't done everthing because i kinda want to explore everything. there are no fillers. just quality!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"a masterpiece, with an insane replayability, few bugs and a good story. a must try"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"an extraordinary game with abysmal depth and truly breathtaking graphics. 80 hours already and i can't get enough of it, having loved the first two installments back in the day! gripping story, touching ally characters, dynamic turnbased gameplay! simply the goty 2023 for me! huge thanks to larian studio!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"i love how most of the negative reviews here are from people who wanted bg2 in a 3d engine. crying over how this isn't identical to a 23yearold game. it's sad, honestly. the game is a masterpiece, and one of the best games to come out in decades."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"overhyped. dialogs are super boring, and there are a lot of them. face animations are awful, unrealistic. books are very poorly written, not much lore in them, if any at all. combat is super slow 1 fight can take 2040 minutes and easy. small maps. the game lasts only because of slow progression, due to a lot of dialogs and slow combat. predictable main quest plot. divinity 2 was more interesting in story and combat system, bethesda games has way more interesting main story plot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,everything but the lack of epilogue is amazing in this game. one of the best games ive played since wild hunt
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,one of the best games i have ever played. the only complaint i have is they broke the game with a patch that kept me from playing for days... only reason im not giving it 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this game is just amazing, there is soo much to do and so much to miss. the intricate stories that every character has, all the side quests you're able to do. so much re playability this game has to offer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"rpg raiz, muito bom mesmo. tima sensao de escolha em todas situaes do jogo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"i haven't finished the game, but i definitely need to leave a review. this was my first time playing this genre and style of game. the game is very addictive and interesting. i really liked the dialogues and gestures of the characters as a priority, that is why i am playing through the game, i really liked the dialogues and gestures of the characters. i put the plot in second place  it is incredibly exciting and varied. in third place is the combat system, i dont see any downsides, everything is implemented quite well. the graphics in the game are also not bad, but the only thing that makes it difficult to navigate in the dark is that you have to turn up the brightness. i didn't like the interface of the inverter and the layout of things in it  it was so small that i had to get closer to the screen and look at something. i didnt like the highlighting of the inscriptions of objects in the world, as i understand it, some things are not highlighted, so its easy to miss them and not learn something new and opening other tasks will not happen, unfortunately. but overall, i really liked the game, thank you for such a creation, it really deserves the title of game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"i've had early access on my old janky pc for ages, and i genuinely loved the world, the combat, the characters. given how much i already knew i would enjoy the game, i honestly didn't expect my ps5 experience to surprise me with how much i'm enjoying it! the story has me hooked, and i know i've barely scratched the surface, there seems to be multiple paths to completing all objectives, huge story based or small side objectives. i find myself caring more about my companions than most games with a similar crew or gang where i tend to only want to bother with a few. but either through humor or interesting backstory i find myself wanting to engage with my companions more. in short, i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this is the game i dreamed about. the only minus for me is that fight are a bit too easy. but quests, adventure, spirit of dnd it's all here. i'll say  when the game ended i was crying, i never had such emotions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,best game in a decade. thanks larian. enjoy this masterpiece and i really don't know why people are givivng it 0
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this game is the absolute best rpg game i've ever seen. the sheer amount of things you can do and the vast variety of outcomes you can get is outstanding. i have not experienced any game breaking bugs, occasional character clipping or disappearing textures is fine by me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"this is the only game i will ever rate 1010. early access already made it out to be a masterpiece, but with the additions of full release it's even better than before."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"amazing adventure in a fantastic fantasy world. chararchers are very creative and wellwritten, as is the whole plot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,amazing game that shames publishers that force developers to put out rushed  games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"the consistency of the story, dialogues and the weight of the choices you make is just perfect. didn't has as much fun and playing as much as i did in a  long time. also broke my heart a few times. really worth every penny."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"the best looking crpg by far. carefully crafted vistas of the magical world are stunning and gameplaystopping, to make a screenshot, or just to admire for a minute. all the environments are very detailed and the number of things you may call spectacular is almost overwhelming. never have i ever heard such a thoroughly voiced rpg. everyone has a voice, from the narrator, to your companions, to significant figures, insignificant ones, everyone! wow! that takes a lot of effort. and thats impressively immersive while doing the actual gameplay. now, theres a painful gap in all that excellence. the protagonist. i wont go into detail here, because there are none. silence. the sounds are really there as well. all of them, the steps, the crackling of a fire, the bombastic explosions, the little, almost indistinguishable things. and finally, music. oh yeah, baby, the music. sometimes its quiet and pretty much unnoticeable, but when the drama really hits, so does the melody. it even has songs with vocals! spot on, beautiful and perfectly adding to the whole experience. the sheer amount of unique enemies youll face throughout the game stands out. theres a lot, like really a lot! and all of them feel different, challenging, interesting, awesome. the battles arent easily won on the balanced level of difficulty, providing enough resistance to trigger the usage of planning, strategizing, preparation and, sometimes, save load abuse. the interface panels, which are mostly used in combat, are far from perfect, and ive found myself struggling with them again and again. the world is vast, brimming with life, secrets to discover, places to explore, views to adore, characters to meet, foes to defeat, heights to fall from and break your neck, doors to lockpick, chests to loot, books to read and so much more! so much, that main questline quickly becomes a hindrance, putting pressure on you to move on, while youd like to take your time, and stay a little more. every location is different, every situation has its own smell and flavor, nothing repeats, nothing gets boring. kill them all. you can if you want. another distinguishing feature. there are no op guards just to limit your murderous cravings. oh no. you can totally paint it red. and it feels real good, i must admit. when the words fall on def ears, and the weight of a coin purse isnt an argument, when your charismatic wink doesnt quite get you what you want, theres always an option to let your weapon do the talking. character progression. i feel this is where the game falls a bit short. and by a bit i mean like 20 hours short, for me personally. ive hit the level cap way to early. thats a design flaw that should not have made it into release. level cap is needed, but when it hits should be balanced in the ballpark of the final endgame. the equipment. the amount of it is too low for my taste, some items even not enough to equip all the companions. again, loot amount is a question of balance, but i found this balance tipped quite wrongly. the loot system as a whole feels clunky and unpolished. the story is deep dark and spills blood and viscera when properly shaken. couldnt help myself not to write that. theres no debate about how gory and darkly and desperately painful the stories in the game are. little of them have happy endings, little still can instill a smile. a smidge more humor and rainbows wouldnt have hurt. heres what this game is not  hilarious. not even funny. the story is admirably wellcrafted and sufficiently captivating to enjoy watching it unravel. especially with your own input, in a form of decisions, from which good ones seem to be none. the twists and turns are plenty, nothing is perfectly clear until the very end. a lot of hard work went into the bloodymerry bunch of companions. their stories are masterfully interwoven with the main theme, their quests are true delights to follow and experience. they are heroes, they are villains, they are mighty and fragile at the same time. and in the end, if handled correctly, they make you proud. the protagonist, you, the player, and your very own character, you dont get the same treatment as companions do. you have no voice. you have no name. nobodys proud of you. your significance is questionable at best. you never feel enough attention or recognition. the game catastrophically fails to bring the main hero forward and give them the treatment they deserve. larian studios never delivered in that regard. the previous games were also lacking. just to mention, the game has no drm! not to rate it a 10 would feel wrong. the biggest and most ambitious crpg ever created. crafted with love, dedication, impeccable attention to detail and best interest of gamers to play it in mind. must play, not only for rpg fans, for every gamer there is. a masterful work of art in an interactive live form. magnificent!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,the game masterfully delivered everything it promised and much more. without a doubt the best game of the year and one of the best in history.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"my initial foray into baldur's gate 3 was marred by a sprinkling of frustrations, particularly the limitations imposed on lowlevel characters who could only cast a single spell each round, and the occasional lost battle that cost me precious time. furthermore, the companions i met early on in my adventure felt a bit quirky, with some unfortunately not growing on me as i had hoped. however, as i delved deeper, the game began to unfold its true richness and depth. many companions not only grew on me but also managed to pleasantly surprise me with their development. similarly, the expansive world caught me off guard with its unforeseen surprises and a wealth of opportunities waiting to be discovered. the real turning point was when i stepped into the vibrant and bustling city of baldur's gate. it was here that the game blossomed into a remarkable experience of joy and wonder. the city, brimming with life and details, presented a delightful playground for exploration and adventures. what stood out were the phenomenal graphics that painted every scene with breathtaking realism and depth, enhancing the immersive experience manifold. i was enamoured by the plethora of content available right at release, making it a rich and fulfilling journey that promises replayability. i cannot thank the creators enough for presenting a game so vast and detailed, a title that transcends initial hiccups to offer an experience that is thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding. it is a journey that i am eager to undertake again, exploring new paths and making different choices."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"910 because the act 3 felt hasted and earlyaccessish, and ruined otherwise 1110 experience from acts 1 and act 2. will wait for some sort of definitive edition to have another playthrough with fixed act 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"masterpiece crpg, arguably the best and easiest crpg to get into for an beginner. obvious flaws the game presents  long loadingscreen in game where save scumming is prevelant thats bad design  act 3 is half the game and 30 fps doenst feel great  tactician is story mode for other crpg's  quests can break if not done intended way besides that the game still raises the rpg bar with the positives 100 hour adventure  wide choice's that influence your experience in act 1,2 and 3  easiest to understand ruleset  coop34man party are where the game becomes magic  music is toptier, shoutout to rapheal"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"the most perfect open world, trpg game, ever. i have played this game for 20 hours long but not even finished first chapter. masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"summing up my experience with this game in one word wow. the turnbased gameplay style was a refreshing departure from other games i've played in the genre. what truly amazed me was the staggering freedom it offered you can practically do anything within the game's boundaries. this freedom extends to shaping the narrative as well, with countless consequences for every action you take throughout each act, making every choice feel meaningful. the story is nothing short of fantastic. it's one of those rare games where i eagerly interact with every character and creature, driven by a genuine curiosity to learn more about the intricacies of the world. across multiple playthroughs, i've observed how the dialogue dynamically changes based on the decisions i've made, enhancing replayability. exploring the backgrounds and personalities of the characters in your party is an immensely satisfying experience, surpassing even the persona games i've enjoyed in the past. currently halfway through my second playthrough, i can't wait to embark on yet another campaign, this time fully embracing the role of a villain to witness how the story unfolds. in conclusion, i wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone seeking an engaging and enjoyable narrative experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"my game of the year! as a long time dm i have to say that this game is as close as it gets to a tabletop experience. you can see that the developers put so much love and passion in this game and they sure set the bar for rpgs in the years to come. the characters are great, the dialogue is on point, the music beautifully enhances the experience. i can't overstate how much i love this game and i hope we see more like this in the future. i would give an 1110."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"no suelo comprar juegos apenas salen, ni tampoco triples a, pero este juego me encanto desde el inicio y no pude esperar ni 1 segundo para comprarlo, desde el storytelling hasta el gameplay, las posibilidades son infinitas y su rejugabilidad es garantizada, el mejor juego del 2023, y de los mejores juegos del siglo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"im still on act one and cant put this game down! the world is beautiful, and i cant help exploring every inch of it! the characters are very well written and all feel real and worth investing time into. the combat is fun and engaging. i find myself really enjoying the turn based combat. ive never really enjoyed it but with this game ive gone into it with an open mind and its actually a lot of fun working out what i can do and how i can take out the enemies. this game is a breath of fresh air and its nice to play a game at launch that is completely finished and not a broken buggy mess. yes there are some issues with frame rates but nothing game breaking. and im very happy with the idea that this game has no microtransactions no payed dlc its a one time payment and you have hundreds of hours of content. the studio really should be proud of themselves for putting a lot of love and care into a game, one that is easily my contender for game of the year! this is a perfect game for sure"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"very good game, it's among the best games i've ever played. it's the first game of this style that i've played. the story is very good and well told. acts 1 and 2 are perfect, act 3 would need to be better worked on both in the technical part and in the story part, but nothing that ruins the game experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"was a huge fan of larians past work, and in awe of the level of detail, complexity and possibility in divinity original sin 2, and didnt think any modern rpg could surpass those aspects but damnit, theyve done it again. and not only that, the level of depth and player agency is somehow even greater. the dedication to replicating the tabletop experience, uncompromising commitment to respecting the players intelligence, and the unfathomable, passionate attention to detail is unmatched by its peers. the perfect rpg adventure tactical, deep, intelligent combat paired with unrivaled player choice and endless possibilities. what more could you ask for out of an rpg? larian are the modern torchbearers of the roleplaying game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"the game is one of the best games i have ever played. the story, characters, and world is very immersive. it is turn based crpg so that may detract from your enjoyment if you do not like those sorts of games. it is one of those once every 10 years sort of games that push the envelope of what is possible in gaming well done! oh and best of all no micro transactions and amazing dev. team that cares."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"amazing game! all negative reviews are disgusting starfield and zelda fanboys who don't even own bg3, trying their hardest to reviewbomb the clear goty, so their games can stand a chance. ignore them, they are toxic sore losers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"it's decent enough. i'm not a huge fan of the dice rolling aspect, but the story and characters easily make up for that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"this is an amazing game with so much to do, ways to play and depth. even if, like me, you don't enjoy dd rules based games, give it a go, larian have done an excellent job with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"the best game i've played in years! i'm reluctant to give it a 9 instead of a 10 the only downside was the anticlimactic ending. i'm confident that larian will refine it over the next year or two, making it the best game ever created."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,when it comes to dice or something like that i'm always so unlucky that's why i always avoided games likes these but baldur's gate 3 is the best game i've ever played in my life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"i just finished this with about 100 hours put in. not only is this in my top 5 favorite games of all time, it has permanently altered my idea of what a good game is. i cannot wait for expanded content and baldur's gate 4 whenever the time comes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"one of the best games i have ever played!!! it needs performance fixes on pc, and larian is for sure doing that."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"baldur's gate 3 is not a perfect game, but it is an inspired masterpiece and love letter to lovers of the rpg genre and dd in particular. it has some of the most interesting writing i've ever seen in a video game and the voice acting is among the best i've ever seen in a video game. i've already recommended this game to anyone who will listen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"normally i play first person action or third person action games that don't have a steep learning curve or or require significant time investment to get some kind of enjoyment or value out of. this is the first rpg since mass effect trilogy that actually has me hooked. like any good rpg, your engagement with the world, committing to making choices and experimentation is actually rewarded, meaningful and beautifully executed across gameplay systems and story telling. every once in a while any medium whether it be gaming, movies books or comics, a true masterpieces comes to set new standards. highly recommend it anyone looking to get lost in an immersive story driven experience. imagine not growing doing hardcore nerd stuff like magic the gathering or dnd and now being curious as an adult, that's how good it is."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"the new standard for rpgs. i am over 100 hours in and haven't finished the game. i could write a novel on why this game is amazing, but i do not need to."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,masterpiece . endless possibilites and great gameplay. larian still improving the game when this is written. but game very much in good playable state after update 2. 175 hours in and can't wait for my second run.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"best game ive ever played on pc. i had it preordered for ps5 but changed my mind and glad i did! havent played bg since the first game, but the changes here are superb! dd pencilandpaper is so tough to get organized these days, so this scratches my rpg itch quite well. fantastic game. not perfect, mind you, but superb in every way."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"i can't imagine how many people would have put in the effort to build a game of this magnitude, you guys deserves the title of game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,an epic hard to duplicate. it's goodness is far beyond our expression. there's one thing i could say the true and full beauty of the game is inside itself and the only way to get it is to experience it by yourself. that's my best review i can say for a game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"good game. the systems and mechanisms are complex and deep indeed, but fun. making such a game is not an easy thing and this kind of masterpiece should be treasured."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"amazing game, so much choice, there are options in the game that i did not even think to choose let alone choose another path."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,best epic rpg game for ever literally. i wasn't a fan of dd games but baldur's gate 3 tied me up screen.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"in a month, i've managed to finish three full playthroughs of baldur's gate 3. this is now my favourite rpg of all time. it truly elevates the genre to new heights. presentation is topnotch, with excellent voice acting across the board, beautifully motioncaptured scenes, and wonderful music. in fact, there's one lategame boss that has my favourite boss theme of all time, which fits not only the character but the events leading up to it absolutely perfectly if you know, you know. every single member of the cast knocks it out of the park with their performances  even the minor npcs with one line of dialogue. it's a joy to interact with them all. and the story is outstanding. there are so many minor interactions and special dialogue lines based on everything from the situation to your race to who's in your party to your class to even your subclass  i played a draconic bloodline sorcerer on my second playthrough and noticed dialogue related to my character's draconic ancestry. it's that complex! combat is quite fastpaced for a turnbased game, and every hit, every spell effect, and every kill is super satisfying. it helps if you enjoy turnbased combat to begin with, but this is some of gaming's best. there's so many little interactions with the environment, like being able to shoot braziers down, push statues over, shove enemies into chasms a personal favourite, and so on. you can even throw enemies at other enemies! combat is always exciting and a lot of the encounters are very creative. the overall story is just phenomenal. no spoilers, but i found the best way to play is to really get into your character's shoes and properly roleplay as them. the bad dice rolls really gave my first character a bard that extra level of incompetence as he tried to bungle his way through every encounter. the good dice rolls made my second character a sorcerer feel that little bit more intimidating and powerful. i'm not saying it's wrong to save scum i.e reload a save when you get a bad result on a skill check, but it was so much more fun for me to live with my mistakes. all of your companion characters are extremely wellwritten and all have great moments, ranging from hilarious to tragic. romance is... abundant. the game's a bit too horny sometimes! but seriously, committing to one character and watching your romance blossom alongside their own personal story is a wonderful experience. questing is excellent. there's so many outcomes, and so many variations of consequences, that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. and that's not hyberbole  as i said, i've done three playthroughs, and they've all been wildly different. the main story eventually leads to the same conclusion, but even that has a bunch of different choices and outcomes. there's a big choice at the end but all of the events leading up to it have an impact. it's not like mass effect 3's rgb ending by any stretch of the imagination. i'm going to echo a lot of player sentiment here, but baldur's gate 3 is what i wanted a dragon age origins sequel to be, in every way. it does everything that game did and then some, bringing that peak bioware style to the modern age. hats off to larian for finally delivering what bioware unfortunately couldn't. this is easily one of the greatest games ever made, and i hope it inspires more excellent rpgs in the future."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"joy shared with others are more enjoyed. this year, i played the game that i was most addicted to, not feeling tired or tired!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"great rpg to play with friends, totally can recommend it! i love the dd implementation in this game, it's easy to learn but gives challenges, and each fight is like a puzzle that you have to solve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"i've finished the game and i'm still thinking about it. i already know that this game will leave me with feeling of nostalgia for decades, same as older bg games did. yes, there are few bugs, yes, you can feel quality difference between act i and rest of the game. but so what, the settings, the log, fascinating characters, mechanics allowing to do creative things, all of it evens out all other bumps. for me it's 1010!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"they knocked it out of the park with this one. just really, really fun to play. the strategy in combat and the characters are great. i love the replayability and being able to run through the game with my wife was a huge plus. she still hasn't put the game down. 300 hours and counting. 1010. haven't bought a game that has been worth my money in a while and this one is worth the money 10 times over. can't say enough how much i enjoyed this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,sick game goty for sure diablo 4 is  compared to this and even a improved to dos2! sick game goty for sure diablo 4 is  compared to this and even a improved to dos2!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"honestly, goty material. the devs did an amazing job on this. theres replayability imo. its fun with friends, if they're not loot ninjas. good job guys!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"in a moment like this, where there is a tendency in game and movie industry to exploit the good things done in the past and squeeze it out for commercial purposes only, playing on fans attachment to propose substandard products, one could have suspected that for this game too we would have had a similar risk. absolutely not!! this is the game we needed and the one we deserved!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"pues despues de terminar el juego sin parar 2 semanas en ambos caminos, dejando de lado todos los que se estrenaron les dire que es el mejor dinero invertido en mi que he gastado, un juego completo y largo sin micro pagos ni gachas un unico pago y muchas horas de divercion, muy bien cuidado a mi que jugue roll con los amigos de nio me recordo esos aos, y sus personajes todos tiene un carisma que quires saber su historia."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"i have been waiting like...i dont know... decade for such crpg? this is easy top 3 crpgs i have ever played and it was like going back in time to golden years of crpgs, like bg2, dao, arcanum, torment, me1 etc. it's just such great rpg, with stunning dialogues and dialogues outcomes and options, quests seemlessly incorporated into main storyevents, rich in interesting plot, stories and interesting npcs. probably the best voice acted video game i have even played. you can play this game in so many different ways, gameplay and storyoutcomes wise that it will probably take me years to squeeze everything out of this game. in short  this is it. this is it! if you love crpgsrpgs then this is pretty much the rpg of the last decade15 years and one of best ever made. this game is no brainer to buy, it's so good i bought it two more times just to support larian so they can make more in future. privelage to be part of this experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,best game i ever played so fun so big so beatiful and so great story. you have not to beat the game you live it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,wonderful game! easy one of my own top five games of all time. will take a very long time before we get a crpg thats even close.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,80 hours and i think i'm close to the end of the game while getting excited for my next playthrough.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"finally i am currently in act 3, finishing the game and closing all the stories 70h, and that is why i have taken that long to make a review. bg3 creates a new standard for rpg. it's the first game i feel i manage completely my decisions. the amount of work from the devs in this game is insane and quite utopian. divinity original sin saga was the perfect training to create this game. the storytelling, the characters, the music, the combat, the mechanics themselves, ... feels like a true dd experience. nothing to say about it that is bad or wrong, so 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i just finished my first playthrough, and man was it a blast. this is my first turn based rpg that i've played, and i never though that i would like this kind of game. looking forward to doing more playthroughs with different classes and origins in the party. think it's time for some dark urge!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"baldur's gate 3 is not the same as the other 2 entries of the series. it has none of the black isle design or logic. this is a solid larian studios that, using the forgotten realms campaign setting and the lore that has been developed for it for over 40 years, create a good, immersive game. the plot is engaging and there are so many thing to do sidequest wise that you feel like the world is your candy shop. which leads to the negatives... there are areas and characters that have suffered even though there was a huge development cycle looking at you karlach!, with some side quest endings feeling rushed and not as good as one would have hoped. there are no bags of holding heresy! and there are times where the engine stutters and you miss cinematic moves during a dialogue. and apparently everyone in the realms is thirsty and gender is a suggestion! all in all, a really good, solid larian game. if you like crpgs or rpgs in general you should at the very least try it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,absolutely game of the year. the npc characters you actually care about. the story has so much ability to replay due to so many different story outcomes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,amazing exp for gaming. i really like to plan my next move and this game just gives it so well. i wish this is the standard for rpg games in the this gen.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,how it should be. . . . . .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"it is the best experience i had in games so far. every time i launch the game, it gives me a lot of fun. almost every session finishes with a story i want to tell my friends. also, none of us had the same playthrough except for some little details. also, i found there are so many things i missed in the first act, so i'll definitely play again from the beginning. best game purchase ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"great game. seeing a lot of people praising it and still giving it 0. dont really get that, but yeah. it deserves goty imo"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,simply amazing game. it really does feel like you can do anything you want. not only should this be the standard for aaa rpgs going forward it should be heralded as the best game made in the last 10 years. great work larian and thank you for giving me a game that actually excites me to play.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i would say it is a excelent game and a new breakthrough for crpg, good job"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"fantastic, pure art, wonderful posssibilities and opciones. charismatic characters, incredible landscapes, cities, interactions, it will be a new classic in games.,!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the best rpg that i've played, loses some points because act 3 is rough and needs work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,anyone who has actually gotten past act 1 approx. 36 of people would know that act 2 and 3 has some pretty bad bugs and balancing issues. a great game but its clear that it still needs some balancing patches. act 1 is perfect but thats after years of user feedback but its clear that act 2 and 3 should have been put in early access before full release.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,there's nothing that i wouldn't love in this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,this is without a doubt the best rpg i have ever played. just wow. everything about it is just perfect. the story is really thrilling and grasps you. every companion is super well written and has something interesting to them. also the lack of bugs and the complete non existence of micro transactions makes this a unicorn in the current game market. this might just be my favorite game of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"simply amazing, it rewards you for thinking outside the box. not to mention the interaction with the npcs, and the world is way above average. just buy it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,absolutely outstanding game. combat is easy to learn but has lots of depth. sets a lot of gold standards for an rpg. just outstanding level of polish.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"goty, revolucionrio, simplesmente o melhor jogo do ano. o amor e carinho que a empresa teve com o jogo e os fs  sem igual"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"juego del ao, desde the witcher 3 que no jugaba un gran rpg, total libertar, varias opciones para elegir que modifican la historia radicalmente"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"absolute masterpiece, act 3 drops off slightly in quality of story and performance, but everything that precedes it and the amazing gameplay more than makes you forgive the devs. there's still potential for improvement which is crazy considering the groundbreaking game larian studios built here, please give me the farm epilogue sven, i beg you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"a masterpiece, bugs here and there in act 3 but not a single time i've felt that it ruined my experience in any way. and ngl i've never ever felt so immersed into a game since i was a kid"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"all my life i have dreamed  where i could do anything, so much so that i'm currently in higher education as a games developer because i thought it would be the only way to see the game of my dreams. now it seems larian has beaten me to it and delivered a masterpiece of design. never have i ever had so many choices, so much freedom, so much potential. throughout my first and second playthrough much of my time was spent thinking about things to do next time theres that much to do !. you can test your combat skills, slay your foes, discover secrets, cry, or fall in love either with a character that puts real people to shame or with the baeuty of faerun. this is a must play just like elden ring or minecraft or read dead redemtion. even if it's not your genre, this demands your attention."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"a return to what used to be a standard in the gaming industry. a feature complete, microtransactionless game that is well polished. i wasn't one of those hyped for this game. in fact this is my first time playing the series. however doing so takes me back to a time when rpgs had solid fun stories, freedom of choice and yes, not free from the consequences of those choices. the combat took a while for me to understand as did most of the systems of the game but once you do you realize there is an unprecedented freedom in how you approach challenges and combat. what to be sneaky and set up explosive boxes and flamable bottles to nuke an enemy? you can!! want to charge in sword swinging, your mage support casting the big spells that go boom while your cleric keeps you healed and healthy, you can! i looked at the complaints on here before buying the game and frankly i'm happy a friend made me get and play it anything. most whining are either. 1. oh no the game has teh gay and pronouns!! how dare it be so woke seriously grow up. don't wanna play a gay character? then don't. 2. it's over hyped cause game media as someone whom doesn't really follow game media any more cause i know they over hype stuff, i can attest these are just people being contrarian. the it's popular so it must  types. 3. those so brain washed by the game industry that they rush to attack an actual good game cause their favorite dev on twitter said it was bad or... 4. they don't understand dd at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i never thought i'm gonna enjoy so much playing another game after elden ring ,but o boy let me tell you this one is craaaazyyy ,the graphics ,the environment , characters , choices , combat . there is nothing wrong with this game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i don't like the point and click system, i don't like the combat, i don't like the 3d from above. that all reminds me of games from the nineties. the art work is nice, but i get shivers from the voice over. it's not for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"easily the best game to come out in years. no play through has to be the same. can easily be played through over 5 times due to how many choices actually effect the story. the only argument ive seen that is more of an opinion, is that some people wont like the turnbased combat. a lot of the bad reviews i've seen are just toxic people coming over from the star field reviews"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"larian managed to build an absolutely amazing world. some of the characters strafe a bit far from what i would consider to be a classic fantasy scenario, but the overall experience more than makes up for it. the combat feels satisfying and the sheer amount of ways to approach problems are mindboggling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,one of the best crpg game i have ever played. 1 because of act 3 bugs during early access launch.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,ho adorato questo gioco. si vede che larian ha passione in quello che fa. rispetto alle altre case tripla a che ricercano ormai solo il modo di come guadagnare piu' facilmente e di accontentare la massa.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the perfect rpg, bioware should learn from this game, aaa publishers does'nt make games like this anymore, lazy developers complaining about the large scope of the game just shows how screwed up the industry is nowadays."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"amazing oldschool crpg with nice visuals, interesting gameplay and great storyline. perfect game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i was never a fan of crpg games. but good comments online made me try this game. and ohh boyyy glad i checked it. game is amazing, from quests to story line, from world to explore to combat, from great amount of spells to fantastic options to create your own person with skills and acting as you wish. this is goty for 2023, as a game that didnt had huge budget for promotion in media they nailed it in every ascpet of the game. biggest supprise of 2023 soo far. i love it! even if i hated crpgs before!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"a proof that it's possible to make a great game with a soul. more companies should take example from larian, i played their other games and all of them are really good and each one is better then previous one. highly recommend to everyone!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the best experience of the year, the ultimate digital dd experience. the game has a good setting, dialogues and everything needed to make an rpg flow, apart from the incredible graphics. i recommend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"deducting a single point for act 3 because it was buggy and that the endings were lackluster on top of the story beats in act 3 sort of feelings like they were stitched together from the remnants of cut content, they can earn it back with an enhanced edition."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"rpg of the decade....graphics, music, story, 's all top notch. but it's not for everyone... action focused players will not love this turnbasedcombat. for me it is larian's masterpiece and i hope there is more to come from this developer..."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"weakest baldurs game in 2 very important for rpg categories , companions and story . combat is nice exploration is nice too. but you can feel that its name baldurs gate just to get some free marketing . overall good rpg , very medium baldurs gate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,it's good but not the flawless masterpiece it's being held up as. characters are very fan services and annoying. inventory management is a nightmare. the camera is atrocious. game is very buggy and the quality falls of hard after act 1. 5e is not a great system for combat video games unless you're playing a spellcaster. but the rpg aspects are fantastic and it's clearly a labor of love. just hope larian thinks a bit more about qol features in the future.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"this game is a must play if you like rpgs, even if you feel like you may not like turn based combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"500h in and i still want more the amount of ways you can approach quests and combats, the amount of freedom of choice and reaction by the game and is incredible. larian accounted for people to sneak, steal, move objects, etc and have npcs reacting to that. so many hours of cinematic perfection through mocap and just great writing overall"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"masterpiece. absolute masterpiece, larian did it, they made crpgs popular again. the progress they made since dos2 is unbelievable."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,best game i've played in a very long time! so refreshing to play a complete game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i personally feel like the character customization lacks appearance wise. but the classes and multiclass options are great! engaging story and characters. i have a an issue when going between real time and turn base because some enemies will still act in real time when you swith to turn base combat but it's a really fun, and complete game. it's night and day from other aaa games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"nightmare of aaa studios. best rpg ever, best indie game ever. husband of starfield."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en los ltimos aos, banda sonora de 10, grficos muy buenos, doblaje de 10, personajes entraables incluso los que no son jugables, historia de 10. un juego con muchas posibilidades muy variaras y dan ganas de iniciar otra run para ver que pasa es increble lo que hicieron."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"el mejor rpg de la ultima decada como minimo, impresionante en historia, opciones de dialogo, posibilidades en combate, personajes, musica y el apartado artistico es increible. me gusta un monton el divinity original sin ii y el baldur's gate 3 es aun mejor."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i've been playing games since i was 6 i'm 32 now, this is the best game i've ever played. i've tried crpgs in the past but didn't get too far into them because of the size and complexity which was overwhelming. but baldur's gate 3 made a story that is so engaging, with dialogue that feels so real and immersive that i forget time when i'm playing it and can't wait to see what's next. i clocked at 125 h in my first good aligned playthrough and just started another one with a more evil aligned roleplaying and i'm 24 h into the second playthrough and it's already vastly different storywise and gameplay wise since i'm playing another raceclass and i'm using different companions. dialogue options are different, companion interactions are different, questlines went a totally different direction, basically i'm playing the same general story but the road to its end is 7080 different and hopefully the ending will be different. 100 recommend trying this game out! it's a masterpiece in production value, value for money and if you've read anything about the developers, larian studios, you probably saw these are the people you want to support with your money. now go, get lost in the wonders of baldur's gate 3, stop wasting your time on metacritic"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i can't say that i like this type of game very much. but baldur's gate 3 helped me break all my prejudices against the genre.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,not at all like the old games with associated name. this game has nothing to do with baldurs gateseries imo. no communication on realase for macos. act 3 is meh. dnd5e .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"demasiado contenido y sin desperdicio. las misiones secundarias para nada parecen relleno y congenian muy bien con la linea argumental. practicamente el juego es un 1010, a pesar de algun bug menor, que muchos fueron fixeados pocos dias despues del lanzamiento."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,no recuerdo juego que haya disfrutado tanto. tan ambicioso y tan bien logrado al mismo tiempo.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"how is this possible to make such good and detailed game? i hated turn based games cause i thought they were boring, but this masterpiece totally changed my mind"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the lack of micro transactions and relative polish justify the game's price tag. i disagree with negative reviews that this game is too expensive for what it is. larian are to be lauded for sticking to proconsumer methods. that being said, the content of the game is bad. the voice acting at times sounds soundboothy, and it isn't helped by the insufferable dialog and character writing. the combat is tedious and boring. i get a lot of people like this game, and find it liberating. i found it surprisingly limiting for creative choices after hearing about the vast freedom. the clips i see of people going omg that worked all seem fairly obvious to me. sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. i don't think it's a good game, but i respect larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"ok, this is without a doubt those kind of game you get once every 1020 years. thank you larian. divinity was amazing too but this is just same with the quality of fully and amazingly done va which makes the difference a lot. the scope and imersion is huge. hats down and respect!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,lots of bugs and outdated gameplay. this goes to show how overhyped some types of entertainment gets.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"this game gave me a lot of freedom in the first act and a little in the second, but the third act is a terrible mess and the ending of the game is very weak. but that doesn't take away from what the game is about, one of the best rpgs ever made. i really hope that larian fixes this and gives us everything that was cut, to have a complete experience as promised."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"player choices matter, the grapics are great, the full phb is included, the story is stellar, branching... i guess if i try real hard to find negatives i would say it has some bugs. still the best game that came out it decades."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"for me personally, this game represents the state of the art, for modern rpg's. it is incredible, how much love and care went into the world and questdesign and i love this game to pieces. there is only one thing, that is to be criticised, and that is the worsening performance and technical issues, as i progressed through the game. there wasnt anything gamebreaking, but something has to be done about it and currently it is, as it seems. overall i think, i can fairly say, that this is game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,this is one of the best games ive ever played and hate to say it but i dont get how starfield has earned so many 910 and 1010.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the actual dnd.  no bs characters.  every move counts.  optimizations, but acceptable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the story and pacing are very good for a story driven game. you could easily spend 200 hours on 1 playthrough like i did. my main criticism is the inventory management, which doesnt have enough filter or options to blend certain item groups in or out. if that would be fixed ar some point, it would be a 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"it's .... greatest game. i played lots of pc games start from ultima 7. in my 30 years of game life, baldur's gate 3 is one of the greatest game i've ever met. the game leads me and lures me with so many interesting things also sexy things, of course!!. there is no pushing point. all things are fluid and natural. and the larian make the complicate dd combat system easy to learn and funny. they made it. overall, it is a perfect fantasy world that i live in. thank you larian!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,the best game i ever played. at some points a little bit buggy and slow. but this is to be expected by such a huge game. you can play many times and after i finished the game the first time i rushed to make a new character. i just can't stop playing in the best way possible!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the turnbased combat system destroys all enjoyment of the game. on top of that, the 3rd act is clearly inferior to the previous ones. i also didn't like any of the companions, this hasn't happened to me before in any rpg."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i grew up loving the feeling of getting lost deep in a game  pokmon yellow, skyrim, halo. as i got older, i still love to play but havent felt that deep love and magic in a long time. baldurs gate made me feel like i felt when i would stay up all night with my game boy color, desperate to advance the story a little further. the characters, combat, worldbuilding, and magic are fantastic. couldnt recommend any higher, even as someone who has never heard of larian or played any of their games before. its a little less polished and buggy as you progress, but still a 1010 in its current state."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,larian is a true company that understands what it takes to make gamers happy. this is what a real game looks like.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"a rich and immersive game, with great freedom of action and choices. outstanding characters, an engaging story, fun and so perfectly developed that you can play it several times without getting bored. highly recommended for dd fans, as it's the closest thing to a tabletop rpg ever created. highly recommended for anyone who has never played this type of game as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,absolutely amazing game. the amount of choice in this game is incredible and very impressive. apart from some occasional bugs which is considered normal in todays gaming industry this game doesnt have any issues i can see personally. only recently got into crpg games but this is a massive step up in production value compared to the others. highly recommend to any rpg fan or fans of classic bioware.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"best game in existence right now. complex, well written, fascinating and so much fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"greatest rpg ever, this is master piece! thanks to larian for this amazing experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"great game, hope they make more stories for the game that are not necessarily connected to the main game. characters are awesome, what rules they had to modify for pc from 5th edition rules are done nicely. only issue i have is as wizard i can't craft scrolls to build up my arsenal. overla issue is that there is no type of quest builder for us to make our own maps and play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"easily the greatest rpg i have ever played. a towering achievement in the art of video games. my partner and i have already put 96 hours into our first playthrough and we've only just now crossed into act 3. this is the kind of game that will be looked back on for decades. it will dominate discussions about technical quality, breadth of content, depth of decisionmaking, and ethical standards for game studios. larian haven't just proven that they're at the very top of the art form, they've also proven they can be truly good to their community and customer without ulterior motives. they really did it. they proved that all you have to do is release a great game. they deserve every bit of success that has come their way for what they've delivered."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"as someone who doesn't really play these kinds of games,i will say this game is a breath of fresh air. the story is one of the best i've ever played in gaming, and the character development is insanely well  combat does take a while to get used to as it can be a little slow, especially when theres 50 enemies on the screen it would be nice to have a triple speed for the enemies turnbut anyone saying the combat is bad probably just found the game too complicated and difficult. there are 0 microtransactions and i personally have played 180 hours with one a few laggy spots and only two major bug a boss was bugged for me and a companions romance quest was bugged for me larian deserves all the praise in the world for making arguably a top 3 best game of all time,dont listen to the little crybabies review bombing the game because the game was too hard for them or they just played a dnd game without even liking dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"best rpg ever! characters, dialogues, several ways to solve missions and this replayability is at the highest level. 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"this is not game of the year, this is the best game of the last decade, a game that we hope it will change the industry and reivindicate the rpg genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"literally the best game i've ever played. there's thousands of hours of content, an amazing story, companions with deep personal interactions and stories. gameplay is amazing. its absolutely worth playing and replaying"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"this game far exceeded my expectations. the role playing is great, voice acting is great, the characters are actually interesting, you can talk to animals, like all of the animals. this is easily the closest that a video game has ever gotten to feel like playing an inperson campaign of dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i forgot the last time i played an rpg with writing this good. game developers have been really lazy in my opinion about their writing but this game does not disappoint. a really good game, its got my vote for game of the year."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i didnt expect to like this game as much as i do and i never rate games a 10 but this is a game i cant stop thinking about. that hasnt happened since i was a child. i cant say what exactly is so great about it because i agree with a lot of criticism of this game. its not perfect by any means, but its still incredible game and the only game in the past decade besides factorio that i think truly deserves a 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,1010 greatest crpgs ever made. words are not enough to describe this game. perfect
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"great rpg, if the main character were also voiced, it would be a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,one of the best rpg games ever. a player who doesn't like the genre will love it. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i can say confidently that this is one of, if not the greatest rpg i have ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"a lot of stuff from early access was cut of or totally dumbed down on release, in matter of days. game is hand holding now, super easy to the point that battle may have been cut off aswell. things like attribute points for each race, they use to differ, now they don't because its racist i guess. on top of that most of studios effort went to act 1 which is a bait as it was developed for 5 years in early access it was a hint a showcase a proof how game should  would be. but it is a lie. so, act 1 being good, act 2 being mediocre, act 3 story and environment all stuffed in cramped. there is also forced diversity in terms of sex, and i don't mean bisexual romance, i mean how most white men are not only portrayed as bad or weak, they also lack in game. women are in charge for everything. i am a feminist and i feel like these revenge attitudes are just annoying witch hunt that makes games and movies predictable thus boring. it is an age we are living, each has its symptoms, children of the future will facepalm and  or eyeroll when they look upon it. game is more neverwinter nights then baldur's gate. there are not enough diverse environments because diversity was forced elsewhere like i stated above. it is still a good game, just not a perfect score like modern marketing professionals would make it. there are plenty of bugs, and camera keeps fighting the player. voice acting and music is good. graphics are good except environment stuff like mountains cliffs etc. anyway, same thing happened to diablo 4, hype aggressive marketing that makes mindless consumers defend it with their life. with few fixes it would be 1010 but those are not gonna happen. 810"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"baldurs gate 3 is an amazing game, with an amazing story, great characters, and fun combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"the game follows 5e dungeons and dragons and is set in the forgotten realms. the writing does a great job tying in forgotten realms lore and weaving in interesting stories with all of the potential companions. i appreciate how much choice you have in developing their stories as you progress. in terms of the main plot i think they did a good job from start to finish making it a memorable campaign. you can do a lot to alter how the game ultimately ends even if there is a path laid out before you, much like playing through one of the many dd book adventures. mechanically there are differences between this game and the tabletop game but mostly in the form of removing small nuanced rules to make it a bit more accessible for a wider audience. however this means some builds can be pretty wild, because those restrictions exist in the tabletop game for balance reasons. but even so the scale of the game and the enemies, especially on tactician, make it a worthwhile ride whether you're hyper optimized or not. i'll be playing this for many years to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,i was not expecting to enjoy this game so much. i was reluctant about buying this game since it was turned based. but what a journey it is. the story the characters the freedom in gameplay. a game with full experience and no micro transactions. congratulations to larian studios
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,imagine what type of lives some people lead to give this game a bad rating.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"das beste spiel aller zeiten. es bestraft einen nicht fr verrckte entscheidungen, sondern macht daraus auch noch interessante konsequenzen die teilweise viel lustiger sind."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,that's a really really good rpg. from battle to charakters personality and storry is all perfect for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,this is the best 60 i've ever spent in my life .its worth every second u in the game  larian 4rever
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"it's a good game. larian really did a good job. i preordered the game a long time ago and was surprised to play it in the ea version. after the official version came out, it really brought me a lot of surprises."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"best rpg experience, very deep system and expandability, highly recommended!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"this game is brilliant! i love faerun and not even one game has come close to portraying this world so well to me as the baldur's gate series. and you know what? bg3 is the best at doing it. the game is full of interesting characters, situations, and tactical battles, which makes me want to play more, and more. i am about 170h's into the game, and it's still my first playtrough. and you know what? i just cannot wait for my next session with this diamond. most games nowadays bore me pretty fast. even the best triple aaa titles often cannot satisfy me enough, they are simply boring because of repetitiveness. even the great god of war had this effect on me. here every battle is different, every situation can be approached differently, and every dialog can be played in multiple ways. i could go on, and on like this but you get my meaning. if you like larian latest games, then there is simply no way that you will not like bg3. there are some minor technical problems many of which fixed already me, but they do not matter if take the whole game into account."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"hands down, the best crpg to date. you will not find a game that has the same level of polish and quality permeating the gameplay the way baldurs gat 3 has it. this game is truly a masterpiece. systems, story, roleplay, graphics, cutscenes, dialog, uiux, everything is a 1010 and a piece of art!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"seit release kann ich an nichts anderes mehr denken. ich bin so tief in diese welt gesunken, dass ich garnicht mehr raus will oder kann. viele spiele haben mein herz erobert, aber dieses hat in wenigen spielstunden platz 1 meiner liste erreicht und dabei ein spiel verdrngt, fr das ich seit 7 jahre schwrme. wo bleibt onlyfangs?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i am giving bg3 a 1010 because i've never had a game make me feel like a kid for a very long time, not since skyrim. i tried bg3 at early access with no expectations whatsoever and it ended up being the best choice i had ever made. i was never interested in turn based games before this point and i can gladly say it's been so fun. bg3 is full of depth and intrigue and there's so many ways to play this game and the choices you make always feels like it matters. on top of the content within the game  larian studios makes its playerbase feel like they are heard, they respond to critique and bugs and stay in constant communication with us. what a wonderful game and a wonderful company! thank you for letting me feel like a kid again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i love larian and their passion for videogames, baldur's gate 3 reflects this and much more. this should be the new standard for the bigger companies, we as customers deserve a win."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"fantastic game and a masterclass for gaming studios. i'm a huge fan of the bg series since the first opus 20 years ago, this one brings back the thrill of the original ones and much more. big congratz and thanks to larian for this gem"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,epic game setting a new bar for all other developers. can't stress enough how great this is as a dd game. would love to see community quests and maps and challenges added.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,divinity original sin 2 is my all time favourite rpg and bg3 raised the bar on every level. at least for my first 15h experience.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"we play with wife on ps5 via split screen. now we have a lot of new topics to talk together. and we wait for the end of the working day to quickly come home and start playing! the game is very diverse, interesting and beautiful! and we just want to say  many thanks to the developers! this is one of the best games we have ever played!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"absolute masterpiece you wont be able to stop playing. the characters, the story, the combat, the locations crpg are back."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,im too stupid to understand dungeons and dragons most zero star reviews
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,the best rpg game to date and from now on probably the best game i have ever played. the world is so full of life that it is not possible not to get lost in it in the first 10 minutes of playing. acting and voice acting is phenomenal! so is the overall story which is full of surprises and unknowns. it is so unique that i couldn't even guess where the game is going to go after act ii. this is no ordinary game. play it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"goty  i tyle. jest troch niedorbek, ktre na bank zostan poprawione. zostanie troch wkurzajcych rzeczy, ale za pierwszy kontakt z gr, za rodkowy kontakt z gr i moe nie tak bardzo za kocwk  naley si 10. ta gra po prostu jest dych, nie tylko dlatego, e w zalewie redniakw byszczy."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"this is my first pp game i ever played and honestly i was sceptical about the battle system and at first i had my problems with it, but not because of the game, beacause i am so used to the usual combat system that i had to rethink  and that was the best decision i made! this game is a masterpiece i am so into the story, the companions, it really pulls me in. in a way i have never experienced before. i am so thankful for this adventure, this game is full of live and love. i will play it for many many many hours. and i will enjoy every minute of it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"my first experience with the series began with the third part and i did not regret it, in the game i met a good story and rpg component one of the best in the history of games, decent graphics, well and the most interesting thing that the game is perfectly implemented cooperative, you can enjoy the game playing with friends stack of 4 people and the game is absolutely friendly to this. the interface and control is intuitive, reminiscent of divinity original sin 2 and similar games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"great game, 10 out of 10 great storyline, graphics, characters hope for goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,some fps issues but a lot of texture pop ins. not a fan of turn base games and think this game even if pulling away from its origins didnt really require turn based strategy even so story was ok. the fact that they used this game for clout and still are has put a dark shadow over it for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"very hard to stop playing. fantastic voice acting, beautiful graphics, interesting characters and meaningful choices. and so much to explore plus excellent replayability. that's baldur's gate 3!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,larian ha hecho un trabajo a la altura de muy pocos en donde se le nota el cario que han puesto al titulo gran libertad gran historia grandes personajes muy rejugable maravilloso la unica pega que podrian haber profundizado mas en las relaciones entre tus compaeros y que no todo gire entorno al avatar asi como en el campamento eso de que cada uno este clavado en su sitio sin mirarse creo que ya deberia de quedar en el pasado
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,it's so amazing i had to create a metacritic account for the first time just to give it a 10
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"it did justice to the best game of all time which is, bg2. the only thing better than that is bg2. this is known."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"timo jogo, narrativa, jogabilidade, cenrios, imerso, tudo maravilhoso, melhor jogo do ano e um dos melhores rpgs de todos os tempos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,me senti numa mesa de dd. nostalgia pura. histria divertida e personagens carismticos.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"a beautiful story told with so many permutations it's mind boggling. the voice acting is top notch, down to even the most random npc and there are so many of them. one of the most notable games in a decade or more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"fantastic game, i have been hooked right from the start, the well designed maps aren't extremely massive and packed enough to ensure throughout the journey there is never a moment of running around without something exciting happening. for those that don't like turnbased games this may not be them, but it should be a reason for many of the low scores on here. characters are well developed, story is incredible so far still going and it just feels like the plot thickens at every turn."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"it's a good crpg. nothing more, nothing less. pros  dialogue  characters  story arcsquest design  graphics cons  maps that are designed to railroad you  atrociuous camera  too lengthy dungeon parts  there's a combat literally around every corner"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"every details ingame is perfect, the journey and end is mostly satisfied. the only thing that i found sad is the cut content most from act 3. the replayability is so good each playthrough always show something new that you miss or didn't notice from the first playthrough. the freedom you have to play how you want to play. the story telling is really good and complete, voice acting and facial expressions of the characters are amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"this is 100 goty material. the scale of this game is massive, the story for every single quest is unique, the characters are interesting except for wyll, idk buddy, you are boring. while there are some performance issue on an older gpu i use rx 570 4gb like the vulkan not working at all and sometimes when it does work, the game will freezes to the point you need to restart pc. but the game is absolutely beautiful and immersive, the amount of replayability is near infinite."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"the best rpg to come out and one of the best games ever, it's not perfect but it captures the true potential that the genre can achieve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,wonderful game. certainly the best rpg ive played in years. going down as one of my all time favorites.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"larian earned this. they have been working tirelessly to innovate crpgs and, as a result, got the license to build with the dd ip. the game is gorgeous, beyond gorgeous. the characters are fascinating and well realized. the plot is engaging. the combat is intense and brilliant. is this dos3? no. not at all. only a very superficial look would come to that conclusion. when you're exploring the underdark with a githyanki, or talking about the beliefs of sylvanus in a druid grove, you will not feel any divinity ip. this is a forgotten realms entrenched game, worthy of the baldur's gate name."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,this is the kind of game that only appears once every 15 years. what a great experience i love it. it has some quirks with combat and the resting mechanic but overall the quests the companions and the amount of content is pure gold. a must for every rpg lover.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"i've always loved the rpg genre, where the best games create a world that you can immerse yourself in, and characters that you can grow to love, all while giving you the choice to shape it all. crpgs in particularly really take those points to heart, but i've always found them a little hard to get into. baldur's gate 3 takes that focus, turns up the choices, the reactivity, and also turns up the production values to make an easily accessible, but still super deep rpg where the world reacts to your choices. and you have a ton of freedom on what to do. it's mind boggling. add to that, well written characters and quests, and you have the goty for 2023."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"if you liked dos2 and add rules, you can only like this bg3. larian goes so far in terms of rpg mecanics, stories, progression system and multiple choices. everything will have an impact, meaning you can spend 250 hours playing as a good, finish it and replay another class, doing another choices as a bad and you will have a totally new experience. try it, you can spend more than 1000h on this masterpiece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"as much as i enjoy pathfinder and similar games, baldur's gate 3 is absolutely the best introductory experience to dnd concepts. the game really shines in cinematics, character customization, spell variety, and the seemingly endless amount of choices the player can make. i've put over 200 hours into the game and there are still whole zones, major characters, etc. that i haven't seen yet. your character's race, religion if applicable, and behaviors all affect the way that the world responds to you. the soundtrack is beautiful and the characters and world design are both fantastic. if you enjoy the sometimes bizarre and unexpected moments in games from developers like machinegames, you'll find similar moments in baldur's gate 3. the companions are all welldeveloped and a fandom has developed around each of them. my main criticisms of the game are minimal. the player's face animations during dialogue are truly bizarre, it became a meme pretty quickly but it really is distracting at times. these moments are incredibly rare, but there are moments where certain parts of the game break. for instance, there's a part of the game where a character wants to raid a village and tells you to meet them there. if you already killed everyone at the village though, that character never shows up and disappears for good, meaning that you lose out on a potential companion. not gamebreaking, but still annoying. also, with one of the characters, i was right at the start of the romantic route with them and they said they are strictly nonmonogamous, which isn't for me personally. so i backed out and said we should be friends. the next day, this character was calling me lover. i also find sorting items in the bag to become overwhelming late game. but truly, considering how massive the game is, there are few issues. ultimately i think bg3 definitely deserves goty and may be the best game of the decade. i enjoy seeing people experience dnd mechanics for the first time and finding out that they're much better at it than they thought they would be. bg3 opens up the world of ttrpgs to new people and gives them lasting memories. with dark urge, three difficulties, and a variety of mutually exclusive paths in game, there's also high replay value. i eagerly await to see what larian does next."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,best game ive ever played. can recommend to anyone who likes rpgs or any new fan!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"melhor jogo da larian e um dos melhores rpg's da atualidade, muita diversidade de maneiras de jogar com bastante classes e subclasses, a histria  tima e te prende do inicio ao fim e os desenvolvedores alm de ouvir o feedback dos jogadores trazem melhorias rapidamente para o jogo, muito diferente de outros estdios desse tamanho. este jogo no vai agradar a todos devido ao combate por turno mas deveria receber uma chance por todos que gostam bastante de rpg's"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,an absolute masterpiece. what a feeling to finally again play a game that bleeds passion while also circumventing many of the modern gaming pitfalls. it's up there with the witcher 3 for best and most immersive rpg i've ever played.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"simply put, baldur's gate 3 is one of the best roleplaying games i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"this is a video game , no microtransactions, no pass, not an unfinished game splitted in some dlc's, god i'm so happy so see that we are not stuck in this loop. 10 for karlach tho."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,cara que rpg fantastico  como se tivesse transportado o rpg de mesa pra dentro dos jogos
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,is an epic and masterful gaming experience that unquestionably deserves a perfect 10. this review aims to justify this rating by highlighting the aspects that make the game a masterpiece in the rpg genre.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"it's simple. this game showed us how good a game can be in 2023. not like bethesda, ubisoft, activision, blizzard, companies with tons of resources but with no quality standards."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,the best game i've played in the decade! the love the developers put into this is stuning. thank you larian for this materpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"larian really knows how to make their games feel so dang immersive and well put together. this one, no doubt, is the biggest and most kickass game ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"bg3 is the pinnacle of crpg and rpg, in an era where publishers are looking for more and more ways to make money from their unfinished, generic and lacking in depth games. bg3 represents a transcendental milestone in games, where the player can interact with any npc in a high quality cutscene, whether in visual andor voice acting, where talking to a random vendor npc, you become attached to the charisma of the character in a few minutes. with an unparalleled depth of dialogue, choices, and gameplay, bg3 is a triumph unseen in gaming history in every possible way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"an high level experience of rpg gaming. while playing, i really dived into the world and its characters, i'm personally not a big fan of the turnbased rpg, but the way the turns works on this games is juts satisfying and really fun to play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"generation's game was my gateway into the baldur's saga, and what an entrance it was. the depth it adds and the experience it brings to the dd tabletop is spectacular. it's a shame about the level 12 cap and perhaps some lack of optimization in act3, but that would be nitpicking at this point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,i can't give this game a 10 because of some basic oversights by larian. e.g. no gruff voice option in character creation spoiling the roleplaying of any dwarf or halforc for me. would be a good dlc to add.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"when looking back at larian's works, the most interesting part is gameplay. and they did it very well again. 3a standard also made fantastic experience. but there is something missing, something very important when playing crpg  story. i'm not talking about setting or others. there is no twist no epic no memorable moment in this game. i'm feeling like tourist visiting baldur's gate. quite a view! but that's all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"a new age of crpg starts with one that stands above all its predecessors in terms of overall quality. while some might argue that planescape keeps the crown for plot, there are few games, or media projects in general, that can meet the heights of cinematic immersion, character development and accessible yet enjoyable gameplay which are demonstrated by bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"this is the best game i've played in the last 20 years. it's such an immersive experience with a compelling story that'll lead anyone, even those who are not familiar with topdown crpgs will love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"some games are beautiful, some are good, some are wellwritten, some are all about interactivity, some about great lore... but sometimes, rarely, some write the history of the video game industry and set new standards, bg3 being one of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,game of the year! game of the year! game of the year! game of the year! game of the year!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,where's the pause menu? how could such a basic feature be overlooked? far from larians best game simply because divinity 2 was a more complete version of this.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"jogo muito bom para entrar no rpg de mesa, grficos muito bom e liberdade na historia"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"slam dunk, baby! didn't think they would be able to surpass the quality  like divinity 2, but what do you know  they just did. than you, larian, for proving that the gaming industry isn't all crooked and lacklustre. thanks for not stuffing your pockets with our cash without giving us something memorable in return. i recently bought the cashgrab named 'diablo 4' at full price, so playing a soulful game with real and creative content like this was refreshing, to say the least. keep up the amazing work! i hope more studios will see this as a motivation to up their game, because the gaming and even movie industry need to be revitalised  and soon. the general expectations of such forms of entertainment are dumbing down each day."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"no doubt one of the best games released this decade. from stunning graphics to immersive storytelling. this game is simply a masterpiece, 1010, would buy again. probably will buy again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"almost perfecf, but act iii and evil way still need to be fixed. cinematics, side quests, larian humor, companions are one of the best in gaming history even if everyone want you in sexual way"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,deliciously interesting and absorbing makes me stay up all night fun to make various character builds and use skills
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"honestly one of the best games i have played in a long time. it is a true masterpiece. this genre never really pulled me in but with baldur i can't put it down. i would reccomend this game to every gamer. the story is very intriguing, the combat is more then fun. graphics are beautiful and you can truly see the devs put a lot of effort in this game. it all works so well. not only do they listen to their fans, they go beyond. it is a pinnacle  in a time where a lot of anticipated games disappointed or straight up failed and i hope more game devs learn from this game. going back to play right now"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"definitely a  storyline is great , the attention to details impressive and the characters side quests very rich ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"i never played a baldurs gate game before and the cover art looked like this was going to be garbage. i grew up addicted to star wars knights of the old republic 1  2, dragon age origins, runescape and wow. other than wow and osrs the kotordao style games fell off the face of the earth. ive spent years wondering when a game like this would be made. the graphics are outstanding, it actually runs well, and its unbelievable how detailed it is. the little stuff goes a long way. salami can be food or a crappy weapon. its little touches like that that i just love about this game and its actually pretty challenging depending on how you want to play"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"it's not for me the main quest is too long, the world isn't open enough, combat is unnecessarily difficult"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,best game i've ever played! the kind of game you dreamed of playing as a kid when it couldn't be done. immersion is total and the writing great.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"i registered an account on this site only to say thank you to the devs, this is the best game i've ever player and i've played a lot of games really, from age 6 to 35 now. thank you for the passion and devotion you put into this game. i truely feel it. thank you for making this game the best you could and respecting the players. this game has everything and even more. let this be an example for the gaming industry. love you larian  love bg3."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,playing this game for 2nd time and still discovering new stuffs. the best rpg game in 2023
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"the game is ok but far from being a good game, except the graphism, there are a ton of issue, but i'll explain in french  jeu truff de bugs mme aprs de nombreux patch j'ai connu moins de bugs en jouant au dernier jeu pokmon..., mais bizarrement accept comme tant une norme pour les joueurs pc...  temps de chargement extremement long mme avec un bon pc.  un tutoriel trs mal foutu, quasi absent, j'ai appris l'usage de la touche alt uniquement grce  des vidos aprs 50h de jeu, par exemple !  les romances claques au sol, on peut passer tout notre temps avec tel ou tel compagnon, avec une affinit excellente mais il ne se passera rien avec, et pourtant des personnages avec qui on aura quasiment eu aucune interaction vont nous forcer  coucher avec... car oui, soit on a une proposition pour les recaler trs violemment, soit toutes les autres seraient mme lorsque cela n'est pas dit explicitement des invitations  baiser.  on remarque que le second degr et l'ironie est totalement absent du jeu, cd qu'il faut prendre au pied et  la lettre tout ce qui est dit, a tue l'immersion dans un rpg !  la gestion des items est catastrophique, les items mettent parfois du temps  apparatre, le tri automatique est malfoutu, et on ne comprend pas pourquoi ils ne sont pas automatiquement rangs dans les sacs de notre inventaire, on ne sait pas quels items ont de l'importance ou s'ils servent juste  la revente.  la gestion de la camra est au moins aussi catastrophique, notamment lorsque les combats se font sur plusieurs tages...  quant au scnario et lore, il est bon et organique, mais loin d'tre extraordinaire pour ne pas dire convenu. en fait c'est du niveau d'une prod netflix, a se suit.  pas de vf, zelda totk et starfield en ont, qualit qu'avait un jeu tel que tw3 aussi...  c'est un reskin de dos2 avec un gameplay simplifi  jet de d qui selon moi n'est pas toujours pertinent.  ll'exploration est trs mal rcompense, surtout quand il s'agit de looter 150 pices d'or et un vieux parchemin... une manire artificielle d'allonger la dure de vie du jeu en mettant plein de vasescaisses que l'on va vrifier dans l'espoir de trouver un objet un minimum prcieux."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"the best game i've ever played! the concept of choice matter is clearly in action, not just decoration."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,this is likely the most immersive and fun rpg ever made. a faithful intuitive dd adaptation that is intuitive to control without being clunky. balancing depth amd ease is t easy but larian nailed it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"this game is one of the great games we'll be speaking about when we're all too old to move out of bed. baldur's gate 3 combines an actual love of development with an established franchise, and, wow, it does it so much justice it's mind boggling. very few other games have somehow simulated a table top gaming experience quite like baldur's gate 3 has. the attention to detail is so overwhelming that a player can spend almost a hundred hours just in the first act reading, inspecting, talking to animals, and hordes of other content hidden just behind the mind's eye. in most games, this element of detail is completely lost especially in recent times. this game recaptures the magic of some of the oldest games i've played that were far ahead of their time. there is so much customization, story pathing, and more that i could see a player being overwhelmed after being trained on recent games regurgitated by scam artists pretending to be developers. this game has no dlc, no microtransactions, no in game store, and was made by a team that actually cared about their game enough that it reminds me of old blizzard it reminds me of a time when blizzard were still just lovable gamers making a great game. there are some minor bugs, and flaws, but every great game has those and they are minimal enough that they do not hinder gameplay at all. most bugs are solved by a simple reloading of a save, a ui trick to reset the moment, or any number of simple solutions. i haven't even finished this game yet, and it's already in my top five games played of all time. alena"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,incredible. this game should be the pattern for future games. more about immersion and choices and less about cinematics.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,great game from a passionate developer. i bought it during early access. very versatile game with lots of character development and choices.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,the best rpg game i've ever played in my life and all those who give 0 scores have their heads closed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"baldur's gate 3 is definitely an achievement for larian that will likely catapult them to new heights, but for as much as the game tries to tie itself to the legacy of baldur's gate and baldur's gate ii, it doesn't have the spirit of those games. it's its own thing, closer, by all accounts, to larian's wellregarded divinity series than to the titans that have spawned numerous spiritual successors over the last 10 years or so in particular in another world, where those two games weren't foundational to the gamer i am today, i might be able to look at this game with the fresh eyes i know so many others are seeing it with, but that's not the world i'm in. if you're looking specifically for a baldur's gate 3 because you loved the tone, writing, and gameplay of the originals, you probably won't find any of those here if larian truly meant to make a worthy successor to baldur's gate i and ii, they would have done well to properly study what made those games, as well as their many spiritual successors, so greatinstead, we have a game that has the surface trappings of baldur's gate, but none of its soul if you don't have the history that i do with the original games, or you're a fan of larian's other isometric offerings, you might find plenty to love here, and if so, i'd recommend checking out the many other positive reviews, because i do think there's a lot to celebrate here. i'm just not the one to celebrate it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"recommend, love it everything in this game is awesome, choices, story, really addicting"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"i was waiting 23 years. totally worth it. gameplay, story, music and npcs are over the top. and it still has classic baldurs gate vibe."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,best game of all time by far. larian have outdone themselves with this one. well done larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"fix act 3 and mintharra a great deep dive in dnd experience. every piece of the game is a handcrafted to make your choices relevant. its probably the most ambicious rpg game that i ever played,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,maybe the greatest rpg ever! a true masterpiece. everybody should experience this epic game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,ce jeux est parfait de quoi bien s occuper rien vu de tel depuis witcher 3 je le conseille
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one of the best games in sense of story, characters, replayability etc. however, my biggest disappointments with game were 5edition dnd ruleset and the lack of exploration of the game. the game feels very linear. the feel of freedom in the game and the exploration is very different compared to the original two games which i love. hopefully larian will add more exploration maps to the game, since now the game and its world feel too narrow."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"deceived that the stream lags, although act 3 lags. deceived that the plot will not be around illithids. there are no quests for the goblin faction. very easy fights. well, a lot of bugs. boring plot. boring characters. early access v2.0"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"yes, i hopped on the hype train for this one. however early access did give me some justification for this. the full game still managed to exceed my expectations."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"one of the greatest rpgs of all times. awesome character creation, tons of choices and their consequences and perfect representation of dd in video game format."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"jogo top, muito bom. feliz por ter jogado, larian  god e merecem todo sucesso. espero que haja um melhoramento do ato 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"absolutely a work of love from the developers. beautiful graphics  music, amazing writing.. a game where choices actually matter if you wanted you can just kill off any main character and the game doesnt miss a beat, but more than that, the game constantly presents moral dilemmas which arent easy but certainly are consequential. i cant imagine i wont play this through 56 times at least, if not more. just wow."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"a wellbuilt world, lots of quests and perfectly written characters. the combat system and the multitude of mechanics is what i expected from bg3. the best thing about this game is that each quest can be solved in at least several ways"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,this is an absolutely amazing rpg la creacin de personajes es una de mis partes favoritas. la historia se hace muy entretenida y rejugable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"bg3 is a triumph in modern rpg gaming. it's a game that not only lives up to the legacy of its predecessors but also sets a new standard for storytelling, character development, and immersive gameplay. larian studios a belgian company has not only rekindled the magic of baldur's gate but has also raised the bar for the entire genre. prepare to be enchanted, challenged, and utterly captivated by this fantastic game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"the best game of recent years. 3d story rich rpgs are not exclusive to shooters, fighters, or drivers. a rpg without annoying actions that even civ 6 players can enjoy. turn based games do not require high level attention as action based games, so you generally can enjoy these game for a much longer time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,amazing. i am so happy i finally had that itch scratched... remember the magic of morrowind? want to feel that again? get bg3!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"great story, in depth charactersbuilding. it's not easy to jump into, which is one reason it's not a 10. the amount of different play styles that can be had is immense. exploring is rewarding. the characters side stories and surprisingly meaningful. i like the linear feel with since it allows the devs to tailor the atmosphere to what's going on in the story. open world games struggle with this and everything just blends in and the story just revolves around big areas that end up looking and feeling the same. decision making is huge. very few games pull this off. pc to ps5 is amazing. overall i'm happy and can talk forever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"fantastic game, shoved well over 70 hours into it. class creation is solid, some are a little op as it's not completely balanced like any whack it class with haste buff or dual classes caster. laeian definitely went with the if it moves and has more lines of dialog then 8 you can sleep with it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"i had to make a metacritic account just to give 10 points for this game, it that good. every choice feel meaningful. best rpg i ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,una obra maestra increble. una pena que haya gente dando votaciones negativas por rencor entre plataformas. este juego es un 1010. goty absoluto
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"i think this is as close as you can get to playing a dd game as a video game. the sense of freedom in your choices is, quite simply, unmatched. the game has plenty of problems due to the reliance on the dd ruleset mind you. but i don't think it could be done any better than this. the problems aren't due to the implementation. it's due to the rules themselves often being very black and white. either hit or miss the target. even when it makes no sense to miss when looking at it visually. when you play a dd game you have a human dm. that dm is interested in making a fun game for the participants. that also means sometimes bending the rules a bit. and baldur's gate 3 basically implements this by letting you quicksave and quickload as much as you want. i'd go as far as calling this a necessity. you will run into some bad luck streaks. be it in battles or with dialog choices. and quite frankly this can be extremely frustrating when it happens. especially since much of the dd rules are hidden behind the veil of stunning graphics and audio. sometimes it feels like the game is deliberately taunting you. as much as i want to, i don't have the patience for a second playthrough right away. so i want this playthrough to count where it matters to me. and that means spamming that quickload button to make sure i exhaust those dialog options and ultimately pick the one that suits me. you never know what awaits you at the other end of a dialog choice. sometimes you thought a choice meant one thing, but then come to realize the tone was completely different to what you thought. it's text, it's not always obvious. and that can ruin some situations when the game tries to squeeze you back into the dialog tree wherever it fits. that sometimes requires a reload. the special classrelated choices are also very hard to decipher. the base die throw required for each are not shown until you've chosen the option. that could use a redesign for better transparency and to save us some quickloads. with all of that said, the game is near perfect when it comes to the entire experience as a whole. there is so much to experience in this game it baffles me it is even possible. there are some weird bugs here and there. i can imagine that being inevitable as the game tries to deal with all of the outcomes of so insanly many interwoven quests and stories. it has to deal with all of it. and it succeeds in ways no other rpg game has done before it. is it perfect? of course not. but it is damn close."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,tengo ms de 200 horas jugando llevo 2 partidas en paralelo. una con un paladn y otra con un hechicero. las 2 historias van distintas en varios casos intent hacer lo mismo pero los dados me llevaron por una nueva historia. el juego es una verdadera obra de arte!! verdadero y puro rol.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,best game i ever played and i'm a gamer for the last 35 years. the story is the best one ever told... even better than any movie or show. this game is amazing. act 2 is the best thing life offered me so far...

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"with so much to do in such a large landscape, it is very easy for hours to pass by in the blink of an eye. my first crpg was divinity original sin and i could not get into it, no matter how many times i tried. bg3 had me hooked instantly. with such beautiful environments, cool story and most importantly, amazing characters that i actually care about. i have even enjoyed the turn based combatonce i learned the strategy of it all. great game! the only thing that stops me from giving it a ten is the annoying turn based combat with the environment. many times you can exit that mode of play, but it is pretty annoying for this to even be a thinga turn base puzzle of ?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"joguei o dois quando tinha uns 17 anos, agora com 41 voltei a ser adolescente com essa obra prima da larian studios. esperando por futuras dlcs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"in this game every aspect of it is done at the highest level, however the board game style gameplay is the style of the old strategy games which i don't really like, however it is worth praising the story in this game, which is really captures, graphics and at the same time quite good optimization, almost complete absence of bugs, also cannot but rejoice. maybe i will not express the most popular opinion now, but many people like this game because of the setting like in dota which is one of the most popular games in the world, and its fans are happy because it is dota with a good story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,i absolutely loved this game. it reminds me of the old bioware games like dragon age origins. i loved this game. i am excited about what comes next.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"anyway, the game itself is shallow and filled with bugs from the very beginning. if you enjoy dd, you can overlook the story, characters and bugs. i'm not sure if you can overlook the awful adaptation of combat though. or the long rest system."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"o rpg definitivo, lore, personagens secundrios e principais, gameplay ttica, consequncia de escolhas."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"one if not the best rpg of all time, easy 10. negative reviews are just trolls."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"i remember playing original baldurs gate series ages ago. while being fun, those games had a ton of problems. just to name a few  unbalanced characters. some classes were just better than others  a huge pile of useless skills with vague descriptions that never worked  inventory management of the whole party, that took enormous amount of time and effort  tricky quests and mazelike maps that made it hard to figure out where to go next  undefeatable enemies. say, you are a mage, but the enemy is 100 resistant to magic  weird dicebased random that feels like 50 no matter the actual chance there is no way the game like this could work in 2023, so i was really curious about how they would apply the old baldurs gate concept to the modern title. ...and boy, apply they did! let us start with graphics and music. they are awesome. they are the best. every asset is so detailed the game could have been a first person rpg. no matter how close you zoom in, or how far you zoom out the game looks great! combined with unique ambient and tracks, they create an unforgettable atmosphere be it a sunny village, or a dark dungeon, they look and feel natural. plot, characters and quests. every character has their own personality, theirs strengths and weaknesses. every quest is unique, highly variable and often unpredictable, with dozens of possible outcomes. there is not a single go kill 10 orks or go gather 3 plants. and the easier it sounds, the more tricky it turns out to be. characters interact with each other, with quests, they react to your choices and offer their opinion about your actions. voice acting and cutscenes are so great, they could have been a movie on their own. freedom. the game made me feel like my choices actually matter. it is a long forgotten feeling, when you understand there are no plot rails you must follow. it is the plot that follows you! nothing is predetermined. nothing forces you to be on the good side. for example, nothing prevents you from attacking any, i repeat, any! character. and it's never the end of the road the plot just unfolds in a way you have never expected it to. but the biggest advantage of this game is the sheer amount of content it offers. i have already spent over 50 hours, and it feels like i did not even scratch the surface. it might be hard to describe, but the game just never stops giving. there is one level after another, map after map, quest after quest. distinctly unique, memorable and different. they are surprisingly intuitive too, and, while there are no quest markers most of the time, you will eventually complete all quests, provided you spend some time exploring. the replayability is also huge, as every action matters, and depending on a way you complete your quests, and companions you choose, the playthrough will also change. and tactical possibilities... they are just endless, with hundreds of skills, items, equipment, spells, environments and strategies you can use. i have never seen a game with this much inside. those 90gb were totally worth downloading. there are still some things i did not like, though.  performance could use some improvement. sometimes, the game would just start lagging for absolutely no reason.  characters are indeed unbalanced, some of them are good at single target combat, others can take multiple enemies at once. and then there are some useless ones, with niche skills that can do nothing most of the time. the difference is also huge, and while 1 character does 100 damage per turn, the other one does only 5. so, i imagine being stuck with wrong characters would make for a poor experience. by the way, all items have same numbes, but different secondary skills. also, while a melee character can swing their sword indefinitely, a mage can cast a strong spell twice at best.  inventory management it still a bother, albeit a tiny one now, as they did add a ton of quality of life features.  realdice random is, well, a real dice. no matter how good your character is, even a 98 chance feels more like 50. on the other hand, 10 chance is also more like 50, even though you might have to spam saveload a few times.  quests are impossible to beat the way you want, as, just like in real life, things rarely go the way you expect them to. and, while the game tries to warn you sometimes, there are still some extremely frustrating moments when you accept a quest, go to sleep, and wake up just to find that you have failed it.  companions also disappoint. that cute girl just ignores you, even after you maxed out the relationship meter. but that weird guy just keeps hitting on you, even after you said no 10 times so far. i guess, developers still have some bugs to fix. all in all, the game is totally worth it. i had a ton of fun. there is no scam, like paid dlcs, cosmetic shops, ads or season passes. you just play it, and get the whole experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,best game released in a long while. it has been refreshing to say the least.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,no game is perfect but this one really comes close to exactly what it wants to be for it's players. nearly 200 hours played and still feel there's just so much content i have yet to discover.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"i was waiting for the game, i bought it when it was still in early access. replayed the game 10 times, played 60 hours! and now, finally, the games have been released, for 180 hours, ive been playing with my friends and at the same time im walking around my local company until we reach act 3, but i savor every dialogue, every book, every corner. the game is incredible, larian studios are amazing!!! thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i am extremely impressed with this games ability to capture dnd so thoroughly, do you think something should work a certain way like using silence to break a wall stealthily or throwing a potion to heal an ally, or using a goblin as an improvised weapon against an ogre. the story is fantastic and the companions have fantastic questlines. act 1 alone would be worth the price of this game and a playthrough will easily go over 100 hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"the narrative i experienced felt meticulously tailored to my character and their decisions, and your experience could be vastly different. even the momenttomoment gameplay can vary, depending on your playstyle and how you choose to interact with the world. this game is a absolute masterpiece !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"a future classic. larian made a master piece that deserves to be the game of the year. best writing, technically excellent, very fun, with millions of possibilities top of the top in 2023."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"holy  larian literally saved the rpg genre, i am in awe at how good this game is"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"this game has a lot of options for dealing with a single situation, and is diverse in terms of endings and different play styles. yet in terms of terms based combat as a general mechanism, this game has no real innovation whatsoever. once ive become used to the cliche crpg narrative, the story stops being interesting. the major frame of the game, so to speak, is weak and balance is the off, so it has to introduce a lot of other decorative elements to cover this fundamental flaw. overall a highly overrated game and not nearly as good as other people seem to regard it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"it is breathtaking. they need to work on act 3 but besides that the game is a piece of art. from world itself across battle system as a classic dd and last but not least the music which is so good it really takes you into battlefield. there is so much freedom in this game that when you think if some of your idea works, you can try it and in most cases it works alhtrough in good way or bad way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"this game has so much depth, loads of customization options, and great replayability, it's worth every penny"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"after 120 hours of game i can conclude that this game is a true masterpiece, is by far the best game of this year. i had also purchased other aaa game early access, well, after play it 2 hours, it is not bad, but i returned to play bg3 with no doubt. a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"baldur's gate 3 is the best crpg i've ever played in my life. i truly believe that it was worth buying the game at full price. it provides an amazing gaming experience, giving you a sense of freedom like no other. it's absolutely deserving of the highest praise and i hope it gets game of the year. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,larian's best game and the best crpg right now. this game is literally dnd on steroids and easily be the game of the year. i hope they launch dlc's on future.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,this is the obvious choice for goty. amazing story telling with a beautiful setting. the mechanics are amazing and the replayability is unbeatable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,fantastic experience that have been ruined by bugs and rushed release during the very last stretch of the game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"since i started playing world of warcraft like 12 years ago i've never seen a game like this, i just can't stop playing, i'm in the last act and yesterday i was thinking about my next character, your companions have soul, they are not just random npcs that you control in battle, you can speak with the dead and animals, and they can help you in your missions, this game is perfect, there are some bugs, but i really didn't care about this, it's not like cyberpunk or ac unity"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"it's not perfect mostly technical stuff pertaining to game engine and controls, but i simply cannot stop playing this game and the replayability is second to none! this is what major studios should be aiming to acheive. despite what developers in other studios say, this game does raise the bar for the entire industry and it does so with class!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"juste gnial ! rien a dire tout est dans la note ! le scnario est exceptionnel , les personnages tellement fascinant dans leurs histoires ! tout est gnial"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"within the first 3 hours of the game you can subjugate a creature via lobotomy, stomp on a giant squids head, murder a squirrel, have a snake bite a child, push a gnome down a cliff, and headbutt a vampire, 150 hours later and you're assembling pieces of a clowns body parts as if you're trying to summon exodia the forbidden one. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"gaming is still alive in this day and age. the depth of this game is unreal, the combat is unfamiliar yet fun and engaging. the amount of twists and turns with light humour is sheer brilliance. i love this game, this will go down as one of my favourite games of all time. the amount of passion and pride this was crafting with comes through at every step, sure its not 100 perfect but given the scope and scale of this, you can overlook those tiny bugs here and there. hats off to larian and thanks for keeping my hope in gaming alive! i can't say i remember the last time i completed a game and instantly restarted a new save. i'll be playing this for months."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"might be the most boring combat system ever, if i wanted to roll dice i'd go to caesars palace"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"i love the game,this game gave me emotional highs likened to that of substance abuse"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"simplesmente o melhor rpg que ja joguei na vida. todos problemas que eu tive foram tcnicos e de ui que grande maioria ja foram corrigidos, e alias, foram 4 hotfix e 2 patch em um espao de um mes.  visvel o cuidado e o carinho da empresa para com o jogo e jogador. falando do jogo, se ele nao for o game do ano, o cenrio falhou. o jogo  o suco do rpg de mesa!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"buggy as hell, 3rd act is basically unplayable and the story really drops off. reviewers didn't even finish the game before submitting their reviews and it shows."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"despite some issues in act 3, i havent had this much fun with an rpg in years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,3bug
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"outstanding in every aspect.  engaging and mechanically rich combat that will be both familiar to dd fans and easy to grasp for newcomers, who might very well come out prepared for a new tabletop hobby  enchanting story, filled with fascinating characters. real choice and consequence, expertly plotted. players can carve their own story and are rewarded for role playing.  brilliant and diverse music. borislav slavov and team have created one of the most epic, emotional and immersive soundtracks. sound design  also impeccable.  visually stunning. character animations only contribute to the immersion. only short of being perfect as a result of some bugs and quest glitches in the third act of the game, but given larians past record, that is also likely to be addressed over the coming months."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"one of my most unpleasant experiences in gaming. i can't believe the amount of glitches that have gone on without being patched, after 6 years of development. party members vanishing from the camps, character models t posing during cutscenes, animations that simply don't account for certain sizes halflings, and initiative order not corresponding to what happens. add to that characters that are clearly more useful than others, most social encounters being boiled down to succeed  no combat failure  combat, an overwhelming sense of die and retry as your entire party fails perception rolls over and over again, and needing to go back to camp over and over again in order to change party members with the same spiteful comments thrown in your face each and every time... and you have one of the most unpleasant experiences i've ever been a part of. 30 hours of my life wasted, and one of the worst games i've ever played. i do not understand all the hype, when games handled party management better 20 years ago."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,this is the best crpg ever made. it's a long long game that you will enjoy from the start to end.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"i never liked this style of games, figured i'd give it a try, it's now one of my favorite games of all time. the story, characters, map, quests, music, gameplay, everything is so well done it had me hooked in the first few dozen minutes. i highly recommend this game to everyone and anyone even if it's not your style."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,absolutely one of the greatest games i've ever played. larian has outdone themselves again. divinity original sin 1 was incredible and a milestone in rpgs. they have managed to create yet another masterpiece nearly a decade later.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"baldurs gate 3 is one of the greatest games of all time. the characters are beautifully written, the story is grand and full of twists, the exploration is immensely rewarding, and the game features the best turnbased combat system ive ever played. it feels like the writers and game designers took their one hundred best dd sessions and compiled them into one masterpiece . i have never given a game a 10 out of 10 score, but i thought that this might be the one. the game that ive been waiting for my entire life. dungeons and dragons come to life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,didn't think any game had a chance of beating totk this year for goty. but here it is. the best game i've played this year and an absolute must play on pc. controller support is good too so console versions will be fun too. but this excels with a mouse and keyboard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"if you only have a midrange computer and want to play this to the end, forget about it. act 3 doesn't just have performance problems, it falls from a cliff and can't even die because of the stuttering, freezing and now, after the so called performance patch, ridiculous loading times, where the level never actually stops loading. and even if act 3 was playable, it's like crashing your car at the end of a wonderful road trip through interesting environments and mysteries, only to end up in the slums of glitchy fetch quests, robbing through the sewers of long solved mysteries, dragging out the inevitable and, let's face it, underwhelming finale. but if you are still interested in betatesting this for the actual release on the ps5, you've been warned. but, you'll no longer play the game that is so cool and the best ever that it makes you cool, the cool best game ever people are moving on as we speak. it's a shame, because mechanically, as an actual game, this is a masterpiece. why it wanted to compete with dribblea cinematic storytelling with an engine that is just not up to it it beyond me. this way it got them the attention and money they were going for, but people who actually tried to finish this will look back at it a little different."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"audio, visual, gameplay, scenario... best game ever.and good optimization, of course"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"it catch everything i love in the witcher 3, dos 2, elden ring and rdr2. nothing more to say i think"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,i have no word. amazing game from start to end. there will absolutely be a second and third play trough!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,incredible game. this should be the new standard for rpgs going forwards.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"baldur's gate iii is an incredible adventure, it's not a game anymore, it's an experience, how much love the developers put into it, it really feels like i'm in the middle ages and the atmosphere is so exciting, pulsating and then fed with romance, it's challenging, you have to plan your next move very often balanced played, personally it was so much fun to decide this freedom alone i give 100, i love how each character has a story! i haven't felt so obligated to help an npc in a long time d this game is unique, the amount of ways to progress and master battles is incredible. the feature saving and loading the game and that has pros and cons in my eyes, but even that is still great. i give this game 100 100 chocos pro   endless story you really get immersed in the game and have to think about what you're doing. actions have consequences, that's so awesome  tactics are required in battles  the music is very good, the first time i turn up the bgm  the map design is insane and the fact that everything about the map has a purpose and there is fast travel and 1,000 secrets to find. multiclassing  the perfect successor to divinity original sin 2 by larian studios. best game ive played in the last decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,si te gusta el rol y juegos extensos... te gustar ste juego. no pide unos requisitos tcnicos en pc desorbitados. con una rtx 3060 de porttil y 16 gb de ram de memoria de sistema... va perfecto. todo en ultra. por ponerle una pega... no est en espaol.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this is the best game in a very long time. the standard of how game design should look, unlike the garbage that is now called aaa games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,new game standard. baldurs gate is a real dnd campaign tuta u can di play with friend. every run can be a different game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"great game! i found out that i dont much like dnd aspects but this is the first rpg since dragon age origins that reminded me of it best rpg of all times. fantastic writing, good characters, good worldbuilding"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this game made me make an account and care to rate it. i dont care much for opinions, or people putting things on a pedestal but this game deserves goty or decade for that matter. everything is well thought out and meticulous. there's actual story that isnt rehashed, and a myriad of options on how to deal with things. well done, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"im an old and jaded adult that isnt a fan of crpgs so i was skeptical. im tired of the recently bias of gaming but its true, this is a masterpiece. yes, there are flaws and some reviews have good criticism of the game, the bugs in the late game are unacceptable. luckily, its not cyberpunk level of bugs so it is playable for most people. that, along with the goodwill they rightful earned, is why they have been given a pass by most gamers. whether thats right or wrong, you tell me. the story and character development ranges in quality from mediocre to masterful. the combat is very fun even though i dislike pretty much every turn based game. theres so many options for player choice in build, execution and agency that it can be overwhelming at least in the class i chose. i think ill give more crpgs a chance and thats a great compliment to larian. any review complaining about wokeness can be disregarded as political whining. larian made the game they wanted to thats not full of microtransactions and thats what i want from devs. i'm glad larian was in the position to be able to deliver that to us. even if you're not a fan of the game its a net positive for gamers to have another massive successful in the standard business model."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this is the best crpg game i have ever played and i have played a lot of them. it may even be one of the best games i have ever played. definitely in my top five and i've been gaming since the snes. if you're into this genre it's a must play. if you're into gaming it's worth a try. i'll admit it won't be for everyone. for what it offers itself as though masterfully done, exquisitely crafted."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,a great game by larian studio. an amazing adventure. a hugely expanded game with tons of gameplay options. for a fan of rpg games a musthave item. i recommend and look forward to the console release as well. one of the few games to which with a clear conscience i can give 1010.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"makes turnbased combat interesting by giving it a verticality not often found in other turnbased combat games. i wish some more story was added into the 3rd act, but seeing the support for the game from larian has me optimistic that bg3, which is already a masterpiece, will become a timeless classic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,it is a very good game. i have been playing for 100 hours and it seems to me that it is created with a lot of love.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"an absolute masterpiece that is going to easily win goty. much like last years elden ring, this is the definition of a once in a decade game. well done larian. congratulations on joining fromsoft in the category of a company producing games that are instant buys due to a dedication to unparalleled quality."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,one of the best games ever created. this and elden ring are shining beacons in a see of filth that we keep getting lately.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this is the best game ever made in 57 years. magnus opus from larian studios, they have been mastering their skills to create a great turnbase rpg for more than 25 years. if you want the game being perfect from any perspective  wait for a few months for the game to get some patches. they will fix perfomance issues, balance issues and etc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"a new standard for rpgs and character dynamics. bg3 actually lets you feel like your character ranging not just from combat, but to character interactions and dialogue."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"bg 3  is a great party roleplaying game that forces you to immerse yourself in a magical world of intrigue, exciting battles and difficult decisions. at the time of the game's release, both i and my friends had almost no bugs. optimization did not cause complaints. interesting and thoughtful characters, beautiful and thoughtful locations. decisions have an impact on the progress of the game. there is always a desire to start the game from the beginning to try to pass this or that place in a different way or with a different hero. the plot is interesting and works with the player very well. it allows you to read a few steps ahead and build your own guesses and theories, which adds to the intrigue  did i guess right? the combat system is what you would expect from a game like this and from dnd. yes, some battles may take a long time, but at the same time, they require you to think more, require more creativity. and they are sincerely rewarded for it. the game is worth your time and attention. the game is worth the money. i currently, for me, this is the number one contender for the title of game of the year. of course, if your computer does not meet the system requirements, if your hardware is outdated, you may have some problems. but this is by no means a problem with the game my friends played the game on weak pcs without any bugs at minimum settings. of course, this game will not be suitable for those who do not like to strain their brains, for those who are used to onebutton gameplay hello, diablo fans, for those who are used to primitive gameplay like popular shooters. for these people, the game will be too difficult and it will cause a negative reaction below there are already reviews from such people   for players who are not familiar with this genre of games, it is better to take something a little simpler for familiarization, the earlier games larian or dragon age, and only then return to bg 3. the same beginners who are ready to take risks  be patient and you will be rewarded, because the game will give you a lot of pleasant emotions."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"masterpiece, without a doubt the effort and affection that the game has is noticeable. it's the first one that makes me feel like i'm really playing the board game, even the stats and character progress are 100 accurate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"one of the best games of all time, definitely goty. been waiting for decades for this bad boy since bg12. absolute masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"the swift fixes to act 3 bugs, companion bugs, an expanded companion story arc three weeks after launch and strong hints at additional content in the future  all this and more has essentially invalidated any criticism of the game whatsoever at this point. there will always be haters  hell, bg3 has 834 at the time of writing  no matter how good the game. the question is whether you should take what they say seriously. this time, larian made a joke out of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"larian has crafted something truly special. something that captures what it's like to play table top dd, adds in the quality of life improvements that you would expect for a game without braking the experience. most importantly the game is exciting and fun to play. it is dense, and you are rewarded for getting into that dense material in both game rewards and experiences."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"only thing i like about this game is that there's no store and pop ups trying too get you to spend more money. otherthen that, it's not my type of game and feel it's overhyped"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"one of the best rpg i have ever played. those who like mass effect,the witcher, cyberpunk 2077 will have a lot of fun with baldurs gate 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this is game is one word fantastic! the game offers so much. from an incredible amount of game play, to a huge amount of detail in the game. the work and passion that went into making this game by the developer of larian is unparalleled. almost everything is possible and do able. the graphics are also good and the large amount of characters and npcs are great and were made with great detail and passion. the dialogues are also very good and believable. in short, larian has made the heavy burden and challenge of making a successor in the baldur's gate series more than worth it! a 10 is therefore absolutely deserved!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"jogo simplesmente espetacular, h tempos no jogava algo que me prendesse tanto, personagens cativantes cada um a sua maneira, enredo que te traz imerso, grficos lindos, modo de jogabilidade super divertido, em minha opinio at o momento  o goty de 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"baldur's gate 3 is an enchanting journey that has captured my heart with its captivating world, rich characters, and immersive storytelling. from the moment i stepped foot into the lush landscapes of faerun, i was entranced by the attention to detail and the depth of the lore. the characters are not mere npcs, but companions with their own unique personalities, stories and quests, which made forging connections and forming relationships an integral part of the experience. the game's mechanics are a testament to its dedication to dungeons  dragons' roots. the intricate dicebased combat system is a delight, offering endless strategies and tactical challenges that kept me engaged for hours on end. the blend of classic rpg elements with modern graphics creates an exciting and immersive atmosphere that's hard to resist. however, for all its brilliance, baldur's gate 3 stumbles on its path to perfection. the buginfested landscape of the game mars what could have been an otherwise seamless experience. glitches, crashes, and odd ai behavior often pulled me out of the immersion, forcing me to pause and restart, disrupting the otherwise captivating flow. for example, one time returning to my camp, one of my companions wished to talk to me. upon initiating conversation with them, i was scolded by them for a decision i had yet to make, or even have any knowledge of, so a future decision and event was spoiled for me. the companions also all seem to fall in love too easily with the main character, and certain companions never seemed to understand that i wasn't interested in them. after forming a romance with my chosen companion, another said something along the lines of i see you've chosen someone else when i never had a romance with that companion in the first place. things like these add to the frustration and i found them immersion breaking. the most significant disappointment lies in act 3, which feels alarmingly rushed, incomplete and unoptimised with frame rate issues. the promising buildup of the first two acts loses its momentum, and it's painfully clear that there's substantial cut content. questlines that were hinted at are suddenly left hanging, and the narrative threads become tangled in a way that's difficult to ignore. it's a frustrating experience that makes you wonder if the developers were pressed for time. one thing i can't understand is the prevalence of glowing 1010 reviews. while the potential for a masterpiece is clearly present, the abundance of technical issues and the abrupt, unsatisfying conclusions in act 3 make it hard to comprehend such high scores. it's disheartening to see these glaring flaws overshadowed by praise, as if the game's issues are somehow invisible. in the end, baldur's gate 3 is a game that i truly loved playing, and i was genuinely invested in its world and characters. the foundation is undeniably strong, but the bugs and the rushed, incomplete third act prevent it in my opinion from ascending to the ranks of gaming masterpieces. a 710 rating feels fitting, acknowledging the brilliance while recognizing the need for improvements. hopefully these issues will be addressed in future patches, which larian is known to do."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"i play video games since i was a kid, i always loved rpgs and this one tops them all, just buy it! worth every peny!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"my first time playing a fantasy rpg other than ac odyssey and vallhala. i decided to try this game because someone online said that if you love mass effect, you need to try it because the companions, the story and the lore are of the same standard that bioware has set if not better. i was a bit sceptical at the start since mass effect is scifi and i love space plus the combat for baldur's gate at first seemed meh and odd. anyway once i started playing, i was not disappointed! the characters, the lore and the gameplay though it looked simple are quite complex and interesting. the best part is that your actions and choices make a huge impact on the ending and how the game treats you going forward. i had a good experience with mass effect's choices but this game nailed it to perfection. still playing the game and loving it. definitely a game that i recommend playing at least twice as there are so many pathways that can't be explored in just a single playthrough. this game has set a new standard for rpgs, the complexity of companions, the impact of choices that really make you feel in control, the fun combat and the list goes on. overall 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,hayatm da ilk defa sira tabanli bir oyunu bukadar ok sevdim ve balandm gerektende ok iyi bir oyun ayrca larian studiosa trke dil desteini getirdii iin ok teekkrler
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"yeah, if you don't think this is a good game, then i don't know what is wrong with you. you might dislike the genre, but this is just one of the bet games released in the past few years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,if only game developers would make games like this. one of the best game i have ever played in the past decade!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"the best rpg game ever. even though i've been playing for 100 hours, i'm still enjoying it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"best fantasy rpg tactics game ever. i never wanted it to end. all i wanted was more more more. it will only get better with time as they fix minor bugs, but i never encountered any that a simple reload didn't fix. play on hardest setting, because there are so many ways to optimize and have super powerful heros.. especially if you take your time and explore everything. the game is easily a 11 out of 10 if you like dnd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"one of the best games i've ever played, from everything like the story the character to even the gameplay. as a new dnd fan this is definitely for me and thank you for giving us this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"horrible el combate por turnos feo, de verdad que no esperaba esto en un juego, la gente lo puunteo muy alto por la nostallgia una secuela , y todo iba bien hasta que llegamos al combate por turnos,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"game is simply a masterpiece. larian studio has proven to the industry that is possible to make a huge, refined and completed game without microtransactions. i enjoyed it even if i dont usually like turn based combat. easily goty for me."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"awesome rpg game. all the feelings from the old entries of the franchise plus amazing universe expansion, characters, story, absolute masterpiece, lesson for another studios how to develop and love a game!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,unfinished game. game quality dips in mid to late game with multiple crashes in the final act which is already filled with bugs. score would be higher if the final act didn't ruin my experience.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"easily the best high fantasy game ever made, including all the zeldas and elden ring. nothing comes close when you talk about the quality of writing, acting, character development, and sheer scope."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"this is the first game i played from this type, idk what to call it actually, but i can't stop playing. i find myself wondering and exploring the world without stopping. the details in this game is crazy. only one game made me feel like that, and it's the witcher 3. i hope this game wins the game of the year. bravo larian studio."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,une histoire et un gameplay qui m'a normment surpris en trs bien. j'encourage ce genre de ppites. joli travail.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"even though i'm not an rpg player, during my 140 hours of gameplay, i was able to thoroughly enjoy everything the game had to offer. the story was captivating from beginning to end, and every nook and cranny i explored held its own little surprises and hidden details just waiting to be uncovered. it was worth every penny of the purchase."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i was really hyped for this game. after spending many hours playing bg1, bg2, nn1 and nn2 my excitement for bg3 was unreal and sadly i was disappointment. do not take me wrong the game in itself is great and the systems are really well done, but this game is missing this tiny little spark that was present in other big ddforgotten realms games. i was wondering for a long time why i can not stick with this game and i tried to love it really hard. i then realized that even though there is so much to do in the game your choices are awfully streamlined and don't seem to have major impact. no matter what you do the game leads you to victory. mess up your build no worries reset away destroying any rp element there is. characters creation? pick whatever race you want there is no disadvantages just extra perk to complement whatever you are trying to build. same for your background story its just a pure stat boost you are not sacrificing anything to gain advantage in something else. your character is build to be perfect and sure you can still mess things up but really its far from punishing. combat ? sure the foundation is decent but sadly its not for me. i do not like how the game focuses so much on environmental damage. place bunch of explosive barrels around your enemies and blow them up. yeah sounds cool at first until you realize your stats, equipment and skill play little part in combat once you figure this out. all previous bg and nn games are all about picking the right setup, finding the right gear and adjusting your characters to handle any combat situation. sadly bg3 is so badly balanced in that regards that if you do not use those environmental advantages you will struggle and i honestly dont find the aspect of this game fun. overall its a great game but not a great bg game in my opinion. it really is missing out on a lot of aspects that made the original games great and i believe its significantly over hyped for what it is and should have been just called divinity original sin 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"bg3 will be remembered as a masterpiece. in an era of shady business practices, latinas product is a breath of fresh air. the story, va, and overall gameplay are top notch and this game should be the benchmark other aaa developers compare their games too. are there a few issues with bugs  yea, but they arent major and 100 these will be corrected. its been only three weeks and we have had 2 major patches already. with a game this large, im surprised the game is as polished as it is. over 200 hours played between release and ea and i cant wait for my next session."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"as a longtime player of the first two bioware games, and an even more seasoned dd player since the days of second edition, with already over 100 hours of gameplay in this third installment, i can't help but proudly claim the unquestionable beauty of this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,hands down the best game i've played in my 40 years of life. the characters are amazing and believable. it feels like a dd game with my friends. i would recommend to anyone. 1010 for sure.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,i give it 10 points because it's probably one of the best games of the last 10 years in its genre and one of the best rpgs released during that time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"the best rpg ever! extremely high degree of freedom, huge content, and the rpg with the best sense of immersion so far. the original intention of rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,best rpg experience i had recently! every dialogue counts. great job larian studios.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i've been playing computer games for as long as i can remember, bg12 of course too. for the past few years i've thought i'm too old to gamble, but bg3 gets me back into it. the game is just very very good! end of story!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"amazing game, best game ever, every time i start the campaign feels like a new game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,this is my first baldur's gate game and my first larian game but i am having a blast. i have played tons of rpg games but the only game stuck with me was dragon age origins and it was my all time favourite rpg since its release. baldur's gate 3 surpassed dao and became the best game i have ever played in my entire life i have 500 games in steam and 50games on ps4. i want to play divinity titles after this game and then i will play bg3 again. this game is the ratatouille of videogames. just grab it and immerse yourself.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,great great game! im so happy that i can play this game in my life. thanks lariat
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,absolute banger of an rpg. hit me right in the kotor feels. this is one of those games i'll still be referencing 20 years from now. so much replayability. it took me over 100 hours for one playthrough. with branching storylines and dialogue and experiences that react differently to your race and class choices. this is easily a 1000 hour game if you really want to see and do everything there is to do.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i am sorry, but in its current state i can't give this game 1010 and neither 910. do not get me wrong, this game is awesome and i really dig it, but you probably heard about the buggy third act and not all content being added yet, which is a shame given that this game been in early access for so long. once all content is added and flaws patched i will be more willing to give this game 910 or even 1010 if the story will drag me in when i finally get into third act and if stories of my companions grab me by the heart. i am saying all that as a person whom bought collector's edition since i really do enjoy this game, however i do not want to be blinded by the hype it gets. one important thing to mention is that the studio behind this game larian actually cares about what their fanbase think and they also update their games based on opinions of their fanbase, which is something truly unique and i wish other studios would be like that  for that a very huge kudos to larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,after quarantine and having too much time to play games i kinda lost my passion for gaming balders gate was the game that brought that passion back i have about 250 hours on this game and have tried multiple play styles i'm a huge dnd nerd and the turn based combat was right up my alley story characters and game play was all amazing to me i know balders gate 3 probably isn't for everybody alot of people can't really handle the difficulty but it's just like when i first learned dnd it takes time and you have to put your self in the best position to win encounters some people like that and some people dont if you like turned based combat that makes you think this game is probably for you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"melhor jogo j feito desses ltimos anos, indiscutivelmente! goty! o game  uma aula a todas as desenvolvedoras atuais de como fazer um jogo de escopo sem perder qualidade!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"game of the year hands down. they built off divinity 2, added dnd mechanics, its so fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,blows my every expectation out of the water. bg3 offers a gaming experience unlike anything i've ever had.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,act 1 and act 2 are masterpieces that synthesize the best of many rpgs that have come before. act 3 is a little less polished.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"absolute stunning. superb arts, excellent game mechanics, deep narrative. best game i ever play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"game is one for game of the decade. i have spent 169 hours in ea, and i will probably play the final release after starfield bores me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"a longforgotten sensation from childhood. it's just impossible to stop. thank you, sven!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"honestly one of the best rpg's i have ever played and i feel like it will remain like that for a long time. i have not played baldur's gate 1 or 2, so i cannot comment on how the story and gameplay holds up to those, however the feel of the game is great, it looks really good graphically and gives me everything i could have ever wanted in terms of making impactful choices within a game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"gioco bellissimo, un vero gioco come non se ne vedevano da anni. le altre case di sviluppo dovrebbero perdere esempio."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"bom jogo, muita variedade, gameplay fluida, bom combate e grficos. consegue trazer bem o rpg de mesa para o digital."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"where to start. baldur's gate 3 was gifted to me by a friend while it was in early access. i enjoy incredibly immersive games and for one reason or another, baldur's gate 3 has drew me in and isn't letting go. the story, the mechanics, the freedom of choice, all excellent. the turn based combat has been executed very well also and even after i've decided to go to bed or end my game session, it's always one more turn or one more fight. my only caution is, beware minutes will turn into hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"o jogo  muito bom, mas  superestimado por uma onda da internet onde os youtuber criaram, o jogo  sim muito bom mas est muito muito longe de ser o melhor de todos os tempo como alguns dizem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"not sure why this game gets so much praise. boring companions, generic plot, plodding and frustrating combat that offers nothing new. there's an illusion of choice, but a lot of the big decisions stayed the same no mater how what choices i made. it's clear a lot of effort went into it, but it's an average rpg at best. bioware, bethesda and rockstar all offer much deeper and more enjoyable rpgs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,this is my favorite rpg of all time i have never spent more time in an rpg than bg3. it exceeded my expectations in every way.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"simplesmente o melhor conteudo de rpg dos ultimos anos com toda certeza, isso  incrivel"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"this game is exceptional. larian studios just did something fantastic with this, there are so many good aspects to the game. just play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"facilmente um dos melhores jogos que eu j joguei em toda minha vida e facilmente o melhor rpg j feito, so tantas possibilidades, tem uma liberdade absurda, os personagens so timos e eu no posso reclamar da jogabilidade que combina muito bem todas as possibilidades que disse anteriormente com combates fludos e tensos muitas vezes. o mapa  divertidssimo e as misses excepcionais, eu j fiz tanta coisa e ainda tem mais ainda para fazer, estou animado para fazer o 100 dessa obraprima e j  meu goty, animado para ver como baldur's vai se sair no tga."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"goty. one of the most incredible games of all time, an rpg with hundreds of different decisions that influence your gameplay. there are so many options that you could play it 10 times in different ways and each one would be unique. i already have 100 hours on steam and i can say that it's definitely one of the best i've ever had the experience of playing. congrats to larian studios for such a masterpiece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"any critic that didn't give this a 95 is just trying to be different for clicks. this game, while not perfect, pushes the envelop of game design and storytelling, and  much to the chagrin of other developers  certainly sets a new standard in what gamers expect from their games, just like bioware did with kotr, bg, and mass effect. one down side is that this will be hard for larian studios to surpass."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"it is without a doubt that the game in question will receive the title of game of the year. the level of detail present in the game is truly remarkable, ranging from the intricacies of the musical score to the staggering 174 hours of cinematic content. furthermore, the combat system is a flawless adaptation of the original dungeons and dragons game. it is perplexing to encounter negative reviews of this game, particularly those from individuals who lack a fundamental understanding of turnbased rpgs. criticisms regarding the length of combat and the abundance of cutscenes are unfounded and demonstrate a lack of comprehension. it is inappropriate for such individuals to provide reviews if they are unable to grasp the fundamental concepts of the game. it is suggested that they instead play games such as call of duty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i can't state enough how happy i am to see a game developer not push insane microtransactionsfree to play games don't count as this is a full price game and actually release a game while not perfect, very well polished enough for me to have almost 100 hours of playtime before even hitting any real bug issues which they are already fixedstill fixing rapidly. amazing. i haven't had this much fun in a an rpg in years. this is even more fun than even skyrim was for me. only into the beginning parts of act 3 on my solo campaign, but its amazing to me and i have multiple campaigns that i have been running over 150 hours at this point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"so i love rpgs but man this one just grabs you. i usually play a game and even though i am enjoying it i am at an age where depression starts affecting me so this game has hit that itch and it is extremely immersive to the point where i am able to play it and enjoy myself. onto the game. it is very intricate obviously with all the different styles, choices, and paths you can choose. the combat is fun and the story is excellent. you can also play with up to 3 other people! also it is very long with no fluff which i love!!! i wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"jogo incrvel que te prende o tempo todo! dd e rpg de qualidade absurda, sua imaginao vai alm dos dilogos e tem que usar o crebro para passar bem em alguns combates. jogo 1010. viciante, vontade de jogar com todas as classes, porm melhor jogar com amigos possibilitando em focar apenas no seu char e no em quatro."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"baldur's gate 3 is the best game i've played lately.although it is a turnbased game, i played for hours without getting bored."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i see a lot of negative scores here based on combat feeling slow, story feeling linear, companions being annoying and the game not being open enough. i for one am an avid fan of dd and have spent hours writing backstories or characters i never will play because i love the fantasy world. bg3 gives me absolutely everything i could ever want from a dd video game, choices do matter despite other reviews saying they do not they have not played long enough to feel the impacts. the game is not perfect, it does need technical improvements especially in act 2 and 3 but if you want to the dungeons and dragons and don't have a group to play with, well this game is everything you could want. now i understand this type of game is not for everyone, for example i absolutely hate every first person shooter in every form but some of those games are well liked by millions of people however it is simply not a type of game i enjoy, everyone has their preferences. the final fantasy remake removed the turn based combat and i hated it and stopped playing within an hour, it is not a bad game, in fact is a beautiful well designed game but it is not for me. bg3 tells an engaging story that you need to invest time into, i am not on my second playthrough because there are so many choices i want to change to see how the story unfolds. i have already bought this game 3 times and would pay full price every time i start a new playthrough, that is how much i love this game but larian did the unthinkable and made this game 100 offline and drm free with so many meaningful side quests that you would not see unless you explore the zones. we literally get side quests from speaking to animals fully voiced by the way but easily missed as it isn't required to progress the story. this takes me back to my comment about investing time. i appreciate the level of detail put into expanding almost every npc's backstory. do you want to know what happened to that one npc you saved back in act 1? well find them again in act 3 and find out, might not be as exciting as instant gratifying demon slaying in diablo but i want to know that npc's story. again this is everything i ever wanted in a video game because it is for gamers like me. you want cod go play cod that is for you not for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"baldur's gate 3 is a new once in a generation standard bearer for a specific. and long running, style of rpg dungeons  dragons. the game features dice rolls, ability checks, stat modifiers, etc. that people have come to associate with dd. but even for those unfamiliar with the mega tabletop hit, baldur's gate 3 offers a unique and deep spin on the rpg genre, giving character choice and direction depth that has never before been seen in gaming. at its core, baldur's gate 3 is a standard fantasy rpg with a well tuned and tactical xcom like battle system. fights can be long and grueling, taking upwards of 3045 minutes to finish, and positioning is key. spells and classes are unique and well balanced in their implementation, although the dd style combat dice rolling can be frustrating at times if you low roll a bunch in short span, the game is crystal clear though on the chance for your attack or ability to hit. fights are also difficult and challenging, especially bosses and the larger encounters, some taking a couple trial and error runs with pre fight positioning and sequencing. where the game truly shines above all others like it is in its breadth of player choice. you as the main player character can, effectively, do whatever you want. yes, there are consequences, but there is never a shortage of options. in only my first several hours of gameplay i had killed 3 potential party members without even realizing. you can circumvent encounters with dialogue or character choices. you can turn yourself into an illithid monster and kill everything in your path. there are entirely too many possibilities to describe but if you can think of it you can usually do it. my most memorable and consequential decision came sometime in the early mid game when i arrived to the last light inn. a character there revealed himself to me to be working for the 'absolute' bad guy and that he wanted my help abducting the local priest who was protecting the inn with her magic. i chose to wait and see because i wanted to find a quiet way to dispatch of this guy and get an item he had that i wanted for myself. immediately in my next conversation the guy made his move and abducted the priest right from the middle of everyone, without the priest the inn fell in to darkness and everybody there outside of my party died a grueling death. this is just an example of the consequences and intricacies within this game, everyone will have a different path and story through this game. where the game does a little fall flat is in the 3rd act, which for the most takes place in a large city. the story, choices, and quests are just more straightforward here, lacking the diversity and polish of the previous areas. the game is also littered with visual and gameplay bugs that are typical for this genre. missing textures or invisible objects can happen, the game can get stuck saving which prevents you from saving again or loading back into a previous save, i fully expect in future patches and developments for these issues to be fixed. overall, due to some of its technical and story issues the game falls short of being in the top tier class of skyrim or witcher 3 for me. but it is without a doubt the most free and uninhibited rpg i have ever played."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"not a baldur's gate game. anomaly outrage was a fabricated pr stunt, bots ratio negative reviews 10 to 1, writing is like a bad rpg session. sad to see this is the best crpg released lately."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i have been waiting for this game for so long and i'm glad that i haven't tried the alfas, the game is amazing after 100 hours in the game i can state that it's a betterthanexpected experience, and still haven't finished it. this is a masterpiece and deserves goty for 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,un juego sorprendente como pocos en estos das por sus mecnicas y su jugabilidad
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i know it's been said before but i repeat is a masterpiece! the quantity of possible choices, the writing of the characters, the quality of the contents not only from a purely gaming point of view, but also as an emotional experience through the unfolding and evolution of the main story, together with the individual stories of the characters and companions that accompany the player, it is simply indescribable. such a level of dedication, love, attention to detail and above all a genuine and deep immersion of the player in a story which, although set in a fantasy world, is absolutely realistic as a result of the player's choices, actions and reactions from the npcs, i've never found this before in any rpg game of this kind. thank you larian for giving me one of the best gaming experiences ever, really."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"no game i have ever experienced has as much love and genuine effort placed within it that one cannot even experience on a single adventure. this is the epitome of the genre and i, for once, believe the developerpublisher deserves every penny they glean from this wonderful work of art. i'm starting a second playthrough shortly, own it on both pc and ps5, and am incredibly excited to enjoy the story and world from another aspect. no bs microtransactions to distract and extract, no nonsensical battle pass, just a wonderful game made by some wonderful people. it's not very often i see a dude in a suit of armor with a bunch of devs dressed in cosplay and ultimately become endeared to them as they exude a dedication to the game itself. it really shows in their work. thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"this game just really surprised me. started off playing it in early access and turned every rock i could find in part 1. its just so well made, the cutscenes are amazing, it actually has consequenses so if you do some evil  it will impact your conversations and gameplay later in the game. really a nice way to play dnd 5e digitally."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"yes, this is the same review i wrote on steam. i didn't feel like rewriting it, lol... by far one of the best rpg's i've played in a long time. i'm not always a huge fan of dd style rpg's due to the high learning curve for newer players and the fact they can be frustrating to play due to the high level of difficulty. however, as someone who doesn't play, but who definitely has a long appreciation of dd, i'm a huge fan of this game. i honestly haven't felt this level of excitement for dd since i was a kid and i was reading the dd choose your own adventure books. the story is engaging, combat is challenging and addictive and i love a game that makes me have to think about strategy. not enough rpg's out there can say they do all of it. this is a rare gem. if you are a casual rpg player or someone who's hardcore, this game is for you. i highly recommend this game. i hope you all have as much fun as i'm having. have a great day!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"best game in long time, waited for years for something like this and it was worth the wait."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,one of the best games i have played in a while. i really had a fun playing playing this game. it has some problems like performance issues bugs etc but i those are forgivable and not game breaking. i am sure they will fix those very soon. the only reason i give 9 is because of the act 3 and the ending it provides. you might have seen some cut content on the internet and the ending really leaves a bad after taste. after playing for more 100 hours you can feel that the ending is really underwhelming and missing. i think the reason for that is they had to release it a month earlier due to starfield. i am not sure when but they will probably make the ending betterprobably within this year. act 1 and act 2 really increases your expectations about the ending but when you come to act 3 you become very disappointed. i would still recommend the game though because it is very fun to play. i think they made this game very newcomer friendly. you don't need to know anything about dnd to enjoy the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"perfect game, deserves goty, perfect gameplay, good dialogue variety, good map sizes, very good graphics"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"without any drastic changes from what was already presented as a demonstration on the pc, there is a lack of innovation and lack of polish in certain areas nothing new compared to the previous games of this franchise. i expected a lot more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i have been waiting for the epic continuation of the baldurs gate series for many years and finally there is a 3rd part, which is great and is a worthy successor to the original baldur's!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,great rpg game ever! ive never played in game likr this befor. im so existed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"at a vertern gamer, i kinda lost my interest in games nowadays, also, movies, music...... etc. entertainment no longer built with passion, only with how much margin they can make. i had my doubt with bg3 because it's a name too big to carry by larian studio, and to my suprise they delivered it. it's not a perfect game, plenty rooms to improve here and there, but it's a game with passion. i only hope the map of baldur's gate is bigger, i spend a long time imagine visit bg again after all these years, and it's smaller than bg1."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,what is mostly a really great rpg is brought down slightly by some eye rolling messaging in game and a lack of random encounters or enemies to fight outside of scripted one of events.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"a true master piece, well performed audio dialogs from every character in the world leads to the game being immersive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,the movie playing is very touching and characters are vivid. the amount of content is magnificent.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"act 1 95 one of the best crpg act 2 93 still good act 3 84 partially messed like old obsidian games. e.g. kotor2, nwn2 is bg3 worthy of getting good score above 95? think about a little calculation. my personal score is 91, but i'll give this game 7 score for opinion balance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"a crooked camera that spoils the feel of the battles imaginary variability that gives a minimum of influence on the world an abundance of bugs of varying degrees of severity  from harmless glitches to dialogues that don't work. just a miserable ending, not to mention the missing epilogue monotonous visual design of weapons and armour with a minimum of unique samples, some weapons were not even honoured with legendary versions. in the game is actually fully completed only the first act, which was a few years in early access the game isn't expensive, and even the first act pays for it right away, but why the hell is a game that is 13 complete suddenly the game of the year! i went through cyberpunk in release with bugs and 20 fps, i cried over the ending, but the game was so hated it almost ruined cdpr. and this unfinished rubbish is being praised like it's 98 and fallout 2 just came out. at this point, such inadequate reviews and adoration make baldur gate 3 look like a cheating manual for developers make the first part of the game in 20 hours, polish it to a shine, collect a lot of money and adoration, and when people pass by the polished part, sit on a diamond throne at the foot of your personal monument and laugh out loud."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"another amazing game by larian studios, we can see all the love and effort they put on the game in every detail and every dialogue option, it's just amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"another great game from larian, it has an amazing turn based combat and a complex yet awesome world, the gameplay, romance and its incredible arsenal of choices to do and make in both character creation and the story make it a truly awesome game, goty in my opinion"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"baldur's gate 3 is a breath of fresh air in today's gamedev world. this one was able to give me exactly those unforgettable emotions, that sophistication and that deep lore and acting out that i had not received from games for so long. if larian studios' baldurs gate 3 doesn't deserve a 1010 then i don't know what other game can. p.s. if larian finalizes the epilogue, adds an upper city, and brings back some of the cut storylines, then this might deserve the title of the best game ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,only game in the world where you can have your eye gouged by a bard with an ice pick in an attempt to extract a tadpole from your brain.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"absolutely overwhelmed all my expectations. imagine a game that makes you think constantly about replaying it more than once while you're still messing around in your current game. i can divide the quality of bg3 into 3 parts. act 1 fantastic 1010. an immersive and overwhelming immersive experience. massive, exploration, emotion. act 2 amazing 9.510. darkness... and emotions. you will have a mixed experience with a bit of drama and horror here. exploration is great but you will feel it to lower back a bit. act 3 excited  overwhelmed  curious and lively. those are the first things that come to you when you step into act 3 1010... then an exciting urban adventure. but the small quest lines started to shorten, it made me a little disappointed. i can say that it is an incomplete delicious taste. you will see what you build from act 12 starting to wobble a bit. 910... to the end, it can be said that the part that made me feel a bit disappointed the first time i played. because bugs start to appear more dense films in the late game. the storylines also begin to end there's a sketchy feel to the atmosphere. but anyway, the epic and the convergence point at the ending will make your mind excited and satisfied. 7.5810 but i know that larian studios will address these in their big patches quickly. future expansion, dlc, and mod content for bg3 can be said to be extremely promising."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"not a turn based rpg fan but this game is the new standard for gaming in general. i enjoyed early access, and the full game is better than i expected. i had given up on aaa developed games being so good."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"if the cut content form act 3 wasn't so noticeable, i would have gave this game a 10. but the end and some of act 3 feels unfinished or the cut contend  quests are very noticeable, so its a 9. but even with those cons, its a masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"first time playing a baldur's gate game and i've become hooked on the series. i make this after nearly passing up the game based on many of the bad reviews here but then i realized something. most of complaints i've read are them are either people that don't understand rpgs, or are whaaaa, th' gay is in this game! it's too woookkeee, whhaaaaaaaa. glad a loved one got me to play this. the characters have depth, there are multiple ways to approach most of the situations you run across in game. characters have, well, character that includes wants, needs, things they don't like and yes are romanceable. there is gasp nudity, hide the children! unless you are smart enough to take two seconds to look at not only the disclaimer that pops up the first time you boot the game up, but have to go out of your way into the options to allow it in the first place before it even shows up! the combat is fun yet frustrating as you puzzle out how to survive an encounter sometimes. the frustration is rewarding when it pays off howe3ver and you manage to find those combos of melee, spells, healing and manipulation that works or any of the other ways to progress. can you stack as many boxes to create a platform to a cliff, hells yeah! set up flaming barrels, bottles and then blow someone up casting fireball? it's there! talk an someone back to their senses and aiding you instead of an enemy? well call me as silk and twice as soft hearted cause i've done it. honestly i remember when games like this were the norm not the anomaly solid game play, few or minimal game breaking glitches a complete experience without getting nickeled and dimed by gambling mechanics or live service bs. definitely worth the buy."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,we were promised a seamless baldur's gate city back in june. unfortunately this is a lie the upper city disappeared and we get twothirds of the lower city. obviously a lot of quests and scenario elements to transition back to the available part of the game. no wonder why the game requires a patch 1 with a thousand fixes. we even experienced the rollback of a hotfix. this game launch is quite messy. the game is to be praised for its outstanding artistic quality and its length. you may also like the story but we are far from the epic experience of the original bg games. unfortunately the game engine shows its limits. the overall party management and controls are cumbersome. beware that it looks like dnd settings but there are substantial modifications as well as added mechanics unrelated to dnd. this may be seen as a plus but this is also likely to deceive players expecting dnd tactical challenges. the game deserves a better score but clearly i don't want to encourage any game studios to lie to their customers. larian failed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"best rpg of the year by far probably in years to come imo, i've put 150hrs into this game and i still haven't finished it and even then the concept of finish is weird in a good way you can play in multiple ways to alter the trajectory of each character and the ending of the story, 1010 haven't felt this about a game since picking up vanilla wow."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"i absolutely love this game, it is so much better than diablo 4. hoping xbox can change things around for blizzard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"today, hating this game is like being a religious fanatic 500 years ago who opposed progress. although those who are against progress still live somewhere in the deserts. yes, the game has disadvantages, such as optimization and bugs, but this did not stop me from completing the game in 140 hours and having fun"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"best crpg of the decade. 200 hours and counting this game continues to surprise me with its immersive story and character development. no microtransactions, no game breaking bugs, this game is what other aaa studios should aspire to when developing games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,this game is so good i already have 450 hours in and i am still finding new content
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"it's everything i've ever wanted from an rpg for years and as a huge dd need it checks every box i can reasonably want. couple of bugs here and there, but nothing too bad. highly recommend to anyone interested."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"balder's gate 3 this is the best game i ever played i've played skyrim, oblivion, fallout, and other role playing games. to preface i've never really played a crpg before though i have played dungeons and dragons larian rolled a critical success nat 20 with balder's gate 3 the sequal to the series starting all the way back in 1998 by black isle studios and interplay studios some of you might even remember it! where do i even start?! the overarching story is excellent don't worry there's no spoilers here! to lay out the scene  you  whoever you choose to be class, race origin etc end up being flung into an adventure of truly giant proportions! the story explores aberrations beyond explanation and how you've come in between it all  i cant understate how experience wise this game has it all from selling your soul literally if you choose to to learning how a half orc is made or even getting on the wrong side of some very powerful entities. this game has the polish of what every game should aspire to be. and that why developers are upset on twitterx as games we apparently shouldn't expect this?! this is also my first game by larian studios who actually bought he intellectual property from the people who made dungeons and dragons in order to make this. they were taking a massive risk in one sense, but it obviously paid off really well due to the dedication to their source material and craft. they even managed to link it into the story of balder's gate 2 and bring back some familiar faces. everything in wizards of the coast produced dnd you will find here  you're not being sold some half truth. a word on the soundtrack composed by borislav slavov this is the best game soundtrack i have ever heard, from a musician's perspective the musical motifs used are effortlessly clever and really make your crew feel truly influential in the fate of the city of balder's gate and partially the realm of faern. none of the music really feels jarring and fits the setting or location you find yourself in even the first layer of the 9 infernos or some beautiful forest it also has some of the best vocals i've heard which fit beautifully with the main theme which is actually split into 3 parts! please give borislav a chance at composing for film or something this guy has everything good about hans zimmer and john williams in his work, the crescendos and build ups in battle music and the soft flowing in certain pieces contrasts beautifully when looked at as a whole. the game would simply not be the same without this music. thank you. things you should know if you want to buy this this game takes a turn based approach to combat letting you plot all sorts of ways to remove your foes from the material plane balder's gate 3 actually started development back in 2017!!! your choices actually matter, and yes you can literally do anything in dialog as well as speak to the dead or animals furthermore, this game is the perfect example of the butterfly effect, one small decision could change your journey greatly! mods for the release version of bg3 will probably be out and larian have said they wanted mods to be made for the game possibly opening the chance of fan made expansions for the game one day exploring the other parts of the realm! i honestly don't know what else to say which hasn't been said in reviews like this one. i could sing its praises again and again also there's tons of replay value! p.s please make a balder's gate 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"it's a great way to experience dnd campaign in video game. it has a great story, interesting characters, and many possibilities for character creation and building as well as how you want to approach the game. there are tons of content and i would dare to say it's impossible to discover it all during ur first playthrough. i just hope they will add some additional content such as spells and equipment because it would add more interesting choices to make to an already complex game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,extremely well made game with so much detail and love. just enjoy it and don't rush. larian studio outdid themselves once again. most negative comments are just some complains about bugs which most of them are already fixed or are getting fixed or some werid nerds crying about wokeness

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"i haven't had this much fun in a video game in quite some time. it really is a perfect encapsulation of dungeons and dragons. i did not play bg1 or bg2  so i am sure there is merit to the points deducted for people saying bg3 feels more like dos3  but i can't give an honest assessment of that. for someone who played dos1 and dos2  bg3 feels like the perfect next step in terms of ui, game mechanics, and overall feel from larian. can't wait to see what they do next. from a technical perspective  i have not experienced any game breaking bugs or hardware issues."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,bon jeu mai il n'est pas en franais. quelque bug dans le jeu et un cameras pas terrible!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"masterpiece , showing how with just spending enough time and dedication, you can make one of the best games on the market"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"i have never played a game that can draw me so much attention in a story based game, usually i would fall asleep and feel bored, but this game is doing the opposite. the story is very immersive. i actually care about some of the characters fate instead of messing around and choosing all the wrong choices for laugh. the characters are very unique, each character has their personality differ from others which makes it easier to recognize when there are hundreds of character in the game. the story is very wellwritten since it gives me the details little by little when i am progressing and this brings up my curiosity and want to know more about what's going on. i honestly thought i would give up halfway before i started playing this game because of the combat, but in the end, i have no regret at all for playing the game. it really worths my time spent in the game and it gives me the satisfaction of exploring and doing the strategy based combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,it's a masterpiece. i don't remember when i played a good game like this. for sure more then 10 years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"the most perfect rpg video game ive ever played. this game makes me rate low other past master pieces, or what i judged like that, because its mere existence. sometimes when i play i remember that bg3 is a video game, so i cant expect a total freedom, but is very close to this, the illusion of liberty is as smart and subtle as ive never seen before. an advise never reload unless you party get totally anhilated. take one decission and asume the consecuences. negative point, imo the exigences of leveling forces you to completely clear the act i and in a way that may become absurd, in a way we can define as exploit every inch of the map instead of make your own adventure. an extreme example if i chose to follow one path to reach the land of the act ii instead the other path, i asume that im missing something and is coherent, but ive discovered lately that im losing highly valuable pxs, so i ve felt tempted to explore that second path even when my party actually has reached the place where that path leads. my party arrived the act ii in level 5, recently has reached the 6th level, theyre confronting massive groups of level 6 to 8 enemies and they just cant deal with many encounters no matter cares wich tactics i used. but, i must admit, im still enjoying being underleveled, it has sense, my party feels scared and must act very cautiously."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"despite this being my first introduction to dd and rpgs in general, i don't regret spending a single penny. in short, the game takes me back to those times when you'd stay up until dawn just to play for another 5 minutes. the game compels me to dive into youtube searching for the soundtracks of specific locations. the game forces the user to hunt through settings for the interface toggle key to capture screenshots of the landscapes. larian has accomplished something nearly impossible they've once again delivered the player the simple joy of sitting down to play their favorite game. it might not be the game of the year, but without hesitation, i'll say it's the game of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,best game ive played in the last 10 years! insanely good story telling and character development and many funnyinteresting npc interactions!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"one of the best games i've ever played. thank you, larian, for such a marvelous experience, and thanks to you, sven, our knightprotector of rpgs!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"masterpiece of the game, played divinity 2 os and it was my number one game until this game released its easy to understand, replayable so many times i can lose my mind. its dnd but kinda easier because dnd rules can go complicated. but this game handle every roll for you just spend your action as best you can, the role play is amazing and the characters are awesome. minor bugs here and there still you should play this game or try it out. act 3 might need bit upgrade and updates but still its still cant downgrade this game at all. enjoying already 4th run."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"brilliant, no bs, solid game, no microtransactions, not broken, delivers a great story."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,great game. alas unfinished. 3rd act is at times a mess and the bugged end robbed me of a closing i felt deserving of.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"the game is unfinished. acts 1 and 2 are one of the best rpg experiences i've ever had. act 3 completely drops the ball and endings are disappointing. i recommend waiting for definitive edition, so you can get the full experience you and this game deserve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,meilleur jeux vive larian ce n'est pas un jeux pour tout le monde c'est sur mais si on doit demander  des novice de jouer a un jeux donjon et dragon c'est baldur's gate 3 qu'il faut faire .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"most dynamic reactive story game in the history of game making. reacts to your race, your class, your choices, your companions etc. also you can just decide to be evil and  everything up, and the game will allow that, being evil is well written, which is very rare."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,this game made me remember what it was like to have a real game rather than microtransaction ads and unfunterrible game design masquerading as a real game looking at you diablo 4. i haven't played turnbased since ff7 but love bg3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"you remember the feeling when as a child you imagine heroic and fantastic situations? or when people fill in the blanks using their memory when playing dd? well now you don't have to, bg 3 does that for you and much much more, this is a trailblazing game that redefines a genre, better yet reinvented it and raise the bar so high it's almost unbelievable, after that praise let me get to what players actually want, the game is incredibly fun, enjoyable and immersive to the degree that it doesn't feel like a game sometimes, the pacing is uncanny, stories characters keep coming at you without being confusing or hard to follow, we all though this game will be good, only it doesn't have the right to be that good"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"this is a masterpiece a game.a real rpg game . if you don't like a turnbased game,maybe you don t like this game but i think you should give it a chance .the choise is yours"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"basically, as of today, the game needs 3 entirely different reviews... act 1 wow. the scope. the depth! the characters, all the possibilities. the fun and fair yet challenging combat. the incredible attention to detail. this is probably one of the greatest games ever made! act 2 whee, still a fantastic game, but the bugs and glitches start to annoy. and couldn't they have come up with some quality of life improvements in 3 years of early access? fabulous characters, engaging story, still incredible depth, but quite a bit of tedium in between. act 3 crash, crash, crashedycrash, crashcrash crashedy crash. the game falls apart in act 3, the story meanders and the memory leaks, glitches and constant ctds almost kill the motivation to finish it. well, maybe after the 2nd patch the game might actually become what most people basically wish it to be atm,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"baldurs gate 3 is an amazing game, an absolutele masterpiece. the graphics, voice acting, music, story, gameplay and the dnd adaptation everything is top notch. i cannot believe some people give this game a 010. the only explanation is that they hate fun. if youre a person how likes fun  this is the game for you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"fantastic game, it's everything i've always dreamt about since i was a kid playing dd!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,i had a lot of tech problems with it. seems so poorly done after 3 years of polishing. i'll be back after all of the patches.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,starts strong but the bug filled rushed ending really takes away from the whole experience. worth a playthru if you enjoy turnbased crpgs but don't expect a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"it's genuinely confusing to me that there are people who say they loved the original bgbg2 and hate this game. this is by far the closest game in spirit to the originals i've ever played. of course there are characters etc in the originals that are more dear to me, but that's because they were part of my childhood and have had 20 years to build unreasonable amounts of nostalgia. removed from all of that, i think the only character with a genuinely more compelling character arc in the originals is the villain  the bbegs in bg3 are definitely pretty run of the mill compared to irenicus. with that said, the game is still a masterpiece. it's one of the least broken major game releases in a while, and it captures a sense of freedom and player agency that very few games since bg2 have. go throw that nonhostile but annoying npc off a cliff."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"i bought the game to support good game designing. i wish i could see more of my familiar forgotten realms i used to know from baldurs gate 1 and 2, icewind dale and neverwinter nights. maybe something changed in dd 5.0 i'm not aware. but keep going with good work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"this game implemented all my dreams about a good game in the dungeon and dragons setting. i completed this game in one breath and want to replay it. i like that this game is cheap and has tons of content, you can jump, fly, teleport, push enemies into the abyss, and see nudity. the world is filled with interesting items, objects, and npcs. this game doesn't have microtransactions. developers deserve the highest rewards. this game is really the best thing i have ever played and i don't believe that such a great game was created in such a bad time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"i did 3 runs and still find new things and dialogues in the 4th the items ingame doesn't cost money!!! no microtransaction nor macrotransaction!! this game should be the standard, don't waste money!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,probably one of the best games ever made. i don't remember having such good feelings since the witcher 3. this is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"i waited 23 years for a sequel to bg2, which is my favorite rpg ever, and i was not disappointed. after playing the divinity original sin games, i was so happy to hear that larian studios would be making bg3 and they have done the franchise proud in my opinion. it has been a long time since i was this invested in an rpg. i often find myself loosing interest in these massive, sprawling rpgs after about 50 hours but i see no sign of that happening with bg3, even after 8090 hours of my playthrough so far. i still can't wait to get back to adventuring tonight. skyrim was probably the last rpg to hold my interest that long. you can tell this was a labor of love for the developers. so much detail and content has been crammed into every corner of the game world. you can get lost for hours exploring a single dungeon. take a side tunnel from that dungeon and you could find yourself on another, hours long quest to find and ancient artifact or something similar. even the side quests have interesting, well written stories behind them, a lot of which tie into the main plot in some way. this is refreshing given that most modern rpgs have only simple side quests fetchkill, rinserepeat that feel shoehorned into the games just to make them longer, none of that with bg3! graphically bg3 is really beautiful. the open, rural areas look lush and crammed with detail and each dungeon has its own art style and architecture. some of the below ground locations like minor spoiler the grymforge and the gauntlet of shar are stunning! i can't wait to get to the city to take a look. the characters and voice acting have all been superb. the playable characters each have their own backstory and questlines, which are again, all interesting in their own right. they all have their own agenda and point of view regarding what is happening in the overarching story, and interactions with npcs can play out very differently depending on who is in your party at the time. sometimes with hilarious or unexpected outcomes. it all adds to the richness of the game and provides replay value because there is no way you can see all the possible party, npc and player character interactions in a single playthrough. if anything it can be a bit much, trying to keep up with the party members subplots along side the main plotline, but i cant really complain about too much content when the content is of such high quality. there are a couple of things which could do with refining. for example, inventory management and swapping inout characters from the party can be a bit of a chore and frustrating. there really should be an option to see and interact with the inventories of characters that are not currently in the party. for me this has been the most poorly implemented part of the game. the spellbook ui is also poorly done in my opinion and the game doesn't provide enough of an explanation of how it works. not a problem for experienced crpg players that are used to the dd style, but for newer players it must be very confusing. i may be wrong but i dont think it is explained anywhere that, certain spellcasting classes can change spells at will using the spellbook while other classes have to wait for level up. however given the commitment the devs have shown and the speed at which hotfixes and patches are coming these things will probably get sorted at some point, if not by the devs, then by the modding community. bg3 will definitely not appeal to everyones tastes though. if you can't go 2 minutes without shooting something or without something exploding, this game would probably not be for you. this is a long form adventure best enjoyed at a slow pace so you can really soak up the atmosphere and lore. i think bg3 goes to show what can be done when you have a passionate, creative team with equally passionate management and they are allowed to express their creativity through their art, rather than being hobbled by deadlines, shareholder expectations, mtx mechanics and other such corporate bs. i really hope some of the big aaa devs you know, the ones that spend as much as the entire budget of bg3 just on marketing their next garbage, money spinner, take note of what has been done here. does it have a few issues? yes. is it a perfect game? no. there is no such thing does it deserve the hype and the critical acclaim? yes!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,solid game truckloads of content. open world with decisions that actually matter. great writing in a cool world. really fun gameplay. its so good other development companies were upset because it highlights their lazy cash grabs for what they are.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"this game is a dream come true. being a fan of larian's former games i really wanted to play more and this one does not leave me dry. graphics are beautiful and so clean. everything you do is amplified to the max and your story that you are building with your choices comes alive because of that. sound design is a masterpiece once again, i cannot really give enough praise for it. having to experience it from the beginning of the ea, i can really appreciate the hard work behind it and how much more we players were given to the release. i'm a fan of turnbased combat and i love to take my time for it, thinking all varieties to go forward so i cannot say a bad word for it. i understand that it's really not for anyone, just like realtime combat isn't fun for me. i still think players can adapt to it quite nicely. this game has been a real treat and i have booked 200 hours already, and there is plenty of hours more to come. i love how one playthrough leaves so many stones unturned for the next ones to reveal them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"this game was designed by a proficient studio for mature players who want to experience a fresh and high quality story. no microtransactions, no mobile shenanigans, they delivered what they promised. so far the best game i have played in easily a decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"dont normally write reviews for games, rather just let the cards lie. but, i'm quiet tired of how larian does things. i've played their games, and enjoyed them. indeed, i enjoyed baldur's gate 3. up til the final act where broken quests, unfinished content, and an ending that is essentially mass effects 3's your choices didnt matter and t he endings you can pick now are barely different from one another. also no companion closure is unforgiveable. of the last four games larian has released, not a single one was actually finished. three of them got definitive editions a year later which boosted sales. the fourth was dragon commander which i'm still sad didnt get finished because it was such a fun concept. bg3 is their fifth in a row game that isnt complete and at this point i feel they're doing it intentionally knowing they'll get a boost later when they inevitably do their definitive edition of bg3 that actually finishes the game. and they'll be praised for it, pats on the back for all. and this needs to stop, and they should feel ashamed that they keep doing it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"i game that truly deserves the game of the year award, its a game that is a first and foremost a game which is rare nowadays."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"baldur's gate 3 is a triumph in gaming! i think i am not the only one who sees that the current game market is flooded with products that simply lack the feeling that was present in old games, such as the feeling of exploration, the excitement of waiting for something new and believing that it will be interesting, of experimenting with mechanics and believing that something new will be found, the feeling that this world is real and that you are part of it and that you are shaping it. and i thought that was the problem with me. that i had changed and just got older and lost those feelings. but this game proves that i was wrong. larian just make the game that is great again and gives me those feelings that was lost. and, you know, the reasons are simple  larian was brave enough to actually make the game, and not just make another lowquality but beautifullooking product designed to sell.  the vast, vast majority of modern developers never allow themselves to make content that players will miss. even in rpgs, content is made so that each variation of it costs as little as possible to develop, and even if the player misses something, it doesn't seem like a waste of resources. it's a business, i get it, but larian made a real game, not just a business product, so they allowed themselves to make a huge amount of different content that made the world come alive and each player's playthrough truly unique.  larian made a sandbox. the player is free to experiment as he wants, to find the most extraordinary ways to solve this or that problem in the game. but unlike most sandboxes, the player doesn't have to entertain himself and find something to do. i want to say a huge thank you to all the developers of this game for bringing back long forgotten feelings and faith in games. i am a developer myself and i thought it would never happen again. when you realise how business works, how games are made by those who have the resources to do it  you get disillusioned with everything, games become just products and gamdev becomes just a business. but thanks to you, i feel like that 14 year old happy teenager again, who is able to enjoy and believe in the gaming world. thank you, may you continue to do well!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"the game is good, but it didn't appeal to my taste. the gameplay is average. the game also has a lot of bugs. it's better to wait until they fix everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"gioco immenso,straordinario,meraviglioso, ambientazione fantastica,storia fantastica con tante storie secondarie che alla fine tantoi secondario non sono perch vanno a completare la trama, uno dei giochi migliori degli ultimi 10 anni, ho impiegato circa 130 ore per finirilo e mi mancavano altre cose, gdr vecchio stile fidatevi non vi annoierete grazie larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"the best crpg ever, with 17,000 ending this game become the best game people should replay ever. i hope this game will become game of the year 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"literally infinitely playable. make choices, scum save, go ahead. it won't matter. you can try as hard as you can to see every scenario play through in one game and it's not gonna  happen. entire story lines won't happen bro, so calm down, sit the  back, and really get into every choice you make without worrying about what could happen if you chose differently. because every playthrough will hold new surprises and introduce you to entirely different sides and perceptions about the different scenarios and characters you encounter. 10 out of g 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"yes there are bugs, unfinished plots of teammates,but the gaming experience is still a 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,best time ive had playing a game since i was a kid. and i have never liked turn based games before this one.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is the way games used to be made before the industry stopped making art and started making products with microtransactions. this game made my year. i thought i was getting tired of gaming when i was just tired of gaming as it is now. i miss eating because i'm so engrossed in the world. last time a game had me so hooked was mass effect 2. or kotor. game of the year, easily."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"one of the biggest and most fun rpg's you could possibly play. there are so many things you can do, so much choices to make. every quest feels like it has a thousand different endings, every npc a million interactions. there's so many small things that can affect what you can do, or how things play out. it's absolutely insane. genuinely one of the most immersive games around."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,hame of the year no doubt. the hype is real. any fans of rpgs fantasy fans will be absolutely in love. i'm more used to third person action games so it was a weird transition to point and click top down but it's so worth it. the level of choice in how you play your character surpasses anything i've seen in a video game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,message to larian and sven  you cannot sell buggy beta test for a price of a full game. it is a scam! after 3 weeks of release  still plenty of critical bugs even in chapter 1.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is lot of fun! choices galore and the combat is solid. there's a lot of little nuances that after you've played a while you can really see the love that went into the development. i've only played though most of the first chapter so far and gotten to the last area, or i think its the last area. but i've had a lot more fun than i expected to. if i had any complaint, its that now i want to replay bg2 with this system."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"masterpiece , a paradigm shift in the rpg genre. the game was so polished and ready at launch that it actually got hate from devs for being so good. there is so much content, so many options to play, i mean you can do almost whatever you want."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,a beautiful story with so many choices that lead to multiple opportunities and consequences the game is a true rpg masterpiece! loving every minute of this game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"best rpg of our time. absolutely amazing storytelling, reactivity, replayability, and just all around fun. it's absolutely massive in scope. it should still be up there in metacritic's top 10 games of all times, unfortunately you get a bunch of entitled idiots who can review bomb with 0s that have no basis in reality, with absurd hyperbolic reasoning. if the game is not for you, that's no reason to give false scores because user issues, rather than issues with the actual game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is not my usual preferred genre , but i absolutely loved it! it's easily in my top ten games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"game of the decade. incredible story, infinite options, amazing. and to do this in a consumer friendly way is a vanishingly rare thing in the industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"i don't think i have enjoyed myself playing any game this much in so long. that's not to say i haven't enjoyed playing other games, but baldur's gate 3 just stands on out so much that other games by comparison can't hold a candle. larian has done such a great job at bring the forgotten realms to life in this game, and giving a dd experience. it stays true to 5e while giving it a polish that balances out the game, and provides quality of life improvements well suited for a video game version of the dd. this game looks great, the story is engaging, and the volume of choices you have on how to play is absolutely massive. sure the game has its bugs and other issues, but those are far overshadowed by the clear time and effort larian put into delivering us this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,finally a good game after so many years of getting  on by the industry.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"a master piece. only thing i don't like is the excess of humour  too much undead npcs in the city interacting with normal people like if this is a normal thing and the music. the main theme of baldurs 3 is bad, not as epic as baldurs gate 1 or baldurs gate 2 main theme. that theme was memorable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,the best game i've played in years. can't get enough of it. so much replay value as well!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"haven't played a game this good in a decade, i will be playing this for years to come"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"the best game of year. goty. we need more games like this. it is a jewel and although the tastes of many people will not be the same as mine, i have no doubt that the majority think like me. goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"exactly what rpg gaming needed! fresh, fun, naughty, deep and overall brilliant game. voice acting is on point, character animation is quality and gameplay is engaging and quite simply put, a butt ton of fun! well done to everyone involved with the creation of this game, easily my number 1 pick for favourite game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"for any tabletop rpg enthusiast, this game is a true treasure, a work of art crafted by genuine genre lovers. every element  from the graphics to the soundtrack  shines at a level of impressive excellence. the engaging narrative, smooth gameplay, stability, captivating soundtrack, and wellcalibrated difficulty come together in a symphony of stunning quality. what has been achieved here is simply astounding, capable of leaving anyone in awe. this experience managed to rekindle my passion for tabletop rpgs, even inspiring me to delve into reallife adventures. every investment made in this game was worth more than its weight in gold, surpassing all expectations. i sincerely hope that this milestone makes its mark in history and raises the standard for games yet to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"in general the combat is the biggest let down along with the bugs especially in act 3. game is okay otherwise, most highlights for other people are the story but dialogue was very cringe at times. felt more like a dating simulator than anything else."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"before trying this game i was skeptic and clueless. i am a dungeons and dragon master and player, i love rpg but i ve allways found crpgs too much boring to play. despite all of this i decided to give this game a chance, best decision ever... this game is absolutely incredible. the plot is interesting, story telling top notch, dialogues are allways on point and they never gives you more information than you need, tons and tons of different choices to give your story a totally original direction, absolute freedom to explore the map, because we've allways seen walls that you cannot trespass sometime you don t get that you can go over, as i said absolute freedom. graphic is enjoyable and clean. combat system? i freakin' love it, i never get bored of experiment, and try new strategies and the fact that is based on dd makes me feel at home. this baldur's gate 3 deserves the 2023's goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,one of the best game and the best crpg right now. act 3 needs some polish but i still enjoyed it. i have 100 confidence that larian will patch it up to act 1 and act 2 standard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"all that you can expect from a rpg. great storytelling, amazing characters, and a perfectly well implemented dd skills  combat system. 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,next best thing ever since dragon age origins... if it isnt for the some anoying bugs it would be clean 10.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,one of the best games of the decade. please optimize act 3 normally. this optimization of the final chord of this wonderful story spoils the experience a bit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,best game of the decade! ruined my real life tho. only downside of the game is every character is hitting on you and trying to get in your pants but that's tolerable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,a massive game and for me goty with lots of content and lots of choices to be made in bg3 world. 1010 both in story and in graphics
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"i find it completely terrible, at least, the presence in the game of such a level, a moronic denouement with sex with a bear. but most of all, the sad thing here is that this game affects a generation"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,finally a game without microtransactions or loot boxes. finally a game released without 55gb day 1 patch. finally a game without a fancy currency that needs you to spend real money ingame.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"don't play this game if you come from traditional rpg games like final fantasy, dragon age and never have you tried dnd. why? this game has sooooooo many mechanics and stuff that you have to consider  remember before doing your next move if you don't, you'll end up fuc up everything and you'll find yourself pressing quick load a lot it can be frustrating at times specially if you like challenges and you hate playing games like myself in easy mode or story difficulty. level system and experience is super slow, i wipe out every area i see in the game and did side quest and later of 15 hours still in level 5. some enemies can make like 3 actions per turn and you can't ,often you'll find yourself seeing that a lot of the mechanics doesn't make any sense. the story begins good and kinda trying to hold for many hours but gameplay is a chore. the optimization is the worst. this game was released as a complete game this years when clearly needs more polishing... it suffers from stutters, severe low fps in certain areas, memory leaks over the time, characters freezes, stuck camera, ui does't respond anymore. vulkan missing cursor. i don't swallow this overhype. it doesn't deserve a must play seal."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,definitely the best game ever made after bg1 and 2. i remember being a kid and play those games. they were way before their time. i am happy to say bg3 honors his precedents.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is one of the best games ever created. best story, characters, gameplay. never seen before amount of options, choises, desicions and so much more. will it be a new trend for gaming industry? i hope so. interaction with virtual world never been so immersive before, and the choises you are making along the way impacting the world around you. this is that makes games so diffrent from movies and books, that makes games like this so unique it's the choises and decision, and the following. you not only be able to see that desicions charecter made and it cosequences but also participate in it, and make like they are your own, and live witn the consequences. isnt that remind you of the real live? thank you larian for your hard work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"simply the dream of any rpg enthusiast, this game sets a new standard that is unlikely to be surpassed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"its not perfect... but it sets its sights so high, tries to achieve so much and offers so much choice that falling slightly short on ui and performance still leaves the most impressive game i've played this decade. i'll be talking about this game for a long time to come. in fact the last game which impressed me this much was mass effect 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"one of the best games ever. you can literally do anything. you can see the passion and love that has gone into this game to create a vision, a plan, an idea. the ultimate game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this such a good game, one of the best rpg, after divinity original sin 2. larian studios makes fantastic games, and i say, that is game of the year, obviously. good dd maker, like onestep game, and we can complete this game again and again. another world, were we can make everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,best game i have ever had the honor of playing. 1110. i am addicted to it and can't stop. i love this game so much
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"simply the best game i have played in 40 years of gaming. so much attention to detail, so much to do in so many ways."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is the best game ever, go buy it now u will love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"tons of fun! take your time and explore. no need to rush through this one. the game will definitely reward it. every character has something to give and some of the random stuff that happens is so cool. frame rates are consistent and the game has been running great on my pc. i would definitely recommend messing around with stuff quite a bit at the beginning. i am still learning things i can do. but most of all, i am excited that this game has me excited to game again! been a while since i sat at work thinking about a game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"this has to be one of the best rpgs i've played in years, and also one of the best games i've played all together. currently on my second playthrough and still thoroughly enjoying it. are there some bugs? sure, but i believe larian will iron them out given time, no game is without bugs at launch just look at fallout new vegas as an example. this game is also my first real introduction to the world of dd and i'm hooked, i hope larian continues making great stuff like this. i definitely believe this game is deserving of the goty award. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,as close to perfect as one could expect from a game. for it style and genre it plays heavily to its strengths and puts in enough mechanics and concepts to cover for the genres weaknesses. overdelivers and still keeps improving!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"this game outclasses everything released in recent years. it's surprising and refreshing to find something completely devoid of micro transactions, and with npcs so engaging you can have full conversations with your friends about them. this has even gotten my nongamer friends to convert. the downside? it has entirely ravaged my sleep schedule."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"seeing this game get such a score truly has me questioning my sanity or that of most younger gamers and professional reviewers. baldur's gate 3 has a decent first act, albeit nowhere near as good as dos 1's cyseal murder investigation or dos2's fort joy, but falls of a cliff afterwards. the game starts with great promise. you have so many classes and races to choose from, that it's hard to not get excited thinking about what awaits you and the different and unique playthroughs you will make. the first act while largely devoid of good quests is largely carried by the interesting companions who constantly banter and have many things as you slowly settle into the gameworld and find out more about them, as well as the game's refreshing interactivity that allows you to talk with animals, dead people etc. despite being in ea, there are still lots of bugs about in the 1st act. but slowly the cracks start to show. the player is introduced to factions, events, characters with zero explanation or investment and is expected to care about things that are never shown, discussed, discovered. and the the 2nd act starts and those cracks result in a massive trainwreck. to put it simply there are many issues with this game that prevent it from being a masterpiece , or even a decent rpg altogether 1 there are no interesting, complex or memorable quests or moments. in the witcher trilogy for example you have stuff like the vizima investigation, the lakeside, flotsam and the choice that leads to two entirely different games campvergen, the baron, the kaer morrhen prelude and battle, the entirety of blood and stone etc. there are quests with interesting characters that allow you to learn more about the world, get invested in the stories of the people you encounter whether they be kings or peasants or nymphs. after nearly 100 hours of bg3, i cannot recall even one quest that kept me on my toes or had me excited and immersed in the game world. which leads us to 2 horrible and non existent worldbuilding and immersion. while games like the witcher and dragon age origins offer immersive worlds, with their different regions, kingdoms, cities, factions, politics, races, that you can interact with, in bg3 there is no codex or interest in making the player feel immersed in the world. there is a city called baldru's gate somewhere and then  cities? kingdoms? empires? the flaming fist? the harpers? the druids? the gods? goblins? a dude called kethric thorm? enver gortash? demons? the game never even bothers to tell you what the world you're supposed to be in is like, what the diffferent factions do, how the different races are viewed. you never interact with the different factions and peoples of the world, you never talk to npcs to see how they view the different racesfactions. the end result is a total lack of immersion or investment in what's happening around you. the game does not feel in the slightest like an epic fantasy adventure. 3 the gameplay. largely related to the above, the gameplay consists solely of running around killing guys you don't know or care about and rolling dices fore literally hours to open doors, chests and automatically win conversations regardless of what your class, race or overall disposition is related to the person you're speaking to you. 4 mute companions post act1. while your companions seem interesting and heavily involved in the story at first, they become mute following act1 and act primarily as props. 5terribly rushed. it's obvious this game was intended to be something else and do a lot of different things that are not in the final version. just to give an example, literally 2 weeks before release the developers were talking about exploring the upper city of baldur's gate but that's not in the game. for a full list just google baldur's gate 3 cut content. this explains why larian refused to hand out copies beforehand, thus a lot of reviews wrongly and unjustly only rate the first act which is also not even close to a 1 to be perfectly honest and should not be taken seriously, same as the hivemind that called this a masterpiece 3 or 4 days after release despite talking about a 100 hour game. 6lack of roleplaying, no reason to replay. as mentioned above, your class and race are irrelevant as a bard can intimidate, a fighter can charm, a sorcerer can survive, a barbarian can have arcane knowledge and so on. the game's lackluster story and quests and limited choices and consequences mean there's no point in replaying unlike say games like the witcher 2 in short, baldur's gate 3 is a terrible rpg, that's carried by a very not suspicious and coordinated pr campaign of professional reviwers that never even finished act 1 before their review and certain unique gamers that enjoy throwing dices because it reminds them of dd board games. if you're looking for the true sequel to baldur's gate 2 or the spiritual successor to dao, this isn't it..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,score of 10 simply for making the people shoving substadard shops as games cry like children as they produce their next shooter trans simulator.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"sencillamente genial, si te gustan los rpg de dd ni te lo pienses, prubalo! simply great, if you like dd rpgs don't even think about it, give it a try!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"the amount of work put into this game is honestly amazing, as a dnd fan, it ticks all the boxes for a solid rpg. the number ways you are able to approach combat and quests is great for replayability."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"so far the best game of this year and only thing close is zelda, this game is big really big and everything feels great, the characters, the animals everything just fits really well and makes one of the best rpgs i have ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"any troll on here who rated this game a 0 is a triggered clown huffing fumes. i would give it a nine, as the third act still has some work to be done to achieve perfection. but to troll the trolls an easy ten for the best game i have played at least since the era of kotor and dragon age origins, and imo this is a better game. i think you have to go back to bg2 in order to find a game of this game that is arguably better. and even then, it's an argument. it in my opinion is better than divinity 2 as well. which i thought was wonderful. beautiful, immersive, and rife with a playbox full of impactful decisions. this is the closest you can find to playing dnd 5e in a video game. if you don't like this game you don't like the genre and shouldn't be reviewing it. leave it alone and let people love something go back to playing your zelda game. 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"larian studios has made a perfect blend of their unique gameplay style with wizard of the coast's fifth edition dungeons and dragons. there is interesting plotlines and quests, with excellent writing and character design. the amount and quality of the content actually fits the 60 dollar price, compared to other games that have less content and more filler for the same price. truly captivating!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i don't like dnd. i don't like turnbased games. i don't like crpgs. i love this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,absolute trash and an embarrassment to the preceding games in the series. i'm convinced the positive reviews are mostly bots.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"i used to be a turnbased game hater before baldur's gate 3 came out, but this masterpiece changed my mind, i bought it thinking i would have an horrible experience thanks to my bias but i ended up playing it for 16 hours straight on release, i finished my first playthrough 90 hours in tactician, 90 hours and i skipped almost every character questline! except shadowheart's and karlach's, loved the ambience, the gameplay, the story, the voice acting, the graphics, the narrator, the map layouts, the music, the characters, the little details like random npcs and animals having their own dialogue, how the maps actually feel alive, how your actions have an impact on them! yes, i used to be one of the believers that tears of the kingdom would be the game of the year, but that was because i didn't know that this masterpiece  would come out a couple months later, baldur's gate 3 is so incredibly amazing that it ended the goty contest just like that, at least for me. i could nitpick about how the game just fades to black after you get the ending and doesn't let you keep playing or finishing other quests but i understand larian's reason, imagine having a destroyed version of baldur's gate city after the final battle, that would be like 30 extra gbs worth of assets by the way, please give us a lighter version of the game, i'd sacrifice my ultra textures for a 100gb installation folder any day of the week, i wouldn't have minded being sent back to the normal city with the final quest finished if that meant i could finish other side quests. last but not least, fix karlach's ending, it doesn't matter if game of the year edition, dlc or whatever, the fiery babe deserves better, just do it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"breath of fresh rpg air. feels very old school, with more options and complexity and great characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,greatest rpg ever made. game of the year. so much content i don't know where to begin.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"not exactly sure how this game is so popular. between the wretched camera that you fight with the entire time, to the directionless quests, to the cringe worthy romance garbage, the uninspired npc's that a 5 year old made up and to top it all off this crappy company yanks things out of your inventory with no warning and then weeks later, puts it back. they don't answer tickets, they don't answer tweets, their marketing is garbage and the customer service is pure trash. this game is the pure definition of white knighting. tons of issues people overlook or play through, and anyone who might have a criticism is chastised. i just wish i could get my money back for this waste of time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"in no way is it the best crpg, the controls are awkward, the wayfinding of the companions is a joke, and the micromanagement with the inventory is a pain in the... the only thing better in baldur's gate 3 than in divinity original sin 2 is the cinematic presentation, in everything else dos 2 is the better game. and there are literally hundreds of traps, in fact it can be summed up like this way too much of insignificant things."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,easily has to be game of the year this game has set a new standard for how good games should be if you want to charge 50 for a game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"cuando un juego te hace pensar en los personajes, las elecciones que has hecho, las elecciones que todava quers hacer, el siguiente lugar que quers explorar y la progresin general de la historia despus de que hayas cerrado el juego y tal vez ests en la cama o fuera de casa y no puedas esperar para volver a jugar, entonces algo va terriblemente bien. este juego te atrae de una manera que pocas veces sent en algo, es una experiencia diferente, una realidad diferente, es tu vida propia vista por los ojos del narrador y tu personaje. vos y tu personaje son uno slo. yo mismo no soy un jugador de dd. es por eso que apenas conozco las reglas, pero el juego te brinda suficiente informacin para orientarte y, con el tiempo, aprendes cosas juguetonamente. el mundo en el juego parece tan increblemente vivo. nunca sientes que ests trabajando en misiones porque incluso el registro de misiones est escrito con sugerencias escritas, como si estuvieras tomando notas sobre las cosas t mismo. deambulando por el mundo, descubres algo interesante en cada esquina y te distraes con algo en el camino hacia una bsqueda y luego hurgas aqu y all y de repente ha pasado media hora y tienes que recordar a dnde vas realmente. porque has descubierto un lugar oculto que absolutamente queras explorar slo brevemente. otro punto a destacar son los personajes. se siente como viajar con gente que vive y siente. cuando recorres el mundo, dependiendo de la combinacin que hagas en el grupo, las personas tambin tienen cosas de qu hablar entre s, algunos se entienden y bromean, otros se enojan, se hacen comentarios aqu y all. parece real. y no quiero ni empezar con las relaciones personales que haces con tus compaeros. a veces olvidas que es solo un juego preprogramado. y luego las elecciones morales que tienes que hacer! un simple encuentro con un npc puede desencadenar una historia de gran alcance que te dejar sin saber a quin creer. deberas creerle a alguien y a quin ayudas ya quin no? deberas ayudar a alguien en absoluto? todo es posible, nada es obligatorio. las posibilidades parecen infinitas. bsicamente, recin comenc a jugar llevo 30 hs in game y solo he visto una parte del mundo hasta ahora, ni siquiera puedo comenzar a imaginar cmo ser cuando llegue a la ciudad. estoy seguro de que he olvidado una serie de cosas que me gustara elogiar. ahora que lo pienso, realmente no s cmo voy a justificar comprar otro juego a precio completo en el futuro dada la cantidad y, lo que es ms importante, la calidad que obtienes por lo gastado ac. s que.. duele gastar una cantidad as elevada de dinero, pero 20.000 unos 60  por este juego en realidad no son suficiente cuando ves lo que obtienes un juego terminado sin apenas errores, nada que comprar a travs de dlc, sin microtransacciones, no tienes que estar en un comprar un pase de temporada cada mes a partir de entonces. obtienes un juego que es simplemente divertido. podra haber dado un pulgar arriba y dejarlo ah. eso es bueno porque nadie leer esta resea de todos modos. pero este goty merece tantas palabras como sea posible al respecto. ni siquiera comenc a hacerle justicia, podra hablar de eso por mucho ms tiempo. 100 recomendacin de compra"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"wow! this game feels really good to play. the attention to detail is exquisite. while there are quests and a main story, you can do things in whatever way your curiousity takes you. the gameplay and mechanics feels like a sandbox that you can experiment with in any way that you want without it feeling like you're forced to do something or that you're missing out if you don't do something. the combat has a slight learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it feels really smooth. there's enough complexity that you can spend hours minmaxing if that's what you enjoy doing, but you don't have to minmax to enjoy the game. whether you succeed or fail at your rolls impacts the flavor of your gameplay without seriously impacting your ability to progress through the game. it's a nice feeling to succeed on your rolls, but if you fail them, it's not such a big deal that you feel like you have to save scum. if there is a really import dice roll that you don't want to fail, the game gives you many ways to improve the odds of the roll, and if you still fail, you can try again with inspiration dice that you are rewarded with for roleplaying your background. the combination of everything makes the gameplay flow in a way that is very smooth and satisfying. i have hardly touched the reload button. i could go on and on about every little thing that makes this game great  art, writing, voice acting, map design, music, sound, etc  but the main thing for me is that it just feels really good to play. one of the best games i've ever played, for sure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"one day years will pass as hard economical days after pandemic will be remembered. and i will talk somewhere that i passed hard times with the help of larian. sometimes you give up hope but suddenly something like baldurs gate 3 enters your life and makes you believe in positive things. praise you larian for your passion. lets go to underdark, moonrise or baldurs lower city for joy and mystery and real rpg !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"its fun, the story is interesting, good graphics, good characters, lots of content, good character customization, definitely goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,well worth the end of the long wait. made me enjoy video games again. thank you larian studios for making another great crpg after dos 2.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"aside from very minor bugs, the game ran great, played great, had a very good storyline, really interesting characters, entertaining choices and response options, and overall was a thoroughly entertaining. replayability is high as there are so many story impact full choices that lead to other scenes you will not have seen before. lots of builds to try as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,awesome game. other game makers take note and stop releasing halfassed cash grabs
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"honestly this is the most masterpiece game i have ever played for a long time. sure there was a lot of bugs but mostly in act 3, yet still playable and have great time. . hell this game still got me hook even i go to work thinking about baldur's gate most of the day even wanted to considered have a few sick day! i don't think you'll have a good complete game like this for a while. i hope this win the game of the year even topped the game in metacritic because it is well deserved. the community of larian are in great position and hope they continue to stay strong because i want more of them and hope they can do well in divinity sin 3. my favourite thing about this game is that you have decision and you would be in conflicted by your consequence which also would shape your story. bad or good, it's still beautiful and you have rewarding moments. you would be amazed or shocked. even the companion was fun to toy with. also i never thought turn based game especially in baldur's gate 3 would be so much fun and can be challenging,. even if you're not a big fan of turned base but i suggestion you should try it anyway. a lots of games these day are in hurry and want to speed thing, so it's time to slow down once a while and enjoy every amount of the game so that you learn to appreciated it. again, it is masterpiece and well done aside of few buggy. we need more complete game like it. thanks larian for this beast game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"this game is undoubtedly goty material, its one of the best games ive ever played. while its adaptation of 5e dd may not be for everyone, i believe the game does a good job in toning some aspects down with its explorer difficulty as to appeal to a more casual audience who may not have experience with dd or wit 5e"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,just another trash larian's game. decisions does not have any sense again. they make it in 4th game in the row. disgusting humor. filth everywhere. worst rpgoriented game studio. 010

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,has been an amazing journey from start to finish. did have some minor bugs in act 3 but other that that it was nearly flawless. can't wait for further optimizations for this and please roll for stats and add avernus content
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,it's become a second full time job but this one doesn't pay me and i don't resent it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"90 hours into act 1, hooked since i started playing. so much to do, so little time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"after reading the insanely dumb  terribly written bad reviews, i decided to add my own to counter act them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"have been playing crpgs for more than 20 years. im a veteran gamers in general. never bothered to leave a review for any game. but here guys, it is something different. i felt i must put this off my heart as larian studio deserves this. very simple and to the point this is the mona lisa of gaming history. period."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"if you've ever wanted a dd but a video game game then i can't reccomend it enough. the story is great, the classes are great, the humor is on point, and with several endings it's repayable to an unexpected degree."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"this game has no right to be this good. it has infected my family like a disease. we are consumed by playing this game. my fiance who exclusively plays overwatch, has stopped playing ow to experience bg3 which is nothing short of a miracle. 1110"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,great game. over a hundred hours in game and not even halfway through act3. if you like rpg's this game is for you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"i find it very funny how you can go on the negative reviews and almost none of them say anything true about the game, sure some of them give some feedback but thats very rare. there's a ton of 010 to balance the game, or people rating it 0 while rating diablo 4 an 8 after the season 1 patch or someone rating every game thats impacted culture 0, 1 or 2. its honestly great. as for the actual game, act 1 and 2 are damn near perfect, im not a big fan of crpgs but this game feels so smooth that its easy to pick up, cutscenes are perfect, story is good and bug free for the most part. the problem is with act 3. the amount of bugs in act 3 could bring this down to an 8 or 9 but its larian. i trust theyll fix these bugs none of them are game breaking mind you at least in my path. most games have 10x more bugs with a bigger development team and a small scope. cant stress how much i recommend this game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"best game of the history. this game is absolutelly amazing, it gives you alot of freedom and it makes you feel like you are the character wich is hard in games nowdays."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"unfinished, buggy, juvenile writing, and massive unnecessary sexual content. absolutely disgusting destruction of the series."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"baldur's gate 3 exceeds the prior titles by larian studios, and plays great on desktop, laptop or asus ally. a beautifully polished, life like world, with the addiction and brutality of game of thrones, bg3 proves we are in the renaissance of pc gaming. this game of the year quality title will draw you in from the very beginning, leave you caring about the outcome of it's inhabitants, and ultimately puts the fate of the world in your hands."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,amazing. this game is so fun. im sure ill play through multiple times.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,one of the best games ever made. it is so hard to not to get into the world and live in that world. it has shown the real meaning of rpg. great game. i just can't get enough of it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"un jeu incroyable  tester absolument, merci  larian pour ce chefd'uvre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"it's hard to recommend the game right now with the sheer amount of bugs in act 3. the ending feels unfinished and disappointing with how little closure is given to the characters. none of the choices you make throughout the game affect the ending and i noticed several glitches and plot holes throughout the last 2 hours of the game. the main storyline also feels disjointed, and as much as i enjoyed acts 1 and 2, there is very little direction or progress in the main storyline until the end of act 2. it feels as if you will spend most of your time running around doing side content with no larger goal in mind. the companion storylines were fun to watch for the most part, however one character in particular seems to be a huge victim of cut content. the game is also missing basic quality of life features like easier party management, and some of the fights near the end of the game are just painfully slow as sometimes enemies will stand there for 30 seconds unmoving, and since there's no way to speed up enemy turns i just end up alt tabbing while waiting for it to be my turn again. unfortunately, i started the game at a 10 and it dropped the longer the game went on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"pedazo de juego, de lo mejor mas entretenido. hace aos que que no le meto horas y horas y horas en un juego desde rdr 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"best rpg i ever played! goty for sure, i don't want play any another crpg more!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"too bugged on release, cut content, doesn't deserve even half of the current score."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"i've been playing video games for 30 years. i was really starting to lose hope that any developers or studios would ever push the envelope again. take risks and challenge themselves. listen to the players and release a video game worthy of our time and money. i can't really nail down all the reasons why baldur's gate 3 has enslaved me now going on 100 hours. i think it's the entire presentation. they get so many things right. and then they go out of their way to show you more. it just never stops. there's never a lull in the story or in the action. never a period of just grinding out xp to level up by farming one location over and over again. they didn't just put a new coat of paint on the genre. this is the genre. in fact, i don't know if anyone has ever been making crpgs correctly so you might be like me and have never experienced something like this. i haven't been this excited for the future of gaming in over a decade. i can't wait to see how other studios respond. the interconnectivity between everything going on in this game borders on unsettling. like you're being tricked or something. you get these moments where you're like, hey, what . . wait a second?? like this one where i found a stray dog on the road guarding his master's dead body. my druid could speak with animals and is very persuasive so we were able to talk the dog into coming back to our camp for food and shelter. he ended up staying and is just our dog now. but he found this red ball one random time when i was at camp and he had it in his mouth and i took it, then i used the throw command and the dog chased it. pretty neat. kudos. but then about 60 ingame hours later this happened. i'm on a mainline quest and i decide to go rogue. i break into this balcony and lockpick the door from the outside. my party all crowd into the room and there's this undead dog barking and going crazy. the game cuts away to a list of prompts to see how i want to proceed.. and one of them reads maybe you still have that red ball that twitch was playing with. and i did!! i had it with me throughout the whole game. i had the dog sniff it and then i rolled against my animal handling to try and calm him down all the way. which failed after 6 attempted rolls and 3 save games. so i did have to murder that undead dog. but i couldn't believe that little red ball made such an unexpected appearance way later in the game. its that connectivity between everything. even things that don't relate or won't ever be in the same room together. that random chance, or forgetting something small, seeing coincidences and wondering if they mean something. that  really makes this world feel like an actual place. random connections and coincidences happen if life all the time. never thought i'd see it in a game that felt this authentic. one last thing while i'm here. i was debating this so i rolled for it. here we go. i've never done this before in any review. there are some games that i cherish dearly. i don't know if i've ever said this about any game. maybe in a drunk conversation. sonic frontiers is the greatest fking game ever!! fight me!!! but i've never truly believed that i had arrived at that conclusion with any game. and i believed i would live the rest of my life without ever making such a bold and ridiculous claim. however, larien studios has shown us otherwise. the impossible has been achieved. baldur's gate 3, inmyopinion, is the greatest game ever made. that's a very opinionated and biased statement that is definitely worth debating so i'll leave that at that and finish with what i do know to be absolutely true. baldur's gate 3 is my favorite game of all time. ever. this has been a stunning year in gaming. might end up being the best year in gaming . . . ever. so baldur's gate 3 didn't have a blank slate of bored gamers with nothing great to play. because there has been multiple instances of greatness this year. i think it's fitting that in a year filled with so many great titles, one of them would not only stand high above the rest, but make a play for alltime greatness. now then, you people have wasted enough of my precious bg3 time. i really hope everyone enjoys this amazing and so very special game. if you don't, don't blame my review. blame your parents."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"bg3 gives so much agency to the player, it feels like it is on an entirely different level than the game that came before it. it stands among the rpg greatest hits for me, and larian feels a lot like bioware felt during their prime. i feel the same emotional highs i felt when first playing mass effect or kotor. it's an increasingly rare type of gem among today's video games, where live service and micro transactions water down the base experience of most new titles. bg3 remains faithful to the dnd 5e experience by taking the base rules, and then bending and homebrewing those rules where it makes sense for the sake of fun or balance. it is a complete package, much like the baldurs gate titles that released before it, with no need to buy a season pass or a dlc to get the full and complete experience. i look forward to more amazing titles from larian studios in the coming years, hopefully a starfinder title? one can hope."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the plot, narrative and quests that do not keep you, as a player, for an idiot, but rather give you many opportunities to get to the bottom of the truth and the desired result in different ways. to be honest, a couple of times i puzzled over it all so much that i had to peep into the guides.  bright, memorable companions. each of them stole my heart, and even laezel, with whom we have a difference of opinion. my applause goes to the voice actors and everyone involved in creating the characters in this game. and the personal quests of karlakh and especially astarion made me cry.  a combat system heavily reworked from the dnd 5e system that rewards the creativity and little tricks of the player. i'm not a big fan of turnbased combat, but the local one pulled me in with my head. holy kitties, what a thrill i experienced every time i managed to outwit the enemy, find some interesting tactical solution, and so on. not only did the battles from time to time not become duller, so the game periodically also threw up interesting conditions for success.  opportunities for roleplaing. the game is attentive to the race and class of the player, which is just fine. for example, playing as a drow, i walked back and forth through the goblin camp as if at home, and no one even objected to me either at the entrance or anywhere else. and being also a bard, i very often managed to agree with the characters about what i needed without bloodshed. and this is just my personal example, and there are many such variations in the game.  the beauty of the surrounding world. it is detailed, rich, destructible, interactive. it wants to be explored and used during battles. the lighting here is especially beautiful, sometimes i lingered in locations just to admire them.  faces of characters. for me, this is a separate highlight and from now on my personal little fetish, which i will look for in future games from other studios. the way the characters act in the cutscenes, gesticulate actively, use facial expressions and every wrinkle and muscle on the face is involved in this... just wow. sometimes i caught myself involuntarily holding my breath from acting out other characters and copying the facial expressions of my own drow.  delightful musical accompaniment. the soundtrack of the game is already downloaded on my spotify and listened to several times. infrequently, the music inside the game has such a strong effect on me where it evokes sadness and sentimentality, somewhere else it adds fighting spirit and courage. that moment in raphael's mansion was unexpected and chicly appropriate. the song take control and the moment with it from the control game immediately came to my mind. and when the end credits rolled and their title song played, i simply burst into tears from all the emotions accumulated over a long adventure. i think it's worth it. throughout the entire game, with the exception of a few major battles, my laptop ran the game's ultrasettings at 50 fps at qhd resolution. even upon arrival in the city, i did not experience significant problems, and i have only a couple of small buts in relation to this game  the apparently unfinished final part of the game, which begins after the gates to the upper city. but i think this is a temporary problem, which will be fixed in subsequent patches and hotfixes, which larian do not skimp on.  from what i've heard, a lot of content was cut that was potentially interesting and expanding on the story of the game. i hope it will be added later or its tails sticking out in the game will be polished a little. but its absence does not affect the complexity and pleasure of the game, in my opinion.  cluttered epilogue. it seems that everything was enough for me, and i had a final dialogue with the favorite, but i wanted something like a year later for the satellites with whom i managed to become related in more than a hundred simulated hours, as well as small epilogues for those characters and for world, which somehow influenced my actions. we can only hope that the developers will listen to us and add this to the game. my review turned out to be unexpectedly large, although initially i did not even know how to express my emotions and impressions of baldur's gate iii. in my eyes, it's amazing. i have been waiting for it for several years and i will go through it more than once alone and with friends. and separately i want to say immense thanks to larian studios, which, most likely, will not see this, but still. despite all the difficulties for decades, they did not turn off the intended path, but gained experience and released games better and better, putting a piece of their soul into them. baldur's gate iii is their crowning achievement right now, but i'm sure these developers will be able to surprise us in the future. thanks to them for their intelligence, creativity, perseverance and respect for their audience. strength to them and inspiration for future games!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"ignore anyone giving this absolute masterclass in how to create a story driven rpg less than 5. they have no idea what they are talking about and must've played something made by blizzard...with battle passes, microtransctions, bloated  gameplay that gets nerfed each season to limit how much fun players get to have, there is only the slog that only wants to maintain your engagement in their chore lists not your entertainment. baldurs gate 3 is just phenomenal. turn based combat, exploration, and dialogue focused scenes are basically the main aspects you'll be dealing with. if you don't like that combination just give this one a miss, it's not for you. i've played through twice, both with custom characters. the 2nd being the dark urge origin. my 1st play through i went down the morally good alignment saving people from the baddies and such and it was amazing, there was so many quests and party members to speak with, finding allies who would be in the camp to speak with later for additional lore and dialogue rounding out their smaller quests. the finale of my 1st run was great and i enjoyed the ending i got. the whole marketing thing of 17k endings obviously isn't true there are slight differences and variables dependent on your choices but largely you'll get a handful of endings. i wish there was more of an epilogue for the characters i spent the last 50 hours with but you get a few final scenes that close of some things and leave others with some speculation. my only complaint is the dark urge and going for an evil, succumbing to this origin characters dark desires often results in a very evil run albeit to some gruesome moments and i dove right in, but this resulted in a smaller number of allies i could choose for my party, losing karlach and wyll because of the choice i made in act 1 provides you with 1 replacement of an enemy turned friend in act 2. act 3 in my 1st run left me with so much to do in the way of quests but on my dark urge there were was not as many in comparison, but this is . i definitely had more fun in combat with my dark urge, being evil and resorting to violence has some pretty good rewards if you follow it to completion. all in all i've put over 130 hours not including my early access playtime which was about 30 hours and this game is one of the best ever made. for rpg lovers. a welcome change from the never ending live service pieces of  that have clogged up the industry of late. triple a developers should be worried because this is now the standard for rpgs whether they like it or not. the next dragon age, mass effect or whatever else comes out should be compared to bg3."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,this is a great game that a lot of people waited a long time for. it was worth the wait.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"baldurs gate 3 is the single most dedicated, enjoyable, and thought out rpg i've ever played. the mechanics of it are vast, the story choices and roleplay options available to players is second to none. while the game undoubtedly as its bugs, an issue no dev team seems immune to, the fact of it that for a aa studio to put our a game that brings players more fun and entertainment than what the likes of even the top tier aaa studios seem to be capable of, is a fantastic feat. with some extra love and care, something i believe larian is absolutely capable of putting in, i imagine bg3 is going to have a strong running to be game of the year for many, many players."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,um dos melhores jogos que j joguei. e ele  facilmente candidato ao jogo do ano.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,awsome game. this is how games should be released. no microtransactions or season passes. complete game for the price.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the best crpg i've played so far. pros  good acting, everything is voice acted  impactful choices  balanced  itemization feels good  character developement  1 price 1 game things i'd like  ironman mode 1 save  party management still, the best game i've played in a long time. thanks larian for your integrity and hard work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the level design is so well done for a map this huge, the story is so flexible and the characters so well written that i can't point any relevant flaw, i love it. not to mention the absence of microtrasantions and expensive dlc's that are just a part of the game that should be part of the base game, i hope larian studios set a new standard for such a damaged industry filled with lazy, unfinished and overpriced games. never change for the worse larian, please"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the game is simply fantastic. played several hours in early access and the full game did not disappoint. dedication larian has shown to the detail of the game is apparent. it is wonderful to see a developer who actually cares about making an artistic, fully fledged product. excited to see how further updates continue to improve this already amazing game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"baldur's gate 3 got me excited based on reviews and feedback, so i gave it a shot, and it didn't let me down. the game nails the atmosphere, scenery, graphics, and noncombat gameplay. almost any object is interactable in the game. the main issue i have with this game is with quests and gamechanging choices. if you unknowingly pick an impossible path, you can waste hours before realizing it, and quests might glitch due to mistimed choices. the combat's tactical part is fun but can drag on, get overly complicated, and i'm not a fan of the chance to hit system. though, i must admit that i'm not a big fan of crpgs and turnbased combat systems, i prefer combat styles equal to dungeon siege and dragon age for 4party setup."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"bg3 is a love letter to those of us who love crpgs and dnd. i haven't had this much fun playing a video game for a very, very long time. the level of reactivity to your decisions is astounding. the characters you meet and travel with are all interesting and well fleshed out. featuring a fantastic story full of heart, wonderful voice acting, i felt connected to the story from beginning to end. i have seen a lot of comments about the ending of the game not measuring up to the beginning. i disagree. i think it does end a little abruptly just like every dnd campaign, but a sprawling epilogue isnt needed. the story isn't the one that plays just before the credits, its the one you participated in for the 100 hours it took you to get there. there were some minor bugs in my playthrough, but none that truly detracted from my experience. things like tposing ghouls in the background of a cutscene, or a romance scene playing twice. my performance was great across the board, though i am running a pretty solide rig. all in all i will be playing and replaying this game for years to come. bravo larian! p.s., please make an expansion or baldurs gate 4!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"amazing story voice lines, if you are a fan of crpg or just turn based games in general i highly recommend"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the amount of content is massive. almost everything on screen has a voice. voice acting is top notch. the replayability is high. graphics and effects are incredible. music is epic. there are bugs yes, but not that are game breaking. requires alot of saving in first playthrough. multiplayer changes the game as well and fun with friends if you have the time together."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,huge fan of dos1 and 2 and larian as a whole and this is a culmination of all that they have learned from those games and it is simply a crpg fans dream come true
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,the best top down rpg game i've played. the immersive story and gameplay brings back a joy in gaming i thought i had lost.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"wow... just wow! that is how games should and was some time ago be created. wonderful, intriguing and hard to get off from adventure. great dialogues, music and plot. totally recommend even if this would be just one game to play in 2023. p.s i created account here specifically to praise this game. never done it before and i am 39, gaming from like 7 or 8"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"baldur's gate 3 is the old school crpg fan's dream for modern gaming. the level of detail put in this game's world, characters, and narrative is nothing short of magnificent. as with any large scale rpg with lots of moving elements, there are plenty of bugs. surely most of these will be addressed in time and they did little to affect the enjoyment of my first playthrough which rang in at about 140 hours. even after playing for so long and experiencing the full campaign, i am still hesitant to look up information on this game, because there is still so much more i haven't experienced due to the choices i did or did not make. i see myself playing this game several more times to experience many more outcomes and consequences."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"greatest rpg ever? i think so, exceeds expectations and sets a new standard. what a breath of fresh air after so many crap releases from other developers putting in minimal effort and shilling out garbage broken releases. no micro transactions, complete game, amazing voice acting, amazing storytelling, actual agency in choices. gamers bemoan the industry, they have every right to with so many greedy corporations out there shilling out the same crap year after year, however, the silver lining is that there are so many great developers and publishers out there these days that are actually doing it right. shout to the goats larian, from soft, bandi, gunfire, ggg, cdpr i don't think one misstep disqualifies them but they are under the microscope now, capcom, and more i'm missing but the point is they exist, vote with your wallets stop supporting scummy companies like bethesda, blizzard, ea, ubisoft, etc. thank you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,what the fk? where is the battle pass? where is the ingame donation... they don't understand how to make modern games?!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,only hyped because of the state of the gaming media lately. nothing special that hasnt been done before and better.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"i've been playing rpgs since late 90's and couldn't drive myself into anything descent since late 2000s. this particular title wasn't any promising to me until a friend of mine asked for playing together and i lost myself to faern for 2 weeks completing every quest, investigating through each dungeon like back then when i was a child. this game revived my interest to rpg and turnbased action genre. bg3 has beatiful storytelling, nice grpahics, exceptional voice acting, challenging fights. it's not pretending to be a yet dark grim fantasy game full of cliched characters yet indeed everyone could find some comedy and drama in it, a story of your own. and due to vast replayability i'm 100 sure there are a couple more adventures waiting for me there"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"besides minor bugs and issues which are understandable in a game with thousands of systems, its impeccable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"i had really good memories of bg2 and a very good experience with dos12. this game take the best parts of the previous bg games, the better of dos, and had improved and added lot of content. the number of things you can do... is marvelous. how many times did i solved a situation perfectly, but reloaded it few times to try each option... each is probably not the good word as i found everyday on youtube videos with ppl that found other way to atteign the same objective while doing it in a way i was not able to findthink about. the end of the game approach and i am already sad thinking about it..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,miglior crpg di sempre lo sto amando alla follia bravissima larian ottimo lavoro!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,you know there is something special about a game when people who usually won't play a turn based game are playing it and enjoying. the amount of effort behind the game and it's size is something exceptional nowadays. this game has everything you want in a rpg and was able to translate very well the dd 5e system into it. the vast world give you many reasons to explore it and there are many interesting stories to be uncovered. it's also important to notice that the game is being constantly patched since the first week to assure that players have the best experience possible.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i was waiting years for this game, and most of it was truly amazing, but act 3 as a whole is in a bad state, and the ending is very lackluster. edit larian deserves a 10 for the speed with they are patching the game and adding things that the players are asking for."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"after 23 years of playing games, i think i finally have an answer to what my favorite game of all time is  unbelievable voice acting and facial animations during dialogue. the writing is incredible. the characters are so likeable, from main questline characters to a random cow on the side of the road. i have the attention span , but not 1 conversation in this game has lost my attention for more than 5 seconds.  your choices matter, and not in the tod howard sort of way. the game totally changes depending on your choices of which there are countless. it makes you want to play through the entire game multiple times just to experience how different each playthrough is.  tactical, turnbased combat with so many different ways to approach any given encounter. the difficulty can vary drastically depending on your plan going into a fight, and there is a massive amount of freedom in how you choose to exploit an enemies weaknesses if you are willing to look for them.  the character creation and class system is deep, and only becomes deeper as you level up and unlock more skills and traits for your characters. each class can showcase it's own utility in all things including combat, world traversal and dialogue. every character in your party will have their uses depending on the situation.  the story is phenomenal from start to finish. it initially makes you feel somewhat insignificant as an entity in a massive world with so much going on around you, yet also makes your decisions for you and your party feel important and impactful to the world you inhabit. there are twists you don't expect, as well as tough decisions to make that can drastically change your playthrough. and the game is paced beautifully as it slowly builds and builds in tension and intrigue. overall this game is probably the most shockingly good game i've ever played. i haven't tried any of the previous instalments in the series, and i had hardly heard of it up until it released this month. but it has ended up, in my mind, being a mustwin for game of the year, even in a year with so many great games being released. this is a special piece of media made by people that clearly truly care about what they have made and they deserve all the success they are having for it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"best game i've ever played. it is a dream come true for dd and rpg fans alike. rarely do we see a game deliver on such a large scope. this is also my first review, and based on my experience with the game, i was compelled to issue a rating. baldur's gate 3 is a complete game, without the ingame monetization frills we too often see in the industry. if any game had to be worth its price tag, it would be this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"this game is one of the best games has ever made, nothing more needs to be said."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,honestly one of my favorite games ive ever played. some things you should know if youre planning on playing  have to have your nvidia driver updated so it doesnt run like crap 2. it takes 120 gigs 3. it has turn based combat 4. and it has a pretty confusing introduction it also has some bugs here and there and some frame rate issues but most of the time is runs pretty well. my biggest problem with the game is that it has an awful tutorial which made me hate it at first but as i kept playing and figuring out what to do it became a great game. would recommend.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,the first crpg game.i like this game.maybe i'll try more turn  best games of 2023
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"fantastic game and worthy successor to baldur's gate 2, one of the best rpgs of all times. bg3 shines with tons of content for free, lots of replayability and great writing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"what a breath of fresh air in the gaming space no arbitrary filler or grinds just a full feature complete game this is what the standards of games should be its what they used to be no microtransactions, no battle pass just you get the game you paid for end off"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"insane game, anyone that thinks about checking it out, try it! the combat might be not everyone's favorite since its turn based. but do not let that distract you from all the hard work larien put into the story roleplay and impact of your choices. there is no other game that compares to the depth of your choices and the many outcomes it can have on your experience of a playtrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the most important thing that makes a game playable is the gameplay. unfortunately, the gameplay mechanics of this game are from the 1990s and are very boring. overhyped !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"an amazing game, but by god does act iii need to be reworked and rewritten, entirely ruined the game for me, there also are not 100,000 endings as promised."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"this game is an absolute masterpiece! it's so openended, fun, and replayable that i know i will be playing it for years. it's even teaching me how to play dungeons  dragons. larian really knocked it out of the park. absolutely my game of the year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"baldurs gate 3 is a spiritual successor of the series in the best way one could hope for. the design and level of detail is great, the voice acting is superb and you can feel the love that went into this project. all things considered i give it a solid 10 for this outstanding achievement and the fun i have playing the game. i look forward to playing this through again with an origin character and different choices. yes, there probably are a lot of things the devs would have loved to integrate into the final release and couldnt, but compared to other productions i dont consider this a flaw, rather a reality of game design industry. personally, i would have enjoyed alfira or zevlor joining my party or other nontadpoleinfected characters i meet on my journey. kagha or another evil druid would have been an interesting addition. also, i could imagine more freedom in terms of evil party composition and story development. some things appear on a sidenote and could be more tied into the main plot. anyway, i judge what i get and not what could have been."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"aren't masterpieces like divinity, divinity original sin 2 enough to prove larian studio's talent? i do not appreciate the story baldur's gate 3 is it a new standard or not? but if we don't consider it as a role model in game development, then we will have junk games like ubisoft, overwatch 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,baldur's gate 3 became the best game i have ever played. previous one was baldur's gate ii.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the bible of good gaming, game of the decade. if you are stupid enough to play only clickersarpg, this game is not for you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"for all those who have never played baldur's gate the vote will definitely be a 10. for those like me who played the old titles it can only be a 7 because the game is really well done but it's a divinity original sin 2 with the dnd 5 rules and nothing more, nothing less. where are the things peculiar to baldur's gate like  6x member party  action turn combat without turn to turn mode  formation mode where you can organize the battle  more isometric view right now it's too far and not well realized i would have given it an 89 if it had another name without mentioning baldur's gate that right now it's another things and other genre"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"bg3 is a beacon of light for all of the people that love rpg games and larian is the perfect marriage. personally, i had never played dnd and this game is an awesome entry to it, understanding it has its differences. its refreshing to be able to play an rpg game that actually feels like it without giving away the classic feel of combat, itemization and exploration."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"the best game i played in the last decade. so many possibilities. the scenario and sub quests are greats, combat is difficult and fun. a really great game in so many ways."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"baldur's gate 3 is an absolute masterpiece that seamlessly melds captivating storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and engaging gameplay. from the moment you take a step into its richly detailed world, you get hit by the intricate character development and the morally complex choices that shaped the narrative. the attention to detail in every aspect, from spellcasting to dialogues, is nothing short of astonishing. larian studios has outdone themselves, creating an rpg that not only pays homage to its legendary predecessors but also sets a new standard for the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"un piccolo miracolo, se non per il gioco in s comunque di livello altissimo, con dialoghi stupendi e divertente sia dal lato gestionale rpg che da quello tattico del combattimento, anche per la ventata di aria fresca che ha portato sul mercato, mantenendo e superando le aspettative promesse. sicuramente uno dei giochi pi interessanti del 2023, ma forse della decade"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,game of the year. thanks larian this game is awesome.best rpg game  and play.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"over 150h in early access  awesome. then started over with full release and i am even more shocked. it got even better. i have over 200h counting loading saves to see other outcomes and licking all the walls. and it was just act1 with small amount of act2. this is a masterpiece full of content and impossibly good mechanics. a sandbox and a great story altogether. we all know its a pinnacle of rpg, one of the greatest achievements in games since the witcher 3. it has some flaws which is understandable in such big game, yet still even with lot of bugs and bad next acts doubt its impossible to lower the score to less than 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"baldur's gate 3 is a great game that progressively loses its steam as it goes on. the first half of the game is great, with great rpg elements, enjoyable characters, and a pretty strong storyline with branching choices. the narrative isn't necessarily amazing, but its a great setup for an extremely open ended dnd adventure, getting the closest to freeform that most games can. level design is similar to dos2, giving the player tons of freedom for creative ways to solve problems, similar to an immersive sim. there are a few missteps in the earlier sections of the game, most notably are the almost obnoxiously inyourface companions who all want to sleep with you the moment you meet them, which can be annoying at best and uncomfortable at worst, but they're not too bad as to damage the experience. by the second half, however, your choices become increasingly less meaningful, and eventually, the game stops giving you choices you would have had previously. act 3 drags this game down badly, and should have been entirely cut to serve as a sequel so that it could be better fleshed out. it is terribly buggy, with heaps of cut content and apparently content that is effectively cut, not activating due to bugs. this completely ruins the evil route in the game, and i'm completely baffled they shipped it like that, in addition to performance issues so bad that the game becomes borderline unplayable at times. performance degrades horribly as sessions go on, although a restart can help. despite the awful marketing claim of 17,000 endings, there is one, and it is sequel bait, something that comes across as almost insulting after slogging through act 3. here, larian has continued their tradition of halfbaked lategame chapters, but this is easily the worst offender. it's so bad that i have taken 2 off of my score, and if it weren't for the fantastic first 2030 hours, i likely would have lowered my score to a 6 or below. if act 3 was a standalone game, i could not recommend it in good faith."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"a breath of fresh air. got so tired of the same game concepts getting repeated over and over. i can't stress how much we needed this. it's understandable the game might feel overwhelming at the start, but man once you get the hang of it, it's just amazing. everything about the game is perfect. and it's fine if you save before rolling the dice, we all do it. p"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"i'm finding that i am not a fan of clunkily moving around by mouse clicks, and bg3 has a steep learning curve if you've never played a turn baseddd style game before. it seriously needs a tutorial for newbs with no prior experience in this style of game. the lack of a decent quest tracking system is also frustrating. worst though are the game killing bugs, like suddenly being permanently encumbered after the patch, even if you dump your entire inventory down to your skivvies. suggested online fixes like kill yourself and then pay 200 gold to revive aren't a fix at all. there is a game here to like, but it would be a lot more likeable if they had made it more friendly to new players, and of course squashed the game killing bugs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"the best game i've played since the witcher 3 in 2016, i daresay my experience with baldur's gate 3 is even better. masterfully crafted world with superb storyline that can be told in more ways than one and it will still be miraculously coherent by the end of it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"es el juego definitivo del ao, la historia la jugabilidad hay infinidad de cosas por hacer seguro me jubilare con este videojuego"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"sets a new benchmark not only for the crpg genre but all gaming. excellent story, graphics, sound. great combat  dialogue systems."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"this game is amazing, the reason it's only a 9 and not a 10 is because it's a bit difficult at first, the controls are a bit wobbly, but other than that it's a great game. i recommend, but still wait for the release on the xbox, it's still not a sony exclusive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,the story and gameplay are both enjoyable and there are many customizable builds and optional paths which affect the game. the only issue is i face some game breaking bugs in chapter 3 of the game and i think it needs some polish. other than that everything has been great!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"honestly this game wasn't as good as many made it out to be. could've been much better. ui bugs are a known issue in this game such as combat ui bugs, tutorial messages bugs, minor text tweaks, possible blocking issue, incorrect player portraits, black screen issue, and issues with npc's crime interrogation dialogue."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,i've never played this genre of games the same way i've never played souls like games. my first game was elden ring where i fell in love with the game and now i'm having the same feeling with baldurs gate 3 a new and exciting game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"awesome game. dont get a lot of time to play games any more, so having something solid with an engaging story is so welcome."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"the attention to detail, wonderful power of choice, and a plethora of ways to replay, make this game a 1010 for me. developers and pr people screaming about how we cant expect games to be like this should be afraid of consumers finding and experiencing something finally worth while. we wont forget and i will continue supporting studios producing what we want, not what they think will make them more money."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,amazing game. 120h in and still so much to do and explore. best companion system in the industry with amazing story and your actions and decisions actually effect the world and the story. 1010

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"i am loving this game so far. as someone that grew up with dnd, this is a game that satisfies an itch that's gone unscratched for decades. most modern games put out garbage and monitize everything. they don't respect the players time and money and it shows in the garbage they put out. bg3 goes above and beyond to bring a unique and replayable experience to us, the players. i can also start an adventure with my friends and have a high quality experience. i wish the industry at large would learn from this but they won't because they are greedy. which is why i no longer buy games until i see the reviews and player experiences. i don't reward them with my business once they ruin the reputation. cough cough  mass effect, assasin's creed, cyberpunk, etc. i bought this and it runs great on my mac native right off steam, which i'm surprised by. i may end up buying it again for my ps5 just to reward them extra money for doing it right. it has cross save platform feature which is both thoughtful and practical."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"this adventure is the best thing that happened to me for the first time in many years! thanks to lorian, i was introduced to the universe of the forgotten realms. the game is incredibly beautiful and gives a huge range of emotions! thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"o jogo tem um desenvolvimento e mecnicas muito boas, esto criticando o jogo por absolutamente nada."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"one of the best rpg's ive ever played. bought day one, didn't even need to check the reviews. never played early access. never watched any lets play's. i just knew with larians track record and the fact they were willing to leave this game on early access for years, just to make sure the game was polished and exactly the way they wanted it, shows their devotion to making a good ddbaldurs gate faithful rpg. cant recommend this game enough, for sure my game of the year and i dont see that changing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"one of the greatest games i played in a long time. in the same league with games like elden ring. tons of fun content. interesting story, both main story and the side quests. fun combat with a lot of different ways to fight the fight. combat may be a little confusing in the beginning if you have not played this kind of game before, but give it a little time and you'll enjoy it. my 2 cents about why this game received so much hate from some other game developers. the hate happened because this game, just like elden ring did, exposes the lazy, the incompetent, and the grifter, who will not or cannot make a really good game, and worry that they will have to up their game or be left behind."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"this game should have come with a warning, i was so excited to play it. i believe the warning should say,  rebirthed dead dice game, made this way so you cant get the rolls you want, if you have never played dd before dont buy this game. you will wind up with a product you dont understand and cant use. every time i roll the dice i lose, this game ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"amazing game. for me this is 2023 game of the year, it's so good that i will buy a ps5 version to take advantage of the cloud save when i want to play in the comfort of my sofa"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"this game really has all for a crpg type of game. the only downside is that the combat is way too slowpaced due to being turnbased. would've want realtime with pause like the earlier bg games, at least as an option kinda like how arcanum works. beside that, everything is really great. and the story is really awesome and funny too. it's like kotor and dragon age origins on crack."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"a complete masterpiece. you get the value of your money right away. tons of hours of enjoyment and replay value. easy game of the year and of the decade. this is really what games should be, feature complete, no microtransactions and full of content."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"not a perfect crpg but the best crpg of all time. it's a new standard for the genre. exceptional mechanics, good history, beautiful graphicssound, and an unique vision of the concept of freedom for a computer game. other crpgs, as the original bg iii, may be better in some points, but neither game is as solid in all features as bg iii."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"game is better than literally any other rpg i've played, so it takes my coveted singular 1010 spot, until another game hits my personal marks better to take that spot. currently have 170 hours in it, 130 since launch. have gotten almost to the end of the game and have loved the journey."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,everything was fine until some mental patient came along and bombarded the game score
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"i think enough has been said about this game. it's just amazing. it's beautiful, the ost is amazing, the lore, the characters, the story, the decisions that you have to make, everything is just crazy about this game. there are a few bugs here and there but nothing that a saveload couldn't fix. definitely the best game of the year for me and probably one of my favorites of all time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"buggy and broken game that should have been released a year later. it starts out strong because of early access testing and, as usual for larian studios, is a complete broken mess at the end that they hope to sort out later."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"105 hours and my play through is over, and bg3 has become my favourite game of all time. kudos to larian for making such an amazing crpg, also a big kudos to the voice actors involved in particular samantha beart."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"this might be my new favorite game of all time. i've never played dnd, but so far i am having a great time learning all the new mechanics. the amount of build variety within a single class is amazing, not even mentioning multiclassing. the dialogue is also top tier. it's entertaining while keeping the story serious and down to earth well as much as a medieval fantasy can be. the thing that brings this game above the others though is the countless decisions that all heavily affect your storyline as well as being able to play as the side characters if you want a true role playing experience."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,the best game of the last decade. a true roleplaying experience. the choices i make and their consequences make me feel like i'm in a real story.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"bg3 is definitely too short, after 320h in game i feel like was playing just a bit and can smell the end is coming...  but i want more !!! no micro transactions and game loaded with content. true masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"es uno de los mejores juegos que he visto en mi vida. haca aos que no le dedicaba tantas horas a un rpg y y no se me hace pesado en ningn momento. la historia, los personajes, la jugabilidad, la msica... es que lo tiene todo!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"one of the best games i've ever played, and certainly one of the best crpgs of all time. baldur's gate 3 is a return to form for the industry, bringing us back to the days where games were complete on day 1 and only required minor bug fixing, etc. after launch... all this with an early launch. despite what some industry folks say, this absolutely sets a new standard for the entire industry and it is one in which the player stands to benefit from a refreshing departure from predatory, storesasgames development models and corporate greed. larian deserves all the accolades they receive from this title and i can't wait to see more from this studio. stop reading reviews and go play the game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"i totally love that game. the world is beautiful, the characters are very well written and i spend hours and hours looking into every corner and talking to a lot off npc in hope to get another quest. i was always curious about how the backstories of my companions would play out and i'm already planning the next run with a different character and different decisions. even so i just finished the first run i already hope for an expansion where i can continue traveling with my character and the group and just continue there travel together."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"to anyone who's giving lower score than 10, you guys need to understand what games are. hands down larian, best game since the last of us 1."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"this game surprised me. it has everything that i enjoyed from divinity original sin 2 and more. i am over romance in games, but it's nice to have the option if i wanted too. choices matter in this game. i think it follows dd pretty well. few hiccups occur when i do things the computer wasn't expecting. but no crashes or game breaking bugs in over 80s hrs played on steam. overall a goty contender for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"for me, this game is slightly overrated a solid 810 at least, but hardly the best or biggest rpg of all time or anything like that. currently there are quite a few basic uiqualityoflife issues that need to be addressed, which is fairly standard for a newly released game. however, given just how long bg3 was in early access, and the fact that larian decided to release it a month early for some reason, i think it's fair to expect a bit more polish. the decision to release the game early ostensibly to get out ahead of starfield looks even more suspect given how much content larian got cut late in the game. up until the last couple weeks, they advertised much larger areas of the city of baldur's gate than were ultimately included. in light of this, i think the praise larian is receiving for supposed consumerfriendly practices is somewhat undeserved. some bad design decisions have clearly been carried over from dos2, such as subpar inventory management and the lack of true pause functionality. most of all, the lack of control over which party member attempts a skill check is a major problem for a partybased rpg party members should be able to interject their own insight into conversations more often. even basic stuff, like character movement, switching between party members, and interacting with objectscontainers, feels very clunky and unresponsive, even by crpg standards. bg3 handles traps very poorly sometimes they're bugged and other times your ai teammates walk straight into them, at best disarming them feels like a chore given how they often come in large groups. there is virtually no ingame documentation of classsubclass features, so the player has no idea what options they're actually choosing between unless they do research outofgame. if you're not careful, given the limited number of backgrounds to choose from, it's easy to make selections that result in wasted duplicate skill proficiencies, and the game does not provide any warningsolution for that. larian has understandably homebrewed a lot of 5e game rules for bg3, but in some cases it's difficult to tell whether something is an intentional change or just the result of buggy implementation. for example, some cantrips are now once per short rest, and even key class features like sneak attack can be rather finicky. to me it doesn't really feel like the design decisionsbalance changes in bg3 reflect an expert understanding of 5e and its issues. the environments are visually impressive and lend themselves to interesting encounter design, which bg3 seems to prioritize above all else. however, i have yet to experience much sense of being immersed in a living world. the combat incorporates some sandbox elements, and there are lots of different dialogue options, but otherwise for a crpg i wouldn't say that there's a ton of freedomchoice in terms of how you solve problems for the most part, you either do what an npc says or alternatively you can fight them. as with larian's previous games, the companions are rather cliched and shallow vampire, amnesiacs, multiple characters with foreign objects implanted into their torso... larian are not winning many points for subtlety or creativity in this respect. if those options weren't edgy enough for you, they even have a serial killer origin called the dark urge. companions are also a bit hypersexualized, with much of their content oriented toward romance. finally, the lack of dwarfhalflinggnome companions is a strange oversight overall it feels like larian prefers the more exotic races like tiefling, githyanki, and dragonborn. if you're looking for a polished, meticulously balanced experience in an immersive setting with incredible writing, you'll probably be somewhat disappointed. but that's not to say bg3 doesn't have plenty going for it it offers coop multiplayer, its graphics are unrivaled among crpgs, its turnbased combat is imo far superior to the realtime with pause of classic baldur's gate, and it certainly captures a pulpy, accessible mainstream dnd vibe."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"an amazing game with incredibly deep gameplay mechanics, strategic and satisfying combat, lots of possibilities emerging from even the smallest decisions you make, best rpg game ever and finally a game that fulfills my role playing dreams. i haven't played another game that achieved this level of immersion. i find myself playing hours and hours without realizing how time flies. i will go a step further and confidently say, this is the best game i have ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,one of the best games i've played since elden ring. odr a game i've played like this in a while if ever.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"a full game, with no microtransactions or dlc in 2023?! that alone would easily place this game at a 6 on the scale today, however that's far from this titles only accolade. the game is just fun in general. with plenty of storied characters to choose from, as well as custom characters for a more unique playthrough. the dialogue, branching paths, and even online multiplayer will have you not just excited to finish your story but to begin your next one immediately after. this is an example  done extremely well, and we can only hope beyond hope to get more games like it. well worth the price of purchase, as i can't see anyone finding a reason to hate the game. in fact i believe this is one of those titles that several years later will have people delving into it's many stories and secrets."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"como algum que no  muito f de rpg de turno, posso dizer que baldur's gate 3 me prendeu, e muito! no estava dando muitas esperanas para esse jogo, mas na minha primeira sesso, fiquei facilmente 10h jogando. poder ter a liberdade de construir sua histria, por qualquer escolha que seja,  o que torna esse jogo to bom, poder ser livre para seguir seu caminho. tem vontade de ser um guerreiro solo? sem problemas, vai l. quer ser um mago e ter 3 brbaros na sua equipe? no tem problema, voc pode. muitas partes dos reviews negativos so por conta dos combates demorados. concordo em partes ser um pouco chato ter que esperar 12 inimigos atacarem ou se mexerem pra poder ter seu turno, mas  um rpg de turnos, o que esperarava? d uma chance ao jogo, voc pode acabar gostando bastante, igual eu"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,incredible game. bg 1 and 2 have been revelations for me when i was younger. the chance that 3 could become a bummer have been quite high. but this game is superb.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"i've played dos and dos2, they are solid games, but bg3 is one of the best games i've played. i really hope that larian goes only up from here, they deserve it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"small text in ui for kbm. worst inventory in the video games history. bugs, bugs, bugs. no upper city. black screen in yumyum scenes. messed up ending scenes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"just breath taking 1010. i as customer got more than i cud ask, it was beyond my expectations. big thank you for the devs!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"this game is awesome, and it become a serious concurrent for goty. all on this game, make you become addicted, that you want to play and never stop. once you have finish the game one time, you can relaunch new one and play a total diffrent run, you will discover and see other cinematics and lore around characters. probably one of the best game of 2023."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,its just very thought out and the freedom of possibility is just nuts. i keep thinking im done with the act 1 map and boooommmm there is more
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"i was never really a fan of turn based games growing up but completely addicted to rpgs. this game changed all that, there is a lot of preplanning for certain fights but its fairly free in what you get to do. best game ive played in a long time without graphic issues or random bugs that break the game until its patched."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"larian studio's team has entirely transformed the 10 scale with this game. games that were a 10 in the past are now a 7 or 8 in comparison. this is not just the greatest crpg ever made, it is the greatest game overall. the only credibility to the argument that this game is too good is found in the truth that if you play this game, you will struggle to enjoy any rpg that isn't this one for quite some time afterward."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,this game has everything what a perfect game needs. for me its game of the year.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,the best and most impressive crpg till now. really masterpiece in game design.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"just it is so goooood for my heart to see, that there are people and companies that can do something that good in modern state of this fking planet"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"a very amazing rpg experience which rewards players, who want to see every single corner of the game. sadly, there are some game elements i don't like, like not being able to access the inventory of your companions which aren't in your party currently, which forced you to switch the companions, just to access certain items, but overall a very great game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,worth a try for everyone. larian opened up new production ideas and quality standards for crpg and it's hard to be copied
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"haven't experienced a game like this in a long time, my boyfriend and i both can't stop playing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,i love this game 1010!!! 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"after finishing an over 100 hour play through, i had to go back and start a new game immediately to find different routes, new allies, and new ends to story lines long since past. absolutely a magnificent crpg, deserving of all the high praise it's receiving, and more than a contender for goty. well done, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"such a breath of change for this horrible industries last 10 years. i can barley believe it, a full complete game, big game with 150 cinematics, no cut content for dlc or day one dlc. no bugs it just  works! other devscompanies should instead of bashing the game, learn from it and see why c so many consumers like it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"one of the best games i've ever played in my life. besides the fun combat and gorgeous graphics, the writing is excellent, i'm talking mass effect 2 or dragon age origins level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"best game i have ever played in my life. the depth of the design and the impact that your choices have on the narrative is perfect. the only downside in the entire game is that character creation is a little basic, but even then there are a lot of choices that make up for it. must play regardless of what games you enjoy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,increble desde divinity 2 no jugaba un rpg tan bueno no me canso de jugar y tomar diferentes decisiones para ver diferentes escenas
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i don't know why but bg3 bored me to death. strange because i really like the two divinity games. the pacing is really too slow this time. yet the story seem amazing. graphics are exceptional. sounds and music perfect. i think i was annoyed at how the level and sublevels were done. how some areas are extremely easy, while others really hard. and how the autosave seems to forget to save in a span of 30 minutes and more. i give it 75 but to be fair, i had trouble liking the game in early access and at it's release. maybe i am not into that particular rpg mechanics anymore."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i want to like it. the opening was terrific. in some ways, it's great. but... 1 way too hard. 2 it pretty clearly cheats on dice rolls. 3 the dialog options are often designed to funnel you into a partiular outcome e.g., a fight  or walking away with your tail between your legs. it has a very manipulate dming style that i dislike. 4 the mapcamera combination is all kinds of horrible. at times, it is very hard to figure out the map. you cannot really look up in some situations. 5 the map is too dense. 6 it feels more like divinity original sin than dd, to me. i may yet change my mind and like it. but i find it hard to play for more than an hour or two at a time  i get irritated. not a good sign."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i have played larian's rpgs divinity original sin 1 and 2 which were excellent games. they completely outdid themselves with bg3. it's familiar, nostalgic, sharp and fresh all at the same time. yeah there are bugs. lots of them. but the game is so good, overlooking bugs is trivial. if all games were made with this much attention to the player, the audience, it truly would be a gamer's paradise. now i understand why other big established developer teams were upset at larian a month ago. larian is master esoteric professor who lives in the treacherous mountain pass complaining devs are the students who refuse to walk to school up hill through the snow because it's hard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"we dont deserved this too good . i just created a metacritic account just to praise this game. too good! it makes you slowdown and imerse yourself to the game. there are consequences where you actually feel it. the gameplay is perfectly balanced. the ai enemy is too good! oh, and no microtransactions! dialogues are engaging"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"everyone has been to eager to come here and praise this game before getting through it entirely. the first act is a master quality product. however, as you move through the game and into the next two acts the shine wears off. there is an abundance of cut content. entire zones that are left out. companion characters with incomplete story and much more. here is a list of cut content. as always, the critics didn't get far enough to give a proper evaluation. act 1  910 act 2  710 act 3  510 there is insufficient space for me to list all of the cut content, but i will post a few of them. 1 the upper city  the most obvious one. swen himself talked about the affluent upper city just 2 weeks before launch and described as it being fully explorable and yet it's very noticeably absent from the final game. 2 shar worship  in ea the player was able to select shar as a diety which game with it's own unique dialogue trees, especially when interacting with shadowheart as a fellow shar worshiper. despite the fact that voice lines were datamined indicating this had functions well into act 2, it was cut when the game launched. 3 karlach's ending  datamined content shows that not only did karlach have a full ending where her infernal engine was fixed and that she survived, but that most of it was fully voiced and complete. however it required triggers from the upper city portion of baldur's gate and when that was cut, so was karlach's act 3 storyline. what we have behind have been confirmed to be karlach's fail state endings which were meant to only play if the player neglected her quest chain. 4 minthara's story  minthara was meant to have a much deeper story, including a pregnancy. these were likely cut due to minthara being a late stage addition to our roster but dialogue lines remain in the games files that show that not only did minthara have a lot more content for herself but your other companions had a lot more to say about it. 5 halsin's story  another late addition to the roster, halsin was originally intended to have a great deal more endgame content involving the druid circle, but this appears to have been cut more early on than some of the other items thus far. 6 raphael the merchant  originally raphael was meant to be a fully viable option to remove your tadpole, in fact the soul coin items that you collect in game where originally meant to be a powerful alternative currency accepted only by raphael in exchange for possibly retrieving your soul as well as a long list of incredibly powerful artifacts from the house of hope that would be sold by raphael himself. 7 avernus  an entire area of the game. avernus was meant to be fully explorable and of similar size to the underdark area of act 1. it would be a source not only for soul coins but other rare materials, highly difficult fights, and special content for karlach. 8 tav the dark urge  a lot of people were both surprised and excited to see the addition of the dark urge origin as the bhaalspawnevil option that was missing from ea. as it turns out, tav was originally the dark urge and they were all one origin. tav was meant to be bhaalspawn and separating the two seems to be what caused the narrative divide between the dead three storyline and the mindflayer plot. 9 omeluum's ring  in the ea version of the game this ring would block your tadpole entirely. it could not grow, it could not grow stronger, and you could not use illithid powers. in the launch version this ring prevents you from being charmed despite omeluum still stating that it blocked the influence of the elder brainabsolute. 10 bhaal and orin versus the creche  an entire act 2 battle was cut in which bhaal's forces, led by orin, attacked the githyanki creche which led to a fight where you either sided with one or the other or had a massive 3way fight on your hands. 11 orin and the dragon  orin was meant to corrupt a githyank red dragon, leading to a boss fight against a slayerformesque dragon. 12 the hag coven in act 2 and 3  you may notice that accepting auntie ethels help in the first act can lead to a negative effect when fighting hags. you may also notice that despite auntie ethel having letters from other hags in her basement, she is the only one you encounter. originally there was meant to be a full three act story involving the hag coven including the mysterious m who seems to have been their leader. 13 epilogues  full epilogue cutscenes have been datamined that varied greatly depending on your choices. these were the 17k ending variations that larian told us about, yet they are completely absent in the final game leading only to a fade to black scene at the end of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,great game. story has been fantastic. a true dnd in video game form. zero microtransactions or ingame store. this should be the standard for video games moving forward.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"fck the greedy publishers and the devs that attack this game this game should be the standard games used to be labors of love enthralling captivating the likes of for example ea, activison, etc many of you made great games once had great vision yes games are made to make money but many ofyou have become hollywood many of you have become tyrants you don't have to nickel and diem people to succeed do better"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,larian's best game and the best crpg right now. this game is literally dnd on steroids and easily be the game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"an incredible 1st and 2nd act that falls flat on it's face in the 3rd act. generally good experience, but poorly paced towards the end with a plethora of bugs and issues as the final hours get hit with the typical larian last act fatigue. loved the companions, loved the combat, loved exploring, but i hope that this game gets the definitive edition treatment because for as intriguing and compelling as the first two acts were, the last act had me rushing for the end to just get it over with."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"un juego al que me aventure siendo mi primer crpg, jams pens que me podra haber gustado tanto, sin duda para mi es el juego mas ambicioso que he jugado este ao y uno de los mejores videojuegos jams creados directo a mi lista de favoritos. unos personajes a los que coges cario, una banda sonora pica y melanclica, y unas misiones y tareas tan bien escritas que tras 110 horas de juego no me aburrieron en ningn momento, no todos los juegos tienen que ser as, ni creo que vaya a ser un estndar en la industria pero si esta calidad fuera lo normal la industria seria mucho mejor. larian ha hecho un juego inigualable y para mi es mi goty 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"this may be my favorite game of all time. so much story, beautiful graphics. depending on the person i could understand its not their cup of tea, but how can there be any negative reviews for this masterpiece. shame on you, negative reviews are for broken games and ones with ridiculous monetization."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"5e as best as possible, it's the best crpg to date. i would give 1011. honestly i don't care about homosexuality or crossdressers in games, as long as they are normal people like in bg3 so thumbs up for making those characters not any more special than any other character. lesbians are always a welcome sight and having a futa action will always cheer my heart. now showing trans characters as something good is just encouraging mental illness."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i just finished my first playthrough, it took me 120 hours and decided to write a review, first one for me. this game is awesome and larian exceeded all of my expectations, but it's not a 10 tho. bg3 has issues, so let's start with them, and talk about good stuff later in review.  bugs, lots of them. mostly it would be something minor, like bugged cutscene, or stuff on the table you cant reach, companions not jumping over the edge, even tho if you start controlling them they are perfectly capable of making this jump, or other weird jumps, when you hit something midair and stuck in there. i had one bug with the quest, and i couldn't finish it, and save was too far to replay everything all over again. only once i encountered gamebreaking bug, when one of my companions couldn't travel, and refused to go to the camp, had to replay last 20 minutes again. it's better then most of recent aaa games, but this game is not without a sin  3rd act cinematics. i absolutely loved cinematics at the 1st and 2nd act. but in the most of them in 3rd i was disappointed. just overall quality, default music playing in epic moment, weird movement, companions shaking, dialogue cutoff or repeat itself and other strange things.  camera. perhaps the worst thing in this game. camera controls are just bad, and camera itself most of the times is showing inside of the walls or something weird else. it's getting worse with the fights where enemies are on the different levels and with the ladders average stuff  companions. all companions are well written, all of the main companions have an arc, which you can close in multiple ways. some companions are fun to be around, some are annoying, and thats ok, they voice acting is on point. but god damn, why are they so horny  performance. most of the game for me was without the issues, usually i've played for around 4 hours and then had to exit game and open it once again, due to fps drops and i have highend pc. but act 3 is way different, when i entered the city i had to exitenter game every 2 hours at least for game to be playable  battles. i love turn based combat, but i can see how it could be an issue for someone who never played games with turn based combat and does not have an experience with dnd ruleset or other tabletop rpgs now to the good stuff  audio. i absolutely loved music and voice acting. several songs from this game are already in my playlist for dnd sessions. voice acting is on point, my personal favorits are voices of narrator, rafael and mol. god, i love them  freedom. this game really awakens your curiosity. i never had an urge to google how to do this quest, or look up where i could get a better sword. game gives you all the tools, and you have to find the way to use them. overall world is fun to explore  story. both main and side quests are great. what i love is that most of these side quests carry on later in the game.  replayability. i'm absolutely sure, when i'll going to do my 2nd playthrough i'll get absolutely different experience, and it's wonderful  memes. do i really need to explain myself here? i haven't tried coop yet, need to try it as well. really hope for the dlc or bg4 already to know what happened with all there characters."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"exceeds expectations. bravo larian studios. during a year of phenomenal releases, this one takes the cake."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"it is a wonder change. i have been a fan of baldur's gate since bg1. i am so happy this game is here. all the hard work that these men and women put into this game really shines. the storylines, the characters, the repeat game play. i hope they don't change anything. i hope they continue to keep the game the way that they wanted it to be. there are so many options to choose from. one save this happened, reload that save and it might not go the same way. brilliant. i enjoy the freedom. when a company says play it your wat, do what you want they really mean it. not like that other piece of not so great  from that company that starts with a b. this has been the most fun i have had since lego star wars the skywalker saga and diablo iii s28. i am hooked, i am addicted. this game is addictive! so addictive! i am not even done with act 1 and i am already thinking of what character i want to be and do in my second play through. i am excited to get home and launch this game and play it. when i think about that other game, coughs d4 i cringe and do not want to continue playing it. good job to all the crew at larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"this game is the goty, definitely. currently it is a huge game, with so many possibilities and an example for the gamer world."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,this might just be my favorite game of all time. and that comes from someone usually not fond of rpg's and turnbased combat.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"baldur1s gate 3, i almost can't describe how much this game excited me and made me want to play something for hours at a time. lately companies are only looking for profit and are forgetting that what makes a successful game is a game made with love, game of the year in my opinion and one of my favorite games. congratulations estudios larian, keep producing works of art like these and save the  gaming industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"exceeded every expectation. 1010 bg3 is the new benchmark for gaming and is quite easily the greatest rpg of all time. coming from someone who has been an rpg fanatic for most of my life, this game reaches new heights. incredible work from larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i have like 50 hours in the early access and 30 in the full released version, and is awesome, is really difficult and is a real challenge, im playing in hard tho but is more difficult than dos2 in harder difficulty, is a 10 for me because divinity original sin 2 was a 9 and this is all that is dos2 but better, more choises, more races, more skills, sooo much more options in combats, you literally end fights throwing you shoes at you adversary in desperation to win a fight, and this makes it very immersive and meaningful to play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"incrvel! o melhor rpg de turno que j joguei, um dos mundos mais vivos e lindos que j vi, espetacular"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"it good, but its not the what the hype train is trying to make it out to be. also nothing is a 1010 so everyone giving it 10 is an absolute tool. dont get me wrong its a good quality narrative driven game, but at times i must admit i get bored from all the scavenging and rummaging, and annoying conversations etc. bg 1, bg2 and icewind dale were all better in their day in my opinion. there is too much fluff in this game, although a lot of people lose their  over that. i mean u can kick a squirrel hahaha heheheh  will quickly get stale in repeated playthroughs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,best game ever. played divinity 2 and genuinely thought that was one of the best games i have ever played and this genuinely tops that.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,an excellent game with a world full of every kind of stories and adventures. when you think the game wont appeal the main stream gamers it had 800k real time online players on steam. the dialogs arent that long and are not hard to read. they are simple and clean. and the things you can do are countless. it was the best game ive played in last couple of years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"bg3 got interesting characters and deep, complex, diverse storytelling with uncountable real choices. also. larian has elevated the crpg genre to another level with its fully voiceacted cinematic presentation. there are bugs but the studio works hard to fix them and anyone who knows larian is sure they fix everything. i dare to claim that bg3 overall is the best crpg ever created so far."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i love this game. the graphics, voice acting and the animations are top notch. it made getting into this crpg very easy after learning some of the rules. i like divinity sin ii, this game is much easier to get into turn base combat. ive played many rpgs and this is my first crpg that i intend to complete. i am constantly amazed by the eta the world and story is shaped by your decisions. the world is very reactive dependent on your class and race. the sound and music is very impressive. makes me happy to get fully immersed. inventory management is supported by nice music that makes it not feel like a chore and instead helps i feel relaxed and inspired. i recommend that for your first gameplay you do not reload game saves. instead embrace the evolving storyline. a good choice may lead to bad outcomes and bad choices may lead to pleasant surprises. this game will have a lot of replay value. do not hesitate and buy this game and enjoy the journey."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"copy and paste of dd, the 3 or 4 text options are just glorified elder scrolls interactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,this game is literally finished on release and a perfect rpg. which is my favourite genre. i went from playing d4 to playing this. its like black and white
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"criticar este juego por tener un combate por turnos, es como criticar un shooter por que tienes que disparar. esa gente no debera poder dejar su critica aqu."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,this has to be one of the most amazing games i have ever played. i am pretty sure it is now my favorite game of all time. the amount of interactivity and creativity that this game allows is truly enormous. i believe that this has absolutely lifted the bar on what rpg's can be and if other video game developers dispute this or feel bad about it then they can just make better games and stop trying to nickel and dime the players.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"el mejor juego que he probado en mi vida en todos los sentidos mejor historia, mejor jugabilidad, mejor banda sonora, etc. simplemente perfecto. ojala se ganen el goty este ao porque se lo merecen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"best game since a long time, never get bored of it. the local coop is so much fun!! epic game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i wanted to like this game, having been a fan of the other 2 and understanding the genre. however, this game feels like playing in a tabletop dd game with that jerk of a dm who tries way too hard to kill you, and is way too much of a stickler for everything. oh, you didn't say you were walking through the fire? well that was the shortest path so now you're burning! it also has some really annoying bugs, and the ui leaves a lot to be desired, and honestly the animations are pretty bad too. also all the npcs are jerks for some reason. it just really isn't for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,best game of all time. never have i ever played a crpg before and usualy dont like turn based games but this game is something else.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,one of the best games i ever played. it gets better and better throught the playtime.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"el juego es un sueo, generoso en contenido, maravilloso para sesiones largas y cortas. me devuelve a aquel nio de 15 aos que se paso el baldurs 1,2 y expansion. jugar a este juego me hace feliz. un autntico 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,most in depth game i have ever played. i love crpg's and rpg's in general and this is a game clearly made by people who will also play the game. complete game on launch with nothing you have to buy to get the full experience was a huge plus. i would highly recommend this game even to people who have never played this genre before as the tutorial is very useful in learning the systems.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"do you know how good it is to not have to feel obligated or forced to play a video game? and just play a video game because you like it you want to see where the story goes? i usually have a battle pass on the go on one of my favorite games and i never realized until i bought bg3 how mentally debilitating it is. i never realized how much i hate bible passes and how much they try to steal my own time and force me to play their game. if your game is good enough, i won't have to buy a battle pass to be invested in it. baldur's gate 3 is the best, most expansive game i've played in my 26 years of life and 13 years of gaming. it has the most freedom of choice in every in any game that has ever been released in the history of gaming. the voice acting is absolutely incredible, the soundtrack is on par if not better than all of indiana jones, star wars and lord of the rings movies put together. it is honestly an honour to be able to play this game. yes, i will expect more out of video games coming in the future. i will not be preordering anything until i see the reviews, i will not be purchasing any battle passes as they are a scummy way to steal my time and force me to play your game. if your game relies on scummy practices such as selling skins and bundles to make money i have news for you, go make a better game. i don't understand how idiotic developers can be in this day and age to look at larian and scream at them, it's like doing terrible in a subject at school and then get angry at the smart kid for getting a 90 lmao. when i say you can make choices in this game, i don't mean that you can say yes or no and that will change the story in two different ways, you will have various conversations with a single character that will influence that character's outcome in the hours and hours and hours to come, not just one thing that will happen one time and be done with. if you're worried about replayability with this game, let me tell you that i have mostly played early access things and i'm still discovering new ways to handle different situations, i'm still discovering brand new areas that i've never even thought to go before, i've had new conversations and dialogue and cinematics on that i didn't even think existed because in my limited gamer's mind there's no way that a developer could add this many contingencies!!! i love baldur's gate 3 and i appreciate the respect larian has for me. aaa developers, if you're wondering how larian is going to make it more money i will tell you. instead of me purchasing 160 worth of skins in your game that are completely useless to everyone but me and also completely useless to me if the live service game shuts down i will properly utilize my money to buy two more copies of baldurs gate 3, give them to my friends and be able to play with them now. in a year? i'll probably buy it again for another friend that i'm sad hasn't played it. thank you for not making this a free to play a game, a game with a battle pass or a store larian. i appreciate you all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"what a home run! it is fun, colorful, crazy, and you can do almost anything you dream up. absolutely worth the money, this could be the best game of the year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"hands down this game is the best game made ever, in the history of gaming. there may be a game that is better but if it's better it must pay you to play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,the best crpg by far a little buggy and not being able to dismiss coop characters are huge oofs but don't tarnish the experience enough to make this game less deserving of it's well deserved praise edit the coop issue has now been fixed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"what a game! other devs take note!!!! no monetisation. game complete on launch something that doesn't happen nowerdays  just a great game made for gamers and yes we bloody love it!! this is the type of game, type of developer , who shame the big industry giants. they took a risk making it and poured heart and soul into a brilliant , multichoice rpg and its worked."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i played the ea since 2020 for about 80h, saw how they worked it with the community, potential was at this time already there but now, after 110 h and finished my first playthrough, i can say, i was and i am so addicted to this game! it gave me flashbacks to dragon age origins even i know baldurs gate 12, i was too young to understand enough i am a huge rpg crpgjrpg, penpaper dnd fan and writing is extreme important, and the writer did so well. i just wish we get a bit more after story but i think they will add, but it was so so great the writer did fool me, gale left me with a broken heart, greedy wizard! everything in this game, world, people, mechanics is so great, almost perfect hello lil bugs the battles even at story mode are not easy, in general its not easy, but its so satisfying, bcs all the time i though omg yes! i did it, omg i am so great! and next battle i die bcs i didnt act stratetic enough haha the music and the voice acting is absolute 1st class, its perfect, absolute overall, its for me a masterpiece, a game i missed in the last 10 years, i was always a larian fan, but baldurs gate is now one of my most fav games ever together with dragon age origins, final fantasy x and even if tempest one note to the end as an otome player, i enjoyed the romance and friendship with my companions, it was deep written, absolute perfect larian, everyone, thank you so much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"the best of the best his may be my favorite game of all time. so much story, beautiful graphics. if you're a fan of hardcore, narrativedriven rpgs like what bioware used to create once upon a time, then you can't ask for anything more than baldur's gate iii"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"a cure for modern gaming fatigue. i'm certain that i'm not alone in this. modern gaming with its repetitive mechanics, lack of innovation and hyper monetization weighs heavily on gamers, myself included.. to the extent where i find myself avoiding game sessions entirely. although i would never usually touch a turn based game like baldur's gate 3. i'm more of a realtime, run  gun  hack  slash game kind of person.. my girlfriend and i gave bg3 a shot over the weekend to see what the hype was about. and man... we are properly hooked. what sold me was how dense and detailed the world feels, where finding a random hidden cave or npc can lead to fun and engaging questlines that can easily be missed if you run past them. what would usually amount to throwaway dialogue choices in most games now affect branching quests and shape the adventure in big ways, so i imagine multiple playthroughs would feel utterly unique once you leave the initial areas. the situations our characters often found themselves in allows the game to feel dynamic. companions are also well executed and varied. it didn't take long for us to fill our camp with a small village worth of them, and we would often struggle to choose which companions to take along with us as they all offer unique and interesting personalities and perks. the game is also proper fun over lan, something which is sorely missed in modern titles these days. i can see why this game is snatching 1010's. i cannot recommend this experience highly enough to those who feel that gaming has become a bit stale lately."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"it's my first crpg game and the best game of my life. if you play it yourself, it will be more than anything you imagine. it's a game that makes me wonder if i've lived to play baldur's gate, and i think goty will definitely get it this year, and i think it will be remembered as a game that will go down in history. this game has made me a huge fan of larian, and i think i will trust and buy larian games in the future."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,simply the best game released since skyrim. larian made divinity original sin 1  2 and were excellent as well but bg3 blows everything out of the water.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,larian continues to one up themselves with a crpg so meticulously crafted its literally scaring triple a developers because now they might have to put in more effort to keep up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"one of the best rpgs ever existed. one of the best games ever existed. on top of that, no agenda, no microtransactions, no loot boxes, no battle passed. just a pure game. maybe it relates to the ceo who is actually playing his own game and sincerely loves what he is doing. do not tell eablizzard, let them die already"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,an immediate lifetime top 5 game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"no  censorship, you can play the whole thing naked. but that doesnt make the point n click rng gameplay and camera any less goddamn awful, doesnt make the story any less shallow or the short game any longer, this is the call of duty of crpgs with a 4 hours long main campaign if it wasnt padded with the braindead combat. the npcs spamming 1010 reviews wont even acknowledge that the game is full of bugs that break quests"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,perfeio em jogo. incrvel como um jogo consegue permitir uma imerso nesse nivel
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"acts 12 are great and well delivered. act 3 is where it all starts falling apart, it clearly shows that the game was rushed out to be released without being fully finished and tested out. cut content that was promoted few months before launch, often occurring bugs, messy story and quest pacing in the later parts of the game, lackluster and seemingly unfinished endings that are short and abrupt. all of those issues in last act of the game sours amazing start and middle part of the game. for a studio that was touted as developers releasing finished and full games unlike those others developers, they sadly did just the same thing as those other devs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"this game is amazing a treat for the real rpg enthusiasts!!! long campaign many endings and the freedom to play how you like!!! awome game having so much fun,cant wait for this on the ps5!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"after 200 hours playing the game, i'm still having a lot of fun and trying out different comps and specs. the only thing i would still like to see is va for player's avatar in dialogues i think it makes the exchanges even more immersive and more characteristic va for halforcs, dwarfs, dragonborn etc. i.e. races that diverge a lot from the standard human form."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"to the devolpers complaining, i dont expect spiderman devolpers to produce a once in a lifetime master piece of an rpg. i dont think anyone does, you started a stupid arguement that devalues effort in favor of corporate greed and laziness please stop making games or go on a strike or sum"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"amazing game, it has a pretty good story with a good combat system that allows your creativity to flow. to put an example you can just push enemies from cliffs while you distract them somehow, it also has that dnd feeling that you can do almost everything you want."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i've played the last two larian studios games tactical games, and it's just so refreshing see how well they upgraded and changed their formula for this new game. i was so sure that zelda tears of the kingdom would steal game of the year, until i played this, the 2023 gaming industry has shocked me again with another homerun success. the voice acting, story, cinematics, gameplay, and the control to the player, are by far the best i've seen in a game. it's been so entertaining watching the bitter dragon age developers cry and moan about baldur's gate 3 on twitter, knowing that they will never reach the heights of bg3, and that the past 15 years of their development, turning a turnbased rpg into an uninspired action rpg was all for waste. the people have spoken the second age of turn based tactical rpgs is here, and it is baldur's gate 3!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"this is the first time i'm rating a game, the game is just awesome! thank you larian studios! you can notice in every corner that there is a lot of love in the game! in my eyes, this art is not only the title game of the year but the best game of all time!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"combat is incredibly slow, even the smallest skirmishes drag on forever. the dialogue is fan fiction levels of awful. the companions are either annoying or not in any way interesting. to top it off, the entire game is extremely sordid and full of degenerated nonsense. it is very sad to see what larian has done with the baldur's gate ip. never again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,it is the perfect dnd game we all have been wanting it story is amazing the characters is amazing and the combat is just what i imagine dnd will look like and feel like.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"its an amazing game with an amazing story, one of the best game play in and rpg game, or game at all. must play"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"best rpg game i ever played in my life. this is a real 1010. larian and from software, best studios"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"best game i have ever played! a true rpg, you can spend hours and hours in it and only scratch the surface of what you can do. even more impressively you can come back with a different character and do it all again and you will fell as if you are playing a different game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,over 40hrs inn and i love it! all the choices and posebilities you have gives this alot of replayability
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i finished the act1 on early access a few years back. with the full release i knew, what i should expect. since the release i am playing the game at my own pace. i am not close to completing the act1 but i already spent around 50hours with my new char. there are too many things to do and almost non of them are boring except inventory management. i know that i wont be able to complete the game since it requires too much time for me but it is not a problem, because i feel like i got more than i paid for already."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,so happy this game got the attention it deserves. i have never played a crpg before and thanks to the attention i tried it and i'm enjoying every second of it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"a great game, and the best rpg i have ever played. an absolute masterpiece that i highly advice to anyone who likes dd or any rpgs in general."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"tengo 47 aos, y llevo jugando a videojuegos desde mi primer ordenador msx all por 1988... he jugado a baldurs gate i y ii y muy a mi pesar tras las dudas generadas por las cia cuando presentan su productos, he sido reacio a comprar el juego... pero tras 2 semanas de ver gameplay, leer opiniones y escuchar a la comunidad, este sbado a las 1700 compr el juego. refleja los juegos de rol al 100 de dd, han conseguido imbuime en la historia solo con las primeras escenas del videojuego en mi poca ramos jugadores solitarios y este lo vuelve a ser, aunque hay opciones de jugar con los amigos, en ese sentido lo agradezco, quiero vivir la experiencia de juego sin tener que estar en un clan o hermandad, y que me rusheen el contenido para equipar me. tengo un ordenador normalito con una tarjeta grfica antigua una rx580 y un ryzen 5600x, y va de maravilla, no se necesitan un megaordenador, hasta en eso han acertado. videojuego al ms estilo old school, lo voy a disfrutar mucho, muchas veces y poco a poco ayer mismo dej el juego en mitad de un combate y se que cuando vuelva estar en ese mismo instante para continuar, un detalle muy a tener en cuenta, porque todos sabemos que cua do menos te lo esperas,te requieren para algo en casa y en muchos videojuegos es imposible dejarlo al instante y en este se puede. mi valoracin actual es de 100 puntos, no puede ser menos. muy buen videojuego, vale cada cntimo que pagas por el."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"its about story being written masterfully and it reacting to the world and everything just makes themselfs feel even better that i can give this game a 1010 and the combat is  amazing the fact you can shove enyone you want even out of combat, the fact that you can play this 4 man coop is  amazing. this game is nuts bro."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"baldurs gate 3 is nothing less than an absolute masterpiece. the possibilities are almost endless, and the gameplay feels awesome, just like everything else in this perfect game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,honestly there is too much good to sum up in a review. i can finally put down dos 2 for a few years. definitely the best rpg to release post 2017. funny how them not chasing players' money leads to them destroying sales expectations. no gamer would have ever saw that coming.....
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"greatest crpg of all time, the customization and immense amount of choices alone make this a masterpiece. combine that with the fun gameplay, interesting story, and compelling characters? 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"just adding my 'review' to the chorus of praise to help the percentage. best rpg since dragon age origins. this is the game bioware would be making today if they didn't sell their souls to ea. thank selne we have larian, they are the moonlantern warding us from the shadowcursed lands of the aaa gaming industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,best game of the year . one of the best games in history. larian took care of every detail and delivered a masterpiece
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"the game is so incredibly good that when it falls short it's felt even more. as i finished the game, i found myself wishing that certain aspects had been more thought out, though i really enjoyed most of my 160 hours. despite any of its flaws, i could not praise enough how good and unique of a experience larian offers here, anyone who likes versatile and strategic rpgs with great roleplaying and actionconsequences mechanics should play it. really, there's no other game that grants such an extensive range of rpg expression and is as enjoyable as this one. it's so full and rich with possibility and personality that it made me want even more and expect so much of everything. unfortunately, this also left me many times disappointed. some actions leave you hoping for consequences that never come. several mechanics lack depth and meaningful outcomes. romance is shallow. some important characters have weak dialogue and narratives. some fights are poorly designed, many times with a hoard of boring enemies that just crowd the rounds, making it feel unnecessarily slow and uncreative. the difficulty is also so inconsistent, mostly tending to easy, even though i was playing on tactician. and i get it, managing a game of this magnitude must be very hard, but it doesn't stop me from feeling it could have been better. most of the issues that i'm talking about begin in the thirdlast act of the game. it feels rushed, meaningful details you got in the previous acts get rarer. bugs and performance issues in this act don't help either. between some fantastic quests, there are a bunch of boring and outright bad ones and unsatisfying resolutions. my character seemed neglected in the final events, with choices becoming inexplicably limited and their consequences underwhelming. the end of the game left me thinking how it could be better, instead of reminding me of the great things i had experienced and honoring all the fantastic things the game has to offer. it  to not be rewarded more after so many hours of great content, but i really loved most of the game. the downsides mostly come from my own high expectations, fueled by the game's overwhelming positives. overall, solid game, will play again many times."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i can't think of a more complete game that enthralls you like this one does. i've never like turn based games but this is a masterpiece. easy 1010 for me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"the best game i've tried in my entire life, it's been a long time since i felt a difference when playing video games. the experience and immersion is absolutely wonderful. i came here looking for gold and i found a diamond. thank you, larian studios, for bringing out this little gem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this is going to be quick because i need to get back to playing baldurs gate 3, 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i bought this game to support fellow gamers and developers, even though it wasn't my usual type. after just a few hours, i was hooked. i even left a game i'd played for over a year. now, it's my new gaming benchmark alongside mhwib, rdr2, botw, and ffxiv. what a find  this game has truly raised the bar for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"90 hours as per savegame. just about to get into the second part of the game. ill keep it simple. just because a game is getting a 1010 score and so many people are praising it doesnt mean its a game for you. if you dont like dnd mechanics in video game format, turn based combat and heavy story driven, decision based gameplay. this game is not for you. if you want combat and action at every corner, or a game that clearly guides you in a perfectly linear path, there are better games than this. now if you really love fantasy and specially dnd. if you played or are curious about tabletop dnd, if you are a fan of tv shows, movies and books in a fantasy setting with great lore, really deep and quality storytelling. if you love game mechanics driven by your actions. where you can use your imagination to surpass obstacles. if you love tactical combat and having fun both discovering and exploiting new ways to progress, well this game is for you. specifically story is the superpower of this game. it gets you hooked because it keeps you guessing. there is a mystery at every corner and its not easy to know who are the good and the bad guys. there are many layers and you will only get the full picture if you take your time to explore. finding that letter that gives you a clue. stumbling upon a secret and such. really thinking about what you say. some will compare bg3 to divinity original sin. some will claim bg3 is not a real successor to bg2. it comes down to the ruleset. bg3 uses dnd 5e ruleset, dnd lore and environments. divinity uses a ruleset larian created for that game. the pathfinder video games use an adapted pathfinder ruleset. but all of these games share common traits. for instance you can speak with animals in divinity. and you can do the same in dnd as well. the fact is the divinity games and the rpg engine larian built was inspired by tabletop dnd. so its not that bg3 is like divinity. its that divinity shares a lot of common logic with tabletop. same goes with solasta. just to show how close bg3 is to tabletop dnd, the actual maps in bg3 use a standard dnd tabletop grid with each square covering about 5 feet if not mistaken. in game if you check the map you can actually see the dnd 5e map grid. when in combat characters walking distance follows the dnd 5e rules. so if anything bg3 is one of the closest adaptations of dnd to video game format along side games like solasta. you dont need to know the story of previous games but if you do, bg3 ties with events of previous games and the tabletop campaigns. between baldurs gate 2 and 3 there was the descent into avernus tabletop campaign. some characters in bg3 participated in these previous campaign events. so yes, bg3 is a dnd game, a real sequel to the previous games obviously with the advantages modern technology provides. and right now, the best dnd based crpg and a contender for game of the year. a game that is shaping the gaming industry because it evolves the formula used to build these type of games. one where players have literally thousands of ways to approach and play how they want."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"very good game, im so addicted to it, i never played a game like this before"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"picked this up when it first launched in ea,and right from the beginning, it showed a huge amount of promise, which they have fully delivered on. i love isometric crpgs, and this is that but with a cinematic story more akin to something like mass effect or dragon age inquisition. forgotten realms is one of my favorite fantasy settings alongside krynn and the world from the wheel of time series, and this embodies the flavor of the faern setting perfectly. there is a huge amount of customization 46 subclasses, not to mention the ability to multiclass. the story and art are incredible, and i can't praise larian enough for what is clearly a passion project that is a love letter to fans of the genre. despite what many large studios in the industry may want to believe, this does set a new standard and shows that large studios can not only meet but exceed our expectations. in a time when many releases are pushed out long before they are ready or suffer incredible launch failures, this stands out as a notable exception to what has frequently become the norm. i'll be picking up a copy for playstation as well, both to do a multiplayer run with a friend, and because it supports crosssaves, so i can play from my bed on days when my back is acting up. and honestly, it's worth much more than the 60 i paid when it launched in early access."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,absolute masterpiece since i devote hundreds of hours into this fantasy world. great job larian studio!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,it is not perfect but it is a video game should be like the final purpose of game is bringing happy to people
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is practically one of a kind these days. we have gained so much in the last couple of decades of gaming, so much in technical achievements, but games seem to have lost their souls in the process, well not this game, this game may not be the most technically impressive of latest years, although it's no slouch either, but it delivers so much more, not just by modern gaming standards, but by the standards that made so many of us fall in love with gaming in the first place, the kind of standards that birthed your favourite games from decades past. if this game's soul manages to infect at least one more developerpublisher to be better, it will have already done more for gaming that every single executive and share holder in the industry in the last 12 years, and that both invigorates as much as it saddens."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is massive, and i'm in for the long run. the questing, characters, world, rng, encounters, graphics, sound design... it's all great! i've run into a few bugs and issues, unfortunately dragging down the score a point, but in almost 80 hours of play i can comfortably say this might be my favorite rpg of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"amazing game! a fantastic addition to the classic rpgs collection. great story, great mechanics, high replayability  you have it all here. moddable too, so you can enjoy the community's creativity as well. a true masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game recaptures the magic i had when playing biowares dragon age origins in terms of scale, repalayability and players choice. no parts of it felt like a filler, it was well written and voice acted and the game feels like a once a decade game, similar to how i feel about other rpgs like tyranny and disco elysium. larian is now the standards bearer for the entire crpg genre and a landmark moment for all of us."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i'm in my fourties now and i had my fair share of rpgs in my time. no really i do have the time and the resources to play games pretty much as much as i want to. i've been there during ultima 18, eye of the beholder, wizardry, fallout, daggerfall, baldurs gate 12, morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, wasteland series, icewind dale, planescape and of course dragon age, mass effect, jade empire, solasta, expeditions series, pillars and  that i think about it, i guess i really played them all. seriously that's a lot of games. however, disregarding my life choices, bg3 is exactly what i wanted from the successor of one of my favorite games. is it perfect? no, nothing is. is it one if the best rpgs ever? yes. yes it is. to this day i know what i did in daggerfall. i remember what i did in dragon age and i get goosebumps listening to the mass effect ost. and i'm looking forward to remember my time in bg3 in the same way. only thing bothering me is the fact that i can't get the bg1 soundtrack out of my had and larian actually didn't use any part of that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i never played any games like this before. i'm blown away, has to be one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"who would have thought that making an enjoyable nonscummy predatory halffinished cash grab would be a good idea huh. i'm not saying that this should be standard in term of scope, grandeur and polish. it should however be a standard for what a game should feel like at launch. a finished product, not designed to milk your wallet, not designed to further some agenda, please shareholders or meet enforced deadlines. when the studio cares for their players' experience, it shows. that is the standard we want this game to set, and not what other developers whine about. its not about scope, length. its about decency, care and respect towards your customers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"game is full of bugs and irritating mechanics, creators of ui didn't deliver mostly. this game is very annoying."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,pure freedom to make whatever choices you want and your choices actually affect the story. your free to kill main charachter allies whenever you want and just continue through the game if you want.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,made an account just for this. i dont think ill be able to enjoy another rpg after this. just so damn good.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i've already spent about 70 hours in this game and after finishing the first playthrough, i'm thrilled with how awesome it is. of course i was hyped before the release and was waiting to finally check it out. and i'm so mega glad that larian put all their heart into this title and it really shows. the dialogues, the stories, the character designs and their plots, the voice acting, the immersive world and beautiful graphics, and the real flexibility of the gameplay  these are, in my opinion, the most visible pluses of this game. well, and from me, i'll also say that the biggest blink of an eye was that you can play an evil character, in the sense of, for real, an evil villain. you don't come across that too often in games, so i respect that xd. i honestly think this game will live on for a long time, looking at the growing modder scene and the opening of the game to modifications. i would like to thank larian for this game, because we probably won't soon meet another studio that creates aaa rpgs with such passion and detail."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,easily one of the best and most wellcrafted rpgs of all time. it's clear larian really cares about the game and the community. chef's kiss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"cara. que jogo perfeito. de verdade, eu t jogando direto, at esse momento  o melhor jogo do ano, e vai ganhar o goty se starfield no estiver a altura, a larian lanou a masterpiece do ano. meus parabns larian studios, que jogo do caralho."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"todas as horas livres que eu tenho por dia aproximadamente 5 so destinadas a jogar esse jogo. literalmente o que todo jogo aaa deveria ser, completo, divertido, jogvel, tecnicamente com poucos problemas e em um preo justo. tem alguns bugzinhos, mas  quase surreal pensar que esse  um jogo lanado h tipo, duas semanas. hoje em dia, todos os lanamentos pra pc vem cagados e cheios de problemas srios, mas bg3 tem s bugzinhos at onde eu vi. no caiam no papinho de grandes empresas, esse  o padro de jogo que o consumidor merece jogvel no lanamento, cheio de contedo, sem micro transaes, sem dmr, sem prticas abusivas etc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"somehow larian studios made what i thought was imposible, make a game better than divinity 2, i can't think of a better praise for this or any other game, this is a must play and replay"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"a game from players for players. while going through the game, i felt that i was playing something that was created with passion, love and attention to detail. breathtaking. phenomenal. i bought together with 4 friends even though 1 of us always buys the game and we share through family sharing on steam. 100 deserved."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,this game is the pinnacle of crpg and rpg so much thing that can modify the game... so many maner to end a fight or start it... everythig is very good. for those aaa publisher with f'n store.... take it in the nose your game  as hell you all should take leons of what is a gamers need.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,there has been no game that feels like this for a really long time. the last time i felt this joy was in skyrim. this is the first game that i feel like a kid coming home from school to play a game. normally i hate turnbased games but this game does it right and keeps you in. you can do almost anything in this game. and roleplay really. best game i have played. thanks for making me feel like a kid again larian studios.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"el mejor juego de 2023, a vuelto a dar vida al genero, no tiene sentido lo que ha echo larian, es una pasada en todos los aspectos. goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"jogo bo, comprem, vale muito a pena. jogo imersivo, mas  pra quem gosta de histria"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"after discovering larian's work on dos 2 and played this beauty for tons of hours. what a pleasure to discover bg3 !!! i played the early access for hours and now im finally enjoying the whole game, did 110h just on the act1 thank you larian you legends"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,absolutely fabulous game. that's how it's done. smashing aaa studios to the ground.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"just going to say i hate battle pass and microtransactions. i loved games like gothic, witcher, elder scrolls morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, etc"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i've been hoping for something like elders scrolls after being disappointed in the online game. this game should make aaa producers shame into actually making games people love and can play. anyone for an attempt at diablo 4 or cyberpunk 2077 that needed a year to become a shadow of the game promised. makes me sick. i have refused to pay 6070 usd for a game that needs so much work everyone waits for the 1.1 release to play it. bg3 is the first game since elder's scrolls that i paid full price. and at a better price, no stupid  of users and this should be the state of the art for all aaa games. not just rpg. why should a aaa studio expect users to accept their crappy code, their  with microtransactions and other  why can't they put out a polished game? because instead of games people love the publisher just wants money flowing in like a cut jugular. and so impressive that larian did not receive backing and put the company at risk putting this out. companies controlled by publishers put out what they are forced to put out. shame the publishers!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,larian have outdone themselves. haven't felt this way playing a new game in a long time. thank you larian for your hard work and passion. it really shows.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i am not one for turn based games, they tend to be my least enjoyed style of game and i usually avoid them. however i knew of the game for a couple years and waited till it came out to play it and to form my opinion on it, and i find it absolutely amazing. this game along with elden ring are the only games that i find more than worth the time to play and money to spend on. i have 117 hours and i have only barely scratched the surface of the 3rd act so far. i find the story to be very good, i also really enjoy the characters and companions of the game as i find them to act more like actual people than bots willing to do whatever you want on a whim. the combat is probably the only thing i can see being an issue for people, i know turn based combat isn't for everyone, and some of the reviews on here show that, but i was of a similar mind before playing this game thinking i would never enjoy a game with turn based combat. then i played the game and it completely changed my mind. i obviously wouldn't recommend this game to someone who absolutely hates turn based games no matter how good every other aspect of the game is, but having been on the side of not enjoying turn based games that much to at least absolutely loving this game i can say with some confidence that i would recommend it to someone that might be on the fence about it, especially if multiplayer is involved, i personally haven't tried it with a few of my friends yet but from what i've heard and the few videos i've seen it looks phenomenal. overall i cant emphasize how much i would recommend this game. it is simply just the torch in the dark of all the ok to subpar games that have come out over the past few years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i am mostly giving my review based on the game soundtrack, but nonetheless i have seen multiple videos and multiple moments where this game delivers something truly special. an occasion for the player to get lost in this world. the soundtrack is absolutely mind blowing. the gentle tones and the ones that makes your blood boil, making you immersed in every single moment of peace, joy, battle and sorrow."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"a once in a decade game, a masterpiece at what it is. definitely the game of the year for 2023 looking forward to the next larian game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is the new platinum standard for all rpg's going forward, not to mention the entire video gaming industry. not much to say except buy and play this game now!!!  no microtransactions  no lootboxes  greatest character creator of all time!  insane character development and story.  extremely addictive gameplay, infectious level designs.  photorealistic and next generation graphics powerhouse.  spellbinding music. picturesque environments.  endless replayability.  better than dungeons and dragons.  equal to elden ring, potentially superior to elden ring in many ways.  did i mention no live service, but has more content than any live service game ever will? an easy masterpiece, larian studios deserves all the praise and money that exists because baldur's gate 3 is the new standard for every next generation pc and console game released going forward. the only game developers who hate this, are those who cannot dupe unsuspecting gamers with greed and garbage practices anymore like the fallen blizzard. please larian, never change your philosophy, we need developers like you, fromsoftware, santa monica studios and id software now more than ever!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i never played a turn based rpg, but it was very complicated to understand what to do in certain situation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is a masterpiece of a era where good rpg are not very common. single player campaign, very long with endless possibilities and a quality that will blow your mind. now, game is not perfect. sometimes it gest too modern you know where i mean but it s never in our face or a constant. act iii is not of the same super quality tan act i and ii. i enjoyed it but i can see some of the complaints being valid. the reason i m giving this game a 9 and not a 10 is for the weak companions relationship. i was expecting something like mass effect but it s very shallow and sometimes personal moments feels very cheap. other than that is one of the best videogames i played in years. it will take you back to one time where games where fun and they were complete at launch. the production of this game is amazing. the music, the actors and the writing is superb. please you give it a try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,this game is literally divinity original sin 3 with 5th dnd edition of rule set. unbelievable boring game mechanics. unbelievable confusing ui. unbelievable soulless graphics. this game is not able to bring the world of forgotten realms at all to it's players.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"realy good game ....and i'm not even fan of turn based games ...it just...finally someone realised a really good game without loots of bugs and toon of dlc,microtransactionsi mean ther is games like that but they are minority and studios that dont get greedy even less and bcz of that i give full price for this game not to ubisoft not to bugtesda that is lazy to fix bugs so modders must fix for them,not to greedy and they listen players that is even more  you know what i will give 10 just bcz thous haters on yt ...f you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,a true masterpiece. if bg3 doesn't win goty 2023 this industry is corrupted.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this is what games in 2023 should be, game of the year if not decade! loved it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i played divinity 2, and expected big things from this game, but i have been blown away by the quality of baldur's gate 3, its so much fun and you lose so much time to it without realising it. the depth of the story and scope of the decision making and potential outcomes is stunning. just an amazing game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"it is a fantastic successor to the originals, respects the lore, and improves on gameplay in every way, goty contender, if you like rpgs buy and support larian studios you won't regret it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,the game i've been waiting since i was a kid and played dd for the first time. hope to see more things like this come out in the future. thanks larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i have been playing this every chance i have. all the options you can take and ways you can progress makes it feel like a real dnd campaign. slowly becoming my new favorite game!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"no amount of good core concepts and followthrough can fix what is a fundamentally broken game. bg3 is chockfull of bugs of all sorts that make the game quite literally unplayable, and they only get progressively worse as your save file bloats and time goes on. by the time i reached act 3, i could no longer progress the main story no matter how many times i reloaded or reinstalled. madder still, they've been in early access getting free testing for how long yet still could not improve the state of it. i have not played such a buggy game at launch since arkham city, it is miserable. i suspect all the people reviewing positively are not actually far into the game, only seeing the turoial and early areas which have the most polish yet are still pretty janky. either that or people are simply lying to themselves about how functional it is. no game should allow you to fall through the world and hardlock you from progressing at launch, i don't care how rocky development was. bg3 is fundamentally broken and i can't in good conscience rate it higher unless they fix it. it is truly sad, as the core gameplay and story are genuinely great."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"a mustplay. a studio with a true heart to its players, so rare to see in the year 2023. ironically, we saw a masterpiece rising at the same time as the former reign of blizzx. collapsed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"the best rpg i've personally played in a very long time. i haven't been this engrossed and enamored since maybe ff7. this absolutely needs to set a precedent of what games need and should be. 100 complete, offline, nondrm. no paywalls or day one paid content. the game's character, heart, content and open ended non player hating design is so far ahead of all the other game companies that they aren't even in the same ballpark anymore. do yourself a favor and play it, take your time with it and enjoy everything larian has created for us. they made it without malice or intent to take advantage of their gamers. what a concept, game makers making good games for players to enjoy and have fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game has so much opportunity, features, customization, etc that its absurd. many games try to be deceptive and act like there's a lot of choices or ways to change the story through your own actions when in reality most dialogue options mean  all. this game actually delivers on that and so much more. because of this game i've been able to get friends to get it and even be willing to actually get into dnd and do a campaign together. this might actually be one of the games of this gen and for sure larian deserves to get goty for bg3. also unlike other goty contenders like hogwarts legacy, totk, or diablo 4 its easy to put support behind because larian doesn't have a history basked in all sorts of isms, doesn't copyright strike random people over osts or less, and they refuse to add microtransactions to their game. this is one of the few times where people are actually delivering what gamers want without any catch and i'm just grateful to larian for that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,an amazing game. loved playing every minute.i think the girlfriend is ready to leave me at this point because how hardcore ive been in it over the last few weeks. 140 hours down and ill drop another 400 easy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"best game i have played in a while, i hope to see more games like this from larian. maybe they could make a warhammer 40k crpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this is just plain perfect. the story, the characters, the combat. the  everything you could ask for on a rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"absolutely legendary, the depth of choices and massive amount of content is mind blowing. it is crazy how low the ration of bugs to content is and how fast they reacted on fixing most of them. the game is best enjoyed slowly and methodically to let the exceptional character depth see in and taking your time to think and experiment with how the world and story reacts to you instead of the standard roller coaster type games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,120 hours in and im having an incredible time with this game. its everything i want in a game especially not having to pay more money to play a game i already paid for!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,a light at the tunnel for the entire gaming industry. we finally got a complete game at a good price.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"theres is one reason almost aline to crown this this gamefeature complete. a term i have not heard in a long time. this games offers everything, and delivers what it says. i have not felt this much joy in gaming since the last 1015 years"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"the game is dense and rich. art direction is generally very good. the only downside is lacking enough time to play. easily one of the contenders for goty. don't believe the review bombing. mixed feelings might be valid as not all people like this type of gameplay, but 0? come on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"best game i have played in a decade, easy. i have never been so excited for dice rolls before. thank you for a wonderful game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,amazing story! play baldur's gate 3 and watch dugeon's and dragons film!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"best game i have ever played. for the first time, it feels like i can really be who i want to be. the characters and the writings are awesome, and the graphics and gameplay are just as good. perfect game and easily my game of the year and favorite game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,the best game of all time this should be the standard game devs push for absolutely stunning masterpiece cant put the game down cant believe something of this quality came out in 2023 with all these other lazy devs like bungie
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,early access done right. as a dnd fan i am soo happy to be back in this world figuring out puzzles and having intense combat scenarios. bg3 is deserving of game of the decade award. glad other game devs are outraged by the success of bg3. it highlights the corrupt money making mindset of the copy paste games we have as of late
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i hope this becomes game of the year, it's been such a joy seeing baldur's gate 3 being celebrated and prospering as much as it is!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,this game it's the most close of a perfect rpg experience on digital. the history is amazing and human! just grateful for played.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"simply the best game of my life, without exaggeration, there are so many things to say about this game that i simply won't even try it here, it's just that they sold me the idea that it would be the game that would fulfill all my dreams in life and they gave me much more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,wanted to leave a review but im too lazy to actually explain my thoughts so here
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,it truly deserves to be in the race for goty this year. this is the most fun i've had the whole year with a game so far.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i've never reviewed a game prior to today. bg3 is one of the best games i've touched in the last 5 years, and it's refreshing to not feel the need to reach for my wallet for a battle pass or new characters that are being released. the story is rich and full of detail and the world feels full and interactive, with engaging turn based combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,genuinely one of the best games i have ever played. blown me away in every aspect. super replayable and a vast amount of content you could play this game for a very very long time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,baldur's gate 3 is a good example of game developers who prioritize the art of creating an immersive gaming experience over purely chasing profits. although i experienced some smaller bugs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"want an angsty, goth cleric girlfriend no problem. have vampire fantasies no problem. fancy yourself james t. kirk and want to get down with an alien lady sure. want murderhobo ok wonderful. the only thing i'll be sad about is if larian goes back to their divinity series. seems a shame about this engine and system, which is a whole lot better no excessive ground spam."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i usually enjoy my games quietly and very rarely leave reviews, however baldur's gate has earned the praise that it is being given. there hasn't been a game in recent years that has captured my attention quite like this. i'm a novice in the dnd world, but in my opinion it is nothing short of amazing and the voice acting is actually believable and engaging????"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"a dream come true, waiting for official mod support to make it the best game ever made"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is what as a child we thought gaming would become. it carries a standard that has almost been lost to time. you actually can play through the game with out feeling like you need to shell out more money for fomo. no missing quests because of exclusive deals. i am so tired of developers and studios being chopped up due to share holders. with all that said the game is actually good. it is packed full of quests and secrets and decisions. the game does not hold your hand. the game is a world full of impactful decisions. you want to be a paladin who stands for good and wants to squash all evil go for it, you better not make decisions that stray from that path. it actually makes you roleplay. it consumes you and makes you stay up late miss sleep and want more. 400 people made baldur's gate in less time than triple aaa titles. it released in a better state, and no microtransactions with less bugs. compare this to a game that has a storied series on the 4th iteration with 9000 workers and 10 years in development."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i don't understand what all the fuss is about... too many technical problems. it remained in early access for 3 years, it should not have come out with such a bad optimization. these are not things i can accept. this is the main reason for my negative opinion about the game. but there are a lot of things i don't like about gameplay and story, these are personal opinions. someone else may like what i don't like. i can respect that, however it doesn't change the fact that this game is one of the most overrated games of recent years. it's a game that is currently being guarded and constantly exaggerated by fan bases and gaming media. this will probably be over in a few months, but you cannot easily express your negative thoughts about this game on any platform because there are people waiting to lynch you. in short bg3 didn't offer me anything special that i hadn't seen before in any game of the same genre. i played 50 hours and it was an extremely ordinary experience. the story and characters were all forgettable and boring. gameplay is much worse than divinity original sin 2. character creation screen was very poor. the effects of the choices made were also not noticeable. also, the soundtrack is very bad. it's almost nonexistent. it's too bad there's not a single catchy soundtrack. going and exploring somewhere on the map is a complete waste of time. a good weapon or armor never comes out. there is a serious item variety problem in the game. all of the classes are extremely bad and useless. development of your character in the game is very inadequate and not felt compared to divinity original sin 2. there is no balance in difficulty levels. even without technical problems, it still wouldn't have been a game of the year candidate for me. i was actually thinking of giving the game 0 score, but since larian supports the game in my native language, i decided to give it 5 score. despite the bad experience the game gave me, this is still a very high rating. i wish larian had continued the divinity series. this isn't even a baldur's gate game anyway. even if they fix the optimization in the coming months, it is no longer possible for them to fix the gameplay and story side. i had high expectations for the game and i'm a big fan of the divinity series, but the end result is a big disappointment. it should have been divinity original sin 3 instead of baldur's gate 3 and then i'm sure they could have made a much more successful game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"finalmente posso jogar dd sem precisar de amigos. obrigado larian! 200 reais, sem microtransaes, sem season pass, possivelmente melhor jogo do ano. nem parece que estamos em 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,when i start playing baldurs gate i was immediately hooked. the story and the world is so exciting. you want to explore everything and every npc you meet has an interesting story to tell. for me it had the same feeling as the witcher 3 in scope of the world and characters you meet. and that was an action based game. i tried playing turn based games before but i never had the patience for this type of games. but for baldurs gate 3 the combat is exciting and when a fight is over i have this feeling of accomplishment. i am happy i did try playing this game. also the replayability is the best. no future game will be the same with all the different classes and dialogue options you can choose from. for me this will be a game that i can play in many years to come and never be bored of it! therefore 1010!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"it's the first time i've played something like this and turnbased games have never caught my attention, however i'm in love with this game, it has become my favorite video game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,it's all we dreamt of 25 years ago. this is a well thought and executed game. nothing tops this from the rpg library of games in my opinion.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,that's how games should be done ! bravo for larian studio ! masterpiece ! games got me out of life for a lot of days !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"overrated. despite the game boasting extensive content, numerous dialogues come across as incongruous. for instance, opting to remain idle prompts an npc to express gratitude for assistance... furthermore, the game is plagued by numerous bugs, particularly vexing graphical anomalies such as sudden texture popins and murky shadows. the combat mechanics also lack strategic depth. while a few intriguing elements exist, the majority of it is rather uninspiring."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,astonishing game play!! i can play my own and it consumes my time. it could be the best game in this year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"that's awesome game. and that's my first review on metacritic, special for baldur's gate 3. my little advice for newbies do what you want to do, don't lock at consequences, best's choices, on guides how to find a legendary sword on 1lvl and etc. that's your adventure, be pleasure with it. i hope other rpgcrpg developers will be take an example from larian. sorry if my english bad. i'm not native speaker."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is such a masterpiece. its actually a game and not a way to scam as much money out of people as possible. it takes hundreds of hours to complete and that's not because there are millions of collectibles, but through sheer enjoyable content. and still they don't price the game at the ridiculous price point of 69.99 that a lot games have done recently."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"es el mejor juego de rol de la historia. despus de jugar mi primera run en este juego, puedo decir que me he enamorado de este tipo de juegos al que hace aos que no jugaba. desde el dragn age origins no he tenido algo tan divertido y a la vez con tanto contenido. y decir sobre todo que este juego es insuperable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i am a proud larian simp. ever since i first laid on hands on the masterpiece that was divinity original sin 2 i knew that the rpgs larian makes are filled with love, passion, and bugs that will eventually get patched out. the moment i saw that larian would be in charge of creating baldur's gate 3 i couldn't have been more excited to play another larian game and hopped onto early access. the moment i could. 100 hours later and finishing the game i find myself in a similar state that i felt when i finished reading a good book or watching a fantastic showthe joy of completion yet the desire of wanting more. larian has created yet another masterpiece of an rpg that not only has engaging gameplay but a story that kept me entranced and forgetting that it's 3 am on a weekday. i am truly happy to be able to experience it. it's not perfect, bugs and imperfections exist from random models tposing, certain cutscenes not playing, weird ai pathing, companion approval bugs, etc, but i have faith that larian will be able to tackle and resolve these bugs. for my playthrough, i was fortunate enough to have had no gamingbreaking bugs, and i'm already eager to jump in for my 2nd playthrough. thank you larian, and i'm going to be enjoying baldur's gate 3 for quite a while, and waiting for whatever game comes next from your studio!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"waited divinity os 3, but received bladur's gate 3  anyway it's a good game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,a milestone for gaming and rpg genre. the game industry need to take example from larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"best game of rpg in a long time, maybe the best ever. the quantity of stuff you can do there, and the way you can resolve quests are endless. lot care and detail everywhere. i hope this can put an standard in the industry, of how a real game should be made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i have played baldur's gate 3 for 170 hour and this game is literally fascinating and i think it is one of the closest things to perfection and i don't agree with swen because this is the new standart and golden age of rpg. everything the game has to offer and the amount of time and effort that goes into it is really crazy. every major game studio should take a lesson from larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"after finishing, the experience has surpassed the experience of any other game. it's my personal gotygoat at least."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"honnestly speaking, it's been year i haven't play so long and enjoy so much  game. i have 300 hours on it and i still enjoy it, they are always new thing to do. it's been years since  real full game was release with no need of dlc or thing like that even if i cry for have one. the positif point   the scnario the ost the gameplay you like or you dont like it dpend of the view of everyone me i love it.  the fact you can play again and again you have like always new thing to do  the multiplayer the ngative point  some bug but i didnt see it to often the need of good machine for have  good experience but it still  10 for me i really love it and i still continue play it that game is really a love letter from the developper i can only recommand that game is my goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"rockstarlevel nonsense for scope, fuc yeah! thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i have really bad choice paralysis irl and the fact that a video game can make you second guess your choices and have them matter later on in your playthrough really shows the companys care for the game. every single little reply from your choices has a voice acting. insane replay value. a world that feels fully immersive and well lived. i wish and hope larian gets to do more games like this in the future
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i give it 10 points because it's probably one of the best games of the last 10 years in its genre and one of the best rpgs released during that time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is impeccable, amazing and i truly think they set the standard. the endings and epilogue is not that good, but outside of that this whole game is a must play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"1210 if i could. larian show everyone that there is still hope for us, that good game without modern give me all your money technics can be created. 200h in game and i still drop my jaw. i can only ask for more stories in this incredible world, in the future."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,this game has so many good things going for it. pros great story great graphics player freedom and choice great gameplay cons the engine of the game needs to be restarted every now and then because it takes up the memory.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,best game ever very good story with good charactere and a lot of choice with consquences plus a solid gameplay and a very big world with exellent art style and design
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"absolutely insane. i pirated it at first as i do with every game all of them are garbage, but i had to buy it after like 3 hours, i loved it so much. this is how you make games, worth every penny. i hope ea and the rest rot in hell and we get more studios like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"this game is a 10 stars of 5. i've never post on metacritic before and larian make me want to do it, because they deserve the ducking goty. complex and at the same time simple lovelyhateful characters beautfil, huge, masive and scary enviroments huge diversity of enemies and npcs. plus hundres of ways to manage the battles or even tons of ways to avoid battles and do it just poisoned beer, rolling dices in a conversation meanwhile your rogue steal them or just avoinding the quest and exploring another area if you will. the music gorgeous if you play it by yourself and play with friends you could choose other pacings, so you wont get bored. its fricking amazing. ps i've being playing the game for 135hrs so far, just if you are wondering,"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"was this game written by a bunch of teenagers that giggle at every mention of sex. can a person ever talk to anyone without being propositioned? probably the most perverted game i have ever seen, and so many have defended this, which is very worrisome. i know i will get the unhelpful check for this review, but being honest will get you that if you are not in the majority. if you are a pervert, and like cut scenes, then this game is for you. for me, i have come out of my mothers basement, so this isn't exciting to me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,truly a masterpiece from larian studios! huge world i love every second im playing this game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"after 35 hours still in act 1 but this game is awesome and it saddens me that companies like activision, blizzard, ea, microsoft are so ignorant to the fact that a good and well made game will sell regardless. not implementing microtransactions or dark patterns in a game and releasing future complete games should not be an option but a mandatory thing for every aaa game that we are paying for as consumers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"we believe in providing a complete and immersive gaming experience without the need for additional purchases. enjoy the game to its fullest without any additional cost or microtransactions. buy this game, vote with your wallets. this needs to be the standard. no denuvo, no mtx, no always online. thank you larian for making games with a passion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"best game ever! story, characters, fighting, world..everything is so alive! larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"for 70 hours of gameplay i got only to the 2nd act, i have not had such immersion in games for a long time. this game, in my opinion, has only one drawback  if you start playing it, you will forget about the world around for at least a few weeks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,obrigado larian por me proporcionar uma tima experincia nesse jogo maravilhoso. finalizei o jogo a poucas horas e fiquei triste por no ter mais contedo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,what? you still didn't buy this gem  yet? better stop calling  then.... also to devs whining about how larian is setting unrealistic standards for gamers... this is a standard for games. what you guys have is shameful to be called a standard. just try to earn your bread in another industry plz.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"absolute masterpiece. combat was daunting for me because i never played dnd but i feel like all the hours i played xcom helped a lot. the writing, characters, story, voice acting, cutscenes, game systems is just absolutely perfect. contrary to salty developers this game did set a new standard. to other studios maybe if you'd spend time making a fun, rich, satisfying game instead of focusing on how to monetize the ever living  out of them you could achieve such greatness as larian did. instead of crying foul learn from them and emulate them. if bg3 doesn't win goty 2023 this industry is corrupt and i will pirate everything except for larian games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"i've spent an ungodly amount of time on bg12  checking almost every corner, every chest, every interaction, every dialogue, every book. i loved these games. from this point of view, bg3 is a worthy successor. lots of dialogues, choices and events. i thought the realtime  pause combat from bg12 was perfect  but the turnbased combat in bg3 is so much better! i'm embarassed to admit how many times i placed my dude at the edge of a chasm to seeing him fall down because he was pushed by the enemy. something so blatantly obvious, but makes combat so refreshing  at least compared to previous bg's. i love the enriched restcamp mechanic, changing surroundings, requiring supplies finally we have to eat and drink! graphics and animations are cool, the landspaces are beautiful. i love this game and i will consume every tiny bit of it, just like i did with bg1 and bg2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"1010 by far. this game is just perfect. if anyone has doubt about this i urge them to play the game. my review doesn't have anything to do with the state of the gaming industry or other nonsense like that. this game is just good regardless of the comparison with other games. divinity original sin was good but the first act was really annoying and way too puzzleish for my taste. divinity original sin ii, first act was a bit too hard but the game became more balanced after you gained a few levels. i think this was made so you really feel that you are in a bad situation and it's not easy to get out of it. baldur's gate 3 is perfectly balanced on all difficulty levels from the start and the game is really fun from the first scene. the story is crazy and the game is just awesome, the replayability of it is insane. it's easy to just lose hundreds of hours into it and not feel the passing of time at all. the game also makes you second guess every dialog and decision that you make. i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"c'est l'un des plus grand jeu que j'ai fait, des jeux qui m'ont prit autant de 'passion' sont rare. je ne voit pas le temps passer il y a tellement de possibilits et il est si dense, il m'a fait l'effet the witcher , se retrouver dans un univers si complet que je me retrouve  regarder plein de vido sur you tube pour en savoir plus sur l'univers du jeu donjon  dragon ici . ne pas connatre l'univers du jeu etou les autres baldur n'est pas un frein pour faire le jeu , des rsumer des autres jeux existe et you tube a beaucoup d'expert passionn pour nous en apprendre toujours plus. le jeu est incroyable, srement une des meilleures exprience que j'ai jamais eu depuis vraiment trs longtemps, j'ai tester normment de jeu tour par tour et je n'ai jamais vraiment aim car a m'ennuyais mais l j'ai appris  aimer a et me rendre compte que c'est en aucun cas gnant. bref il faut y jouer vraiment , a serait louper une exprience que de ne pas essayer ou d'avoir peur du systme du jeu qui peut faire peur mme pour les nophytes jamais jouer a de jeu de rle papier ou autre baldur  divinity etc . foncez ! larian studio je vous aime et merci pour votre jeu"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"melhor jogo do mundo, incrvel como conseguiram fazer uma obra prima dessas"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"it's quite entertaining to witness the critics of those youngsters from the 20s who are solely engrossed in fortnite and never heard of dnd, pointing fingers at this game, labeling it as excessively cinematic and overly drenched in narrative intricacies, rather than a game of fastpaced combat action. their ability to assign negative ratings to this masterpiece truly showcases their unique perspective and profound wisdom!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the best thing about this game i can say is it's finished, it's exceptionally well fleshed out, and it's not buggy, but past that, it's just boring, it's so unbelievably slow to do literally anything i stopped looking in anything just to make it playable. i wanted to at least play and enjoy the story but i don't even know if i'm on a side quest or not, i just dropped down into a megadungeon that could take me a couple of hours to work through just to find out i did a side quest that has almost no impact on the story. and you need to be able to disable the dice rolls they are by fare the least enjoyable part of the game, they should be hidden int he background and just display success or failure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"1010 they deserved it. good job, larian studios! unlike ubisoft, ea games and whatseover these suit guys are called who have only profit in mind."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"i could never get into or enjoy anything turn based. however i do enjoy rpg games. poe, original diablo, bethesda games, the witcher, etc etc. turn based has always been such a bore though. anyway, with the incredible flood of positive reviews this game has received i'll keep it short. as someone who never like turn based game  baldurs gate 3 has to be one of the best games in recent memory and i can't stop playing it. i can't wait to replay it again with a party. i can't wait to play it again using different classes. it's incredible what the developers have done. highly recommend it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"49 yrs young here, started on a c64 with ghostbusters as one of the first games that i fell in love with. it had a cool progression and upgrade mechanic but you had to load it from a cassette deck! anyone under the age of 40 can google that last bit. i played the original bg and bg 2 and i can say that bg3 is honestly one of the best games i've ever played. not to mention its a complete gaming experience out of the box! larian studios have shown the rest of the industry that you can make a great game that's a financial success, which doesn't treat their player base like blood bags of cash while they vampire like  us dry of our hard earned cash with microtransactions, loot boxes etc etc. everyone at larian who worked on this, my gratitude is boundless. and as i was fond of saying during my d and d days may the wind be always at your back and the road always rise to meet your feet."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"probably the best crpg ever made. played bg1, bg2, pillars of eternity 1  2, divinity 1  2, etc. the level of detail is something else, i hope you guys continue to expand on this game once you finish your well deserved break."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"i never thought i'd play another game as good as divinity original sin 2 in my lifetime, which was crowd funded on kickstarter by the way. baldur's gate 3 has absolutely improved in every single aspect all while being on the brink of bankruptcy. ever hear of a aaa game company almost going broke? no, because they don't make games, they make money, greedy f."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece combining brilliantly written interactive storytelling with an engaging tactical combat system amid a dense open world. every detail is purposeful.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"larian did the impossible whit this game. this should be the standard when it comes to high quality gaming . there is no use saying anything about the game itself since is perfect in every way shape and form, simply  it , support the developers , somthing like this comes only once in 1020 years.i dare say the perfect game. i have over 70 hours of gameplay and im still in act 2 . its a must play game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"i didn't gave a solid 10 because the tutorial isn't complete enough, i needed to read dd 5e instructions to understand some icons and mechanics but besides that, it is one of the best rpg's i've ever played in my life, the graphics, the characters, the lore, the atmosphere, everything is amazing, larian did an truly amazing job and all other studios should see and follow what larian did! this is a game that will never be forgotten. good job for all people involved in this project, this goty will be very well deserved."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"jogo sensacional! muito divertido, absolutamente completo em interaes e criatividade em combate e aes. um rpg fiel ao gnero! impecvel!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"score 7.510 larian's latest game presents a perplexing dichotomy. on one hand, the studio's talent in crafting immersive worlds and compelling narratives is evident. on the other, glaring flaws significantly detract from the overall experience. the question arises are the glowing reviews genuinely reflective of the game's entirety? or are they merely the impressions of those players boasting about being 60hrs in still in act 1? what exactly are they doing during this time? admiring the scenery? lighting torches in buildings they'll never revisit? the ending is a stark reminder of the original mass effect 3 debacle  a conclusion that left fans outraged. for this game, the praise seems misplaced. the abruptness, lack of depth, and multitude of bugs make replayability beyond act 2 unappealing. why replay when the payoff is so unsatisfying? performance issues are hard to ignore. even with a highend setup, frame rates were inconsistent. act 3, in particular, was riddled with stutters and memory leaks. this segment's lack of polish is reminiscent of the issues cyberpunk faced at launch. yet, for some reason, these problems seem to be brushed aside by many. the game's narrative suggests cut content, with characters built up in the earlier acts only to be reduced to mere boss fights later on. raphael is a prime example. minthara, introduced as the evil choice romance option, is riddled with bugs, making her more of a liability than an asset. choosing her path means sacrificing two welldeveloped companions, a tradeoff that feels more punishing than rewarding. companion dynamics swing between two extremes overt flirtation and outright hostility. a middle ground is sorely missing. some companions, like haislin, become redundant, especially when others, such as jaheira, offer so much more. while certain aspects of the game, like explicit scenes, are detailed, others, like the final act and inventory ui, are lacking. the imbalance is palpable. many are quick to defend larian's dedication to the game. however, this is no longer an early access title it's a full release. if these glaring issues are acceptable to some, it's a concerning reflection on the state of the gaming industry. bg3, despite its moments of brilliance, is overshadowed by its flaws. the journey, which started with promise, devolves into a different, less satisfying experience by the end. it's hard not to question the authenticity of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, especially when the game's latter stages are so problematic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"while not an open world rpg, baldur's gate 3 has more freedom, more choices, and more paths to achieve goals than any crpg i've ever played, and i've played most of them. at no point in the game was there any encounter or obstacle which didn't have many ways to resolve. the game rewards players for being creative and imaginative. high production values, engaging turnbased combat, and passably decent writing combine with that to make this one of the, if not the, best crpg ever released on pc. it is not, however, particularly innovative, despite all the accolades being heaped on it, and it sits most comfortable in the turnbased crpg genre. so if either or both of those things don't appeal to you, don't let the hype trick you. you probably won't like the game. me, personally, i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"for upwards of 60  you should be able to buy games of the highest quality , unfortunately in this age we get games like assassins creed valhalla diablo 4, and a joke  world of warcraft , which in my opinion should cost half of what you pay for. with boulders gate 3 there is so much content that i feel im robbing this studio blind for 60 because i know im going to play this game for years to come .this game is my new best rpg on the market . its a timeless masterpiece that will be a benchmark of how real rpgs are to be played . from games like skyrim and witcher 3 , this game creates a new standard for me of what a true rpg should be like . thank you bailers fate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"whatever larian touches seems to turn to gold. loved divinity original sin 12, and i love baldurs gate. the best part about this game is, they've made an engaging immersive player experience without the toxic cashmicrotransaction shop. you paid for a game, you have a game and a great game at that. this is not to say cashmicrotransaction shops are bad, they are just bad when a developer exclusively builds their game around it like what blizzard did with d4. poe did the cash shop right imo, where d4 did it wrong."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"what really kills this game is that it gets really boring. i quite enjoyed act 1 and it has a decent pacing but act 2 drags on forever and the story gets uninteresting. i pushed myself to play the last couple of hours to finish act 2 and now i feel kinda fed up with the game. i really tried to like this game, don't think i have ever played a game this much without enjoying it. but yeah i had to come to the conclusion that baldurs gate 3 is a bad game. metacritic doesn't allow me to write a proper review of the game so i have to keep it short"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"although the writing both of the main plot and characters still doesn't reach the level of mastery of the second entry, and there aren't as many places to visit, the unmatched level of freedom to solve every situation and act exactly as you want, more than makes up for it. in addition, the graphics engine that made divinity original sin so famous is unrivaled in the world of crpgs, allowing us to interact with almost every object on the map, climb mountains and buildings, fly, fill the stage with flames and frost, and much more. the worldwide acclaim it is receiving is truly welldeserved."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,its so good when you lose yourself in the freedom and get so immersed about the sheer amount of unique dialog trees and choices and you think to yourself did i make the right choice?

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"masterpiece of crpg, i hope larian prove crpg game is still interesting to intract many players if it is good enough for some producer, such as obsidian, inxile or bioware"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"i am loving this game so far 45 hours of gameplay. the depth of characters and story telling are fantastic. no microtransactions, no agenda, no always online. for the first time in a long time this game feels like a game that was designed to be enjoyed by the player and not just to feed company revenue with little regard for the enjoyment of the consumer after receiving payment. the only minor gripe i have with the same thus far, is there are sexual advances that come up at random. i'm fine with it, if it fits the story, but i've had a character that seemly hated my guts up until this point, and last night all of a sudden wanted to share a bed with me? it was out of the blue and didn't really make sense with my decisions up to that point. otherwise, solid game that i'm enjoying very much."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,la cantidad de opciones que te da este juego es impresionante! una obra maestra en toda regla!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"baldur's gate 3 is a great game that throws players into an amazing fantasy world quickly and dramatically, contriving a dire series of events that thrusts a group of unlikely companions into a perilous journey. it is the greatest rpg . the game is overflowing with crossroads, with every step conjuring up yet more paths trying to seduce you off the beaten track. each of the three acts could be their own epic rpg, jampacked with elaborate dungeons, strikingly memorable quests and unique stakes, supported by systems that offer a truly intimidating amount of player freedom. have fun adventurers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,i felt like a child who plays its first game. thank you for such an amazing experience larian studios.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"blizzard should learn from larian how to make good games. baldur's gate 3 is a phenomenal game. i haven't had so much fun with any other title in a long time. for me, this is the game of 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"purtroppo, nonostante io riconosca il valore del lavoro svolto, questo rimane un prodotto di nicchia per gli amanti del genere. perch se non amate il genere, non amerete questo gioco. voglio dire, anche il gioco di pesca perfetto, da 10 assoluto, non pu piacermi se non mi frega nulla della pesca. in conclusione, di genere. ma ottimo prodotto."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"this game is just pure crpg goodness. this is the new standart for aaa rpgs and crpgs espeacially. no one demands the same results from small indie studios, that's impossible or would take very very long. but for big a publishers and developers? yes i expect this in the future too. i haven't even played a crpg that much since the old realms of arkania das schwarze auge or eye of the beholder series. good rpgs, sure but they were more immersive sims like system shock or ultima underworld. if you love crpgs and the insane freedom and amount of ways to solve a problem in this game, this is for you. you will be a very happy person."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"although i've been a long time dnd fan, since it began in the 70's, i have not really played much since my teens, with the last real playtime landing with the gold box pool of radiance, curse of the azure bonds, etc. games and finally baldur's gate 1  2 upon their initial release. i bought into this a couple of years back but only put a couple of hours in and found i didn't want to ruin the surprise. so much to learn and find in this game! this game deserves an 20 out of 10. larian devs put so much effort into this game and every time i think i have cleared an area, i go back to find more that i have missed. wander everywhere. go to dead ends. open everything. all this exploration is on top of the amazingly well spoken and written story lines. i want to play with every character. if you are the type of person that might be interested in the story, quests, exploration, and are not turned off by redoing battles, if needed, then play it. it is the best game of its type to ever be developed for computersconsole  i'm not kidding. it is the top of pile by a huge margin and that's for the last fifty 50 years of dnd. this is a god tier dungeons and dragons game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"people giving this 1010 are out of their minds when it comes to objectivity, not even a voice acting protagonist in a slow game like this is absurd. most overhyped game i have heard of in a while. if you compare this to a now very old game dragon age inquisition which is the closest game that comes to mind, they trade blows in some things, but i find the 9 year old dai overall much better than this after 30 hours of gameplay. closest 2. would be greedfall which too is better in most ways. i tried this first like a year ago, didn't like it at all. tried upon release again now and it's pretty much the same, although i've come a bit further. the game is extremely slow going, your character is appearing to jog while walking slow. it has quite good voice acting and characters at times but lacks depth so far, but thats early to say. the graphics are near identical to dai, if you could slap dlss on dai they could be in the same world. the customization is ok, but lack of nose, mouth, eyebrows, face shapes and so forth is unacceptable, some will say that it would be impossible with cinematics etc, well even a game like immortal fenyx and greedfall has that, dai too has that, with voice acting on top of your fully customized character making the experience complete, while here your character just looks at a person appearing to be mute or slow. the combat is pretty awful so far, if you win you win, if you loose you reload the game, if you have to throw a dice, you either win and go forth, you loose you reload the game. it's not a fun way to play. many of the dialogue options are not possible to get to if you asksay the wrong thing first, usually they allow in most games to go by all of the dialogue options so you dont have to reload, but here it's very limited. i do want to play some more and perhaps it grows on me, but how people praise this game is just not objective. there is absolutely no smoothness to it, it's just so rough, everything from camera to movement and combat, it's like if it came out in 2008 it would be decent, but it's 2023, it can't be this unpolished today. so far it's perhaps 6.510, going to either 6 if not improving or possibly a 7 if it really picks up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,this is the most satisfying game i have ever played in terms of exploration. maybe elden ring could come close to this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,thank you larian. the respect you shared for this game is great! i will personnally wait for the enhanced edition .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"this game is a masterpiece! larian's boys deserve the goty, i think this is the most complete game in recent years, an immense game with lots of things to do but in a world that is never empty and fully enjoyable, if you have never played dd you will find it slightly complex at all start, but you will get used to it in a few hours of playing i guarantee it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"as a crpg fan, baldur's gate 3 is nothing for me where the likes of fallout 1  2, arcanum, geneforge and many more exist. but kudos to larian who laid their groundwork from divinity series and executed the basic tropes of crpg well showing the world what true roleplaying is in video games. i was skeptical at first because it deviated lot from the infinity engine games but larian learned all their tricks and made baldur's gate 3 their magnum opus. barring some flaws, baldur's gate 3 has laid the foundation for more crpg in the future to get recognition and mainstream success"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"just what i've been waiting for! i haven't enjoyed a game this much since i was a teenager. finally a game that feels well and truly for gamers by gamers in this contemporary drought we've been living through. a game with integrity that embraces a gameplay first mentality and proves that profit need not conflict with quality. a new benchmark in gaming prowess regardless of the quibbling of other studios  if you cant take the heat, get out of avernus. larian studios  my our? heroes."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,baldur's gate 1 was my favourite rpg game to this year. in 2023 i discovered skyrim which i loved and now baldur's gate 3  everything fans of fantasy and dd could dream of. skyrim and bg3 are pinnacle of fantasy rpgs. i think that bg3 could become my favourite rpg of all time. i have only slightly problems with camera.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,the best crpg to come out in a long time and a true sucessor to baldurs gate. the game truly feels like a dd session.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"baldur's gate 3 is a real masterpiece unlike other games like diablo iv. the game has all the qol features that diablo iv can't offer. better story and better narrator overall than diablo iv. large selection of items, with well thought out enchantments. not like the junk from diablo iv. builds can be designed however you want. you can have several skills and different elixirs, potions, crafting etc. like witcher 3 different monstersracescharacters very good cut scenes all characters have a story to tell or interact with in the story. not like that soulless diablo game where you have 75x blacksmiths just slapped along with copy  paste. you can go in different directions in the game and have different decisions, therefore different endings of the story. you can see when developers make an effort what a divine game the result is. i could say more positive things about baldur's gate 3, but that's enough for now. i recommend baldurs gate3 to everyone who also likes turnbased games dnd but for now, the game gets a 1010. excellent work, larian !!!! note fk you blizzard company, check out larians game how to do it right !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"never played dd, but this is just an amazing game. this game has been developed with love and passion with a highly skilled team with high standards and commitment. 1 great story and a beautiful world. 2 great characters. 3 amazing amount of detail! 4 side quests that actually make sense. 5 finally a game that's actually worth your money. 6 a developer and publisher that actually cares about their product and the gaming community. 7 next level replay value! 8 multiplayer coop."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the game is really good and offers a lot of freedom. there are a few problems, technically. the graphics are really bad, and the lefty wing propaganda is in it too. the super diverse city is boring and no fun. i prefer interesting cultures, there is no need to seperate them through hate, you can also make it just , missed oppertunity and lefty decision. and forcing us to create black females is also super sad, why not tolerate what we do? and the dnd5 version is just not the best for combat"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"baldur's gate 3 emerges as a worthy successor to the iconic franchise, offering a mix of nostalgia and modern gameplay mechanics. the game's meticulously crafted world is a visual feast, with stunning landscapes and intricate character designs that capture the essence of the dungeons  dragons universe. the storytelling in baldur's gate 3 is its undeniable highlight. the narrative is rich and branching, influenced by player choices and character interactions. each decision has the potential to alter the course of the story, lending a sense of agency and immersion that draws players deeper into the game's universe. dialogues are wellwritten, filled with wit and depth, giving npcs a life of their own. the transition to turnbased combat has been wellexecuted. battles are intense and strategic, requiring players to carefully consider positioning, abilities, and environmental factors. the inclusion of verticality and interactive elements in combat further elevates the tactical experience. however, it's important to note that while the game is impressive in its release state, there are occasional bugs, performance issues, and incomplete features that can temporarily hamper the experience. players should make a note that the game is receiving hotfixesupdates to fizzle out these issues. despite some minor hiccups, the potential for greatness is evident. larian studios has a track record of listening to player feedback and refining their games accordingly. as hotfixesupdates continue to roll out, players can anticipate improvements, additional content, and a smoother overall experience. in conclusion, baldur's gate 3 shines as a promising addition to the rpg genre. its captivating storytelling, intricate gameplay mechanics, and potential for growth make it a title that both longtime fans of the series and newcomers can look forward to experiencing. while some rough edges are present due to its early release, the foundation is strong, leaving players excited for what's to come in the goty edition."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"a tough one after 50 h. still 710 for me. let me explain it is a very good game, obviously. everybody downvoting because he feels so, is a morron. i noticed though that many, if not most, reviewers seem to upvote the game on steam for political reasons, or because they seem to be old. politics no microtransactions, no battle bass, etc. you probably see what kind of reviews i mean. and then there is dragon age origin. lots of nostalgia reviews, which is fine because this type of games was popular 1520 years ago. however, let's be honest there is a reason why this genre died. it is too slow, too sluggish, and it has too much content. too much content is when you just do not care to reach 50  of it. from what i have seen, many players did not even finish act 1. why? because it's just a game. therefore, i may regret it one day, but bg3 is a stark reminder of why this genre became niche some time ago, and why the next dev should not try the same. you will not earn the same political outrage as bg3. actually, most steam games do not even have microtransactions... so, well, where is this outrage coming from exactly? and why? but more importantly if the next rpg is as big as bg3, then the act 1quitters will just not buy it. in the same many players never finished xcom. but if you do not such a game once, you will likely not buy a similar game next time. so, my verdict is 710 because it is a very good game. but the political hype is distorting. it probably just came out at the right time, where many pc gamers are annoyed by blizzard, ea, ubisoft etc. as for the game i wish the main story was more interesting and the game's pace less sluggish at times, unless you need a walking simulator with tons and tons of meaningless content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"a software engineer, a hardware engineer, and their manager are driving to a meeting when the car they are in gets a flat tire. the software engineer says, let's run diagnostics to see if we can identify the issue. the hardware engineer suggests, let's swap out the tire and see if that fixes the problem. the manager chimes in, how about we get out of the car, and then get back in. maybe it will start working again!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"the gist of why i gave this game a lower score is that while i think it's a great game with a lot to like and a large variety to solve most situations you encounter the story and writing is severely lacking in my opinion and that can hamper the experience. the game itself is beautiful for the genre it is in, the music is mostly great, the cinematic is amazing but sadly there's just the one. there's a lot of gameplay options in most things including combat. it's a great experience and most of the times it plays great! the biggest downside for me was the story and characters. the writing feels too contemporary bringing in modern day issues and dilemmas to a fantasy setting. things that don't seem to fit with the world that you're presented with. unlike previous baldur's gate games which felt very grounded in the world. due to the writing and the larian style it can feel like you're playing divinity original sin. it's the same humor and quips, the way npc behave. it was all to dosesque for me. while dos is great a different would have been refreshing. not everything has to play like some kind of mediocre marvel superhero movie. luckily you can choose to skip a lot of that if you don't like though it might hamper the experience. any annoying character you don't like can be dealt with usually with brute force. surprisingly this was a refreshing experience as i usually play trying to, mostly, save everyone and resolve things in clever ways that don't require, much, bloodshed. so, playing a bit more cold and indifferent character was very refreshing and lead to some satisfying moments like pushing asterion off a cliff. technically the game has some issues and bugs. there's a very wide range of them and some of them can greatly affect your game if a quest breaks for some reason. items can disappear. encountered traps that would not stop or invisible clouds that would damage me as if a trap that was disarmed was still spewing gas. won't go over everything as this can be easily found elsewhere but do save often. very often. the camera can be very annoying and make it difficult to interact with the world. i hope that a mod will fix it but those seem to disable achievements for now. there's a lot to like but to me the writing really drags this game way down and i play a rpg to be invested and immersed in it. as a sequel to a the great baldur's gate series? i think the tone and writing miss the mark by a lot for it to be the successor of those games. reading some other reviews i can't help but think people haven't play many rp games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,i love this game and i must play again in this. this is amazing and perfect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,this is the best game i truly found myself immersed in since witcher 3. i played countless games after witcher 3 but none seem to create that feeling of belonging there but this is a masterpiece. even though i didn't liked the divinity original sin 2 turn based combat but this game is so good that i am even enjoying the turn based combat. well done larian studios
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"all i can say is wow, wow, wow the team at larian went all out on this game! it truly is a masterpiece that is going to be fondly remembered. to be honest, it kind of feels like a lovingly made piece of art. character creation, companions, setting are all incredible, but what makes this stand out is the depth and painstaking detail woven into the quests, gameplay and dialogue that screams masterclass. itll probably will take some getting used to for some younger audiences that have been so subjected to increasingly dumbeddown and lowfrequency content over the years, but this is something that once they get into it, will surely be a breath of fresh air to them and will be a real treat for that mistreated generation, showing them what epic gaming is about. itll hopefully inspire a new generation of budding game developers to reach for the stars, because sometimes someone like larian actually manages to reach them."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,very good game. i enjoyed playing this game a lot. i strongly recommend this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"act1 felt very frontloaded in terms of quality, comedy, shock value, etc. act2 needed more content overall but was solid in terms of what was there. act3 needed more depth or oomph to some of the quest lines. there are bugs, and when you're playing a game this massive right out of the gate of course there are going to be issues, but i can't really dock on them on that because for me the game was incredibly enjoyable through and through. controller feels 10x better than mouse and keyboard. lack of wasd control on mk is a horrible design choice but controller offers you character control with the joystick. i don't mind savescumming but there needs to be ingame options that take away this advantage. offer a hardcore mode that locks you in to your choices and rolls. in my mind the problem with the companion relationships is that they aren't flushed out enough but it's not something you're likely to notice until you're in later parts of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"one of the greatest experience i got from video games this decade. it feel like an old crpg experience on steroid, it feel so unreal that the game can be this good. in the year that most of the video games are disappointment after this appointment, this game become a shinning light in the darkness, spark hope and dream for uncertain future. best regard to the larian team for this unforgettable experience. i hope for a bright future for them."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"i played hours of baldur's gate 3 and i'm still looking for all that revolution i've seen so many people talk about. they changed the combat system compared to the previous one and if it weren't for some good side quests this would be just another okay game. maybe my expectation was wrong, as i was expecting the game that would reinvent rpg concepts, but no, it's just an ok game with some cool side quests and some references to dungeons and dragons which are cool. make sure other games on the market like the witcher 3 put this game in your pocket."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"simplemente maravilloso. podra decir cosas malas del juego,podra ponerle menos de un 10. pero me parecera una tontera, dentro de la industria gaming actual, pocos juegos han conseguido divertirme tantsimo. 100h de juego, y an no he acabado la campaa."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"after playing early access for 24 hours, i was hooked on the game. i waited for the full release and since then did nothing but play bg3 for 2 straight weeks. with 130 hours of playtime in a single full playthrough, i can only say, play this game because you are going to love it! these 130 hours are filled to the brim with so many amazing quests and places it's insane. there wasn't a single filler quest! everything in this huge game was crafted to perfection. larian did something truly amazing with this game. thank you, larian studios! this was absolutely incredible!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"i dont understand what all the hype is with this game i spent over ten hours in the game and its very repetitive, there are glimpses  game but it is smeared with too many problems that just make the game feel plain and basic, even with my high end pc the frame pacing and stuttering of the game just makes it feel clunky. i dont recommend the game if you are looking for a a good experience"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,story and game play mechanics are over the top. this is the best open world fantasy game since witcher 3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"this game is phenomenal, i've not have this much fun with a videogame in years,i thought crpgs weren't for me, but baldur's gate 3 made me appreciate this genre a lot, i don't know much about larian's studios, but they brought a beautiful game experience, in a landscape full of soulless bad aaa games. the game boasts of a masterfully written story, where every action you take,reflects its consequences in the game world even a lot of chapters later the tactical gameplay makes you use your brain in fights,even at low level, instead of just spamming op moves here and there. the fact that this game is set in a dnd world,makes the lore even deeper,and invites the player into researching interesting facts about it. the game is full of memorable characters,each one with their unique traits. for a game this big and deep,the graphics and the 3d models are highly detailed and have top tier voice acting and good  ost is simply one of the best i've ever listened in a videogame,with each villain having their own ost a character with a name that starts with the letter r has one of the best ost in my opinion. this game is one of the best rpgs i've ever played and sits on the throne next to the witcher 3. i loved every second of this game and i hope this game gets goty 2023 award,it deserves it for setting the bar in development so high. good job larian,you deserve every praise for this game, i hope to see more of this game in the near future. p.s. get that goty please!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"goty game ever. thanks for developers, this game so beautiful and interactive. i hope we get dlc or something, this game have big potential for user servers or coop adventure, especialy with mods party limit begone. if you dont bought this game, so i dont why you listening my review, you won't understand until you try. separate respect to sound compositor  borislav slavov, best compositor ever"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"cringe humor, trash writing, annoying or boring companions, while the gameplay its boring after a while, especially with big encounters the roll mechanic its trash, i know how that sound, but for almost everything ? from combat, persuasion, perception, picking locks, fighting, dominate someone, etc give me break, you're just lazy at that point and don't want to make more gameplay and just roll a dice maybe with luck you can win this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"while not perfect, i had some buggy issues myself, the way the game was developed makes baldur's gate 3 the best pcrpg game in history. early access allowed for incredible cooperation and community building that made this game the hype players are describing. beautiful story, game with a beginning that allows you to play with whatever you want without breaking the narrative and initial premise of the game's story. fantastic and delicious environment to explore, with secret places and different paths to the same destination. and at the end of it all, a game that arrived ready at launch, without making consumers beta testers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"this game is a masterpiece. the characters, the gameplay, the stories being told, the visual style. everything clicks the gameplay has incredible depth thanks to the many possible interactions with the environment, the enemies or your party of adventurers. you can pic up an enemy and throw them off a cliff, use them as an improvised weapon or throw them into another foe in range. you can set up ambushes and modify the terrain with barrels. you can combine elemental effects. you can sneak to a potential enemy and pickpocket their potions and grenades so they have no consumables during combat. you can drop your flaming torch on the ground and have your party coat their weapons in fire. etc. the characters have layers and personalities which are affected by your actions. there are multiple ways their stories can progress which are affected on multiple levels from your starting choices in character creator to the actions you take during your adventures. the visual style is beautiful and on a technical level the game is impressive since the maps are massive and full of objects that can be destroyed, burned, moved around. masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"excellent game, best crpg games there is currently and arguably the best game released in the last five years. full voice acting for all dialogue options, unique dialogue for each characters except your own custom characters. npc reacts differently according to what you are wearing and doing. combat is excellent, no unbalancing issue, put a little bit of thought behind you r actions can get you through all situation even on tactician mode hardest difficulty. story line is great giving you several divergences, you are not bound do a specific path aside from the little worm in your head which is the factor driving main story line. should you buy the deluxe edition? unless you are a big fan of larian studio and their previous games, or wish to support good developers and companies like these, you don't have to buy the deluxe edition. personally i bought the deluxe edition because it comes with the soundtrack of divinity 2 original sin where you can pull out an instrument and play that banger at the end of your turn in combat."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"absolute stellar game, a masterpiece. intrinsic stories with a great cast. visually striking imagery and the world itself. nuances in its voiceacting and great turnbased gameplay. my only major quibbles are the bugs. it's to no surprise that there will be many in a game of such a scope and larian the studio behind the game are constantly pushing out fixes. still, it can take you out of the immersion from time to time from cutscenes not appearing to characters walking through walls. the other big downside is sometimes the camera really doesn't know what it's doing in battle and cutscenes at times and it can be a little frustrating, and sometimes downright hilarious. either way, this game is spectacular and is truly a once in a generation type game. i wish other studios gave as much heart and soul to this game like they do instead of running it into the ground with microtransactions  which this game is free from anything ingame. major kudos to the team, you should be proud!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"game was alright, worthy of being one of the best games of the decade. however, the game starts to lose it's charm and the facade of 'detail' gets lost somewhere about the end of act 2 and persists to the very end of the game. i hope they reconsider their choices they made for the story of characters like karlach. and that they polish act 2 and act 3 up to have the same depth of content as act 1 had."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"been following this game since early access. honestly im in shock of how good this game is, everyday i get the craving to run home from work and play it and too top it all off there is no microtransactions or other scummy tactics. i love the characters and turn based combate, there are a few bugs but doesnt take away from overrall experience. if your a fan of turn based combat and systems this is right up your alley and if your not atleast try it out or watch some videos before investing."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"before playing this game, i used to hesitate about turnbased combat games, thinking they were difficult to play, hard to follow, and slowpaced. however, after examining this game and wanting to give it a try, i realized that i'm actually quite interested in this genre. there seems to be no limit to what you can do in the game  if you want, you can be the villain, or if you prefer, you can be a good character and save everyone. personally, i lean towards being the villain and causing mayhem."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"very fun at the start, but the poor number of possible characters make it not worth it to replay. first playtrough was nice tho"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"the game is a feast. i played larian games since divinity ii ego draconis, and played all the baldur's gate back in the day along with icewind dale etc. the awesome gameplay you found in divinity original sin i  ii is obviously present, and if you are familiar with the series, you will feel at home with the usual systems  stealth mechanics, multiple dialogues at the same time and agency of controlling other characters meanwhile, to... pickpocket or other, moving objects around and throwing them, or even people, stacking boxes, interaction between elements poisonfire, waterelectricity etc. ... if you are not used to them, there are quite a few to discover. so yes, it is definitely a larian game, and the system familiarity have let some nickname it divinity original sin iii, but i disagree. i do not know of any other game where you have this agency, and having all this in the third opus of baldur's gate is simply a boon. i can understand some people not liking the turn based mechanics, but i actually like them for the same reason i hated dragon age ii system, which had the least interesting fights in any rpg so far due to wanting to add dynamic to it you push a button, something happens!  and even if you do not, enemy drop out of thin air  , all while being rushed in about a year because... ea  which definitely does not mean early access here. dragon age inquisition improved that, but still lacked any decent ai tweaking compared to dragon age origins, where you could actually program you ai exactly how you wanted. in bg3 as in dos and dos2, you actually control all your characters, while having the flexibility to cheat time by having some characters out of combat, and well, anyway, that is a debate for dynamic vs. strategic. the pause system either imposes on the game an ai which you can actually define the behavior correctly, or to do a lot of micro management otherwise, which then becomes a parody of a turn based system. anyway, as i said the game is a feast. i am still on act i after about 55h  true, i quicksavereload a lot because i am curious of different outcomes, and i guess you could shove 20h of trying alternative ways and such. but the richness of the world, combined with the quality of about everything, is staggering. when i say everything, i mean all the subtle details in combat with the vfx, sfx oh i love the power of eldritch blast, and the stuble dice roll sounds, the voiced sentences when you move or act in the world whispers in stealth, ... in order not to have your character be a total mute given the 8 different voices for a character, and that all the other ones are voice acted  including animals, i can understand, ... i could go on, but it is already getting long enough, and i think my first sentence sums it all. it is definitely larian's witcher iii game, and i do not think you can have higher praise than reading nonlarian devs say that the game is so awesome that you, littlegamerwhoknowsnothing, should not expect all the games to come to be on this level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"bugs aside, this is easily one of the best games i've ever played. it's incredible! also, i want to mention how larian studios are extremely proconsumer no drm, no microtransactions, dedicated to addressing bugs and fan requests, they are a gold standard for what it means to be a game developer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"an absolutely masterpiece in crpg design, combat, story, and lore. even for me, someone who could easily go without a good story so long as the core gameplay is fun. i found myself hooked on the characters backstory and lore as more of it was revealed while playing this game. if you love turn base rpgs or dnd, this game is a must play."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"we are far from the hype and promises from the beginning. the act 1 is the only thing properly done to begin with. other acts have been rushed. the level of writing is weak, suitable to teenagers and younger adults but not mature adults. a shame 25 years after the first game. clearly, players from the 90's weren't the targeted audience. the game mechanics are bad because the 5th dd ruleset is bad, but that's wotc bad policy the problem, not larian. you can play at the highest difficulty level without a problem as a casual player because everything is way too easy. there's no tactical challenge the whole game, which clearly shows this game is designed for a younger audience. the worst part being the companion. they're all dull, they don't get at each other throat for being opposed by their alignment like in the first games which is clearly weak in term of roleplay while it's supposed to be the strongest part of the roleplay... overall, it's an okay game, but we are far from the promised quality. the name of the title is more bait than anything else, it is not a proper heir to the original saga, far from it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,i don't often write reviews but here i have to. this game is simply a masterpiece. it's extremely rich and vast and you can feel all the creativity and passion that were put into it as you play. it's just stunning.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"this is a masterpiece of the classic rpgs. a well deserved secuel for the baldur's gate saga. larian studios has perfected the formula they were improving during the divinity orginal sin saga. the dd franchise is safe with larian studios. enjoy this game, you will not regret buying this game at full price."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"truly one of the best games and rpgs ever made. why is it a 1010?  graphically its gorgeous, animations for spells are cool and there are tons, more on that later. overall the dungeons, locations, and overall look and feel of the game was polished, detailed and fabulous looking! sound was fabulous, whether it be the music or the sound effects, everything was pushing the atmosphere. again, the music here is great, for long playthroughs it really helps the experience. gameplay is where this game shines, its shows its' dnd backbones with pride. the checks and systems of dnd work wonderfully here. the amount of choice you have is staggering, the amount of possible outcomes for so many situations is exciting to say the least. needless to say, if you're a dnd fan and like video games, this is gonna be a hit for you. it works wonderfully for coop, i've only tried 2 and 3 person groups, but both were seemless. i have not tried cross play however, with pc only being out. plotstory the story of the game is well drawn out, it has some amazing characters and backstories that are definitely intriguing. i'm encouraged to see the many directions the plot can go as well for multiple runs. i will say the game's companions are a bit too horny lol the amount of content here is staggering, its well worth a full game price tag, i myself know multiple playthroughs will be easily happening. 1010 without a doubt. that said, i would say my one gripe on the game is that the 3rd act doesnt quite punch home. i still think the first act was the most well put together, doesn't take away from the value of the game though! buy it! play it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"its one of the best in genre, top 2 canditate for game of the year award.  7 dialogues and choices, translations, cutscenes. its not so boring as much like dos1 or 2 5 graphics and designstyle 4 large world 2 archers have more range, could climb, assasinate enemy. there is few new fun things. 1 nice character creation system, but its not perfect  5 dnd  i dont complaint about version of system but tabletop unimmersive solutions. dnd 123 would be same abstract. its pc not some table game. there was much more fun solutions in even turna based genres. cloud of blades, adding fire to weapon from little candle, using team healing with one potion by throwing to ground. its too abstract for me. 2 little too much dark companions. almost every new character has some very evil side. 2 story is nice but, is it original? no, its just like a good dream or maybe good tabletop rpg session. its not masterpiece like lotr or game of thrones  its not same scale. even fallout 4 was more original but dialogues had less depth. almost every idea is like cp77 overwrite memory, getting unique powers from demons, bad devil is good, paladin are bad weaker and dumb 1 graphic and physics  god as for turnbased, but gameengine is to weak for realtime fight when u need to look straight ahead. its not so ambitious game like bethesda games its, game from lower league. 1 bad controls and little dumb ai. i prefer bg2 strategic selecting characters, maybe i dont know i can change this. there is no option to do sync shoot when sneak. lot of dumb situations when sneaking. lot of dumb situations like enemy passing dagger cloud few times same turn or companion which died after fight which also passed dagger cloud after autoquit turn based  won bottle. 1 dialogue rolls  why i have chance only from active character? 0.5 layout, a specially shops  uncomfortable. no way to change appearance or name"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"no microtransactions, no season pass, no internet connection needed to play, no preorder exploitative content, all about good content gamers' wish."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,the best western rpg i ever played. it's like playing a real dd campaign but with hollywood direction. simple wonderful. as a side note being me a reader of all forgotten realms books it was a real pleasure to play and live all that world and lore so loving and wonderfully recreated in this masterpiece. thank you larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"this game is a once in a decade game, there's is too much they do right to get anything less than a 1010. the graphics are outstanding, the game mechanics are brilliant, but most of all the story telling is second to none. there are so many ways to cook an egg with this game, for example i have been using some walkthrough for some of the quests and i notice that they are telling me a completely different way to beat it, this is because your choices can change each individual quest entirely, to the point each quest is almost tailored to your game. even to the point of which party members you have in your party at each specific quest can change the outcome and dialogue choices. the spells you learn and play style you adopt will completly change how the game goes for you. this isn't a mass effect style 4 endings in different colours and your choices mean nothing. every decision you make in this game has the ability to entirely change the story and this is a revolution for gaming, something much bigger developers always promise but never deliver on. hats off!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"die anzahl der rezensionen, die ich auf steam geschrieben habe lassen sich an einer hand abzhlen. ich mchte jedoch diesem spiel und den zahlreichen menschen dahinter einfach danke sagen. danke fr ein spiel, ein erlebnis und eine unglaubliche erfahrung. ein rollenspiel, das dich alle grenzen sofern es berhaupt welche gibt alleine erforschen lassen kann. ein rollenspiel, das dich dazu bringt am ende mit deinen freunden darber zu sprechen, welche unglaublichen erlebnisse du gemacht hast. ich brauche nicht weiter auf alle details einzugehen. die wurden hier und auch auf zahlreichen anderen plattformen bewertet. es war mir jedoch ein groes bedrfnis einfach mal danke zu sagen. danke, dass ihr mit diesem epos vielleicht sogar eine zeitenwende in der gamingindustrie angestoen haben knntet."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"yet another boring turn based strategy game , this genre is on it's last leg and peaked 15 years ago so why is everyone hyping this up ? game is generic , bland and has one of the worst uxui's i've ever seen , the spell icons and everything looks like it was designed by a 10 year old. you just can't trust reviews anymore these days and devs are banking on boomer's nostalgia with these titles. nothing more to say about this one as it's average asf."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"since dos 1  2, larian studio is the only savior for me for funlong lasting rpgs. btw, no microtransactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i will admit, for the first few hours of bg3 i wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype. i am new to crpgs and dd, so there was a bit of a learning curve. a little over halfway through act 1 i hit level 5, and everything clicked. i am now 55 hours into the game and i'm just starting act 2. clicking on everything that's clickable and reading every book is an absolute joy, as is the combat. it may take a little getting used to if you've never played a game similar to this before, but there's no denying this is one of the best rpgs ever made. truly well done."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"amazing game, i went to the trouble of creating an account for the first time on metacritic just to rate this work of art! if the media is trying to upstage the game, then finally dear friends, we have something really good here! even if baldur won't win the goty, we know which is game of the year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i have no earthly idea what everyone sees in this game. i'm 20 hours in and besides nice voice acting and story. the game is boring to no end. it is tedious, it is slow, etc. i just am really struggling. i wish i knew what people thought was so great about this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this game is simply amazing, played it a lot in early access, reminds me of the old days, looks great, plays really well, is fun in coop. its feature complete, its not a 90 dollar game with micro transactions. its simply deserving every positivity and hype it gets."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i have played thousands of other games and loved many of them  franchises, triplea titles, unique games that left a mark on the gaming community. however, baldur's gate 3 is the first game in 15 years that i've played with that genuine urge, the desire, and the passion to explore and embrace every experience the game has to offer. i look forward to playing baldur's gate 3 in my peaceful office all day long, accepting every consequence of my actions. congratulations to larian for the beautiful scenery, the story progression lines, and the gameplay factor that allows for various character combinations and builds. if it doesn't win game of the year, it's already the game of the year in my heart even with so many positive reviews, it saddens me to see that there are hundreds of negative reviews. i believe these might be from people who didn't grasp the game's progression properly, made poor choices, failed to adapt to the mechanics and strategies of tabletop games that bg3 draws inspiration from in most aspects, and that's why they gave negative reviews. i hope this changes in the future."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,best game in this year. i have never played game like this  i want to try dnd.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is a very good game. there are many options for the development of events. perhaps even too much  the game is beautiful, the characters are interesting, the locations are good. flaws? well, the dd roleplaying system limits the imagination of the game authors"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is one of those rare games that actually deserve a 1010, we haven't seen one in awhile. a complete game, with no microtransactions, no fomo mechanics, no battle pass, bauldr's gate 3 stands on its own two legs without the need for manipulative corporate addiction tactics to keep a player base. ignore the toxic negative review bombing, any sane person loves this game. i have already played well over 230 hours, 4 different playthroughs some incomplete and loved every second of it. i play dnd 5e regularly, and this is the closest thing in the video game world to simulating what it's like. the voice acting and facial expressions are outstanding, the story is captivating. the world design is stunning, the combat is so fun and feels exactly like dnd 5e with a few quality of life changes, i'm so glad they made it turnbased unlike the previous two bauldr's gates. you just can't have dnd without turn base combat, it doesn't work! this is by far the best bauldr's gate so far and definitely the best crpg i have ever played. act 3 could do with a touch up, but knowing larian, they will go above and beyond to polish any shortcomings, which is why it won't affect my rating. pay no heed to most of the negative reviews, other than the few disappointed by the current endings of act 3 which still doesn't warrant giving it a negative rating at all. the other negative reviews are just toxic review bombers who are either insane homophobes, bots, dnd hater's or just people who want their pet video game probably zelda players to win goty. these degenerates are trying their hardest to bring down the score and defame this absolute gem . well done larian, you successfully achieved what you set out to do, polish act 3, fix the epilogue and you have made one of the best video games in history! pay attention gaming industry, be like larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"truly a masterpiece which will change all crpgs and directly rpgs in general. the story is amazing, it's graphicssound are perfect and very atmospheric. it's gameplay really resolves dnd 5e system with some tweaks in order to make it more enjoyable than the ttrpg itself. i'm pretty sure larian will get their goty with this game. really looking forward for more from this studio, which passed from an indie studio to a aaa game studio."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"not even the powers of a fettered prince orpheus could make me resist the urge to play this game. it is as close to a table top dd adventure as i have ever seen on pc. characters are fleshed out and eviscerated. i felt that i could play f, carry, kill with everything clickable. the dialogue options are plentiful without being overwhelming. the combat variety is excellent, ranging from peckerengorging slaughterfests to cheekclenchingsingleremainingturn escapes. graphics are great for the most part with some jank here and there. the continuity with bg1  bg2 is logical without being overarching. i would have paid significantly more than i did for this game. thanks for the memories larian studios. you have filled up and fortified my faith in video game developers. the film and television industry should be taking notes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"a great deep dive in dnd experience. every piece of the game is a handcrafted to make your choices relevant. its probably the most ambicious rpg game that i ever played, ando certainly creates a new paradigma for the default experience of the genre in the aaa segment."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"perfect, a real interactive movie, game, litterature, it's intelligent, a masterpiece, your choices really change the game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,thoroughly blown away by this game. haven't had a gaming experience like this in a long time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"first review on metacritic, though i have used it for a long time! just thought i might pop my ten out of ten here because bg3 deserves it. i played the og baldur's gate and bg2 when i was a child. while i never beat it, i have fond memories of reading books, flinging spells, and talking to the npcs when i was 9 or 10 years old. when i heard bg3 was coming out i was very excited, and bought early access immediately. i played about 40 hours of early access when it was first released, and back then larian had made bg3 as an amalgamation of their previous title divinity original sin 2 and the dd 5e core mechanics. because of this, i was worried about larian's handling of the game. while i enjoyed the story and interactions available, this combination of two disparate systems was not what i wanted out of a baldur's gate game. i went on the forums and posted a nice feedback post, and waited patiently for a few years. in the intervening time i played a lot of video games, moved, lived life and mostly forgot about bg3 but for the occasional update about an added class, or a bug fix that i might skim over. now, about three years after early access, i get to have my hands on the full game. starting with the bad, there are a few bugs here and there. sometimes the ui borks and you have to reload a save, and sometimes the cameras in dialogue aim in weird ways or are covered by the odd piece of environment you moved during battle. every once in a while the pathing can get you killed, or because the screen is full of fire and explosions you might accidentally stunning strike your own rogue. but that's about it. when it comes to the good of the game it is hard to summarize so i will just talk a little about the things that stand out to me the most, the first being the story. baldur's gate and indeed dd has, for me since i played as a little boy, always been about the characters and the story. when i was the spawn of bhaal in the old games and had to overcome that. when the characters really wanted my help with their problems and i disappointed them if i failed to act. that stuck with me. heck i would say it even taught me how to be a better friend as i grew up. bg3 continues this tradition, and expands upon it with all of the complexity that a more modern game can provide. i wont do any spoilers but, suffice it to say i am enchanted by the characters, and really feel the beats when they succeed or fail. i want to help the people i like, and i want to shatter the people that would stop me from doing so. not many games give you that feeling of personal responsibility for your story and the stories of your companions, but bg3 does. the second thing i will mention is the systems. while there could be some quality of life changes regarding some oversites in ui, the systems for combat are great. as i said before, i had written a forum post when i first played early access about my skepticism of its similarity to divinity, but they had taken the advice of me and every other fan of dd, changed it to what we wanted, and made no fuss about it. the results? i feel like i am playing a masterfully homebrewed campaign of dd 5e, to the point where i certainly have an advantage over a new player, knowing beforehand what a bonus action, a spell slot, and what gith are. it made me wary even that the systems could be a little too complex for a casual, none rpg player to enjoy. but as i watched people play on twitch, i can see that the fun of the combat and its ease of use outweigh the sometimes cumbersome system knowledge it might take to understand precisely what is going on when you, say, use smite as a bonus action in order to make your attack deal 2d6 more radiant damage to any enemy, multiplied by its resistances, and since you have a cool item, healing you in the process for 2d4. the game makes it understandable through good audio ques, visual design, and ui design. making rpgs approachable to the masses has long been one of the big barriers to more people playing, and larian seems to have done it by simply trusting that players are smart enough to get it. how simple, and yet effective. to bring this big old post to the end, it is no understatement for me to say that baldur's gate 3 has, in many ways, revitalized my faith in the games industry. in the past few years i have felt, like many, that the only way to get something unique and beautiful in a game is to find it in indie developers. whether it be a system, a story, an art style or some mix of all of those, more and more it feels hard to find a big budget game that evokes the sense of awe and wonder that those intimate studios seem to capture. larian, though, has proved that it is not impossible for a big team to make something wonderful, heartwarming, heart wrenching, and built from the bottom up with love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i really loved bg1 and 2. possibly the best rpgs of all time, certainly it is for me. this makes my review slanted and i unashamedly compare these games because they are the same name, world and intent. it is apples with apples and bg3 are bad apples. game mechanics i find them clunky as well as overly complex. too much going on with not enough adaptability in combat. weird state to achieve. it is outrageously woke. i hate how over representation of minority groups as a vulgar way of enforcing social compliance occurs everywhere. it is here and it's heavy. it damages the game because to be honest, the socio political agenda is regularly evident and it appears to worship wokeness, a lot. the media beat up for example about the bestiality in one of the media release videos was terrible. so gay scene, male protagonist and male druid thing get graphically on only for the druid to get so excited he turns into an animal and they keep going at it. this is not love, it is perverse and sick. okay so you don't have to play the game that way but there are plenty of other woke captures, it's unavoidable and regular. it is not a baldur's gate game. it plays like previous games the developer has made. graphics are similar, combat is almost identical and the attempt at quirky interaction is the same. it is a copy paste onto dd background with familiar and loved names. this is the biggest let down. i could write a lot more but won't. these are the issues that kill the game and although i'm pleased everyone who does like it hasn't wasted their money, i do however think that the behaviour you walk past is the behaviour you accept and then becomes the behaviour you expect. the modern gaming industry, like films and soon music is a self licking ice cream where you, the user, are being changed into exactly what they want, a morally ambiguous and brainwashed consumer. demand better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i thought i was going to really like it which i did to an extent, but it wasn't the best out there like many people think it is. bg3 isn't bad at all by any means, but i was kinda let down by it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"baldur's gate is one of the best games i've had the privilege to play, this game in my opinion deserves to win game of the year. hope to see more games with that amount."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"after spending 200 hours from early launch all the way through to the end of the game after release, i can hands down say this is the greatest rpg ever created. if anybody feels differently it is because they do not enjoy the mechanics of dd. the character customizationcreation is incredible. the story is engaging and well written. the mechanics are exactly what you would expect from a dd game. this is one of the few games that will reach a 1010 and i'm happy that i was able to play it in my lifetime. congratulations to larian studios you deserve all the love you get. edit it is is unacceptable that some endings go to black screen with decision made and consequences experienced.. i will keep the 1010 for my first playthrough however that ending was absolutely, indescribably terrible for my second. 610 4 points lost on bad ending."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"my first ever interaction with dnd and this game might just be every rpg fans dream game, now i won't come here and call it the perfect game but it's as close as it gets to the perfect role playing experience definitely a recommend"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the people who are giving this a 0 or really anything less than a 9 or 1010 are just being deliberately obtuse. anyone who actually plays this game would instantly see the quality that is there.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,a beautifully crafted game that has given me zero issues over many hours. the spirit of the studio behind this is really to be admired.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,please make me stop playing.... i can't stop  not much more to be said... it's simply that good
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"lots of great content, art, enemy variety, environments etc. but the combat is slow and boring"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i've got about 60 hours into the game. at this point it's become a breath of fresh air. the story from all aspects seems gripping and compelling. gameplay is challenging and fun. no shop aka microtransactions. looking forward to sinking in a few hundred more hours. game deserves all the praise its received.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,an amazing game that actually took the time to make the world feel expansive and lived in. the first act stands on its own two feet with barely a hint of anything from prior baldur's gate titles. every character has a great story to experience and each one is worth getting invested in. this game was a labor of love and you can feel that with conversation. decisions have weight and you'll find yourself playing multiple times to find out what happens down the path you didn't take. in one of the most competitive years for goty this one stands above the rest.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the game itself is an easy 8 or 910. it is a 1010 product for the entirety of the process and ethos around it. studios like larian should be held up high as the standard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"amazing game, all aspects of game are just amazing !!! larian studios i must admit i was very skeptical about you guys bringing the most favorite game to me of all time back into our lives bg 1  bg 2, and i must admit you surpassed my every expectation. u did amazing job on atmosphere, music and story. its just luring you in always wanting more. i finished my first playthrough and immediately started a new game, this has not happened to me in 23 years. u must make icewind dale !  i know now there is a studio out there with love and passion for games of this type, and this should definitely be the new standard. never given a single review  my whole life, but u guys deserve it !!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"its a great game, thats for sure. but as an german gamer it is hard to understand why there is only english. i had to read the subtiles all the time at the bottom of the monitor. make it hard to have fun with this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"overrated. too much like other larian studio games have to kill everything, collect everything, talk to everything just to progress."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece , great respect to larian for a job well done. great story and interaction with the characters and the world. after 80 hours of playing there is nothing to complain about, everything as it should be. i highly recommend and will vote for game of the year for sure."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,just the fact that other developers are uncomfortable with the game says a lot. thanks larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"every few years is a game that completely captures me, and this is the first one in quite some time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,great and compelling narrative and gameplay! there is nothing more you could ask for in a game. this game is as addictive as you're used too from the other games from larian studios. normally i don't write reviews but for this game i happily make an exception. hands down best game of this decade!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"el mejor rpg con reglas de dd desde el neverwinter nights de bioware, larian studios ha demostrado con creces que merece tener la franquicia de reinos olvidados."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"if you like the genre it's a masterpiece, but you must really like it, because it's very slow. from my point of view it was 74 hours well spent"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i started playing crpgs in the mid 80s during the ultima era then the mightmagics, ssi gold box series and many many others, including the infinity engine ones. baldur's gate 3 brings the imagination and creativity of the good old days, of course updated for an entirely new generation. a spectacular outcome for an outstanding software house. kudos to you, larian."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,legit one of the best rpgs ive played. the amount of freedom in what you can do is great and the story is a fun classic style dnd and baldurs gate tale
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"never played anything like this before. never been near to the dd's world, but bg3 still captured me and let me fell in love with him after just few minutes. must play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"great game. not perfect at release, some bugs and little plotholes, but it's a far cry from any other rpg i have played in the last 10 years. every decision is yours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"el verdadero goty del ao. un juego solido, con una narrativa exquisita, personajes bien construidos, un sistema de combate pulido, banda sonora de lujo y un diseo creativo a la altura de los tiempos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"what i like about this game is that there's dozen of way to complete a quest. there's one early boss that you can easily shoot out a bridge support underneath him and kill him immediately with 100 success rate, except you get none of his sweet loot. in the first act you need to take a room full of baddies where the everyone will agro against you, so i climbed into the rafters and had each of my characters drop a barrels of oil and smokepowder into the torches below... blowing everyone up before they can fight back. for another fight i chose to snipe at enemies with my thief's bow and quickly go into sneak mode. when the they come looking for me, i stab them in the back from the shadows. not to mention you can talk your way out of most fights. this is so much fun and more varied than games like divinity 2 where every fight feels like a prolonged mini boss fight. larian also loves their environmental effects like fire, ice, water, etc but thankfully they have toned that down a lot since d2. there are also plenty of puzzles that are fun, varied and interesting and nearly all of them aren't essential to the main story so you can totally skip them if that's not your thing. there were a ton of bugs and crashes on the first couple days of playing but larian squashed most of them quick. there's still some graphical quirks and ui annoyances like i need to click on a character portrait multiple times to be successful, but i have no doubt the devs will get to them in time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"150 horas de juego. es una maldita obra maestra, para m el goty de este ao. la libertad creativa que han tenido de hacer este videojuego ha sido tremenda. los personajes, la libertad que se dan como jugadorjugadora. la cantidad de horas que te da el juego de contenido. la cantidad de cosas que puedes hacer, las variaciones de finales y sobretodo de partidas. el simple hecho que tu amigo pueda tener una partida completamente distinta a la tuya. demuestra lo que es este juegazo. no me canso de jugarlo, es simplemente brutal. y a pesar de todas las horas. me quedo vaco, pero por qu? por qu no siento que haya explorado todo el juego. este juego debe de tener muchos cientos de horas de contenido. la historia a pesar de ser lo importante, queda a segundo plano con su mundo hecho con cario notable. terminas haciendo la trama principal y la dejas a segundo plano haciendo secundarias del videojuego. demuestra la calidad del producto. la banda sonora es extremadamente buena y se nota que le dieron mucho mimo al ponerla en el juego, me recuerda a death stranding en ese aspecto, siempre cuadra cuando debe la msica. recomiendo comprar este juego encarecidamente. fanboys de zelda, alejaos de metacritic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"bastante liberdade para escolhas, combate com bastante opes de abordagem e personagens interessantes. gostaria de expanses iguais as de neverwinter nights"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"everyone writes about the pros and praises, after playing the game for a couple of hours. i went through the game completely and i will say everything honestly. 1 at the end the game is full of bugs, scripts break, quests break. this is a scam. 2 the characters are  bisexual animals. 3 party management and inventory is disgusting. 4 level platforming is disgusting. 5 solid guts as a design level. 6 the most casual character progression in total, 12 levels, no prestige classes,  multiclasses. 7 loot is all  the game goes almost with starting equipment. everything that belongs on the game gives a bust. well, and a bunch of annoying little things. like a bunch of traps on which you already clog and run through them to the breach, because you start to get angry when you shoot each trap through a cube."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"not the best baldur's i miss the dark side from the serie, but an amazing rpg! goty of the year surely"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,best game ever made. the other game developers can now learn with larian studios how to make a game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"it's the most complete game i've ever played in my life, with already 28 hours played i'm still in the first act because no matter where you go there's always something to do, quests, encounters with new characters or secret bosses, secret loot or entire new areas with lots of the previous ones and you feel how every desicion you make is premeditated and has a weight in the history. for me baldurs gate 3 deserves more the goty than any of the previous games who have earned it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"baldur's gate 3 is an amazing example of what video game studios should try to achieve. great launch, amazing voice acting, superb storytelling, character development, world building, no microtransactions shoved down your throat and just a company that overall cares and listens to its customers. larian took their time and created a masterpiece unlike other companies who release halfbaked products. this game takes me back to my childhood when i used to play neverwinter nights. this has easily become one of my favourite games. hats off to you larian, you guys have really outdone yourselves and you truly deserve to win goty!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is my first baldur's gate game. i also did not like dnd growing up. i tried once in high school and got frustrated in the first room not knowing what i was supposed to do and never tried again. i saw the bear scene on tik tok and had to get this game. i'm obsessed. i'm over 100 hours in with two characters and neither is even remotely close to beating it. there is just so much to do, so many options, so many ways the story could unfold, so many amazing characters and beautiful sets. it doesn't feel repetitive even when i'm doing the exact same quest again because i'm doing it a different way. after the massive disappointment of diablo 4 i definitely needed this."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,absolutely amazing game that should be a foundational starting point for other aaa games going forward. it is so clear that larian spent their time crafting something they really care about with baldur's gate 3 rather than churning something out for an easy buck.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"larian studios marked a new high in the gaming industry with this amazing game. i played open beta and knew the moment i played it its going to be amazing. its a turn based game that allows for hundreds of different outcomes during your play through. no in game shop! no spending extra money, which is unheard of in todays new standards . im already maybe 70 hours into the game and i just got to the new area. the game is well worth it. this company deserves our money."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is the best game ever released in almost a decade. this sets a new standard for rpgs in general, i do not care how developers are stating it is unfair. good job larian, you made me fall in love with rpgs again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the only thing i can compare it to is dragon age origins. it is the best rpg to be created in over a decade. it has everything you want and everything you didn't even know you wanted. i've excitedly restarted playing several times just to try different types of characters. uninstall all the other garbage in your library and get this game and be happy for a change. good hunting!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"best game of 2023 hands down, and i dont think any other title can beat it. fantastic work from the team, may they have the will and energy to continue their work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i had a lot of fun running a multiplayer session of bg3 with 2 friends. probably the best replication of dd and a very well made narrative on top. shining moments in our campaign were pushing a goblin of the roof to finish an intense combat where they had the high ground the whole fight. then another moment later where my character was knocked out on the other side of a chasm, but my friend used an explosion which launched my body across to where they were so i could be picked up. it has been a laugh and i'm always excited for when we can all get online together to finish our campaign."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,crazy good game that has exceeded my expectations. only issue i have is that the companions arent very immersive and i wish magic loot was rarer and more powerfull. still a ten though.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is the game that restored my faith in the industry. larian knocked it out of the park, and this truly feels like a game that was created by gamers for gamers. baldur's gate 3 is one of the only games ive purchased in the last five or so years that i can honestly say was 100 worth the price. with the number of times that studios and publishers have scorned their player bases in the past fiveodd years, larian has proven once again that they are worthy of their community's trust. my personal goty, even if it doesnt win. i think baldurs gate 3 could even be called the game of the decade. a truly onceinalifetime experience. pros replayability my main concern with a story game was the replay value compared to the cost. with a wide array of classesraces to choose from when creating a custom character as well as 7 origin characters to explore, you can have drastically different experiences between campaigns. not only can every single combat encounter play out incredibly differently based on the party compositionclass youve chosen for a campaign, but the choices you make while interacting with the world, the characters, and the storylines all can influence your experience. every time i start a new campaign, it feels like playing an entirely new game within the same world. immersion the graphics and the voice acting are absolutely superb and truly help you feel immersed in the world. the soundtrack adds ambiance and depth without being overpowering or seeming artificial. from bustling cities to beautiful forests and spooky dungeons, you truly feel like youve stepped out of this world and into an entirely new realm full of places to explore and secrets to uncover. a refreshing escape from the stressors of modernday life.  compelling characters. the companions are wellfleshed out and offer their own interesting stories and quests, as well as offering commentary, advice, and their own unique benefits while traveling around the world. they even chat with one another while youre exploring the world, which i absolutely adore. the care they put into the companions and even just the npcs that you find while exploring is absolutely immaculate. combat the three difficulty levels provide a nice range of options for players of all sorts. explorer mode offers lower stakes but still challenging combat and is comparable to story mode on other titles. tactician mode creates incredibly challenging, highstakes combat encounters. balanced is a perfect blend of the two. regardless of which difficulty level you choose, the way in which you approach combat in this game is limited only by your own creativity. there are nearly infinite combinations of spells, attacks, and items that you can use to drastically change how you approach a fight on any character you choose. personally, i am a huge fan of the turnbased combat system that bg3 utilizes, though that may not be the case for everyone. no microtransactions, no seasonal battle passes, no hidden fees. just a phenomenal, complete game that offers hundreds if not thousands of hours of content! can be played offline in single player multiplayer does require an internet connection, but singleplayer can be played without. neutrals inventory management i am a loot gremlin, i will pick up everything that isn't nailed down. if you are similar, know that inventory management can be a bit of a struggle depending on your class much more challenging on a gnome sorcerer than a humanhalforc barbarian for example. your camp chest seems to be limitless storage though, so that helps since vendors have limited fundsstock at any given time! movementcamera controls they take some getting used to. familiarizing myself with the key binds and the controls themselves helped immensely. this is neutral for me, rather than a negative, because bg3 does not make me simulationmotion sick like other games with similar controls do! cons intermittent lag sometimes ill encounter a little bit of lag. its normally if ive been to a certain area of the map and always stops upon restarting the game after leaving that one area. i dont find it to be a huge issue, but it could be more annoying for others."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"a stunning game and one that i really shouldn't like. as someone who immediately steers clear of turn based combat and has never been able to get on with point and click style movement systems, i shouldn't enjoy exploring or combat.... but i really, really do. being turn based works so well and because there are so many decisions and you aren't flicking through a menu, it feels a little more natural? organic? i'd like it to how ff7 remake technically had turn based combat but it didn't feel like a traditional turn based system. i also don't like heavily narrative driven or dialogue heavy games but pretty much everything is voice acted and the vas do a fantastic job. some top, top talent involved and they really do bring the characters to life. the detail, characters, writing, sheer number of things to do, find, discover and explore is incredible. i tend to eye roll at games saying choices have consequences but i'm running two main save files currently and honestly, both feel like quite different stories and games. pretty much everything in game has multiple ways of tackling the problem. do you kill everyone? talk your way through? convince others to go and attack? slip poison into a barrel of ale? sneak through? convince them to actually fight on your behalf? there are so many spells, dialogue options and ways to go about things that if you think outside the box and get creative then you can come up with some hilarious andor genius ways of getting round a fight or area. it won't be for absolutely everyone but i would encourage people who aren't traditionally into crpgs or turn based systems to at least check it out, watch some videos etc because i think a lot of people who think they wouldn't like the game would actually love it. i accept that there will be people who genuinely don't like it but a little bit like how elden ring and game of thrones were enhkhed by people who aren't traditionally into those genres or fantasy etc, i'm positive that there will be a lot of players who, like me, initlaly write it off but after trying it just fall in love with it. i've now got over 400 hours in the full game and early access and know i'll comfortably exceed 1000. with larian confirming mod support, modders will likely do their thing and keep this playable for a decade or more. i'm confident in saying that this will ultimately go down as my favourite single player offline game of all time. it's genuinely superb."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"the experience of rolling dice in this work is excellent, not just a simple group running ceremony, but perfectly presents this unique game behavior in the form of video games, this sense of participation, mystery and uncertainty , all built in the vast and fascinating world of baldur's gate 3. larian used their persistence to tell us once again that crpg is still charming, and what is the true depth and fun of emergent interaction. in my opinion, the massive content and mature design techniques are not the most prominent features of this work. the greatness of crpg lies in the accumulation and gradual changes step by step, the more ingenious network narrative, and the fighting fun that only increases and does not decrease. it is difficult to guess the development of the world, what kind of identity to participate in, and what kind of world belongs to you, this is what our ideal fantasy world looks like."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,truly a gem hidden amongside all the crap in this corporate moneyhungry industry.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"finally a game that is 1. not flooded by micro transactions 2. not flooded by bugs 3. not in beta test phase 4. not affected by that absurd disease of paid seasonaltemporary battle passes 5. not created by developers who want us to believe that their choices are made to improve playability, who know they are lying because they know that by doing so they are destroying fun and instead trying to create an addictive mechanism 6. finally not created by companies that aim only at the billiondollar budget and that leverage the playing addiction i have to unlock the skin to be more cooler than everyone else, i have to unlock the weapon to be stronger than others instead of creating that healthy fun, maybe to share with friends. isn't that the real purpose of playing games, which is to have fun? yes! and this creation can be finally called game. thanks larian! loved your games but this one... is a masterpiece. absolutely 1010, only because i can't give more. spoiler alert thanks also to the other big old studios, who are showing us how not to create real games made to entertain, showing us their real goal, which is  all our money who said biz... oh, and to those who say it's not a goty title, to those who say it's not a standard hey, you are talking  wash your mouth first. the other devs are just afraid of getting wiped out by a market made of players asking to go back to the good standards of 1520 years ago, when a published game was finished and you didn't have to pay 11euro more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"best rpg ever. i like zelda, poe, diablo... but this game is another level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,never even imagined i would like a game like this. i downloaded it just because of the hype et now i can't stop playing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i have created an account, just for this review.... i have played all rpgs out there, and so far bg3 is the best, tyranny, pillars of eternity, witcher, or skyrim are all great games, but bg is beyond compare, nextgen truly shines here, the decision that the player makes have a real impact, which can be felt and seen. the voice acting really is amazing, and the narration pulls me in even more. also considering that larian is not your typical aaa with a limitless budget. but a humble team of passionate gamers. the effort spent on this game is really stellar, and it pays off and is felt and seen throughout the game. the downsides are, turnbased combat is not everyone's cup of tea, it feels really good though imho. inventory management can be tedious, or it is just me, since i pick up every junk there is. 1010 my favorite game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"another edit when i said baldurs gate 3 won't be the game of the year, i was wrongi like being proved wrong, this game at the moment is my goty. after 70hrs i'm on second playthrough. i've been playing starfield and yeah it doesn't compete, nothing that came out this year competes with this game. larian studios, you have my vote. quick edit i didn't expect to come back here and bump up the score yet again, this is a 910 game, this game keeps on surprising me with new stuff that i didn't even know was in there, i realised this game has splitscreen, i not only that, i'm still in the first area i'm in the underdark, discovering new things. i'm making sure i get through all the content. first impression below this is my first baldurs gate game, usually, i'm not excited about turnedbased rpgstyled games, but this is quality. i'm sure the hype around this game made a lot of gamers look into it considering how good the graphics and cutscenes look, the dialogue options, and the characters. now i'm going to say it... a lot of this game will be spending a lot of time in combat. i understand that it's the style of the game, but really what makes it bad for me is that i've played games like god of war where the gameplay is more engaging. in here it's sit down and try and play chess with the enemies. besides the combat, i have to say that in no game i've ever played recently has the world been this engaging since the days of skyrim and fallout 4. everything from collecting loot to finding weird characters and events is really good. now the reviews that are giving a 910, or 1010, i get where you come from, i understand the type of games you like and enjoy dunking hours into. i'm going to keep putting hours into this game because i'm invested in the world and the opportunities it offers. but, i cannot say it's perfect considering the vast variations of consumers, modern gaming, and well just the technology available to make this game an experience for all to play. it is in no way a perfect game. this is another elden ring situation, where gamers not familiar with the type of game it is, are relying on the game to entertain them understandable, instead of finding stuff in the game that will entertain them. what i expected from this game is a hybrid turnedbased game, kind of like dragon age inquisition. this is just pure turnedbased. now you can play this with the controller, but i found that combat is much faster with the keyboard. so far, the performance of the game is good, no crashes, no bugs, just a very clean game. now let me lay it down for you. graphics 910, that's spicy graphics, some may say it's bad actually, but it's really good. the details of the models for a turnedbased game, and the environments are nice, it's just missing something...atmosphere. characters 810, nice characters, some of them are stupid but i guess that's the point. combat 410, i'm not forgiving, but i dislike turnedbased, especially when you lose because the enemies start to dump damage like it's taco tuesday. story 710, i'm digging the story, you can get a little lost at times, but if you just wander around you'll get to where you need to be. features 710, it has good features but, i wish i could look up i know a stupid thing to say, but when you have a pretty environment you want to look at it from all angles, i wish the camera was more adjustable. scummyness 210, deluxe edition? just sell your game, and we will buy it, but at least this game doesn't have any mt, no packs, no time savers. this isn't something unique to me, this is the bare minimum. ok, i may not update this review again, since this is going to be a long game, but i think an 810 is tolerable for this one. should you check out this game and pay the price? if you like turnedbased, this is a good fit for you, if you're new to turnbased, you may not like this, but if you are willing and open to trying one, this is probably the most quality one i've seen. look i'm not a hardcore fan, there are probably a lot of fans out there not impressed at all, i don't know much, but i am a game dev, so i understand the intricacies of this game. it's simple and thank god for that. it has a good enough constant game loop and flow, to keep me invested. so overall good job, i don't expect this to win goty this year as there is nothing groundbreaking in this game. i predict spiderman 2, hogwarts legacy, starfield, or armored core 6 to win. it's a hard pick. i think it might be starfield if bethesda pulls it offnope, if not spiderman 2. balders gate 3 will give the industry a run for its money thoughthey will win. finally, i hope larian studios, moves past the old style and starts innovating. this game in my eyes could have been more epic, combat wise, you guys nailed cutscenes and characters, and now just nailed an interesting and engaging combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"amazing game, i played bg1 on windows 95 from a big 5 disc foldout book and then bg2 on windows 98  me back in the day. i played icewind dale 1 and 2 and neverwinter nights, so i know the universe this is set in and seeing the returning characters and little easter eggs and nods to the old games is fantastic. turn based combat takes a big getting used to but is enjoyable, the companion character interaction is great. i've been playing wow, diablo 234, ffxiv, poe, gta 4  5 and more over the past 15 years and bg3 is hands down the best game of the past 10 years. it has the best storyline, classes feel different and give nice perks for subclasses that help you in various ways depending how you want to play, i'll definitely be doing a few different playthroughs with various classes and using different companions. i still have the bg2 cloth map and book from the box set and wish that i had bought the collectors edition preorder for bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"easily the best game ive played in the last ten years. this game has gotten me to leave the house and play dungeons and dragons with complete strangers, because i just enjoy it that much"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"this is one of my first turnbased games since ff13, which was just too slow paced for me. larian has really made something special here because it certainly keeps the pace going but the rewarding story and well written dialog, keeps bringing me back to the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the game throws me back to when i started playing games. it has been a long time since i feelt so eager to get home from work and sink some hours into this fantastic story rich and sometimes challenging game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"the amount of different stuff you can do and the diologue options, the characters and the story, no micro transactions or required internet connection. basically i like this game and am satisfied with all that it offers. i heard there were a few bugs in later acts, but i trust they will fix them soon enough , i haven't gotten far yet, so haven't seen any of the bugs people speak of, act 1 is amazing so far, and i trust the other acts will be just as good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,this is one of the best game i have ever played and it's the most refreshing experience of the last few years for me playing on pc. goty for me even if it won't win
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"1010 game, the best game ive played in this genre. crazy beautiful environment and the zoomins are gorgeous! character development is bonkers, i went from being an atheist to absolutely love shadowheart, ive converted to believe in shara. also sometimes after work when ive been surrounded by idiots in real life, i just pop off the animal speaking magic just to have a quick break or speaking with the dead, obviously ingame! also the sidestories, wtf is a main story? ive been hugging every corner, ive checked every hole, read every book and notes so far, friendly fired my character or simply missed the attack and hit next to the npc. in summary, you have to play the game! but best of all, the respecc costs 100g and not millions, no paragon board where you have to click on after the other to remove points. anyhow! larian made it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,best main story best side qeusts best soundtrack best gameplay good graphics this game is legendary
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"best rpg of my life. deeply emotional, deeply tactical. game of the year for me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,absolutely amazing to finally see a fully developed a game. have been enjoying literally every second of it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"absolutely riveting, will reconsider my review after i've 100 completed the game but wow"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"the best rpg i've played in decades! a pinnacle of gaming that everyone should try out! the music, the atmosphere, the narrative, the gameplay, the combat and so on are so beautifully crafted that it's leaving me wondering what happens next every time i stop playing it for the day!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i never liked turnbased games or this type until i decided to try bg3... and here i am with 48 hours of play plus the ones i need. simply a work of art
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"the reviews made it look like the game is a second coming of jesus, but it's just an ordinary crpg, with cluttered inventory, limited character customization and poor writing. it feels like the game was made by a bunch of horny 14yearolds. the only thing it has going is great graphics for crpgs and cut scenes. everything else is mediocre. people should play pillars of eternity if they want to see a crpg with good writing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,finally an old school rpg without this liveservice  larian proved that devs still have passion and love to make games. i missed that in the last 10 years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i have played so many games in my life, and this is the most unique and outstandig game. i am so impressed. i was looting forward to d4, and even though i really like d4, i was ripped from the game and dedicated all my 'gamingtime' to this game. even the replayability is amazing, hands down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the best game i played these recent times. finished product, no  denuvo, no microtransactions. amazing story, characters, satisfying gameplay. made for mature, intelligent audience. i can't remember last time i felt this satisfied with a purchase."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i can't remember the last time i've had so much fun in a game.. this is my goty worth every penny!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"as a 36 years old gamer, i can say this is the best game i have ever played in my life! the level of deepness of the game and its characters its something unbelievable  chapeau to larian studios !"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"best game i've played in years. choices you make may come to haunt or reward you later on and there are multiple ways to solve different situations. it all depends of your character and your team. different outcomes are all viable and failure in conversations or in any checks isn't an end usually, but may lead in to much more interesting results. combat is deep and challenging. and if you don't want to bang your head on the wall with difficult fights, lower difficulty. incredible game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"ive been gaming for over 20 years and ive never left a review before, but bg3 is such a once in a generation masterpiece that i felt compelled to add to the chorus of praise. the scope is mindblowing  each act is massive yet has a distinct feel and after nearly 100hrs i never got bored of exploring. the combat is intricate and there are so many ways to approach situations  i didnt think i would spend so much time considering positioning and trying to get an advantage over enemies and trying new tactics just to see what would happen, as opposed to simply spamming the same spells and actions every encounter. each encounter was just different enough for what came before to feel fresh. the multitude of stories are engaging and its impressive how many permutations there are for some threads. i often went back to previous saves to make a different choice so i could see how to affects subsequent encounters. theres a boss battle in act 2 that plays out so differently based on some choices you make in the lead up. i cant wait to play the game again with a different character and party and approach, and see how the story warps around a different set of decisions. this is really a masterclass in video games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"only game i would give a 10 to in the last 13 years. even then, fallout nv doesn't come close in terms of polish or content. the game is worth every penny and my only issue is i know it will be a long time before any game is comparable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the best rpg i ever played in my entire life, by far! the care and attention larian gave to this project is remarkable, when i talk to my friends about our progression, sometimes we try to do the same thing but the path we took, give us a complete different experience in the process. also larian emulated perfectly dnd 5e, they made some changes, yeah of course, but this changes made it even better!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"pessoal vindo aqui dando 0 s para sabotar o jogo porque esto com raivinha, bando de fracassados. o jogo  maravilhoso, histria pica, grficos excelentes, gameplay excelente, o melhor jogo de turno que j joguei, pode no levar o goty mas  goty para mim, espero que venham muito mais jogos nesse estilo daqui pra frente, pessoal que reclama que tem muito dilogo que o combate demora, que o jogo tem muita histria, so todos um bando de sem crebro que aparentemente no entendem o que  um crpg, sim rpg o principal  a histria, dilogos fazem parte caso no saibam, ainda mais um baseado em dd. caso no tenham percebido esse tipo de jogo no  para seu bico, bando de nutellas d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"tldr  this is the best game i've ever played. i will be putting thousands of hours into this in the coming months and years. i never had this much fun in a game. the only thing comparable would be the wonder of playing computer games as a kid  this game captures the magic that makes this hobby so rewarding to pursue. while there are a few minor bugs in the first 20 hours of the game, becoming a bit more frequent toward the end, larian studios has already patched many of these bugs hotfixes, with more to come. there is only one problem with this game i will always think of the joy i had in baldur's gate 3 whenever i play the disappointing titles of other aaa companies. the bar has been set."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game is very overhyped. bad optimization, mediocre gameplay. look like this is still beta version."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,melhor jogo que j joguei na vida!! tem que levar o melhor jogo do ano. larian de parabns!! simplesmente incrvel!! jogo que rpg e simplesmente me sinto totalmente imerso nesse jogo maravilhoso.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"uau, eu simplesmente no consigo conter minha empolgao quando se trata desse rpg! sabe, o que mais me cativou foi a forma como ele me levou para um mundo totalmente novo, cheio de mistrios e possibilidades infinitas. eu amei a liberdade de criar meu prprio personagem e decidir seu destino ao longo da trama.  como se eu estivesse vivendo dentro de um livro pico de fantasia, onde cada deciso que tomo afeta diretamente o que acontece em seguida. e as reviravoltas na histria? absolutamente brilhantes! mal posso esperar para passar mais horas explorando esse universo rico e mergulhando nas aventuras que ele tem a oferecer. para mim, esse rpg  uma verdadeira obraprima que equilibra perfeitamente a imerso, a estratgia e a narrativa."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"top 3 mejores juegos que he jugado en toda mi vida. haca aos y aos que un juego no consegua que estuviese as de enganchado. tengo ilusin por jugarlo, por descubrirlo e incluso por fallar en l. no me importa, porque creo que fallar y aprender es parte del camino. han hecho un juego excepcional y tengo una suerte enorme de haber podido contribuir econmicamente. gracias larian studios por esta maravilla."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"it is a monumental and profoundly epic release in scope, scale, and application. undoubtedly, larian is devoted to, dedicated to, and committed to its player base, and that is the company's beating heart."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"melhor jogo da dcada at o presente momento, histria, escolhas, personagens, mecnicas e imerso praticamente impecveis, tudo em bg3 parece orgnico e feito com esmero e muito amor pela larian studios, feito de f para f! definitivamente o melhor jogo de dd desde o prprio tabletop com os amigos, pode ser que n seja o goty do ano como em 2018 foi roubado do rdr2 pela mdia sonysta, mas ser sempre o goty do povo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"es un video juego con una base slida, sus personajes son increbles, cada uno escritos majestuosamente, el juego tiene una diversidad de matices en la toma de decisiones que puede sorprender con cambios de giro dramticos quiero felicitar al larian studios por traernos una joya con la cual tendremos miles de horas de pura entretencin se merecen un 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,we hope that this masterpiece will inspire other software houses that only know how to think about monetization
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"most people giving reviews to this game have never actually played it all the way through or are paid advertisers. this game spent more on marketing then it did for development and the heavy astroturfing of sites like this shows. how is it so highly rated? most have just come along and gave it a 1010 due to hype, similar to how they did elden ring before getting past the first zone the game suffers hard in the 3rd act which is where it falls apart and the devs knew 75 of the playerbase would never reach it. games like this and diablo 4 are great reasons to pirate before you buy it or wait for it to go on sale for 10 once the patch's fixed it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,excellent game. first crpg for me. but absolutely love it. i have already sunk dozens of hours in and haven't even cleared the first act.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,perfeito!!!! o melhor jogo ja feito! perfect!!! eu amei todo o cuidado e qualidade do jogo!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"a perfect game! a turnbased game that makes any player love it. i sincerely believe that every game should have the same respect for the customer, every detail of the game shows the love of the developers. who would have thought that a turnbased game would take me back to my childhood. a simply perfect game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"after around 90 hours playing and completing all three acts, i have a few observations. act 1 equals act 2 and 3 combined in length, with act 2 being the shortest but strongest due to introducing the main antagonists. however, a major issue i have is the lack of proper setup for these main villains. the writing is inconsistent, resulting in some scenes being engaging while others fall flat. each companion possesses unique traits, but these often negate each other's uniqueness, making none truly stand out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"melhor jogo de rpg ocidental por turnos desde o divinity 2. a larian est se tornando soberana nesse gnero. o jogo  to bom e fluido, que nem percebo o tempo passar. grande histria, personagens cativantes e o sistema de combate muito fludo, para um jogo por turnos. pessoal que est criticando o jogo, com notas 0, simplesmente no jogou e est somente tentando baixar o score. precisam pagar mais boletos, para desenvolver carter."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"great graphics, the best i have seen in a game like this , landscape and characters design are good but what killed it for me is the amount of talking in this game , i know rpg games have a lot of talking but this game takes it to another level but after some time it makes me feel tired, sometimes i dont even care what the characters are saying anymore, i just want to skip every conversation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i havent been this exicited about a game since at least the origianl breath of the wild and maybe not even then. i think this is the most i have enjoyed a game since college 20 years ago. it helps that i am exactly the target audience prefering my games turn based and being an avid dnd fan but i know that others who dont share those traits are loving this game too.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"absolutely amazing experience, playing through the whole game i felt incredibly satisfied. i'm now on my second playthrough and the amount of impact that for example different dialouge options can do for the rest of your playthrough makes this game have very high amount of replayability."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,allways look to game have good story like dragon age origin and gameplay like baldur's gate 2 and this game perfect fit for me. best game of the year !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,masterpiece. a class on gender and a class for the whole industry in different ways.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"baldur's gate 3 gave me back the enjoyment and satisfaction of playing a game, after so many rushedunpolished or just bad games over last decade. it is a shining gem  a must play if u will."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"thanks, larian, for this masterpiece. best modern attempt on implementing add as a computer game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the best i've ever played. the crosssave function is a mess but the rest of the game, stunning."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"baldurs gate 3 is the best rpg of the last 20 years larian sets an example of how to listen to your users with the tremendous campaign he did in early access, and i'm sure it enters the top 10 of the best games of all time easy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,best game i've played my entire life. baldur's gate ii was a masterpiece. divinity original sin ii was insanity good. two combined  perfection good time to be alive.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game feels like the true successor to dragon age origins and baldur's gate 2 at the same time. it keeps the same vibe those old bioware games achieved, and is a must buy for every rpg fan. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"este jogo  top demais, bonito, gameplay excelente, histria top. que venham mais desses!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the game is amazing, definitely worth playing for hour and hours! definitely game of the year!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,meu jogo preferido de toda a vida e ainda nao sai do ato1 !!! de tanto testar e retestar classes e combinaes. amei s2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"como jugador de dnd, realmente tema que lo echaran a perder, pero el juego es tan genial, a pesar de que las reglas del juego son un 90 iguales a las del juego de mesa, esta tan automtico y optimizado que el gameplay no es para nada tedioso y ayuda muchsimo que el diseo de la historia, personajes y entorno es superinteresante. podra seguir con los detalles de por qu este juego es tan bueno, pero  horas, as que lo resumir con mi calificacin de 9 , no le doy un 10, porque la perfeccin no existe, pero como videojuego, se le acerca muchsimo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,melhor rpg que j joguei na vida! os desenvolvedores demonstraram toda paixo fazendo esse jogo com carinho
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the best game of all. i thought about the actual games, that many have partial contents, and doesn't are make with love. this game are a perfect revival of the dungeon and dragons in computers, the system that are inspired by tolkien and literally the structure of medieval fantasy today. i think it will take time to appear a game like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"cara o jogo  lindo, com certeza merece o goty, um dos melhores que joguei na vida. voc sente o amor e o carinho que eles tiveram com o jogo e com a gente, onde em um mundo em que os jogos colocam voc pra jogar da maneira deles, a larian fez o jogo pra gente jogar da nossa maneira, e isso  lindo. amo vocs larian studios games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the beat game i have played in the last 15 years or do. hopefully my gf wont leave me as i've already put 40h into the game last week. and i dont even like turned based, story driven rpgs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"no tem como se maravilhar com as inmeras possibilidades que o jogo lhe permite seguir. voc tem inmeras possibilidades de segui a trajetria do jogo. no gosto de actionrpg mas esse jogo me conquistou. sem microtransao, tem moedinhas para comprar roupinhas."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"it was a fantastic game until the end of moonrise towers. afterwards arriving in the city it went completely of the rails. i didn't understand the discussion about woke content on steam until i arrived in the city. the first three experiences after arriving were over the top woke, seemed rather like a parody but i doubt any company dares parody these days concerning woke stuff. afterwards, exploring the city i somehow killed the habitants of about every second house. you saving the city seems worse than any damage, the problem you are trying to avert could cause. having a choice the people of baldurs gate probably would probably happily take another covid shot if that keeps maniacs like you from trying to save them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,best game since the witcher 3...better even. i'll be playing this game more than i played  i won't have to buy it more than once.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i love these game its a master peice and it should be new game standerds! if u want to jack game price up 10 then yea make it as good as these game or better without battle pass and all that money grabbing crap. these is the first time i wrote a review because i love it that much a full game without having to pay for other crap. its worth playing more then 1 time so many stuff to do!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"excellent game, absurd possibilities of choices and to play, it deserves the goty! grade 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"baldur's gate 3 is not a bad game. i would in fact say it's a good game, however in the genre that it exists in, isometric rpg, it's about average. i think what's happening is that a lot of new players, who have no idea what an isometric rpg is, are suddenly playing the cool game and enjoying it. a lot of the additional mechanics, such as shove, are just out of place and contrite. the story is lacking and seriously underwhelming. at times you wonder if you're advancing it at all. in the end come for the novelty, but go play baldur's gate iii for great games!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"gostei muito jogabilidade melhorada comparada ao divinity2 , gostei das adies de cutscenes e musicas, a historia muito bom"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,its a masterpice . point. if only have a little interest in rpgs try it out.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i don't know what to say.... bought it due to my dnd background and the game doesn't disappoint. there are so many options to go through, don't like a npc? just get rid of him. d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game is perfect, great game so far, an absolute masterpiece for fans of the genre and a sign that there's still hope for modern games"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"its simply the best videogame ive ever played. graphics could be better, but they are not bad in any way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i strongly believe that this game is the closest perfect game that gamers can get their hands on.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"amazing! the amount of choices, complexity, and craftsmanship of the design and voice acting is the best in ever seen in a game! completely amazing game and by far he best rpg i've ever played in the last 20 years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"baldur's gate 3 is the sebastian bach of video games. let me explain what i mean by this. bach was a late baroque composer. he was famous for his complex contrapuntal music. to explain in simplest possible way, every instrument played a melody in his music, instead of the usual way where an instrument would play melody and others would supplement it by playing rhythm. during bach's time this type of music was already considered archaic and old fashioned. a new and more orderly kind of music was getting more popular. yet he came and created the best examples of this style long after its fall from grace. think of directing godfather 4 today and it surpassing godfather 1 and 2. likewise baldur's gate 3 got released at a time when classical computer rpg's are considered a thing of the past. current trend is action rpg's. yet this game came, revived the 90's and early 2000's style of rpg's and even surpassed the originals. aaa developers are correct in a way. this game is an anomaly. you rarely get moments like this. if you are playing baldur's gate 3, know that you are a very lucky person. because you are witnessing the history in the making. ever wondered what would it be like to listen to bach while he was alive? people of the future will look at this game and wonder what was it like to play it when it was first released. baldur's gate 3 isn't just my personal goty but a milestone in the history of video games. play it and share it with your friends whenever you can. and don't forget to gather your party before you venture forth!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"new to the baldur's gate series but not new to tactical rpg games. this game is hands down one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. so rich and beautiful. also in today's day in age wear companies are half ing their games and release them with intention to fill gaps with dlc. this game right is complete and full, so much thought and effort in to every detail and character. very wonderful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"that's the goty. baldur's gate 3 is the best rpg game i ever played since skyrim, kingdomhearts 2 or the witcher. the game was made with love and you can fell this on the gameplay. i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"obra maestra en el genero sin duda, muchas variantes los dilogos que aunque no salga un resultado bueno, no te importa el resultado ya que la re jugabilidad es muy alta y te incita a ello una vez terminada la partida"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"despite the high review score, i don't believe this is that great . within its very specific subgenre this game might be enjoyable to some people especially those who like dd, bg, or larian's other games, but when compared to the broader gaming landscape i don't see a reason to play this game when there are so many better ones out there. the scores for this game are disproportionately inflated by fans of the genrestudio as opposed to your average gamer, so take some of the talk about this game with a grain of salt. bg3 does have some strengths. for instance the graphics and art style are nice, the audio and voice acting are some of the best i've ever heard, and the combat can be fun at times. but these pros are heavily weighed down by the rest of the game. the mechanics and nearly everything you do on the map outside of combat is absolutely horrible in my opinion. the map design and traversal are extremely outdated, it's like the developers forgot about the last 20 years of game design when making it. bg3 maps are small, linear, and full of empty space with nothing to do, just like a lot of outdated 90s rpgs. navigating the map is like doing a maze with annoying obstacles scattered between paths of nothingness. say you want to go to the other side of the map, well first you need to waste your time doing an unnecessarily hard battle, then you have to solve a frustrating puzzlefind the key to a locked dooretc, all the while trying to navigate the maze and avoid dead ends. there are ways out of some of these talking your way out of a battle, picking the lock, etc but it's not fun, picking the lock, for instance, is just a dice roll. it's not like skyrim where there's a fun little minigame. and this is essentially how the developers pad the run time, by populating the map with these obstacles that force you into a dice roll. they give you the illusion of choice and 3 or 4 options for how to proceed, but you'll probably end up rolling the dice no matter which option you choose so the end result feels the same with every encounter. i don't hate the use of dice in the game, especially for combat, but for a modern rpg it is annoying that they don't have some mechanics or minigames that require an element of skill. outside of battle, nearly everything is left to chance which makes for a bland experience. want to find buried treasure on the map? dice roll. want to persuade someone to do something? dice roll. want to find a secret passageway? dice roll. there's very little you as the player can do on your own accord, which takes away some of the thrill of the game for me. i'm not truly discovering these things for myself, the game is rolling the dice and giving them to me if i pass the check. the map also has issues with scope, as most of the maps are relatively small by 2023 standards, and they're extremely linear. each map essentially equates to a level, and you have to beat one level to advance to the next which is another outdated concept. i personally think the game would've been far better if you started in a hub map like the city of baldur's gate and then had 510 maps surrounding you. then you could choose which maps to go to based on quests, rp goals, etc. instead, they took the 90s model of map design and make you do the same levels again and again in the same order with little choice as to which map to do. you can't, for instance, travel directly to the titular city of baldur's gate from the beginning of the game without first playing 3040 hours. the combat in the game, as i mentioned earlier, can actually be fun. the problem i ran into though was twofold. first, most encounters are unnecessarily hard, even at explorer level. you often find yourself facing off against enemies that outnumber you 2 or 3 to 1. this is a problem, but the even bigger problem is that there aren't enough small fights you can do to grind up a level or practice a little more to prepare for the big fights. as i said, enemies don't respawn so the few easy fights in the game pass quickly and can't be repeated. if i want to fight, for instance, i can't just run into the forest and find a dynamically spawning pack of wolves. instead i need to go through the maze and deal with a ton of nonsense only to find one of the scripted battles which is likely way too hard to be a simple fight. there isn't enough side content to make up for this either, i cleared the entire first map and was still only the recommended level for the next zone. where's all the side content i can do if i want to get ahead? so overall i did not like this game, and i haven't even touched on my issues with the story including its length and content, oversexualization of characters, and lack of replay ability. i love rpgs and tactical combat, but this game is just not something everyone will enjoy despite the universal acclaim. overall i see why some people would like this game, but for most i'd recommend passing on it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"jogo crpg definitivo! um dos melhores rpgs desenvolvidos e uma aventura pica. jogabilidade, personagens, histrias, game design, ambiente, trilha sonora, e, mais do que tudo, respeito ao jogador em lanar um produto em preo cheio extremamente polido. uma experincia de jogar um board game de dd moderno, interativo e cheio de ao no computador. o combate por turnos que pode ser a preocupao de muita gente  a melhor coisa do jogo, e, mesmo eu que tenho pouqussima experincia nisso, estou impressionado o quo  bom, inteligente, desafiador e recompensador. certeza que o jogo ser muito rejogvel porque os prometidos milhares de finais e tudo que ocorre na sua jornada, que depende bastante da sua sorte nos dados, definem a sua experincia nica como um todo."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,just amazing !! goes straight to my hall of fame  it's been a while i havent enjoyed a video game so much.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"as a player of rpg's for over 30 years, i am trying to remember a time when i was this blown away with a videogame. i think i have to go back to everquest in 1999 and that might not even be fair because it had that first massively multiplayer aspect to it. bg3 is truly beyond my expectations of what i thought was possible. the game is built specifically for me, but also you, and everyone else. i kind of feel bad for starfield because the 45 minute video that i was hyped about a month ago just seems dated compared to this. i will be playing bg3 for a very long time. hopefully, this game does truly move the industry. it really feels like a breakthrough moment that has not been seen for 20 years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,a worthy successor to the classic infinity engine games. masterpiece 1010.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,what really shines the brightest in this game is the sheer endless amount of small stories and details surrounding every character. this is a game to really take your time in and learn why people act the way they do.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"best rpg alltime. i don't see any game with a better mix of story, dialogs, graphics, mechanics and respect of the community ideas."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"conheci pouco dos jogos anteriores, o primeiro que joguei foi o bg2 dark aliance, e era um jogo dificil mas incrivel. esse jogo me deixa imersivo, 4h de jogo nele dar uma sensao de minutos, e fazia tempo que um jogo causava isso, muito dialogos bom, tem uma excelente traduo dos textos e dialogo, realmente bem trabalhado, um jogo feito com amor, vontade, e para os consumidores. i got to know a little about the previous games, the first one i played was bg2 dark alliance, and it was a difficult but incredible game. this game makes me immersive, 4 hours of playing it feels like minutes, and it's been a while since a game did that, lots of good dialogue, it has an excellent translation of the texts and dialogue, really well crafted, a game made with love, will, and for consumers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"my first introduction to dnd and crpgs. by far it is amazing by all means. storytelling, npc interactions, attention to detail, combat, and best of all, the knowing that the developers were passionate about this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the game style may not be for everyone but this game is a total masterpiece. great rpg elements, very different story narratives depending on choices, great soundtrack, great graphics and you can do a lot of funny  for a game with this style. the only people that give this a red are either mad developers from other studios or people that just dont like this genre. i play pc games since i was 4 years old and this is without a doubt the best game i played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,definitely one of the best games ever released. the only thing i would like to see is the game being able to reach level 20 as is the dd game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this has become my favorite game ever. best game in 2 decades. thanks, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i'm only 30ish hours in to the official release but as someone who played it for about 1520 hours in early access over 2 years ago they have really put the work into this game. for those who are having a bit of trouble with the complicated ui just know its dd 5e accurate and the streamlined it more than i thought possible. the fact they were able to covert all this alone is incredible.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"a captivating story, amazing voice acting, a rich and detailed world where missing a small detail could see you skipping more story than some games have within their entirety. i have been playing for 40 hours and still only feel like i've just scratched the surface. i haven't enjoyed a game this much since knights of the old republic when i was a small child. i can't get enough of it. i'm already planning what i'll do on my second playthrough. believe the hype. this game gives you more freedom than any other game i've experienced, barring tabletop games, and this comes pretty damn close to even that in terms of player freedom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"after years of waiting, baldur's gate 3 is finally here, and it's amazing in every way. it feels like playing dragon age origins back in the day  both are amazing games. i don't have anything bad to say about this game apart from one feature  liked in the first 2 games there was a mechanic where if you put two companions that don't like each other together, they would eventually fight and kill each other. other than that, the story, gameplay, characters, sidequests, world, and combat  everything is amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the fact that this game has been criticized by aaa studios out there point out that larian is going the right direction, by doing what the customer want and not some unfinished, full of micro transaction  that those companies are used to put out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"amazing game, spent far too many hours and have many more to put into it, the scope of detail, the random things you can do and the length of the missions and how they change based on previous actions is glorious. love all the haters trying to review bomb it as well, what sad little creatures they are"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,best rpg of 2023 and most importantly it performs better than a lot of aaa releases that have been a stuttering mess lately

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"very high quality art design and visual style, but that was the only good thing about the game for me. sludgy character movement with very awkward and frustrating camera behaviour, e.g. clicking on invisible foreground terrain geometry sends you running backwards. combat with your humanoid party is like trying to position giant battleships made of glass. but worst of all is the constant sexual overtures from npcs  it's like me too never happened."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"grandioso,  tudo o que espervamos de um rpg com a mesma proposta, faz tudo perfeitamente certo e te deixa totalmente imerso neste mundo incrvel! 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,this game is amazing havent had this sensation since i played the witcher 3. def in my top 3 thank you larian for all the crit successes i have asked and you have given
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game has so much character. story writing is fantastic. people in the game, beyond just the main characters, have real personalities and it's easy to get attached to them. the story has so many branches too, which makes it so that your decisions feel like they really impact the game. i'm excited for a second playthrough. this may be the best rpg i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i remember being really excited when swen and larian announced the new title and that it would be in early access. their previous game, divinity original sins 2 had been such an awesome game, and i was proud to have backed the company in making it. but, when he said that they were going to make the characters act in cut scenes with the camera in close for better details, instead of having to read long texts  i said, i wonder if this will open the game up to a broader audience? duh! so happy for larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"great story, great mechanics, insane freedom and possible ways to solve quests and handle situations. in my point of view the best game ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i haven't played the original baldur's gate series, so i can't judge this game from this perspective, but i played divinity and completed it as well, so i can probably say if it is a good game or not, and the short answer is yes. this game is a huge step forward compared to previous larian games in terms of cinematic quality, story telling, and the plot itself. but let's dive into the review and speak in detail about all aspects of the game. first character creation yeah, many people talk about it, but i also want to say my small part. character creation in this game is not about a huge amount of sliders to create a detailed version of yourself or some celebrity yeah, the boobs slider is missing, but this game is about picking the right class that will fit your race and also ability scores and backgrounds to create your own imbalanced hero of the dnd world. that will also affect the variants of dialogs that will be available or not and, as a result, open or close possible ways to complete the whole game. also, companionship is another important moment that can change as your playstyle and story change because each of them has their own class, race, background, and so on. as a result, even at the start , there can be many layers of complexity that can intimidate players or not, if you're kind of lazy. plot branching is another key aspect that can be enjoyed by casual goodstory lovers. you can be a bad guy who just wants to get some money or a hero who can save the world or destroy it because it's funny. additional features that can increase immersion are good cinematics with excellent graphics, and all of the dialogs are voiced. the gameplay part is similar to previous games divinity, except that all your actions need a dice drop. d20? d6? d4? you take all of them. in all other aspects, gameplay is based on the character that you created and used. yes, it can be simple rmb clicks on enemies or various combinations of spells used to defeat them. the sound part is also a great part of the game the music is well suited to actions on the screen, and the final musical theme also has good sound. in the final part, let's talk about some issues or bugs that i noticed during my playthrough. minor visual artifacts in cutscenes closer to the final part of the game are ok just compare it to the first half that does not contain bugs thanks to early access so that problem will be fixed. another bug is more complicated and related to enemy ai that cun stuck and during the combat just stand and dont do any actions yeah its ok and make battles more easily but it increase time as well because game try to make enemy attack but them desagree with game and just stand and take our time. the last part is kind of strange there is a moment in the game trying to tell it without spoilers where you can refuse the help of a character and say that you're going to do it in another way, and your companion can say that you use an item to rescue another character and what strange things she can say even if you don't have this item, so in case you don't have the required item, you can get stuck in a location because you don't have it and refuse the offer of another charter, so the one solution is to reload the previous save. so to whom will i recommend this game? probably to everyone who is not scared of turnbased combat and wants a very wellcrafted story with various ways to be told."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,one of the best rpgsgame i've played in my life. this is what an aaa game should be. so many games these last 5 years have been major disappointments with few exceptions looking at you elden ring its a breath of fresh air. really knocked this one out of the park
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"larians origin characters recieved a lot of bad press since ea begun. many people  myself included  regard them as overwritten, vapid and unpleasant. but you can create a custom character and custom party, so there should be no problem. yeah, theres a sly catch. pick a custom character, and your choice of voice actor  at least for the male  is voiced as a bumbling moron literally, with the following sample lines inanely uttered over and over shouldnt have wished to live in more interesting times im weakmostly all endsnot as bad as it could have what to do next up is the custom party. except it isnt custom. the socalled hirelings are prohibitively expensive in the earlygame why have any cost at all?. and they cannot be created from scratch, even though the character creation editor allows for it. you select from precreated appearances  i guess to avoid anyone creating a custom party that isnt inclusive enough. in a private game no one else is going to see. as yet another middlefinger to those who dont like the origin characters, the hirelings are zombies  another contrivance that allows the more bitter of larians staff to have you endure voice lines read, in this instance, by a literal mindless entity. you could say the grilled miniature giant space hamsters you find across bg3 arent an equally angry reference to the popular bg2 minsc his defining trait was a pet miniature giant space hamster. so whats the joke? because im inclined to think something highly suspect is going on at this point. larger than life with brains smaller than miniature giant space hamsters, even the overlyspecial bores that are the origin characters are, however, more appealing than zombies whose appearance cant be changed. that doesnt make their gimmicky plots any less nauseating to endure. im just getting to the end of act 2, and the amount of major plot thats hurled at you in clusters  particularly if you do any exploring  reads like the writing team had some kind of identity crisis halfway through. meanwhile, ign quoted one of the larian writers as boasting about the sheer quantity of sexual content in the game. you may or may not have heard of the bear sex scene revealed during the final marketing push, where larian capitalised on the thirst for a druid character nicknamed daddy halsin. the scene depicts halsin transforming into a bear and engaging in a sexual act with astarion. gale, despite having been pitched as a former lover , hits on a male mc so often that its the stuff of parody on various forums, and ive had to simply stop engaging with him at the camp. quite ready for you gale creepily whispers occasionally, whenever you happen to just click on him lest you ever forget hes up for a bit of magic wink wink. theres no gender selection anymore, just identity and body type. in other words, larian is now most definitely an aaa studio, and no doubt has some new employees to help them out in understanding what that really means in modern gaming. buried beneath all of this dross is a serviceable game. the combat is decent and the enemies are almost unique in every battle. but you can see the ageold larian balance curse kicking in, just as the ea act 1 content ends. towards the end of act 1, id hit level 7 out of a max of 12 and was fighting enemies much lower. while thats evened out over time, the later combat is nowhere near as polished as act 1 ea, nor is encounter design as creative. then theres the sheer quantity of magic, rare and unique items  i have so many now that i literally just pick them up and dont want to look at them, even if theyre useful. the tone of the art is way off as well, ranging from excellentdetailed to rushedbland to completely ridiculous. compare the bg2 wizards lowkey hooded robes and fighters practical, plausible armour to bg3s freakshow of overdesigned armour, or bare it all clothing that looks like something from an sm dungeon google the sadist from the act 1 goblin camp. im only halfway through  and judging by the hate online for the final act and the complaints of halffinished, ive a feeling i know already where the rest of this is going."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"as someone who plays different genres of games. i never played anything similar or heard of this saga until a friend recommended this. 60 hours in, i have to say it is truly one of the best games ever created. i never heard  in which i could play multiple times and have a different story every single time. it is truly incredible from a design standpoint. do not listen to haters or bots managed by greedy companies. play this game, you will not regret it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,this might be the best game i have ever played. this game has officially moved witcher 3 out of the 1 spot in my personal game rankings. game of the decade for sure. 1110
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"game of the year? nah. this is a contender for game of the decade. a passion project that turned out so good, polished and complete that it sent the video game industry reeling and has aaa developers turning green with envy and doing everything in their power to discredit larian and this masterpiece they've unleashed on the world. it's stunning graphically, the writing is amazing and the voice acting is immaculate. add to that the weight of your choices actually mattering in the game and the absolute freedom you have in this massive game. all that for a fixed price, with no micro transactions or day 1 dlc purely designed to flesh out a halfcooked game in sight. take a bow, larian. you've done yourselves proud."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"after finally finishing this game, i'm going to taking a short break. counts to 5. ok, breaks over and now i'm off back for playthrough number 2 !!! love this game, awesome!!! buy it, buy it now !!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,amazing game! this is exactly what we should be getting from aaa devs. one of the best games i've played in 30 years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"no tenho o que dizer. obrigado larian, vocs mandaram bem de mais nesse jogo. 70 depois venho avaliar e ainda tem muito cho. de fato  um goty!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the sheer amount of content this game has in insane, the quality of all conversations, the optimizing needs a little work, but it's a million times better than many other games which is crazy to think about. i have played this game for 146 hours at the times of this review and i have barely scratched the surface of the game, although it is true that i have deleted some of my characters with much time invested because i changed my mind about their looks. still tho, i have played enough to understand it's quality, it is incredibly good, i wouldn't say perfect but certainly close to a perfect crpg. i played divinity original sin 2 for many many hours, it is quite similar to baldur's gate 3, but every character has been massively improved in this game. certainly a goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,que jogo viciante e bom. queria poder jogar com 5 personagens no grupo ao invs de quatro mas isso no tira o brilho do jogo. parabns para a larian studio e todos os envolvidos na produo do jogo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"is this a technical flawless game? no, the inventory is bad, changing party members more trouble than it should be, and the camera can be funky. except those nitpicks? it's a brilliant masterpiece!!! it catches the feeling of dd, without trying to be a ttrpg. the pacing is good, the world is beautiful, voice acting is excellent, quest design is engaging, the story is good, the companions are fantastic!, and so on. is this a game for everyone? no. but it is an experience for most."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"the best dd game i've ever seen. it captures all the ridiculous moments you can find on the table top with your friends, and i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"amazing game, so much details and love they created this game. this wil be my new standard. i think even that i will play dozens of playthroughs. great job larian"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"bladur's gate 3 is one of the best games ever created. i applaud larian studios' work. they clearly put in a lot of time, effort, skill, and most importantly, love, into creating this gem. the amount of choices available to the player, along with the fantastic writing, art direction, score, and voice acting resulted in one of the greatest video games ever. amazing work!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i congratulate larian studio, which released the best rpg game in the world with this budget."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game has brought everything i have ever looked for in an rpg. and i truly believe that this is a game that everyone deserves to experience and enjoy. bringing a new expectation for us as consumers from triple a studios that use predatory micro transactions fronts and battle passes just to release subpar experiences just so you fork over your money. your money on this game, will be worth every penny, and cast the vote that this is what we want in a game. a polished, finished game with complete experiences."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"overhyped again act 3 its a mess, too many promises and nothing in the end, the city feel empty, bugs, crashed, lag, etc. gameplay its boring and repetitive after a while, at one pointnot the end of the game you clean everything pretty fast, ai its dumb. writing will make you do a soy face if you're using reddittwitter, otherwise will make you cringe at best or just skip everything at worst companions will try to romance the main character even if you didn't do anything, they call you a bad guygirl if you refuse them this game its a masterpiece if you never touched more than 5 rpg's in your entire life or any crpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i really hope that'll be new game quality standard and all this tiny indie  studios will finally understand something
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"play it, just play it. certainly goty 2023. i'm still not through but i know i'll play it again at least once."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,game of the year. 1110 no micro transactions no  just a great world to lose yourself in and do what ever you want to do. anyone giving this less then 1010 is a moron who probably hasn't played games in the decade.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i play games since i can remember video games since 1987, board games even before. i started playing dd games pen  paper since 1991. having said that, this is the best computer game ever created true to the principles, rules and atmosphere of dungeons  dragons! it has the mechanics! it has the graphics! it has the authentic rules and skills! it has the races! it has the classessubclasses! it has the story! when i was thinking of the optimum video game variation of a forgotten realms world, i could never imagine such a solid result as the one delivered by bg3! last but not least, the game is totally different based on your alignmentbackgroundrace choices, thus giving it great replayability especially if you choose to play with friends  up to 4! a must game for every fantasydd fan's library!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"just amazing, nothing more to add, game is immersing you into itself like nothing i ever played. worth every penny."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game is perfect, goty has already been chosen, they don't even have to do the competition"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"this game masterfully executes the dd experience. in addition to all this, for the size of the game, its graphic quality is incredible and especially the localization of subtitles for different countries. really a game that elevates the franchise even further and manages to demonstrate what a studio with people passionate about a project is capable of doing. my got this year without a doubt."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"everything looks, works perfectly organically and authentically. i love the dialogs, the variety of how to handle every situation and their results. for me, the  so far  perfect bg  dnd adventure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"bg3 is a masterpiece, plain and simple. people who give this game a rating below 6 are extremely jaded. best example is one guy who rated it a 410 to balance out the hype, lol. i rate it a 8.5  910 after the bugs i have an issue with are being dealt with but for now, its a 810.  the characters are well written, and have unique personalities and struggles  the dark urge origin fits surprisingly well for it being a highly customizable character  the combat being turn based is amazing, thats how baldurs gate 1 and 2 should've been  the world design is phenomenal, it rewards exploration  the quests are amazing, full of twists and many ways to solve them  the itemization is great, so many powerful items that define classes, literally bis  the music is absolutely amazing, its so immersive, so forboding, mysterious now the cons  the performance is bad in act 3  some quests are bugged  using long rest as story progession is weird and makes you miss some story beats, especially during act 3  camera is weird too, why does it hang on mountains? is it a literally person holding that camera and can bump into stuff?  the inventory is bad, you get lost easily without proper sorting anyway, thanks for reading my review."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"literally a masterpiece, worth every cent. larian as always making good games like divinity original sin 1 and 2"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i was waiting for a game to topple the witcher 3. i didn't think it would happen in the 2020s. thank you larian for pouring your hearts into this masterwork and rising above the repetitive nonsense we've become accustomed to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i have been playing games for over 15 years and never played something better than this. i played the early access for 100 hours and after 40 hours after release, i still didn't see anything new, but still had more fun than ever. it is what we always thought we would never get again. a full price game that delivers for a one time payment more than all other games deliver for a monthly payment. the story is great, the characters are great, the world building is great, the combat is great, the exploration is great the dialogs and voice acting are great. some of the spellabilityitem descriptions could be better, but that's something easily fixable and after some time you will get the hang of it. otherwise, there is absolutely nothing i can complain about, which makes this game the greatest of all time for me. larian did it again."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i've got 100 hours in bg3, and this game truly harkens back to the days of boiware's golden age. as a primarily crpg fan, i am rejoicing. this is the kind of game that got me into computer games back in the '90s yes, i'm old, and it saddened me when crpgs became passe and more and more of my favorite studios moved to an actionoriented style of gaming. thank you, larian, for reigniting this passion for rpgs and making me feel like a teenager again. also no microtransactions, no dayone dlcs, and no major gamebreaking bugs. nuff said1010 from me."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"baldur's gate 3 is a triumphant return to the beloved world of dungeons  dragons, offering an engaging and immersive experience that's sure to captivate both veterans and newcomers to the series. the game's story is rich and compelling, drawing on the lore of original dd content and setting up a grand mission through the main characters' infection with a mind flayer parasite. what truly sets the narrative apart is the freedom of choice, allowing players to craft their own unique story from thousands of possibilities. the gameplay mechanics are faithful to the standard 5th edition dd system, with larian studios infusing their signature style from previous titles like divinity original sin 2. the level cap of 12 strikes a perfect balance, and combat feels authentic to a dd tabletop experience. the game's graphics and sound are captivating, with impressive visuals and a beautiful soundtrack that includes tracks like down by the river. it's easy to lose yourself in the character customisation menu or be wowed by the cutscenes, creating an atmosphere akin to an interactive animated movie. innovation shines through in the game's features, such as the use fall damage and environmental elements. the intelligent scaling of difficulty, where npcs make smarter decisions at higher levels, adds depth and challenge without being overly frustrating. while some minor bugs were encountered, larian's responsiveness to player feedback and commitment to swiftly addressing issues is commendable. overall, baldur's gate 3 is a musttry game for players who enjoy crpgs or rpgs as a genre. its blend of faithful adaptation, innovative design, and attention to detail creates a rich and rewarding experience that's hard to fault. whether you're exploring the vast world, engaging in strategic combat, or making choices that shape your unique story, this game offers something special for every rpg fan."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"goty sem duvida, 1000x melhor que o zelda com grafico de android, jogabilidade e histria incrivel."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,another good work from larian team. it is definitely a gorgeous comeback of the baldur's gate franchise.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"dialogue options really change the world, and the endings. your race, class, subclass, and history heavily alter the choices you are given during gameplay. the difficulty is above average even on easy difficulty, but as it is possible to roll back the save, it doesn't have that much of a problem. incredible story, good music, interesting characters. 1010 for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"perfeio! um jogo que no ligou em colocar micro transaes, e um contedo que passa de horas de experincia nica? me de papai!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"simplesmente magnifico, no me vejo imerso em um jogo desde ? eu no sei desde quando so posso dizer que em quanto no estou jogando estou pensado no jogo, nos personagens, nas decises e o que eu poderia ter feito diferente ou at no mundo do jogo. eu n me sentia feliz em mergulhar em um jogo como estou me sentindo jogando bg3 a muito tempo e so posso agradecer a larien e agora vou l jogar mais"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"um jogo que eu no esperava nada porem entregou tudo , parabns larian pelo timo trabalho."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"greatest crpg ever, just narrowly beating out divinity original sin 2 since it took that system and added several years of work to it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"amazing game! in a time where most games that come out are money sinking halffinished rubbish. baldurs gate 3 shines with a complete game with hundreds, or more like thousands of hours of gameplay to enjoy. there are some bugs here and there still, but they are outweighed by the fun ive been having with this game. now, baldurs gate may not be for everyone.. this is a tobletop game converted into a video game. the combat is turn based and can be a little overwhelming to someone that has never played a game like that before. what larian studios was able to do with 6 years of development is absolutely astounding. this game is a polished masterpiece in my opinion. thank you, larian crew keep on being awesome!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,the best game i've played in recent memory. highly recommend if you enjoy good rpgs or dnd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"great classic rpg. that said, it might not be for everyone. here are some tidbits that might affect your enjoyment, depending on your tastes and priorities  heavy emphasis on rng rng decides a lot of outcomes in this game and can be really frustrating at times.  turnbased combat yeah, it's slow, especially when fighting large groups of enemies.  movement is very slow your group moves rather slowly and you can find yourself looking at your party move somewhere for minutes on end.  you will be reloading alot the rng, combined with the limited healing options really forces you to reload frequently.  plot is very scifi fantasy while dd is known for its slightly cheesy world, this game leans very heavily into the dark fantasy  scifi elements of dd.  combat can be challenging, but also offers a lot of room for exploits. given the game's many rules, spells, mechanics and items there are hundreds of ways to cheese and exploit fights if you want to.  act3 is more disjointed and less polished than act1 and 2. while the first two acts offer a clear main objective, act3's more free form outcomes are less satisfying as not everything gets a fair conclusion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"the game is so magical and full of freedom dev's did an amazing job, you get fully immersed in this world, and it deserves it a try even if you are not a fan of turn based rpg games, true masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"they created a very polished game with a vast world. the graphics are great. the storytelling is great. the characters are alive and awesome. i am about 25 hours in and am loving it. it let's you do a lot of different things in different ways. if you're a bard, you can insult people during dialogue to hurt them. i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a premium product from a game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,awesome game as usual for larian studios! great work improving their earlier systems
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"larian studios did the impossible, and not only released a fully functioning complete game in 2023, but also released a crpg, and turn based game in a industry that has moved away from those genres."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"absolutely incredible feat. deserves all the hype and more, i have around 106 hrs currently with 25ish hrs being from early access. please give this game your support, it is a miracle this game released in 2023. one of the best games ever. full stop."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"1010 o jogo  sensacional com historias profundas, dd 5.0 agregou muito me sinto em uma mesa de rpg de fato! sensacional o game nunca vi nada igual vale muito a pena jogar  viciante!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"bg3 is the best electronic rpg of all time, it makes zelda look like an old car all torn apart and broken. the beauty of bg3 is sublime on all levels, the criticisms here are mostly untrue and without any sense of fanaticism as if the game or platform were religion. the only criticism i have about bg3, is that the camera system could have been improved on viewing angle and way of tracking."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"great game. no dlc , no paid to win , no loot boxes just a full game. thank you so much , im enjoying every bit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"realmente um dos jogos mais incrveis que ja vi, pois a preocupao com os detalhes, os dilogos, os diversos segredos que muitas vezes passam batido pelo jogador casual, as diversas formas de resolver as quests, realmente  cartilha que deveria ser seguida pela maioria das desenvolvedoras."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"the best game of the year. mecanics, story, everything is fantastic in this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"one of the most thoughtful games i've ever played. every combat encounter is different and creativity is rewarded! i've played 30 hours since it released and cannot wait to play more. having played nearly every rpg made in the past twenty years, i can easily say this is the best by far followed by witcher 3, mass effect 13, nwn 1 and bg 1. it feels like i'm a teenager again discovering the magic of a playing the stories i've read and imagined since childhood."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"a true dd game without the name, it's perfect for groups that don't know a dm. we've got a couple of games going and each playthrough is wildly different from the last. turn based combat works really well in a coop game, allowing for stacking of abilities and planning out who to killknock out etc. one thing that would have made this game even better would be voice lines for the player's choices. or when playing coop, a bit more visibility on what was chosen, as some players take it quite fast. sometimes it's hard to keep up with all the options, and then they've already chosen an option before you could have your input.. then you couldn't see the option they chose, it's caused a few arguments around how it should be selected and if the player talking should actually read out their choice before selecting."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece that captures the essence of classic rpgs and introduces exciting innovations. the detailed and mysterious world of faern, deep character customization, and rules system based on dd 5e provide an authentic experience. strategic and exciting combat, along with an immersive narrative and memorable characters, make this game a gem for rpg lovers. every decision counts and the relationships with the characters add extra emotional value. baldur's gate 3 is an adventure that immerses you in an epic world and awakens the desire for more. if you love roleplaying games, this experience is a must."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"game of the decade right here. i want more games like this. feature complete on launch, not riddled with microtransactions, and a wonderful crpg experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,this game is quite simply the best game that has ever been made ever. larian studios take a bow.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game is absolutely incredible. baldur's gate 3 is the new standard by which not only rpgs should be measured, but video games as a medium. the love, care, and attention to detail at every angle is staggering. larian studios is leading by example and showing the rest of the industry how it's done."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"um puta dum jogao, t aqui s pra subir a nota na vdd, pq to tentando sabotar o game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,melhor jogo do ano. estou com 60h do jogo e ainda estou no ato 1 curtindo cada canto do jogo. d de perceber que a empresa colocou muito carinho nesse jogo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"1010 the game is a true rpg, the only one that has managed to achieve something similar is morrowind and the withcer 3, without a doubt the game of the year"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"best rpg game i played , great story , graphics , setting , lore ,immersion , extensive character creation with a lot of classes , races, backgrounds, great companions. the combat of this game is turn based and i know a lot of people don't like this type of gameplay, i was also one of those persons but give the game a try because after playing it grew on me , the game is very complex and requires understanding, you have a lot of decisions to make with many outcomes , you can be good , evil , or neutral. perfect game to roleplay in the forgotten realms of dungeons and dragons. this is one of those game that is marked as a must play no microtransactions and very good devs. final review score 10 enjoy"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"best game to come out in years imo!! it works, has no paywall, and has hundreds of hours of content. for once in years i don't feel like i am being treated as a beta tester for a aaa game. diablo 4 cost more money and had 4 to 6 hours of main storyline gameplay. this industry has gotten out of control and treats the community like cash cows, providing uncompleted products at a premium price. then they add a whole bunch of paywalls to new content and items. buy this game folks. vote with your money and don't buy the next aaa game from companies like ea who have significant predatory business practices. show these companies we don't want to pay hundreds of dollars to play a game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"um dos melhores jogos que eu joguei em tempos! precisa estar no preo para o melhor jogo do ano!!! quem  f de rpg de mesa, vai adorar!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"uma experincia simplesmente fantstica, um jogo feito com aquele carinho que tanto estava em falta em grande parte dos rpg's. tem capricho em tudo e todo canto, de uma forma massiva, situaes tensas...inusitadas...engraadas, e varias formas de se jogar e rejogar, um game quase infinito.  o elden ring dos jogos de turno ...eis o meu goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"how could you give less than 10? has raised the standards of the rpg genre, starting today any rpg game that doesn't come close to baldur's gate makes no sense for a developer to release it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"larian excels at creating gripping tension in every aspect, and the characters are absolutely captivating. the writing is topnotch. even if you're not a die hard dos2 fan, you should consider buying this. the dd rules are faithfully preserved, with minimal adjustments to accommodate dos2's style, and the essence of the source rules books is beautifully retained. your heroic characters will have the incredible ability to effortlessly lift and hurl barrels, unlike the game's prequel dos2, which deliberately avoids any resemblance to the gridbased battles found in disgaea. yeah, this is for you, zelda fanboy or boomer who despises what bg3 is doing and achieving. we are the absolute, we will be the future of the videogame industry!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"baldur's gate 3 sempre foi uma preocupao grande para os jogares antigos da srie, pois tinhamos muito receio da questo da jogabilidade em turnos. tambm ficamos receosos com a questo do jogo ficar muito parecido com dos2. no s estvamos errados, como o jogo excedeu todas as expectativas. parabns  larian por entregar finalmente um jogo feito com carinho para os fans novos e antigos. muito obrigado!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"you shouldn't buy this unless you're a die hard dos2 fan. much of the dd rules are tweaked to fit dos2's flavor, and remains little flavor from the source rules books. it's a when you press a barrel, something awesome has to happen style of game, dragon age 4. and your heroic characters won't be able to pick up a barrel and throw it, otherwises the game its prequel dos2 would be too much like disgaea type of grid battle. the explosive, the height gap, the geo that annoys players most of time, and the sex hinted jokes, i see what sequel the game really is now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"baldur's gate 3 is one of the best games i've ever played in my life. it has a super interesting story line, incredible dialogues and companions with an interesting background that makes you want to explore and get to know them better"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i really admire games coming from larian studio. divinity 2 has made a golden standard for crpg to me. this game with all its mechanics, different approaches to every encounter, the conversations and questline was just perfect. obviously there were some minor issues on the way, but nothing gamebreaking. i feel same but even better for baldur's gate 3. it is awesome game with great and polished mechanics and a really good storyline. i am over 80 hours into it in just 11 days of gameplay and i am loving every part of this game. strong recommendation and a golden standard for any future game coming from any greedy and complaining studio."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"the best in the world, no matter those negative score... they'r just frustated"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i purchased this game in early access over 3 years ago and am blown away how much it's improved since the initial launch. voting 10 to counter the neckbeards and trolls who've never played a turn based crpg based on dd rules before and were thinking this was a fast paced action game like they're used to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"outlier, fora do padro, uma obra prima ! surpreendeu em todos os campos fornecendo uma experiencia inversiva jamais vista no mercado."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i think there is nothing in the nearest future that will be better than this. a great game with fantastic gameplay, dnd, and a great story. the dnd part is very easy to learn and every newcomer will be able to understand the rules."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"muito bom, que continuem fazendo jogos nesse nvel. fazia tempo que no lanavam um jogo de rpg nesse nvel e usando regras de dd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"game is great. great mix of dos2 and dnd5e. the game is amazing and my group loves it wish we could get together more often. it's one of those games that we keep talking about as a group even when not playing it. it does have some bugs and unclear things where you don't get a first turn or action for some reason and many choices that are unclear or frustrating but the game excels in storytelling, giving the player freedom and classic divinity jank tactics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"despite the roughness of act 3, this is perhaps one of the best games i've ever played. my only gripe is the way this game ends. it just kinda drifts into the aether. you beat the last boss, get 2 minutes of your companions talking about their plans, and that's it. roll credits, time to go home. you get a massive, rich story in a world filled with mystery and magic while being taken on a roller coaster ride full of twists and turns for the ending to just say congrats, you did it. even if the ending ends up teasing you, the journey is more than worth it. just don't expect to feel done when you've completed it, in more ways than one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"great game in every aspect, story and gameplay. larian managed to make a wonderful rpg game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"great gamey i have 40 hours played and i'm at the beginning. deep interesting gameplay, interesting story, cool characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,it's better than almost every single game ever made and it probably will stay that way for a while. the attention to detail during making this game was so big you can complete the game 12 times and can get new cutscenes every single time. game is amazing but there's a lot of bugs. the amount of bugs is so big that the rating has to suffer by at least 1 point if not more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"fantastico. a melhor experincia que tive com games. larian demonstrou como se fazer um jogo de alto nvel, dando aula s empresas que lanam jogos atualmente inclua nintendo nesta observao. no penas goty, mas o jogo de uma dcada toda."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"if you give this game a fair chance, you can't give it a negative review. yes it is not perfect. bugs are numerous and are actually tiresome. but boy.... this is incredible game. 89 is only fair."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i'm having a difficult time actually physically removing myself from this game. the story, mechanics, and characters are all so engaging. this game is an achievement in a sea of mediocrity. i'll be playing this for years to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game is amazing, dont know how some people create accounts just to rage against it. this game deserve all the glory!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"o jogo  muito bom, tima histria, personagens e gameplay. joguando a verso do pc, no aguardo para pegar a do xbox tambm."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece, still has some bugs, as expected, the game is 2 weeks old, but they are fixing it quickly, bd3 is the best transcription of dd for a game ever made, very well executed, amazing script, wonderful freedom of choices, perfect soundtrack. i currently have 60 hours of gameplay, every day i go to work and all i can think about is the time to go back home and play more, with that i can already nail it, bd3 is my goty 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"another massively successful game by larian. if you're truly a fan of rpgs, you'll appreciate this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,jogo e muito top ok melhor que o zelda . o jogo tem que ser goty 2023 se no for goty e por causa das mdias merda que favorece sempre a nintendo ou a sony . ok . e goty porra.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"absolutely marvelous! the industry was needed of a punch like this. certainly the industry will rethink about this practice of launch unfinished or low quality games. larian certainly is the newest role model for your segment. if you are that kind of people who have nothing to do all day and rate this game with 0, i'm sorry, but this game is impecable and isn't your opinion who will change the fact, keep trying! yes, the fights are slow, but do you ever play dnd? do you ever think about some strategy or throwed the dices fast? graphics, sound, music, playability... everything are impressive and the story, characters and npcs are simply amazing! i never played this kind of game until then and i'm loving it! definitely a masterpiece!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,a genuine breath of fresh air in the gaming space today. i have very minor gripes with some qol things. but the game itself is phenomenal. the sheer scope of the game is massive and is oozing with replayability. if you've ever been on the fence for trying dnd and haven't.. give this one a try. you will probably find yourself dying to play it afterward. i also recommend playing solo before playing with a group as it is a vastly different experience for good reasons

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,this is the way games should be made. with people that care about the game and not the almighty dollar.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"definitely the best rpg ive ever played, have a feeling this is gonna be the gold standard going forwards for a long time. after finishing the main story after 70.8 hours i immediately started a new game with a completely different character just to see the differences."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"amazing game, even if you never played anything within the genre before, or have never touched dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"great game overall, act 1 and 2 were awesome, act 3 was good but not great. sadly the last 2 hours of the game are questionable and the ending left me very disappointed since it was very short and lacking."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"a very beautiful game and an a pretty nice story might not fill the void of bg2, tho, worth playing. however, it feels kind of short in terms of soundtrack and the turn based system might not feel that appealing to some audiences, which was my case. very enjoyable and hoping it gets more content in the future!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"best game of all time! a must play game for all rpg fans. huge world, cool storyline, no microtransactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,1010 the nightmare of aaa studios come to life. it is phenomenal. i played divinity 1 and 2 before and those games were already in my top10 games but baldurs gate 3 is just build different. its my new favorite game taking the place of the witcher 3 which i thought would never happen.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,impeccable game! masterpiece! .....................................................
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this must be the best game i played in a long time. usually, i get bored of modern rpg games really fast. with this game, i can't stop playing. the world is full of events, hidden secrets, mechanics and interesting stories. very long and interesting main quest. i must have played over 70 hours and everything is unique. companions only add more flavour to the main storyline, you don't even notice that you branched out to go and do some side quests. no words to describe how beautiful the armour design and weapon look. so much thought was put into all the possible interactions with the environment during combat and just wandering around. truly must play. amazing game. runs on my pc smoothly with no problems."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,this game is practically perfect in every way. there have been a few minor bugs but nothing to break me out of the immersion that this game offers. every conversation is handled extremely well and the outcomes are so fun to watch unfold. a game where your decisions matter. the combat is tactical turn based and is so fun solo or with friends offering a wide variety to combat encounters. i havent had this much fun since dragon age origins. ps do not listen to the negative reviews. they are all junk

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i played both og games and this one is such an amazing worthy successor, every choice matters, every system has depth and i'm so invested in the characters! it is a shame the ratings only go to 10 because in a year where zelda seemed sure to win goty this game seems to be upending the cart with incredible quality."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game is huge. there is so much depth in almost every aspect of the game, that it defies belief that any game studio, much less one the size of larian, could have come up with so much great content. it is truly astounding! in terms of story, immersion, characters, level progression, monster interaction and variety, magic system, soundtrack, worldbuilding, crafting, and last but not least, player agency  this is quite simply the best video game rpg ever made. full stop."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"llevo unas 80horas, estoy casi por el final del acto 2 y no deja de sorprenderme la cantidad de cosas por hacer. llevaba tiempo sin estar tan enganchado a un juego. y mira que los combates por turno no fue lo mo. le pondra un 9,5 ya que tiene sus fallos."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"amazing. this is the perfect 5e game. everything you would expect out of a dnd game and more. even if you don't like dnd, or have never played it, this game stands out as one of the best games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i've been a massive baldur's gate fan for years, replaying the games several times. i'm also a dnd dm and seasoned rpg player, and i can honestly say that larian studios nailed it! the character storiesarcs are engaging and interesting. there is depth to the decisions they make, what they react to, and a variety of personality types. there are sad moments, humorous scenes and moral grey areas that are genuinely difficult to decide. as a fellow game designer, i commend larian studios for how they have implemented dnd 5e mechanics. dnd combat can, at types, be prolonged and sluggish, but they've made the combat feel relatively fast and epic. i had already spent over 100h in early access, and it's a joy to see all the changes larian have made in the final release for the better. more game design companies should look at larian studios as a blueprint for creating a wellrounded game. this game has been made with passion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,an amazing game. haven't been so immersed in a game and it's characters for perhaps decades. highly recommended!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i have enjoyed dnd 5e for some time and played with friends, always hoping it could be expressed in a modular game, so we could all enjoy it together seamlessly with no need for a dm. bg3 delivers one of the most extensive, enjoyable stories and gameplay for a trpg i have ever played. everything feels like it is impactful, your actions matter and to top it off the combat is fantastic. for those who love dnd and gaming there is no game better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"what a fantastic crpg and work of art. a personal game of the year, perhaps of the last 10 years. i am hopelessly addicted. not without some minor flaws, but a masterpiece nevertheless. trust the dice? hmmm."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this is truly an amazing game. at the moment i have only reached the second act, but my impressions are extremely positive. decisions and consequences, environment, dialogues, characters. everything is amazingly done. i'm really worried about the consequences, about the fate of every character that i've met. thank you, larian, for an incredible experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"absolut masterpiece. feature complete. no microtransaction. just a full game on a new height. goty 2023! a game . it does have some bugs, especially states. meaning that sometimes when loading my characters don't have torches active. loading again they do. those are though so minor considering the fact that this is the first game where i feel i can roleplay a neutral evil character. if you love roleplaying or just a damm good narrative game with some depth to mechanics go for it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this is a ridiculously good game. the story, the character arcs, the epic twists and the cutscenes. and all of that combined with dd5. i've never been so satisfied with a game before."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"masterpiece. best game i've played in years. 1010. i've not played a turn based rpg like this before but i've really enjoyed playing bg3 so far and look forward to finishing everything the game has to offer. larian sets a new high standard in rpg's and games in general. bg3 100 deserves game of the year. great immersion, great story, great voice acting, interesting and fun mechanics. very refreshing compared to some of the messy broken titles, triple a devs have released in the last few years. this is how its done. well done larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"spent more than one hour simply to create my first character and that was during the early access era!!! at that point, the game knows you'll never ask for a steam refund so it offers you the full immersion oh you want rpg, real roleplay, so you need to be able to create your own hero, i've got the tools. this rpg is a solid, rich, engaging, entertaining experience that, one could say, establishes a new standard you know it was coming. i find myself trying to explore every path with my good druid, often chaging form to access new zones and... damn! should i have succeeded this perception check i would have found the button and not used a skill. and when you want to create a new character, choose different paths, know that the developers already know what you'll try during your second playthrough, perhaps even your third and sixteenth. larian, i will remember this crypt and those armed skeletons, and i now know you knew i would disarm them the second time around. baldur's gate 3 is larian's gift to us players who want and love a true rpg, turn based, with options beyond our dreams. i mean i converted one bad guy leader into a walking corpse, which ultimately led me to be attacked by an entire village of mushroom how should i have known? everytime i think of little me enjoying divine divinity, i can now add grown up enjoying bg3. i dream of bg3 and different paths and strategies, that's how i know this game good, real good. thank you larian, you've won my future support for everything you'll do. time to continue my search of an illithid cure. ps some doors are meant to stay closed"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"tldr if you're a fan of roleplaying games, you might like baldur's gate iii, but be aware, there are still bugs and annoyances. if you're a fan of bg and are expecting more of the same from bg iii, you might be disappointed or delighted, depending on your preferences, but know that it's quite different from the previous two games in the main bg series. the combat in particular, as it's turnbased rather than realtime, and while it has rules from dungeons  dragons, it's very similar to divinity original sin. if you're a fan of dos, you might like what's in the game, but it does have different systems for combat. all in all, it's a decent but flawed game that still needs polish. review i played it during early access, and i'm sort of disappointed with the state of the full game. there are some quality improvements in some areas, including features that were requested like better sorting, stack splitting, and such, but even considering those, the issues the game still has are still enough to weigh it down. customization the appearance customization is a big improvement over dos ii, and some options have been added that weren't in early access, but overall, it seems too limited for a game where you see your character's face so often. it's definitely not as indepth for face customization as bethesda's games, despite seeing your character more often in bg iii than you might in a game such as the elder scrolls where you hardly ever see your character's face. rather than choosing the features of your face, such as nose, eyes, etc., you're restricted to choosing from a selection of faces, with customization mostly being colors e.g. eyes, hair and addons e.g. eye makeup, tattoos, piercings. the piercings are a bit lacking, as even if you find ones that you like, they'll come with others that you can't remove. for example, you won't be able to choose between an earring and an ear piercing elsewhere, nor can you choose only one earring. the ability customization is pretty good, but as it's based on dd, it's quite limiting. unlike some other roleplaying games, you'll be locked out of certain features, rather than being able to do most things. for example, the wizard can learn spells from scrolls, but other classes cannot, and while some races have an ability giving better vision in dark areas, others don't. classwise however, there is multiclass, allowing for choosing an extra class later albeit, only on balancednormal and tacticianhard difficulties, and not on the explorereasy difficulty, and so, it isn't much of an issue as a result. story the pacing is strange in some places, and some content seems to have been removed that early access had. for example, the tutorial area has been streamlined, and certain character customization options are no longer. characters are hitormiss in personality, but it's good to have some oddballs to change up the pace. that said, character dialogue seems a bit odd at times, as characters can have outofplace reactions for their personalities and circumstances. dialogue is okay at times, and feels a bit limited at others. there are times when you might want your character to say something but must choose what the developers want characters to say. there are also times when your character will make comments on things. it's good to keep things lively, but it can be outofplace for a character and be pretty bad for roleplaying. audio and graphics the music, voices and sounds are welldone for the most. graphics are pleasant enough, though there are bugs where things start stretching and such sporadically. combat on the balancednormal difficulty, i found the combat to be quite difficult, and a bit inconsistent. during my first start of the game, the three enemies after the prologue caused a lot of damage to my characters, but on my second start with a different character, they were no issue. difficulty aside, the interface is quite unintuitive using controllers, and still a bit clunky using keyboardmouse. also, the interface varies greatly between controller and keyboardmouse, with the interface being very minimalist for controllers. exploration movement is very sluggish, and interacting with objects is quite the task. because of how object interaction is tied to movement, there will be many times where objects that would be easily able to be gotten in real life will be impossible to grab normally in the game. characters will sometimes run around a table to grab an object they could've grabbed from the side they were on, even though they grabbed another object from that same side. the camera is also lacking in its zoom options. modding as of this review's writing, there is still no official modding support. there are likely going to be tools like there were for dos iii, but for now, it's not bad as modders have made quite a few quality mods to improve aspects of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,one of the best rpg i have played don't remember the last time i got so excited about a game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"best crpg ever! thank you, larian team. i'm already played about 120 hours and didn't get tired. i hope larian will make more games like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"possibly the most worthit 60 eur i spent on games this year. having played a little of dos2 and dos, i knew what to expect in terms of combat turnbased, environmental effects, etc. and dialogue. it certainly lived up to the hype! i only started playing inperson, dnd oneshots with groups of friends, and this game feels very much the same way, and i love it! dialogue and their consequences are great the battle system, although could be slow at times, gives your tactical muscles some work out the art and landscapeenvironment are topnotch!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"played the game for a few hours and it seems cool, i will probably finish it a few times"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"one of the best games i have ever played. the attention on detail is incredible and the story for far is really good.companions are complex, maps are really large and with many hidden stuff and quests. game of the year for  the story progressing the atmosphere is getting a lot more creepy and dark!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"playing this game feels like being part of a fantasy tv series. i love the way the story unfolds, the choices are relevant to the player experience and overall the game is so immersive that often i can't even tell how much time i spent on side activities. a brilliant rpg experience!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,first game of this genre i have played for some 20 years. i am so glad i picked this up. it runs well on my aged pc with a 1080 card and i have suffered no graphical issues at all. the story drags you in very quickly and to me the game on normal is a fair challenge at first. the game is lovely to look at and quite indepth as it should be as a dd game. plenty of things to read and lots to try to understand but that is i guess part of the charm. i did not pre order or indeed buy it at release but watched some gameplay and thought why not try it. i am glad i did as i see no real hard faults in this game as of yet. oh did i mention there is no nasty microtransactions in this fine game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"absolutely stunning. it's not a bad thing, but you need to be prepared for some bloody battles. i just can't believe it will get better with next patch!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i'm not a big fan of rpgs, but bg3 is the first game i bought without playing early access and watching a minimum of material on it. a very worthy project, which we will not see soon. there are minor errors and bugs for which 1 point, they will be fixed and the game will be 10 out of 10"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"if you are reading this review to understand whether you should buy this game or not, then my advice will be very simple. give this game a chance. it doesn't matter if you're familiar with the dungeons  dragons series, other larian games, or previous games from the baldur's gate series. this game requires no preparation in order to start playing, although some understanding of dd 5e will be very helpful. it doesn't matter if you like the turnbased crpg genre in general. this genre is definitely not for everyone bg3 requires a lot of time to be completed. you will probably replay for several hours a single huge fight, which in the reality of the ingame world would last a maximum of a minute, without being able to speed up the animations of characters. it doesn't matter if you want full control over your game experience or if you give control to the randomness of the dice. most of the choices are yours in dialogue, and the world will respond to them. and if something did not go as you wanted, nothing stops you from save scumming when you quick reload the game to get the desired outcome the hell out of this game other than your own forgetfulness of pressing f5. on that note... it doesn't matter if you want or don't want that famous bear scene in your playthrough. want a scene with a bear? with a demon? with a vampire? with an alien? just with a character of the opposite sex? with no one? the world is your oyster. that said, it must be pointed out that this game has some things that might be annoying for some players. ally ai in battles might be too aggressive, so an npc you want to live will rush forward, will be focused, and will die in a single round of combat, so you'll have to replay the whole battle even if it was the 9th and last one of long combat. the inventory is too oldschool and requires a lot of management, especially if you want to swap group compositions from combat to combat. and bugs, which exist but are not regular and are actively fixed by developers. but still, these problems are not crucial and might be even better for this style of game, so i'll give this game 10. this is a game that has been created for many years by people who really love it. this is a game that does not try to  money out of the player in any way possible. this is a game that might be the game of the year at least, or even of the decade, or of all times. thank you, larian. praise the absolute!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"a love letter to baldur's gate 3, through the lens of a lifelong gamer ladies and gents, boys and girls, and all lovers of pixelated glory, gather round as i regale you with a tale of a video game experience that's unlike any other. you see, ive been basking in the electronic glow of video games since i was a wee lad of 6. yep, back when pixels were as big as bricks and controllers were corded leashes that kept you within a 2foot radius of the console. fast forward to now, a ripe age of 40. thats right, ive spent 34 illustrious years on this virtual journey, hopping from one digital world to the next. from the blocky landscapes of pong to the sprawling realms of the latest rpgs, i've seen it all. but nothing, and i do mean nothing, has quite rocked my socks like baldurs gate 3. let's put this into perspective. over the years, i've saved princesses more times than i've actually gone on real dates don't tell my wife. i've built empires, toppled alien invasions, and even made a digital duck jump over pixelated trucks. yet, all of that pales in comparison to the epicness of baldur's gate 3. why? well, for starters, the characters! oh, the characters! they're more layered than my mom's lasagna and thats saying something. conversations in the game are so riveting, i find myself questioning my social skills outside of it. why cant i persuade the barista like i persuade a goblin chieftain? i ask, as i sip my notsofree extra shot latte. then theres the storyline. its like diving into a book where you dont just read the words, but you live them. with every twist and turn, my heart rate oscillates like a roller coaster, and not just because of my age and questionable diet. oh, and dont get me started on the graphics. there were moments i had to pinch myself, and not just because i sat for hours and lost feeling in my leg. its the kind of visual delight that makes you wonder if you're playing a game or if you've been transported to an alternate reality. maybe, just maybe, my years of gaming have finally granted me that special power! in short, baldurs gate 3 is not just a game. its an experience. a tour de force in digital storytelling and a testament to how far weve come since those blocky pixels of yore. so here i am, a 40yearold kid, standing on the virtual mountaintop, shouting, this is the pinnacle of gaming! thank you, larian studios, for reminding me why ive been glued to the screen for 34 years and counting. here's to many more hours of losing myself and occasionally my legs in the enchanting world youve created."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this may be my favorite game of all time. so much story, beautiful graphics. depending on the person i could understand its not their cup of tea, but how can there be any negative reviews for this masterpiece. shame on you, negative reviews are for broken games and ones with ridiculous monetization. basically one of the goat"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,great game i don't like the camera angles at points. combat is good and inventive. story is so far interesting graphics ok but not amazing never played dungeons and dragons but it does have a table top aesthetic. you appear to have a lot of latitude in the way you do things.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this is the best game i have played in 25 years of gaming. and ive play loooots of games played this 30 hours in one week that wasnt planned!! i dont actually have the time to play that much, but i kinda abandoned my friends, family and even work somehow, for this game. a sacrifice, this game is more than worth."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,the best rpg based on a tabletop roleplaying game! there is a very wellported system of the fifth edition of dd with a bunch of its own additions that make the game more interesting and more comfortable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"never played dnd, nor previous baldur's gate games, i was never heavy into fantasy world. but here i am, absolutely in love with this game, there are so many situations where i'm left with a huge smile on my face when playing this game. i never really was a person to play through a story driven singleplayer game multiple times and here i just can't wait to start again and see all the different interactions. the story is great so far, i try to read everything i find and it's amazing how subtle, but meaningful it is. and the voice acting, my god the voice acting, it's simply amazing. i've been playing games my whole life and never got so immersed with the world and it's characters. and to think that such a gem  was brought to us in such a dark times for gaming, thank you larians."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game is an absolute masterpiece. the details, the tone, i iaughed, but also turned my face in disgust, i cheered but also avoided situations in fear. the amount of options you have to solve one problem are endless. this is what videogames should be, a complete game with heart and soul poured into to it. if it cost 200 it would still be 100 worth it, a breath of fresh air in this mess of a industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i've always found dd pretty daunting. never really played crpgs. this is a breath of fresh air. 40 hours in and barely half way through the story. great story, great characters not you gale. played this game until 2a.m. on day 1 and had to force myself to go to bed. a game hasn't gripped me like this since my teenage years. bravo larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"the best attempt of making a worthy successor to the original baldurs gate series after over 20 years. i hope with the mainstream success, larian will make an even grander game set in faerun in the future. there are only a few small things that i see as a step backwards personally firstly, unlike in bg1 and bg2, in bg3 there is no daynight cycle which takes away from immersion of the world. secondly i prefer starting small to see the progress of the characters in their journey into more fantastic areascharacters later on. bg3 started over the top in the nine hells, inside a teleporting illithid ship chased by dragons and more tieflings  that are considered to be rare  than humans in the first act. thirdly, i would love to have an option to disable the cinematic camera in conversations. i rather prefer to play the game fully in a top down view and let my imagination work on it, rather than seeing 3d models from closeup, where they lose their charm and fidelity. the models look amazing from afar, but while being unmatched for this type of game, they still arent good enough for closeups. conclusion for this reason i would give it only a 810. but i will add 1 point to the fact, that ive been waiting for a game like this for over 20 years now and i am just glad it happened, making it a 910."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i have never played a rpg with so many different ways of approaching the story or plot. it is amazing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,the new standard for rpg games. the time of mtx hell is comming to an end. thankyou larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,the game is not for me. it repels with an overloaded interface. entering the game world is timeconsuming and requires a lot of analysis. i would expect an easier entry threshold. the camera is also bad.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this game is so great. i've played it through with a friend now in splitscreen coop. it's just so much fun to experiment with the environment and abilities. there are things hidden everywhere in the world, so it's worth exploring extensively. great dialogue, great voice acting, nice graphics, but also a few graphics bugs now and then. a second playthrough is already in the works. the best game this year and probably one of the best in recent years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i don't remember the last time i actually enjoyed a game every single franchise is meh.... now but this game it has reignited my passion for games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i love this game. you must try it. new graphic makes game looks modern. its huge step forward in isometric games. but concept of neverwinter nights was also good.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"best crpg and potentially game of all time hands down, so much content and no battlepass, microtransaction"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"achei incrvel como em um acesso antecipado de um jogo pode me proporcionar tantas possibilidades de escolha, combates divertidos e estratgicos, uma trama instigante e um universo complexo como s dungeons and dragons poderia proporcionar. no consegui sair da frente do computador tentando desvendar tantos mistrios e descobri novos confrontos, e isso  apenas o acesso antecipado, o inicio do jogo, tenho certeza que a obra completa ser mais incrvel ainda!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"es el pinculo de los juegos de rol, cuidado hasta el ms mnimo detalle. es una sensacin nica cuando juegas a algo a lo que se le ha puesto tanto esfuerzo y cario. en definitiva una obra maestra, sin desmerecer otros grandes ttulos de este ao como zelda por supuesto, pero para mi bg3 es el goty de este ao, con diferencia."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,ich habe sehr viele spiele gespielt. doch keines hatte so einen hohen grad an liebe und detail in jeder kleinsten ecke gehabt! jede mechanik. die geschichte und auch die charaktere selbst sind sehr gut bis perfekt durchdacht und in sich logisch.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"bg3  dos2  bg2 the hype the game is a rare combination of many good things, but it's definitely not perfect, nothing is.  aaa budget indie funding  passionate developers  talented developers  experienced developers  honest developers  beloved ip normally no more than 2 of the above come together, especially with how normal it has become for developers to sell their souls to cunning businessmen with no interest in games or people. the criticism i see a lot of criticism that it's just dos3 and not bg3. i grew up with bg1 and bg2 and really liked them, but the combat always bothered me. these games were made to be a dnd experience on the pc but the combat in dnd is turnbased, while the combat in bg1 and bg2 is an awkward blend of realtime and pausing. bg3 does dnd more justice in terms of combat. likewise i can see the dos2 dna in bg3, but it is still a dnd game through and through that centers around the dnd city of baldur's gate, feeling a lot more matured and true to both previous bg games as well as dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i've just finished the game after 115 hours with a fair amount of afk time. going into act 3 the game was a rock solid 1010 for me, but after finishing the game i have to amend that to a 910. act 3 is noticeably lacking in polish, i had multiple quests bug out, some of which i couldn't complete at all and others that were ruined as a result. and the performance is really bad, with an rtx 3080 and 13700k i lost about 50fps going from acts 1  2 to 3, which made for a choppy experience. and while there were some great quests, the act starts off so slowly, i spent hours just exploring which was made less enjoyable because of the aforementioned performance issues. the start of act 3 is the first time i've felt bored playing the game. the length of some fights is another sore spot for me, especially when you add cc into the mix, waiting two minutes for your turn only to get stunned thus skipping it just feels awful, this really became a problem in act 3 with so many enemies on screen at once, the combat became a chore that i had to do in order to get more story content, which was incredible. this was made even worse due to certain friendly npcs bugging out and not movingattacking, which caused the game to pause whenever it was their turn i had this happen on the final fight and others. i think a lot of little things had just started to really grate on me by this point, especially things like the dodgy camera movement and fighting in buildings which was so cumbersome. and i can't count the amount of times the camera bugged during dialog so i ended up looking at a door or wall instead of the character. i know i'm being a bit negative but overall it's still an incredible game, with the best story and voice acting that i've ever experienced. i rarely get so invested into characters, but the character development was so so good. and the attention to detail was top class, everything in the game world felt connected, sometimes in unbelievable ways. my friends and i are planning to start a mp campaign now that we've all finished it, which should be fun, but i do hope that larian can work on fixing some of the issues i mentioned before we make it back to act 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i was expecting this to be good, i was a fan of the series since bg1 had both games and their expansions, also icewind dale and planescape torment and played them a lot!!! tried the early access for like 2 hours and left it on the side to not spoil the story and kept waiting for the full game to be released. tried to not watch spoiler videos and wanted to have an experience similar to first game, when internet was not as it is today. i got blown away with the game, this game not only gave me hope for gaming in general but it reassured me that as long as people with vision, passion and integrity work in this industry everything is going to be ok. don't want to spoil anything for others so i'm going to leave you with this. they worked their asses out, they had fun doing so, and we get to have fun in return. guys and girls if you like rp please go buy the game and play it. you will not believe what you'll get."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it's not perfect, but it's pretty close. no microtransactions. no battle passdlc. not needed to be online at all times. no bugs. no crashes 20 hours in with rtx 2070. gameplay it hard but fair. bg3 is the first rpg i've played that you can actually role play  create a character from scratch and interact with the world you the way you want to. not the garbage binary 'good or bad' responses that most rpg's have."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,best rpg i have played in a really long time. both singleplayer and coop are great fun. there is absolutely no downside to playing either or the other way.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,terrible game. very disappointed. terrible carmera controls and is a very slow game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,just created my account to rate this game. this game is one in a century game. it is one of the best games ever released.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,not very dar into it and i'm amazed at the shear amount of options available in every situation.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,one of the greatest games of all time. like playing a visual novel written on par with the works of the greatest fantasy authors.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,blatantly obvious some people have left reviews just to try and knock this game down. as someone that has never indulged in crpg games this one has me completely hooked. i think the fact this game actually challenges us to think and strategise is brilliance. i am currently 50 hours in and its blatantly obvious to me that the developers have done everything in their power to make this game for gamers. this game absolutely sets the gold standard going forward. if it can draw us in and make people enjoy a style of game that they previously had no interest in it absolutely must be considered the standard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i recently started playing dd with friends and was immediately captivated by the creative freedom and boundless ability to choose your own adventure in the truest sense. baldur's gate 3 has managed to capture the feeling of playing a real dd campaign in every way i could ever hope for. also, i kicked a squirrel on a nat 20 and it exploded. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"mass effect trilogy and the first dragon age were my favorite games for over a decade thanks to their well written and charming characters and enjoyable gameplay. never thought i would get that sort of feeling from a game ever again honestly. was running out of love and passion for the genre slowly but surely. with baldur's gate 3. not only did it reignite my passion but it became my favorite game of all time. the story, the characters like karlach my beloved tiefling sweetheart, shadowheart, astarion my bro. i just love the cast of characters.  you wyll this game despite it's early bugs is a masterpiece in gaming and to me. my new favorite game of all time. baldur's gate 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"perfect i haven't played such a good game for a long time. hope i can see another good game in the future, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i literally created a metacritic account just to leave this review. let's be clear  this is not an easy game to learn how to play. it's very cerebral and the mechanics have a steep learning curve, and it's made by nerds for nerds and if you're not a dnd or crpg gamer it will feel slow, meticulous, and complex, and there is so much choice here that it can feel daunting. but oh man after you get past the initial learning curve, you'll find yourself awed by this masterpiece. the immersion is so good that every act, every word, every second you do anything in this game has meaning  you will literally get into your feels playing this game. bg3 is a love letter from larian to dnd, and most importantly, us gamers who haven't had much to be happy about ever since data driven marketing and game design turned us all into numbers on a screen to be manipulated for cheap profit. larian, we salute you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"absolutely phenomenal! it was so easy to get pulled into the story, and i really felt as if my decisions had an impact on those around me. truly an amazing game, and i am so happy that wotc let larian make a game in the forgotten realms."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"amazing game. released with minimal bugs, nothing like the current state of aaa games these days. i've never been a crpg fan but i'm pretty hooked on this game. tons of content, choices, gear, story, exploration that you actually want to do to find stuff. my only complaint is the camera is sometimes not the best to work with. trying to look at higher elevation is a lot of times is not possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the long awaited spiritual successor to bioware in its prime. have spent time with this title since early access and watched this game transform from a early access bugfest to a masterpiece  that has renewed my love of modern rpg's. a game that rewards and incentivices creativity while offering significant player agency, and satisfying choice where once can be equal parts hero, villain or something in between. the character writing, romance, combat, attention to detail, and humor are some of the best i have ever seen in an rpg. simply put this is a must play for rpg lovers alike, and while there are small technical issues at time larian has proven they are very fast to patch things and fix bugs so i will not let those small things affect my score. an all time great game that will be remembered for many many years"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"ah to tell the truth, i expected much more from this game, but unfortunately it didn't deliver, at least for me, the combat system was good for me, but it didn't take long for me to feel tedious, and the straw that broke the camel's back is its story that barely the 10 minutes of gameplay my only wish was that this be over at once, i respect the work of the developers however the title failed to catch me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"wow! thats about all i can say. i will complete the review at the end of the first run, but probably i will say only another wow, and than start with the second run"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i never got into divinity series due to the way the dialogue plays out. i got into this because it has those mass effect  witcher 3 conversation cutscenes. i never like the gameplay in divinity but after playing bg3 for a day and i'm now playing it everyday. still in act 1, clocking in about 40 hours now. goty 2023 calling it now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"baldur's gate 3 doesn't just deserve goty but it deserves a special best pc game of all time award. the story, gameplay, visuals, sound, replayability, and every small detail in the game is masterfully crafted. the game that every gamer dreams of! larian studios have just made the best pc game of all time but also reignited the almost extinguished flame in gamers' hearts. they teach all the greedy developers and publishers out there how it's done and proved once more that great games are made with passion and, not with corrupted, corporate mindsets. a masterpiece to play for ages. thank you larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"excellent game, excellent history, excellent combat mode, a master piece and lesson for other companies of the industry. congratulations larian studios for this excellent job. i can't stop playing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,the new stand to crpg. you must play this masterpiece! this may be my favorite game of all time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"finally! a true masterpiece amongst all the generic copy pasted wasteland of modern videogames. an actual rpg where choices matter. please dont believe the negative reviews. if youre an rpg fan and you read through them,you realize that theyre completely irrelevant. like people complain about the game being slow and too many dialogue options? rate an rpg 0 because of that? if you want fast paced combat with a next to nothing story,go play diablo 4. this is a true crpg masterpiece. some bugs yes but you know that will be addressed shortly. so many developers promised and failed to deliver. larian did it. this is it! this is the game all future rpgs will be compared to and let me tell you,it will keep the crown for a looong time based on what the coming soon lineup looks like. if youre into action games,you can play assassins creed nepal or farcry afghanistan or whatever the next generic instalment will be. can you not spam reviews based on too many dialogues in an rpg please? knowledge is key"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"first time in a very long time i've been this excited for a new release. so many lately have been overhyped, overmarketed, overpromised and ultimately lacking. day 1 dlc, game breaking bugs, some that even cooked graphics cards. it's satisfying that i bought a game that feels complete start to finish. it's normal to have some bugs on a game release. there's no such thing as the perfect game, even when looking back through the nostalgia glasses, so it's not the expectation of perfection. it's the expectation of enjoyment and functionality without having to worry about microtransactions, time wasters, live service, and all of the other baggage that goes along with most releases these days. and this game by no means is completely unique in that regard, we've seen a couple that have been like that, and they deserve the same praise. the story is solid from start to end, and the largest complaint i could have about any specific section wasn't the content of the section but that i wanted more of it. wanting to follow questlines to their fullest, wanting to explore minor characters more fully and just be further immersed in the writing and effort put in. how so many references are a love letter to the previous baldur's gate games and faerun in general but also expands upon those things further, becoming its own thing in its own way. how it can make references to lore entirely outside the scope of the game, and make it meaningful but not devastating to those that don't know that lore. the gameplay is also satisfying. it uses 5e as a base, but makes several incredibly important changes that work very well for the nature of a video game and quite frankly some of them would be good for our tabletop game as well. the rebalance of certain features or entire class, as the monk goes works well, making thus far every class i have tried across custom characters and origin characters feel impactful. having a philosophy of fun over balance, but still maintaining genuine difficulty with many of the encounters is a masterstroke. beyond that we have the options available at any given point. in past crpgs we all experienced the severe limitations of how to complete the quests. that didn't make them bad i loved the neverwinter series, the baldur's series to this point, and both pathfinder games from owlcat. they're all games to be lauded and appreciated, being those that came before and the building blocks for those that came after. and build larian did. having played both dos games and seeing the progression from one to the next not only in engine but in story scope. rare in the old days could you take a quest and complete it in a completely different way. a few times per game. now i've found that rare are the times where there is only one solution. while these types of games will never have the modularity and freedom of a tabletop game, this is the closest that gaming has gotten to it. in reference to those twitter threads, reddit posts, and memes galore larian raised the bar. you may not like it, but it's happened."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i can kick people off a cliff and pick the corpse and put it on a bag 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i played divinity original sin ii, and it became one of my most favorite games. when i saw the first footage of baldur's gate 3 i wasn't really sure about all that dice rolls. i never played dnd myself, but i liked to watch other people to play some pp. at the beginning the dnd stuff was a bit overwhelming. but now i've played this game for about 40 hours, and i love it! i'm still in act 1, because there is soo much stuff to do. i can't rate this game less than 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,the best rpg in the world.i love it.i creat a acount to rating this game...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"unfortunately, is not common to see a game release with so much good content as this. that should be the standard! larian has reafirmed what we all where thinking for a long time instead of doing an unforgetable experience, most aaa developers are more concerned to get our money while delivering the bare minimum."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,sets up new standards. reminds of old bioware games. not finished the game yet but so far it's fantastic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"having finished the game i was absolutely enthralled the entire time. i never typically feel the need to 100 games and don't regret not doing it as if i am truely interested in the game i will watch videos of different endings and whatnot, but this game is different i focused only on my companions stories i had with me in combat, and i actually regret it as after the ending i want to see what its like getting everything done and getting the perfect ending where i complete all stories and go the good route. i will likely play through the game and go slower the next time which is a unique thing for me to do. i hope that everyone can give this game a try. it was so good i was almost a little depressed when i finished as i wish i could play for another 60hrs. i will have to attempt to play again and complete it fully... as perfectly as i can."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,larian studios has really out done themselves this time. and i dare say this is the best game that has been released for the past 20 years by any studio and i highly doubt that there will be any other game that will be this good for the next 20 years. and i really love that they are standing firm on their principles about not having microtransactions in their games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,an excellet addition to the crpg genre thats needs more quality games made by studios that loves the category and boy does larian deliver on this beter than most!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,just wow! this game has had me playing for over 30 hours in the first few days and it has everything that i need and want out of an rpg. huge dnd fam so this game hit some features right on the money
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,um jogo muito bom a nica coisa que no gostei foi que o descanso longo dentro do game afeta o jogo voc pode perder vrios eventos ento  um 9
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,im 20 hours in and i can safely say this is how games should always release. its dd perfexrly translated to a screen. hats off to larian studios.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,amazing game built for players over profit. there's so much content it's baffling.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,best rpg i've ever played.. there is a great gameplay a great story. one of the best dd rpg and a good choice to start with a game of thy type.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,meticulously crafted world. an all time great game. some technical issues but that's due to the sheer size of what's given.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i miss when i was able to sleep. that's the most complete game of all time, every npc have dialogues, the animals have dialogues even te deads can talk!! goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,best game i have ever played in my 35 year life. played 125 hours so far and i can't get enough. i never want it to end.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this is my first crpg and i've never played dnd, so i wasn't sure what to expect... it has blown my expectations out of the water! the story has been awesome so far i'm in act 1 still with about 35 hours played, and the freedom this game gives the player has made it even more interesting. props to larian studios for coming out with this absolute banger. if you are considering getting it but have never played a crpg, just get it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"great game. the deeper you go, the better it gets. there is no getting bored in area, top notch story telling, a graphics and it runs on everything from a gtx 1060rx580 at 1080high 60100fps locked to 4k 60 fps locked with maxed setting on a 10gb rtx 3080 fe. i haven't been this enthralled with a game since i was a child 30 years ago. this is absolutely absurd and i am not even a big fan of turn based crpg's! the writing, the options in combat and gameplay in general, this is almost like an entirely new genre. it's a crpg, but it's also an immersive sim. there are very rarely only 2 or 3 ways to get somewhere more like get there however you like. fly spell, give it a shot? fell like jumping down that chasm which says death? well you might die. or you might end up in the middle of a city miles below the surface if you cast a feather fall spell first. lol, you can stack boxes like minecraft to get over things, or shape change into a smaller creature to get through an opening. find the pixel perfect coordinates to manage a jump that even the devs didn't anticipate and the game reacts. wow does the game react. to the point where i had a character who received bonuses for not wearing any protection running around with just their weapon and otherwise naked. people were commenting. everything from the person's courage to how the area itself is going to heck in a handbasket. how they had the time to script out, to write out every dialogue tree for all of the options we can make as players is just beyond me, as this takes crpg choice and consequence to the next, next level. it's like baldur's gate 2, a new deus ex made by warren spectre himself with a team of 1000 and a decade's worth of dev time and xcom all had their game ideas smooshed into one genie wish and out popped baldur's gate 3. i could use all 5000 characters and still have far more to say about this game, but i'll close with i started playing crpg's way back at the age of 9 with pool of radiance. i've played every dd release on pcconsole since. i've played most modern rpg's starting with king's field and ff7 in the midlate '90s. love the first two bg games, loved oblivion, the mass effect series, kotor, dragonage origins, persona royale, wastelands 3, planescape torment and the witcher 3. cyberpunk too. had a blast. this is an entirely new beast. i thought i had freedom in deus ex human revolution and mankind divided? not like this. larian should be given a bonus by the gaming industry as a whole. this is literally unreal. i can only pray publishers will give other, smaller devs a shot at making more games like the this. the budget and the time. just as fantastic would major publishers letting their massive studios beneath them make games that are this in depth in other genres. this is the best game i have played since the witcher 3, perhaps the best since the original mass effect series...maybe the best since baldur's gate 2, which at the time of it's release was an absolute marvel. heh, and larian should license it's engine out to other devs so they can have as interactive a world as this one, because there is just no way they could have scripted all these possible decisions and had the game out in 20 years. it has to have some type of dynamic quest and story line adjustment because the game would break too many times if it didn't. unless literally half of the studio was tasked with implementing a solution for every possible choice they could think of and then sql'ing it  the entire 6 years of development. there is no other way this many choices would be possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it's the best crpg i've played for a long time. the same nolifer feeling i have for this game make me actually take breaks because i don't want this game to ever end. i scout every corner of the world and i'm still at act 1. i'm even thinking of rerolling a new party only to not progress further in the risk of ending it too quickly. this game, together with the others like the divinity orignal sins 2 is the best games i've nolifed. and i'm still not done with original sins 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. story is strong. depth and possibilities are larger than anything i have ever seen. there are a few bugs as to be expected at launch due to high complexity. if you are worried about facing a visual bug or two, then just wait a few months before playing this. i have completed the game and never faced any serious bugs i played first week after launch"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the choices you can make alone are just so amazing, voice acting, interwoven story lines."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"without a doubt the best game i've purchased in several years. larian nailed it on pacing and balance. the graphics are nice and the cut scenes are fun but the meat of the game is when you're immersed in what's happening and the results of what you've just done. that's where i'm having the most fun. no microtransactions, loot boxes or other megacorp greed to distract from a seriously well designed and written game. best purchase in ages!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,this game revived my gamer soul  after i played all this other games that feel like a second work instead of something to relax. usually not really my kind of game but surprisingly it took me hostage and i cannot wait to continue my adventure  i wish i could take some days off from work  and i am really happy that it runs so smoth with my 67 years old pc gtx 1080
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i probably tried every high budged rpg in the last 10 years and this is the fkn best! exactly what we needed!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game ruined my vacation, planned to go home to my parents, get some rest from the city. now i can't wait to get back to try and make my wizard monk work somehow... been following the game for a few years now and i don't think the timing could have been better. smack in the middle of the whole dd hype that's been going on recently. my only negative experience thus far was in combat when some enemies take a bit long to do anything, but that could be due to my pc's poor performance, 1110 game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the best crpg ive ever played since icewind dale. ive played almost all crpgs out there from bg1, bg2, pathfinder series, pillars, wasteland series even old school fallout, torment and tyranny. a perfect representation of the genre! story and companion development 1010 graphics 1010 difficulty 810 replayability 1010 lore 1010 larian studios deserves all the praise! a paragon that all game developers should aim for!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,aaa in the sense that this anomaly is awesome and addictive!  definiteley deserves to become game of the year 2023.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"literally created my account here in order to tell you guys that you can  without a doubt  trust the hype about baldurs gate 3. go ahead and buy it. as somebody who really really dislikes turnbased combat i was really worried that i might also dislike this game but boy was i wrong. it is everything that i wanted from a crpg. it kinda reminds me of the old elder scrolls days where you can literally do whatever you want and make it have impact on your gameplay. its so immersive, the characters are written amazingly and i just look forward to playing it over and over again. i really, really love this game and i hope that larian gets all the awards there are for this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"worth the investment in time to play, reminds me of me  me2, witcher, and swkotor for how much i enjoy the story. great job larian, amazing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this is one of the best games i've played in years. for a dd turnbased during combat game, it's really approachable for people not versed with dd rules. the cinematics are topnotch, and the variations in dialogue and combat is unbelievable. you can really think outside the box to approach things. i also love how developers from other gaming companies are upset because this basically puts them in their place. maybe they can take a hint and stop making utter garbage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"no gostei nada do game, esto superestimando pela nostalgia de dd, mas no traz nada que realmente inove ou valha a pena dedicar algumas horas nele!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"go and play it! the game deserves every accolade bestowed upon it and more. the music, animation, and dialogue work beautifully, in tandem, to  you into a world that leaves you unaware until the next morning's sunrise. larian's faern unfolds as your playground, a carte blanche to whims and norm defiance. a seemingly mundane pot lid evolves into a resourceful veil for a toxic gas trap, while a goblin child assumes the role of a meticulously aimed projectile destined for adversaries. the ensemble of companions, each propelled by their unique motives, presents a kaleidoscope of perspectives for nearly every undertaking. emerge as the protagonist reminiscent of cherished storybook protagonists from your youth, or embrace dark urge and become the embodiment of jack the ripper. the narratives seamlessly adapt to accommodate the distinct tapestry of your choices. with each subsequent endeavor, fresh dialogues and hitherto concealed discoveries surface. larian studios' love and meticulous dedication resonate through each blade of grass and intricately etched strand of hair  an enduring benchmark for the years ahead."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,one of the best  if not the best  rpg's that i've ever played. such a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,melhor rpggame que joguei!  perceptvel o carinho dos desenvolvedores por esse jogo. uma obra prima que transcende os videogames.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,this game is amazing. worth every penny. larian deserves every ounce of support and i absolutely love them. of course there are some bugs but with a game this size it is to be expected. goty
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"he visto bastantes gameplay, y al parecer todos le sale el mismo nmero en los dados en ciertas partes de la historia, las explosiones lagea bastante el juego"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,the game is really truly one of the best if not the best rpg game that has ever been made. apart from some sound glitches secret walldoors opening and closing and a few very minor bugs here and there it is flawless.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"made a meta critic account just for this game, 1010 game of the decade. could use more mindflayers tho"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"definitely the best invested 60usd nearly 4 years ago...from early access, the game matured into a ultimate masterpiece. story, music, gameplay, gfx and beyond everything, insane quality delivered without multicorporative greed and microtransactions. larian proves, once again, that they are worth every single second of your time. anytime again, larian! thank you for this fantastic experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"in an era where the gaming landscape is often marred with microtransactions, ingame purchases, and various other monetization strategies, bg3 stands out as a beacon of what gaming was and should always be about pure, unadulterated fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,an absolute gem. this game turned me from an 8 stone apology into two seperate gorillas
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i absolute love the game. so many things to do. the closest thing to dnd in a video game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game is amazing. simply put, this is the closest experience you can get to playing a full fledged tabletop rpg. i played a bunch of dungeons  dragons sessions and i can say that the feeling and sense of freedom is deeply printed in baldur's gate 3 experience. you want to solve conflicts peacefully? granted. want to solve things the harsh way? go ahead. it's your choice, akin to everything this game offer. for me, that's what's define this game as a masterpiece freedom in the way you interacts with the world and how it reacts to your actions. it's one of the best i've experienced in a long time, and truly deserves all the appraisal."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,larian's best game and the best crpg right now. this game is literally dnd on steroids and easily be the game of the year.larian's best game and the best crpg right now. this game is literally dnd on steroids and easily be the game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,amazing game! this is the first time in my life where i felt like i wanted to give a tip to the developers as the value is far exceeding the price.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"baldur's gate 3 is the best game of the year. the good interesting and varied combat encounters, with good pacing, and excellent balance quests are all actually meaningful. no one asks you to collect 10 bear asses for their stew. the quests are all heists, or vengeance plots, or rescue missions, or finding out more about your companions' pasts or whatever. it's brilliant. though the characters are mostly archetypes of standard rpg tropes, the excellent voice acting and presentation, as well as the reveal of backstory through quests makes for characters that you grow to care about over time. the overarching story is interesting and meaningful, with an immediate hook for all the potential party members to have a good reason to band together. it starts with smaller stakes and ramps up to something really powerful. choices are startlingly consequential, from the beginning of the game all the way through the end. the bad there's a lot of larian dna in this, which is mostly good, but also their penchant for strewing the area with 5,000 crates for you to open that are mostly empty or have a single rotten tomato or a broken net or whatever in them is annoying. you'd choose to skip them, only every once in a while they've got actually important items in them, so you spend a lot of time opening crates. the trap sections in this game are truly tedious. i don't mind traps in a game, but they could limit it to one or two per area. making me walk down a corridor or through a cellar, disarming 30 traps, gets very tedious very quickly, and it's very common. they make some truly bizarre choices in terms of mechanics. for example, why in the world do they make me select what ability score i'm hexing every time i reapply hex? and why do the icons for this move around so that the only ability score i care about  strength  moves around in the prompt every time i cast it? and why is it that all 6 of those options in the prompt use icons that are so similar you have to peer at them to find the one you want each time? the game is full of things like this. it's not always very clear when there's a time pressure on you to do something before some massively consequential event happens and npcs you care about die. the ugly the game still has quite a few bugs, some of which result in you dying or locking yourself out of something. i've started saving every 5 minutes or so and save scumming if need be to deal with it. this is still the first week of release though, so i imagine a lot will be ironed out. some of the mechanics don't work as advertised. for example, great weapon master says you have to be wielding a heavy weapon to use it, but i'm able to use it with a trident. reactions seem terribly broken. it's hard to know when or how they will or won't work, even when going into the reactions menu and setting them to always ask. despite the few badugly bits, i'm going to rate this a 1010, because it's still far and away the best crpg i've ever played, and the best game i've played this year at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"una sensacin de exploracin y descubrimiento que no haba sentido en mucho tiempo. la inmensidad del juego contribuye a que en la actualidad no abundan las guas ni los recursos en lnea, evocando la nostalgia de una poca en la que el internet no exista y la informacin se comparta de manera oral, como ancdotas de nuestras  de juego"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it gave me something to lose myself in again, i haven't felt this way about a game since i was a kid. buy it for your friends"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it reminds me to dragon age origins rather than baldur's gate 2. pathfinder wrath of the righteous is the inofficial succsessor for baldur's gate 2. nevertheless baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece, not only for its genre. it raises the expectations for the entire game industry. also people which only have interest in story and not fighting will have fun. every player will have a own unique story and resolve. it is almost completely bug free, dont contains any micro transactions and runs at 10 year old systems. yes it is english voice only, but 170 hours professional voice acting with this quality is incredible. not a single other game have voice for every squirrel, rat, cow, narrator line or npc. this one have it, 2 million lines of it..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one of the best games i have ever played. i am old, and old school. i have played all previous baldurss gate, icewind dale, planescape torment, elder scrolls, neverwinter nights saga, dragon age origins saga, mass effect saga i love crpgs, arpgs and baldurs gate 3 is so detailed, with so many options, a polished game, a finished game, no dlcs or micro transactions buy it, it is a must have. support it, so the aaa developers get the message. every time yo buy or boycott, you are sending a message and showing your power. use it well."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the game is really well made and polished, if it is your first time playing a turn base game i recommend giving it a try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i have such a disappointment rarely lives the game does not do justice to the great hype absolute failure
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"after nearly 140 hours into the game, having finished all three acts i have to say a couple of things. act 1 is about as long as act 2 and act 3 combined, with act 2 being the shortest, yet in my opinion the strongest of the acts as you actually get to see the main antagonists. this also brings about one of my major gripes with the game which is the lack of proper setup of the main bad guys you are supposed to want to beat. the writing is very hit and miss, which leads to some scenes being quite interesting and fun, and others sorely lacking. with that also comes the fact that every single companion has something very unique and rare stuck to them, without mentioning spoilers, these all in some regards really cancel each other out, making none feel very special. in addition to the lacking companions and failure of proper setups the romances feel very awkard and poorly crafted, which is also compounded by the fact that dialogues happen based on events that which never transpired in your playthrough. companions react and talk to you about things that simply never played out making it quite immersion breaking for many reasons. further compounding these issues is the poor optimization, especially in act 3, and major memory leaks from saving and loading the games. there are also no consequences for killing and stealing from every npc you meet, even your companions who are kind hearted don't bat an eyelid when you pillage through entire swathes of innocents versus bg 1 and 2 where they would react to your deeds and interact with these choices. however, on the upside the voice acting is easily 1010, and the gameplay about a 710 due to major path finding issues and ui issues which at times screws over entire fights, leading to reloads. the writing on the other hand is perhaps a 510, with moments of splendour and moments of 'what in the....' reactions to silly and outright stupid replies, or lack of possibly replies. and with the bugs and glitches, i'd give it a fair 610. with that being said, my last ending game cinematic ended in every character tposing or freezing, just like it did in the first opening 'fall' cinematic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,",      .        ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"can't possibly recommend this game enough. i'm about 120 hours in to the full game, finished my first playthrough with about 110 hours. no, act 3 is not perfect, but the game overall is by far the best bang for your buck you could ask for in gaming. the funny part is, this game is so damn good i wish i could give larian more money. just a masterpiece."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i've been a big fan of larian studios ever since divinity dragon commander. they've outdone themselves with the divinity original sin series but this game just launched them to stratospheric levels. there are bugs here and there, but it's almost negligible considering the game's insane scope. this game is all that is good in original sin, but none of its shortcomings. truly one of the best games of the decade, it's way up there to the likes of zelda tears of the kingdom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,this is my first time reviewing a game and i actually created this account just to review this one. baldur's gate 3 has restored my faith in at least 1 company that is creating games still. to play a game that you can feel the passion that went into development is rare and welcoming. 1010 recomend buying and supporting the team that created such a masterpiece

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"lets start with the disclaimer, the game has bugs and they are being worked on to the point you notice. the biggest in my opinion are in 5 hours i've locked up twice and there is an issue where cloud saving will lock so you cant save it says it in the corner continously. the cloud saving just means you turn that off in steamgog and turn of cross sync until you need it, then off again. the good parts i wont get into details but they have put so much obvious love and attention to detail into this being a real player driven narrative. i got myself into some trouble by calling in some npcs with a horn to help with a courtyard...they attacked a recruitable npc who them was hostile. i spent 5 hours playing this court yard a dozen different ways, all fun and keeping me going to eventually get the npc helpers murdered saved 500 gold! and split my party so some ran back inside and some across the  then after a long rest came back to find that npc in a sorry state but the quest fixed. larian has done what no one has tbus far for me, immersed me to a point i talk to everyone, i have every intention of playing through again at least twice and i'm in act 1 cleaning up the area. the quest line web is so interwoven if you look at players everyone has these moments that are huge twists and all unique to their play through. i can't recommend this enough and if you can, play with a friend group, but limit that group to one wold card player. my biggest complaint is the autosave, keep it event based but give me an option to turn on every 15 or 30 minute autosaves. i mean there are outright player death options in dialogue and with the other issues some redundancy is needed. need aasimar please  why 1010? play the game and figure out why these bugs are minor setbacks. now do eberron, i want my cherry barkblossom druid warforged and my changeling warlock coward."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,jogo lindo perfeito amei o jogo e j viciei nele um mundo grande uma boa explorao e uma historia incrvel
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"first off my review comes from the perspective of a huge baldur's gate fan. i loved the first and second bg and i have some expectation for the third installement of the serie. i am also a tabletop player for several decades now and have played most of the dnd based video games since early 2000. so as a stand alone game, it is good. the story telling is great and engaging. in truth it very much feels like divinity  baldur's gate edition over anything else. both divinity were good and this is a significant improvement over them, making it also a good game. as a crpg, three things are required for me to love it. engaging story, multiple pathways to attack encounters and great character building. bg3 is great on two of the three. it has a true engaging story and multiple pathway to adress the encounters. sadly the character building and combats are rather bad. i didn't remove too many point on this because the issue isn't really larian's fault it is rather a dnd 5e issue. in short 5e is a shallow rpg focused around roleplaying. this is fine to introduce new player to the tabletop game or for rp focus tabletop groups. but for a video game, it makes the combat experience pretty lacking. bg3 is fairly faithful to the tabletop rules of 5e. but this ends up being one of it's major flaws. i wont get too much into it as this will become a critic of 5e. as a successor to the previous baldur's gate it's ok, 510 at most. what it keeps from previous bg are great companions with opposing objectives, world view and affiliations engaging story what it is missing  bg3 railroads you in its story. previous bg would have the main plot as all game, but you would go off in the woods just because you could and you would discover new monsters and fauna along with engaging quests. bg3 does have sidequest and objectives, but they are very minor and not very engaging. the most engaging are the companions side quests. all are conveniently placed along your main objectives. bg3 story is fairly tame and lacks in depths and ''epicness''. previous bg were stories of godhood and divinity. the plot was built upon blocks that were set up from the very beginning of the the trilogy. bg would throw out the typical dnd module tropes in exchange for an epic story. bg3 embraces the dnd tropes where all playable character have to be of equal scope. this misplaced fairness in a video game trades the scope of the story for an equal multiplayer experience. this is a bad trade. being the companion of the bhaal spawn is far more engaging then having your own psychic power. what it gives instead a great multiplayer experience a simple dnd game, easy to pick up and understand without any tabletop experience unlike most previous dnd game  looking at you thac0 impressive graphics and very fleshout zones overflowing with content overall it's a good game. is it the best game ever? no not event the best crpg? no, go play other crpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,a great fully finished game that has gotten me back to binging games like when i was a kid. so many choices to make and im already thinking about my second play through. easily game of the year

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,mindblowingly good. a ridiculous number of personal choices to make. incredible combat system. interestinglovable characters. a perfect rpg. a little buggy here and there but aren't all great rpgs? and i'm sure most of that will get patched out anyway.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game is a love letter to the dd community and more so to fans of the original baldur's gate games. the gameplay is deep, fluid, and engaging. and best of all, the game is 'feature complete' so no microtransactions. i hope they are either working on new dlc adventures or on bg4 already!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,crpg80
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game is gorgeously well done. i have never been more obsessed with a rpg than now. the dialogue feels real, the characters have personalities. you can like and dislike them beyond evil and good standpoints, all while feeling like you are engaging with an actual human being. the spells feel powerful, everytime you lob a fireball or cast magic missiles, it comes off incredibly empowering from sound design to the characters animation and colorslighting. everytime i have my warlock cast eldritch blast, i feel like i'm ripping a hole in the games code, that's how powerful it sounds and feels. the story is topnotch. the world feels alive, with every decision you make affecting the world. and i mean every decision. there are not enough words to express my satisfaction with this game, so much so i wish i could rate this game an 1110. i would have gladly payed double the price, i genuinely think it is worth that much. larian did an amazing job, and you should definitely try it out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"as an old school ttrpg and crpg fan, larian really exceeded my expectations on this. visuals, sound design and story are all top notch. sure its not bug free, but for a game as massive as this, minor bugs are to be expected. and hopefully fixed soon. but its a 10 due to how much i am enjoying my first playthrough and im almost at the end. going to start another playthrough immediately after."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a must play for any pc gamer, this is dnd perfected in video game form. larian have knocked it out of the park with this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"spoken to friends, i'd swear we are not even playing the same game as we have had a completely different experience and story, cannot wait for my next play through and i haven't even got close to finishing my first."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"baldur's gate iii  uma verdadeira obraprima dos jogos de rpg, uma experincia que mergulha os jogadores em um mundo aberto deslumbrante, repleto de detalhes meticulosos e uma narrativa cativante. desde o momento em que voc pisa pela primeira vez no cenrio ricamente construdo deste jogo,  impossvel no ficar impressionado com a profundidade e a imerso que ele oferece. uma das maiores foras de baldur's gate  a forma como ele constri seus personagens. cada npc que voc encontra tem sua prpria personalidade nica e histria de fundo, fazendo com que o mundo parea vivo e habitado. a qualidade da escrita e dublagem dos personagens  excepcional, tornandoos carismticos e memorveis. desde os aliados que se juntam  sua equipe at os antagonistas formidveis, cada interao  uma oportunidade para aprender mais sobre este universo complexo. os dilogos em baldur's gate so verdadeiramente uma obra de arte. as conversas no so apenas informativas, mas tambm envolventes e muitas vezes divertidas. as escolhas que voc faz durante essas conversas tm um impacto real na histria, levando a diferentes caminhos e desfechos. isso cria uma sensao de agncia do jogador, tornando cada jogatina nica e recompensando a explorao das vrias opes disponveis. a grandeza de baldur's gate iii se estende para o combate estratgico. a possibilidade de controlar sua equipe de maneira minuciosa, definindo formaes e comportamentos em batalha, proporciona uma experincia gratificante. cada encontro requer planejamento cuidadoso, o que mantm o jogador envolvido e entretido. alm de sua narrativa rica e cativante, baldur's gate tambm brilha por sua incrvel capacidade de replay. a diversidade de classes disponveis para criao de personagens oferece uma gama de estilos de jogo nicos, cada um trazendo uma abordagem distinta para as situaes enfrentadas. essa variedade no apenas estimula a experimentao, mas tambm garante que cada jogatina seja uma experincia diferente da anterior. a liberdade de tomar decises diferentes em momentos cruciais da trama contribui ainda mais para essa sensao de novidade, mantendo a empolgao e o interesse elevados a cada vez que voc se aventura pelo mundo de baldur's gate. no entanto, mesmo em uma obraprima como baldur's gate iii, existem pequenos aspectos que podem ser aprimorados. um deles  o processo de criao de personagens, que, apesar de funcional, poderia ser mais elaborado e diversificado. mais opes de personalizao com sliders e no rostos predefinidos, poderiam adicionar mais profundidade a esse aspecto crucial do jogo. em resumo, baldur's gate  uma jornada inesquecvel para qualquer amante de rpg. seu mundo aberto meticulosamente detalhado, personagens ricos e carismticos, dilogos envolventes e escolhas impactantes na histria o colocam no panteo dos melhores jogos do gnero. o combate estratgico proporciona desafio e satisfao, enquanto a nica falha perceptvel reside na simplicidade da criao de personagens. no entanto, essa pequena desvantagem  mais do que compensada pela experincia monumental que o jogo oferece. preparese para ser transportado para um universo pico que ir cativar sua imaginao e mantlo imerso por horas a fio."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"with over 100 hours spent playing the fully released game, and the early access  i can safely say that this game has been the breath of fresh air the gaming industry has needed. another amazing game from the developers that brought you divinity original sin 2, they have poured their hearts into this game, and the care they have for the community has shown like diamonds. the storyline is well developed, engaging, and every character down to the smallest squirrel feels fully fleshed out and in no way 'filler'. the mechanics work well building upon the divinity combat system, and adding the dd 5e functionality. overall 1010  we need to encourage this level of care in game production."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it has been 23 years since bg2. they did not only top that game but exceeded in the huge amount of content for this one. the story is very well written, the companions are interesting, the locations are huge to explore, the many ways to solve quests and battles. the ultimate rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the best new game i've played in years. i'm not even that fond of turn based combat, but the combat manages to be fun for the most part. what is really special about bg3 are the story and characters. i get classic bioware vibes while talking to these companions and finding out more about their past. they feel like real people. the story is full of twists and turns and can be progressed in so many different ways. the amount of choices in this game is staggering. what makes it even more special is that those choices have long lasting consequences that you might not feel until 40 hours later. all of these things and bg3 still has a level of polish that puts most aaa studios to shame. it might not be, but this should be the new standard for rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game is something ive seen a lot of buzz around since about 2 years ago....i watched numerous videos and listened to various impressions , ive never played part 1 or 2. but i did dabble in dd years ago. this game has a learning curve and yes there's alot to learn 7 hours in i am hooked. i've been on a 3 year gaming hiatus , this game got me back into gaming. the systems are so deep characters so interesting weapons lore sidequests this is so fun to play and i  at the game but i love it . played on steam deck no fanboy crap .buying for series x when it comes out and ps5 in september."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"no spoilers i have over 100hours of this game. startet when it was first released in early beta and seen what larion has done to the game. the game has just continued to improve over the years and this final release has not disappointed! so many choices, so many different things to do. not to much hand holding and the possibility to mess upa very fun part of dnd. i highly recommend this game to everyone, even those that are not into rpg for the rp reason. the game has challanging fights as well fights where you feel like a god if you plan and prepare correctly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,game of the year! what a game! the graphics are stunning! i'm new in this genre and realy didnt thought i would like the turned based combat... but its realy good!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a near perfect game. i could nitpick a few qol issues, but they're miniscule compared to the masterpiece that is baldur's gate 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,this is my first crpg ever. also never had contact with dd. but this game won't get out of my head i just want to play it every single minute over the last days.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"larian devs are exited to see players enjoy and experience this wonderful game, while others shut down games and sack whole dev studios because it did not meet their  quota if they focused on the game instead of thinking up how to such more money off ppl"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,insane game. beter than any game i have played in years. gonna be the gotty for sure
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game is the closest any game has come to the tabletop dnd experience in a video game. it is far, far from perfect, however the sheer imagination and experimentation it does, with many of the highesthighs i've ever had in games, it gets an easy 1010 from me, even with some issues. i also wanted to add a 1010 review to drown out the only thing negative reviews are saying, which is game is gay, booo. ya, the game is gay, and it's great."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this rpg is a masterpiece, far superior to the latest releases from large companies, it deserves our recognition."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the new gold standard of the industry considering role playing games. if you'd told me that we'll have anything other than zeldatotk this years goty title, i'd tought you've gone mad, then comes this game and now i can't imagine bg3 not winning it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,feels just as good as bg2 did. some bugs but they'll be squashed in time. a gold standard for character customisation and story.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"goty contender for sure!! baldur's gate 3 is the new standard for all game developers and publishers going forward whether they like it or not. no gamer is going to expect baldur's gate 3 level of games from any indie developer, but we will be expecting it from all of the big budget triple a developers like ea, ubisoft, microsoft, sony, blizzard and others from now on. because baldur's gate 3 has once again proven that great games can be made without microtransactions, without massive day one patches, without horrific glitches, bugs and being an unfinished mess. so other developers now have zero excuses not to match bg3 in terms of game quality, gameplay and polish. larian studios is now the industry standard on how to make a good game and has proven that it's not impossible to make a good game and still remain within the 60 price tag. they have proven all the other studios to be liars that just want to do less work, with less effort, for more money. as far as i'm concerned larian games has my utmost confindence and trust with games. from now on when larian comes out with a game, i dont even need to ask if they worked hard on it, for me it's shut up and take my money. i can't sing their praises enough on baldur's gate 3 and i hope the absolute best for them moving forward. and if bg3 wasn't enough, swen vincke went and turned down microsoft on their offer to buy larian games. which in my book was a total gigachad move on his ! 10 out of 10, if i could give it an 11, i would."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"like a smartphone game.. subway surf is better .. dont buy. bad graphics, bad mechanics.. audio language not available in the most important languages 80 euros on the playstation store and 60 on steam for what? for an old game? there is much better. many people praise it just because it's the fashion of the moment, and everyone talks about it .. but let's stop for a moment and analyze this game in comparison to other games, and we will see that it is not worth that amount. they basically took an old game and just made the graphics better. it's 2023.. wake up"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a masterpiece ! firstly, for a developer to release a full game without any required updates, dlc or microtransactions is a breath of fresh air and should be a wake up call to every other developer out there. on to the actual game itself incredible! every choice matters, even the small, seemingly insignificant ones can alter the story in ways you wouldn't expect leading to a what if i did this differently? curiosity that makes replaying the game very satisfying. the combat although i didn't enjoy it at first since i'm usually not a fan of turn based combat is very engaging and thought provoking, encouraging you to use trial and error to figure out the best way to best enemies. and finally, the characters. oh the characters are so amazingly written, each having a very in depth personal quest that you can affect in a multitude of ways depending on if you have romanced them, they like you or they despise you. each companion feels important to the story, like they belong in the world and that their opinions and feelings matter to your own character. all in all, there are a million ways to handle every situation and that is what makes this game just so damn good. the developers should be damn proud of this and i couldn't recommend it enough!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a masterpiece, an incredible piece of work by larian that shows all the love for dd and worthy of the best of the year awards"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"amazing story, so many options and ways to make it unique. only issue i have is online coop you can't remove friends from your party."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i hate this genre of games. but i gave yhis game a chance. its best game ever i played the last few years. just wow
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one of the best rpg series from decades! deep story line, charismatic characters, a cool well designed gameplay if you like turnbased and yes, i would recommend this game to everyone. i hope larian keep this mindset for incoming new games or dlc and show to the game industry, they can make different, btw don't waste your time reading some worthless reviews here, some people are just jealous or don't understand how quick world changes and be fair to everyone not just a part of it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"amazing game with a gripping story, savvy and deep companions, an almost infinite amount of gameplaycombat choices, and story decisions that impact even the smallest of quests. the game is dark yet whimsical with nuanced characters from villains to companions to random npcs. even the animals in this game are entertaining. although some aspects fall a bit flat such as act 3 and a particular companion quest, the game itself outshines these flaws making them barely noticeable. 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"best rpg ever, musics, game design, dialogs. good job larian, it will be a very long journey in this game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"only 20 hours in but i can already say this is a 10 for me. im defenetly biased us i play dnd and love baldurs gate 2 and ofc larian divinities. but in all fairness its an incredibly polished game, very unbuggy even though i lost 1 hour of gameplay because i got affected by the cross save bug, which they patched quickly. music is amazing, facial expresions real and voice acting superb. lastly multiplayer is a blast, very easy to jump into someone elses game. such a feature complete game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,beat the game in 80 hours of playtime and i can't wait to start a new character and try different things. this is a game that makes you want to keep playing it over and over to see everything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"an absolutely incredible game and experience. overall, if it wasn't for larian themselves, i would likely give this game a 910, but just due to the sheer care put into the game as well as the consumer friendly decisions no microtransactions, no drm, they deserve the 1010. as far as the game itself, it is a truly remarkable experience. i just finally beat the game after 141 hours played. overall, it was just incredible. i have never played a dd game because i always felt they would pale in comparison. this game reminded me how fun it is to play a character. i spent over 2 hours in character creation alone. from the absolutely incredible perhaps some of the best even voice acting i have ever heard, an environment that keeps you guessing what's next, and turnbased combat that had me on my toes trying to figure out what to do next at times, this game truly delivers in every way. i loved how it looked, i loved how it played, i loved the story it delivered. to me, the tale  rpg is one where you are considering your next character by the end of the first play through. i was considering my next character by the end of the first act. there are some issues, to be clear. act 3 can be quite buggy. i came across several bugs that at times i would need to reload earlier saves to resolve. but bugs can always be ironed out. a game needs a good core concept or it can never be fixed, and this game has it in droves. the only real criticism of the game itself is that i did feel as though the ending was missing just a bit more, though not nearly as much as some feel. i just feel like the end could have been slightly more fleshed out at certain points. still, this did not hinder my enjoyment by much at all. i'll say this. there is a singular point in the game where you are fighting this individual who you've been having a mental dance with for some time. during this fight, the music because a duet between this person and someone else, and this person literally sings in the song, as you fight them. it is such an incredible and fun and just... unique moment. i cannot recommend this game enough. tldr  an incredibly beautiful game with dense storytelling, incredible amounts of player choice, combat that will test your mettle or not if you just choose easier difficulty, and some of the best music and voice acting i have ever heard. if you are interested in a game that has more cutscenes that any game you have ever played and have an interest in turnbased combat, you should absolutely try this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"no season's pass, no content cut dlc, no battle pass, no obvious cashgrab micro transactions. no forced online for a single player game. hundreds of hours of content, and infinite replay value. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,freedom in a nutshell! no game come closer to an original dd experience in 2023
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a masterfully crafted piece of art, characters are captivating, story is amazing, every quest and act feels unique, and i can't get myself to stop playing it. it stole my heart and is absolutely one of the games that everyone should at least try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i already put in 120 hours in 9 days of release and im still in my first play through, do with that information what you want the game is incredible"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"aps 207 horas do jogo eu ainda no finalizei a campanha. jogo da dcada, obrigado larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"games is too filled with cutscenes, the gameplay is just boring, i just don't like it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one of the best fantasy rpgames ever made! i can't believe how good it is in so many aspects. everyone here giving 0 ratings is either just trolling or trying to downrank the game because heshe doesn't like one specific aspect, that mostly hasn't anything to do with the gameplay or overall quality of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i have played many kinds of different games, i found which ones i played a lot more than others. i did not find my self playing turn base comabt. dragon quest 11 being the only exception. i tried the game at a gaming convention when it first became early acess, even with just 20 minutes of playing a was not too impressed to be honest. but now i can truly see how much they changed quality and gameplay. i had not had this much fun with a game since elder scrolls 5 skyrim. if this game dose not win game of the year i dont think anything else could even compete unless starfiled is a absolute banger. either way, no game this year will top this flawless masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"amazing game. more than 50 hours played and i cant stop playing it. i thought that i wouldnt like that type of games, ive never played something like this and im so surprised."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i'm 48 years old gamer and bg3 is how games use to be make, i understand that most who will read this post are young and didn't see how games use to be make and sold. bg3 shows how gaming was made and should be, it is a smack to the face of money grubbing companies who have subverted the gaming industry for their own greed. if game makers can't or will not step up their quality and ethics of game making then i say let them tank. we need better games and less money garbing game developers like it use to be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"well after all the game is really good so far ive played it looking forward to see if its frontloaded or not and how the mid to end content will be but its realy disappointing that the triple a releases these days no longer go the extra mile for locaiized audio. for me its a horrible descicion. but hey maybe the fans will make a mod to solve this thing, like they have to do all the time for seeral aspects inside of games, to make sure that the poor devs dont have to pay extra money to do it directly and clean in their own game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"a liberdade e consequencia traz o que h de melhor em um rpg, so tantas possibilidades e suas possiveis consequencias que eleva o jogo ao extremo. vai ser dificil, alguem nos trazer uma joia dessas to cedo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"thank you larian from a close to 40 yo gamer. i think if it's not the best, no screrw it, it is the best game i have played in my life. baldur's 1 and 2 are some of my fav games of all time never thought to be surpassed. fell in love with gaming again which i thought was impossible. fck the modern 3a industry, i am still speachless i got this masterpiece for this price and no mtx. just buy it. no words."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"poor multiplayer code, pretty poor animations, mediocre rpg. after divinity original sin that is pretty weak game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"videogame perfection. this is what all other game companies should aspire to do, and this should really be the standard from now on from this price point. congratulations larian studios, you guys renewed my hope in videogames."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,gigantic game with ton of choices. very good writing and incredible voice acting. i loved larian since divinity original sin and glad to see their coronation from so many people. crpgs are not dead ! and let that be a lesson to other to show that you can produce a finished game without day one dlc !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,it is the best crpg i played since dos2. thanks larian to bring this masterpiece to us. i really enjoy every moment in game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,to be honest i thought i lost touch with video games and hoped starfiled would have rekindle that feeling but this game did it for me one month sooner and im thankfull for it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,very good game. absolutly stunning. feel perfectly. amazing game. just play
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"finally, a game thats actually finished at launch you know a game is good when developers are complaining about it, and worried it may raise their expectations. this, and remnant from the ashes 2 has been a breath of fresh air with all the diablo fours that have come out this year.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"such a big game with so many hours of playing, so much content in one place. the graphics are stunning and i am in love with the music. the perfect way to put dnd in a videogame, i havent had this much fun in a long time, literally cant get my eyes off the screen. absolute masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"good game, but there are flaws in the release, i hope that the game will receive lkw and so on, this is a new witcher in this genre"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"es el mejor crpg de la historia. me recuerda a mis partidas de dnd pero claro, junto con los grficos, la historia, todas las variantes que tiene. es simplemente el mejor juego que se haya podido crear de este estilo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"it's larian, after all. one of the few studios left who still make games to make a good game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,one of the greatest games of all time and a new milestone for dd in video games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,larian showing the industry how it is done. much needed game in a landscape full of boring cookie cutter games. no micro transactions no filler. amazing story with great combat and graphics.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"never played a real rpg game before with dnd rules and all that. so i was not sure if i was going to enjoy the game but hey, let's try. played 15 hours per day for 6 days during my vacation. this game is so good. you can chose so much things and it actually has a meaning in this game, different ending, real choices. it's beautiful, the music is cool, the story is cool and i'm not a fan of story based games. probably my goty so far, even if zelda was good too. 2020 would buy again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"just registered to metacritic to support bg3. this is the best game i have played in the last decade, by far. easily on my top 5 games of all time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"for the first time in a long time, a delivery on freedom and choice. a game that sets you in control, you choose how you want to take on this world"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"definitely, this is the best thing that has been in the rpg genre over the past 20 years. during the game, i experienced the same thing that i felt when i played fallout 2 a long time ago. the game just took me back to my childhood. many thanks to larian studios for this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i also made an account just to give this game a 1010. the lack of scummy monetisation, the engaging story and characters, the fun mechanics and gameplay have all made me fall back in love with video games, after more than a decade of slowly declining interest. awesome game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the most close to a dnd campaign ever made in a video game, absolutely crazy the number of ways to approach a situation and the freedoms that they offer you, where you think that the game will not allow it, as it turns out that it can be done, or that there is another way to reach, achieve or complete the mission beyond the confrontation or the dialogue, it is a magnificent game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i've completed game in 90 hours and now i'am in my second playthrough, this is beautyful peace of art and i am absolutely love it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,this is the ultimate roleplay experience in video game form as of 2023. other developers should learn from this game instead of throwing shade.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one of the best games of our decate. the dedicated work shows and this should be a lesson for all the big gaming companies that are only revenew driven and where the budget omly shows for the marketing phase, but the games end up solulless shells."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,grats for the best crpg game of the year. more just the one year. 100 hours and this is not even limit.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game was not hyped in my friend circles, even though they have played dnd for quite a while. i'm bad at dnd and don't enjoy the dnd combat style. that's why baldurs gate 3 has been an absolute slam dunk for me. this feels like an insane breath of fresh air compared to even elden ring, which is another game i love to death. i did not expect to be a fan of the turnbased topdown combat style but i've become addicted to it. the one thing that should be considered as a bias is that i play this game with a group. i cannot say if this game would be as fun alone unless i was a hardcore fan of the combat, which i might be by the end of our run. i have clocked 20 hours into the game and haven't even completed act 1, and i have heard that act two and three are both longer than act one. i am extremely excited to continue playing baldurs gate 3 and hope that larian are able to take home goty with this modern sleeper hit."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the best rpg in the decade, but for me, at all. a lot of times it reminds me my youth when we played dice and paper rpgs. a lot. the graphics, the animation in the cutscenes and the voice acting is amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i can say i signed up for metacritic just to give this game a good review. i played the og games and i am 30 hours into this game. i can not stress how much i love this game.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this game, which i didn't expect, made me love dungeon and dragonstyle rpgs. i take immense pleasure in playing it. i own up to my mistakes and choices, and i find it really enjoyable to have a game where sometimes the 'hero' is not perfect and can't save everyone. i also enjoyed searching for answers about the dungeons and dragons rules. one might think that stepping out of the game to understand everything would be negative, but in reality, the game is so exciting that you want to uncover its secrets. i definitely endorse this game to all roleplaying game fans i speak french"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,just an insanely great game. as a young teenager in the late 90s i would get wrapped up in the fantasy worlds of video games and how they seemed to be built for players to truly escape into and enjoy. i haven't felt that way for years and years... until now. this is the greatest and most important game of the last 20 years...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"amazing game, worth every penny, if you need more proof of that look at all the other studios crapping their pants over how much better it is than anything they will ever make."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this is what a perfect old fashioned gaming experience is like, we hardly get aaa level games that reminds me of the good old days where i felt valued as a customer... where i feel like i got the full experience for my money... now the game itself is also absolutely fantastic, the cutscenes are beautiful, the story has really picked up for me and is very well structured, they even managed to make a turn based gameplay system feel fast and efficient and ever so fun... larian has outdone themselves and the entire industry here and anyone who's unsure about it needs to give it a go or at least support this studio... amazing stuff larian, i'm absolutely thrilled to know you're in this industry and pushing the limit for us old soul gamers and newer fans alike. you all should be proud of yourselves, for caring about your consumers, doing this old classic series justice and bringing the world of the forgotten realms to life so faithfully and masterfully... bravo!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"hours of gameplay, countless memorable moments and an almost infinite range of outcomes, baldur's gate 3 shines in everything it does. i played early access for quite some time and am so happy for the larian team's success. if you love roleplay games of any kind, both digital and tabletop, bg3 is a must have. even if this is the last game larian makes, they have already cemented themselves as one of, if not the best crpg makers in gaming history. with that being said i look forward to any new projects they make."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"not just the rpg ever, but the best video game ever made. kudos to larian. that is saying a lot considering the decades of games i have played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"it would be a waste of time for me to ramble on when in all reality, after what i would believe to be almost a full playthrough, i probably haven't seen half of what there is to see in this incredible dungeons and dragons based rpg from larian. the amount of dialog options, story paths, encounters, and events in this game is absolutely astounding. even compared to the bioware and black isle games. the 5th ed. dd system lends itself perfectly to these types of games with loads of actions and spells available depending on your class and level. the story is as compelling as i've seen in any video game regardless of platform or genre. i find myself being constantly blown away by the twists and turns along the way. technically speaking, it's also a gorgeous looking game and runs very well on my midtier system and still looks great with many of the bells and whistles turned downoff. the character models are ridiculously detailed and convey a more than adequate amount of emotion. especially compared to some other games in this genre. spell effects are a. the voice acting and sound are top tier as well. tldr this is far and away the game of the year. even if you're not the biggest fan of this genre is probably worth a try for the story alone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"it's baldur's gate 3, divinity original sin 2 and dragon age origins mixed together with nextgen graphics. so what does that mean, it means they made a dream rpg game, atleast for turn based rpg genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,it's just so refreshing and nice to know that there are game devs that just want to make games and release them in their entirety without having to milk the fans or have parts of the game locked behind a paywall  there is love in this and it shows  the game is perfect  don't really care for the bugs cause look at what we got compared to 99 of most games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,simplesmente o melhor rpg que eu j joguei na minha vida a larian studios esta de parabns pelo excelente trabalho
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"best game in years. proves games don't have to be shooters or action games. gorgeous, challenging if you want it that way and also has puzzles. larian put a lot of time and money into it and it shows. ea has a lot to live up to with dragon age 4 next year. i mention this as they are of the same genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"estou ainda com 50 horas de jogo, mas  excelente! quem gostou de divinity original sim  uma tima recomendao."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,divinity gate 3. not baldur's gate. sound is not as nice as the original. turned based is too slow. camera mechanics are clunky. cinematic zoomins are obnoxious. please zoom out and not show me hideous cgi closeups. speedrun the game with wizard in 10 minutes with gale and feather fall.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,i've been waiting for a continuation of this series for years and while a little limited in someways compared to the previous games it also has added enough to make that limitation almost unnoticeable. i can happily say that this is now one of my top 7 crpgs and i can't wait to see what they do next.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"a really fun game with great dnd mechanics baked in. a captivating and cohesive story with interesting characters. after recent disappointing games and fantasy series ill keep these anonymous to prevent heated debates, its truly exciting that there are still good writers out there and great stories to be told. the game itself is great as it allows you to do almost anything you can put your imagination to. it is also extremely fun to share the experience with friends. on top of that it has great music clearly inspired from divinity 2, amazing combat and impactful story choices. highly recommend for all fantasy fans!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,just wow. best rpg i have ever play. i dont have time to play but suddenly night od my best friend.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"blizzard stop sending your employees to vote down this game. 9000 failed to make a good game in 5 years, i doubt they are competent enough to find the 0 button. and to all the this is a slow combat game ... you are stupid. i loved bg12, but missing turn based was a weakness of bg12 and a strength in games like pathfinder after they introduced it. it's dnd, not your daily kiddy clicker game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i have not experienced such emotions probably since i had been playing the witcher 3. the game is very fascinating, you want to understand it, it throws up unexpected moments and immerses you in yourself, you want to associate yourself with your hero and you experience the events in the game as your own, especially knowing that the further outcome depends on your actions. i am delighted with the efforts of the developers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"completely overrated! the game does have strong points  variability, locations, but the minuses are much more. it's long and tedious battles that depend on random, constant f5, and if you don't have it, fight half the creatures you encounter because your choice is random. really good roleplaying element no. in this day and age where it's common to criticize every game project, baldur's gate 3 somehow gets by without it. people have been brainwashed into thinking it's a 1010 masterpiece. the game is frankly average though. 610"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"es simplemente increble, recomendado al cien por ciento, te puedes entretener por horas sin problema"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i'm halfway in the act ii and can say that this game is great so far in all the aspects. didn't enjoyed any game like this since elden ring. bless you, larian. edit lowered my rate from 10 to 8 cause' act 3 is very buggy even after the latest patch they managed to get rid of one chunk of bugs but also accidentally created new ones. not to mention that acts 12 ran smoothly on my pc but during act 3 poor lad is suffering like he's getting ready to go to valhalla or something and game is lagging in the process also act 3 felt a little bit rushed towards the end. still a great game, though. waiting for the new patches to improve the quality of the whole experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"somehow chill, exciting, fun, immersive and more alive feeling than any game ive tried. the world changes based on you on so many levels. i dont even like these types of games or dnd but i couldnt recommend the experience enough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"a carefully crafted and cohesive story, wonderfully voiced conversation, and beautifully rendered environment. what the developpers at larian studios did is nothing short of spectacular and deserve the highest of praises. the world of faerun is blooming with details and secrets, dungeons and monsters, love and intrigue, which will leave you sinking hundreds of hours to complete the campaign. this game is a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"in nearly forty years of playing computer games and roleplaying, this game is a highlight. i cannot recommend it enough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,i hate term based rpg but this one is other i am obsessed with this game its one of a kind ... the game play the songs the story all make a perfect game .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"a great game. larian did an excellent job in following up bg2 with this new chapter in bg saga. story, game mechanics and graphucs everything is praiseworthy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"just perfect, a masterpiece of larian studios nothing more need to be said."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"finally the game to unite everyone who likes rpg and bring new people to this niche genre. i know it's a game that was treated and taken care of very outside the curve of the games market, but it's inevitable that from here onwards, the public wants rpg's from that level forward. the immersion in the story, the feeling you develop with the npcs are linked to an extremely wellcrafted gameplay. it's what every dungeons  dragons player has always wanted."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i played this game for years in early access, and while i had a great time, i had resigned it to one of those games that was just far too ambitious of a project to ever see completion. but boy, was i wrong. while the graphics arent anything particularly impressive, the storylines are some of the most creative, wellthought and enticing of any game i have ever played. the combat mechanics, as well as the roleplay mechanics, are intricate, but somehow also easy to learn as you level up. the characters are flawed and likeable, while the puzzles leave you with a satisfaction that other games lack. i made an account on ketacritic to say this this is as close to perfect a game as i have ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"larians magnum opus. immersive, rich and lovingly made with addictive gameplay. it feels like playing a game, reading a novel and watching a movie in perfect balance. perfect entertainment, with some technical imperfections which must be forgiven in a game of such dramatic scope and depth. bg3 is what happens when people who love gaming make games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one of the most polished games of the last 10 years. brings back excellent memories from bg1. depth is insane, story is good, freedom is complete. 1010 rpg."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i feel like this game is being unfairly review bombed by trolls. to me this is a return to story telling that has been missing since the days of baldurs gate 2, kotor, and dragon age origins. its refreshing. i dont understand any hate against the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"in my opinion baldur's gate 3 is one of the best rpggame on our modern systems but it has problems. baldur's gate 3 is so good that its making my partner mad on how i spent most of my time with this game jokingly. baldur's gate 3 has been one of the the rare games that eat me away with its impressiveness and complexity of its story, system and combat. its graphics is not that state of the art when it comes to graphical fidelity but it can still be a looker with its different location. baldur's gate 3 will drag you with its story and the characters you meet, with their story really captivating both in companions and other quest that you will encounter. but, it has its problem. baldur's gate 3 is not a perfect game. baldur's gate 3 suffer from the mass effect writing when it comes to romance. characters would fall for you in a fast paced setting that will shock you on how everyone is very into you. but, expanding on those romances can blossom into something that is very interesting and engaging they just had a bad starting point. one of the problem of baldur's gate 3 problem is the camera angles and control. sometimes, camera would get stuck on environment where its a struggle to fix to the point of awkwardness of its control. overall, even with those problem this game is i consider this game as a contender to the game of the year spot, with its long hours campaign that is strangely not over stretch that has quantity and quality built into them and compelling characters with intriguing background. the gameplay is rough and hard but satisfying nonetheless. overlooking the graphic fidelity, it is still a good looking game that has a quality of a triple a game that can serve as a blueprint on how to nail a perfect rpg. this game is a 9.9 for me but 10 would be a good score overlooking the problem that it has. larian studios deserve the praises that they get with a banger like this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this is just dd as a video game and as i heard, if you like dd then you'll love this game, if you don't like dd then you'll still love this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i havent finished my first coop playthrough yet, but already started solo campaign. great replayability, liked the character creator, liked the story. goty 2023 for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"until playing this game, i was not into turnedbase combat or single player experiences. but now i'm addicted and eager to join my friends in a coop campaign. loving just how much thought and effort was put into this game! let it serve as a lesson to all the studios that have been creating games of lower and lower quality over the past 5 years or so."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,what a work of art. they deserve the hype and praise. not to mention the message this sends to the industry. massive respect to larian.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"ningn juego haba dado tanta libertad como bg3, llegando a unos limites exagerados y abriendo unas posibilidades que solo haba sentido en rpgs de papel y boli. entiendo que entre los mas veteranos que disfrutamos en su da de bg1 y bg2, puedan echarse de menos ciertas caractersticas sobre todo en el combate, eso no quiere decir que las nuevas mecnicas sean malas, creo que estn realmente meditadas para adaptarlas a la gran interaccin que hay con el entorno. el nivel de como se desarrollan las historias de todos los personajes y como se entremezclan unas con otras, es de un trabajo demencial y con lo que larian ha dejado en evidencia a la industria del videojuego. sinceramente ahora mismo es goty 2023, salvando los juegos que quedan por salir, y casi podra decir que es el juego de la dcada."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"definitely the best game of the year so far, the amount of things to do is quite frankly insane i have spent 35 hours playing since release and have just started act 2 and if it continues as it is will likely be my favourite game in the last decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one of the greatest production of the last decade, truly. this title does everything that a great rpg should provide a ton of customisation and player choices with consequences, a great production in term of story and music and a deep satisfying combat system. everything mixed in a complete deliverable with no microtransactional  if you love classic rpgs andor dungeon  dragons you'll love this game. if this is a genre new to you, i cannot think of a better game to start it will be a lot to take in initially but it will capture you and never let you go. a masterpiece for the ages."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"um jogo incrvel, um verdadeiro rpg no sentido de interpretar o personagem. a liberdade  muito alta e o combate  ttico, pode ser preciso que voc aprenda a gostar de jogos por turnos, pode ser difcil no comeo o combate, mas vale a pena, jogo incrivel, mais de 600 magias, diversas raas e possibilidades."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,simply amazing! one of the best rpgs i have ever played. pretty rare to find games like this now a days
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"man this game is so good that it made me sign in in metacritc just to give it a 10 man i was really so surprised when in act 2 after 30 hours of game play, choices i did 25 hours ago had different outcomes and they are extremely different, i dont think any other game in the history has ever done this, i hope no one buys the aaa crap other studios are offering now a days because thanks to larian we now know what games are capable of being"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i had high hopes for baldur's gate 3, given the legacy of its predecessors, but it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed and frustrated. the game seemed to have all the right ingredients for a memorable rpg experience, but it fell short in several key areas that left me questioning the direction of the franchise. first and foremost, the game's technical issues were a major letdown. from constant crashes to buggy gameplay, it's clear that the developers rushed the release without proper quality assurance. it's incredibly frustrating to be immersed in the story only to be abruptly pulled out due to a gamebreaking bug or a sudden crash to desktop. speaking of the story, it lacked the depth and intrigue that fans of the series have come to expect. the characters felt onedimensional, and their interactions often felt forced or unconvincing. the main plotline failed to capture the epic scale and intricate storytelling that made the earlier baldur's gate games so memorable. it's as if the writers missed the mark on what makes a captivating dungeons  dragons adventure. the combat system, touted as one of the game's strengths, left much to be desired. while it attempted to blend realtime and turnbased mechanics, it ended up feeling awkward and clunky. the ai of both allies and enemies was often baffling, leading to frustrating moments where victory or defeat seemed arbitrary rather than skillbased. furthermore, the game's pacing felt off. it dragged in some places, and the world felt empty and lacking in meaningful exploration. i had hoped for a rich, vibrant world to get lost in, but instead, i found myself trudging through uninspired environments with little incentive to explore beyond the main quest. in conclusion, baldur's gate 3 is a disappointing entry into a beloved franchise. it lacks the polish, depth, and charm that made the earlier games so special. perhaps with future updates and patches, the game might improve, but as it stands, it's a missed opportunity to carry on the legacy of the baldur's gate series."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,everybody that rates this game as a zero has zero clue what they are talking about.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"it looks pretty, i give it that. story might be good, but i have no idea since i can't progress far enough to experience it. aparently i am too stupid for this game. it might be awesome for players who know dnd but to me it feels like playing an excel sheet where every formular gives random results and nothing is really explained. i can imagine that it's good for the right audience but it's not for me who just wants a chill experience after a stressful workday."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i really can't say more than the welldeserved accolades this game has already received. bg3 is easily the best game i have played since witcher 3 indeed it may even surpass it. if you love crpgs with wellfleshed out, memorable characters, good writing, and beautifully realised, detailed visuals, you owe it to yourself to play this game. ignore those troglodytes who try to drag their political agenda into every area of life, including the games we love these are the same people who still believe the earth is flat and that covid is a myth... in other words, they're not worthy of consideration. if you are looking for an escape from lunacy, or if you just want to play an amazing game, bg3 will satisfy your every wish."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this game is not goty, this is a game of a decade. a truly worth sequel to legendary baldurs gate games. im sure that in 20 years we will remember bg3 as good as we do remember the bg 1  bg 2 now. a true love letter to any rpg and dd fan, or even just a gamer that wanted a good product, worth it's money. bg3 is an innovational piece of art, a gem in our time. hats down to larian studios."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,simply a good video game. the score speaks for itself. it is nice to see some real video games at this age
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,so i wrote a review and the site crashed. better learn i guess. anyway in a summary now  best game i played in a long time  as first time crpg player i recommend giving it about 50h to learn the mechanics and gameplay and just work through them to open the world ... and the world you get is simply amazing. crafted to perfection.  don't watch guides and spoilers try to do yourself that is unique about this game. i don't think ti will work well if you watch the guides and spoilers. mechanics ok but rest is not needed and will ruin the experience all in all game is perfect and i enjoyed every hour of my 100h into it until now. highly recommend!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"larian's best rpg so far. larian managed to against all odds make a better game than their previous divinity original sin 2. this game is ridiculously amazing. if you like rpgs andor dnd, you will simply love this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,a timeless masterpiece. i have nothing but love for the devs over at larian. the depth of this game is beyond anything i've ever experienced from a video game. i find it fun to discover tricks on my own as opposed to other games where i spend many hours watching guides for peak efficiency. i'm excited to see what happens as the modding community grows.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"is an absolute masterpiece. i've enjoyed every single minute of the game. the only bad thing you can get about this game, is the necessity of finding a group of ppl to play dd after this. good visuals, good story, good companions, the least bugged game from start i've seen in years, and even a few time after the release, they had the first hotfix. it's really obvious that larian made this game with love and passion. i hope this means a new standard for all those companys that make a game per year and it's bored and unplayable. i've spent 100 hours on this game already and finished one of the possible storylines. i'll keep playing it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i have always been a fan of larian studios ever since baldur's gate 2. despite all the positive reviews on early access i managed to stay away as i didn't want to ruin my experience and be able to have a full fresh start upon release of the game. the graphics are stunning. the game is well thought through and keeps you on your toes, what may start off as a minor quest to get help from a granny at her home may land you in some deep dark caves that remind you of something of a horror circus. the music and sound is top notch. the gameplay is fun and well thought through. i suppose the only potential put off that doesn't apply to me is the learning curve, it's not like some brain dead game like diablo iv that you can just pick up and spam a button to kill everything, you actually have to use your brain a little here and study the environment you are fighting in. i really can't fault this game, its an absolute masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"best game i have ever played. it has everything that a rpg needs, great and fun combat, fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, a lot of content, fun items.... it's the perfect game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"at least, the pinnacle of fantasy crpg. while it's not entirely without flaws, if i don't give this game a 10, there's no game in this world that deserves a 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,best rpg ive played since probably mass effect. it brings back the fun of the kotor days. its a great work of art. lots of fun. i hope you enjoy it as much as i have. the story telling is great. the tactical turn based combat is a lot of fun once you get used to tactically using the environment to your advantage. the cut scenes are beautiful and the story is captivating. i dont like the dei propaganda plus here and there but they are really not intrusive. give it a try.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"larian games shows today's lazy, talentless game developers how to make games."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"easily game of the year! i can almost guarantee the majority of the bad reviews are by nintendo fan boys crying that baldurs gate 3 may and in my opinion will beat tears of the kingdom for game of the year. i'm already super excited to start my second playthrough. the lore, the characters, the world just oozes life and man have i sweated whether imma roll high enough to get through some tricky situations. also karlach is the only romance you want and need."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i knew larian would not disappoint. i expected a lot. but they did something very few studios managed to do in last two decades. they exceeded my expectation, a lot. i felt in love with this game. its fantastical world, vibrant and charming characters, seemingly infinite ways to approach the situations and all those cleverly weaved little stories into that amazing, intriguing overarching narrative. i want to explore everything, talk to everyone. i want to spend time with my buddies and some more time with my loved one. everything is accompanied by beautiful music, those cinematic biowarelike dialogues add so much character to every dialogue, sounds of battle are so well produced and.. there is just so much life and love in this. and all of that for 60 eur. i would gladly give double. this absolutely is a new standard for rpgs. and it almost certainly is my goty, and i am saying that while being insanely excited for starfield."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"as a video game player myself since first fallout games i played when i was a kid , i ain't get almost same smilar real role playing experience  with it's unique and improved version of this role playing experience  really like this game soo much would like to thank that even this kind of considered as small company can make something this huge , the only think that i disappointed soo much soo in my head this game ain't deserve above 9.0 is you cannot get experience points while you solve your obstacles with your intelligence or with your speech ability rather you need to use physical interactions in order to get level and continue on harder progressions . but rather then that i mostly satisfied in this game ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"baldur's gate 3 is not a game, it is a love letter written to all rpg enjoyers. larian studios created a masterpiece, a product of passion and genuine love and care for details. the npc's are full of colour and character, the locations are full of secrets and beauty, exploration is a reward itself. the world is full of life and beauty, a single interaction may change the outcome of many quests to come without realizing it, a true experience where the player feels like their choices truly matter. a true vanguard against corporate greed and repetetive products, baldur's gate 3 is a full experience with no traps for money, players that took part in the open access period have been graciously rewarded by a deluxe digital edition. the only regret that i have over buying this game is that i got a digital copy. this should be the new standard for quality."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,a milestone in game development and really a sign of hope. the first true next gen title
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"quick background on me the reviewer, i tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. i also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now its rarer for me to get into a multiplayer game. up to try any genre of games and sometimes i find something new that i didn't think i'd like. i own a little bit of everything pc built by me, xbox, playstation, and a switch. i prefer playstation due to their focus on narrative games. for scoring, ill be using the gameinformer review scale and of course influenced by my personal opinions. 10 outstanding. a truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. this score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. it's been years since i've played a game that i enjoyed so much that i play it every chance i get. so far i'm 150 hours in and i believe i'm about to beat the game. occasionally, i did run into a bug that didn't allow me to continue a quest, but i would just load an old save and loose about an hour of progress to fix it and try to be more careful. usually it was because i would try to attack while one of my characters were in dialogue cutscene. this is a turnbased game and i learned to like because it allowed me to strategies more but usually i don't like turnbased games. i'm also not a dd player and find the dice rolling a little annoying when in the cutscenes trying to get the story to go where you want to, so i scum save. surprisingly, i didn't have to reload often. i've enjoyed the story and i could see myself replaying this game. i started a coop campaign and starting to see how different the game can be based on your choices and it's a remarkable accomplishment."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,instant classic and one of the best rpg games out there. there are few hiccups such as not the best optimisation but that doesn't ruin the experience by any means. disregard 0 note apes and give it a spin!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this is the best true rpg i have played in over a decade. witcher 3 and dark soulselden ring are amazing games but this game is something special with it's crpg elements and decision making. this is a company worth supporting and a game worth trying out. even if it is not for you, you should support this direction in gaming for all genres."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,the best game i have ever played in my 40 years of gaming. what a shining example of being. faithful to dungeons  dragons and making the ruleset work on a video game. you will not play another game with this much effort and attention to detail in possibly a decade or more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"everything you expect from a roleplaying game is almost completely present in baldur's gate 3, such as high freedom of action, strong and deep story as well as surprising and epic, wonderful and charming music and voice acting, enjoyable and innovative gameplay, quality and eye catching graphics, dynamic and diverse world, attractive and lovable characters and high repetition value and most importantly, the game that was made with love, not lust to rob people's pockets. the only weakness i can find is the lack of identity of the characters. i mean, i wish that instead of all the characters being pansexual, each character had their own sexual orientation. but again, this is a personal opinion, not a professional opinion, and i can't reduce the score because of this in short, it can be said that this is one of the best games of its genre so far, and if you are interested in the rpg genre, don't hesitate to experience it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"an rpg masterpiece. this is not a game, it's an experience. and yes aaa developers, this game does in fact raise the bar and we expect you to do much much better going forward. i can't put the game down. i'm exploring every nook and cranny. i'm a mix of frustration because learning how to effectively use the mechanics and my npcs party's abilities and building their abilities to work with my play style takes some time to learn and elation when i finally get it and i win a hard battle. the stories are deep and insanely interesting. the game doesn't hold my hand and im thankful for that. im playing on balanced and the game is a perfect mix of challenge and story. this is how you release a game. i can't recommend this game strong enough. buy it, learn it, have patience, you will have your i get it now moment to and be richly rewarded. larian studios respects my hard earned money im spending on this game by giving me value for the dollars spent. larian studios respects my time by releasing a game that is working as intended. larian studios respects their customer. it's been made clearly apparent other studios like blizzard , activision and recently rockstar have not shown respect their customers at all for a very long time. can we say microtransactions, cutting content and selling it as dlc and ridiculous prices for ported unchanged releases'? shareholders over customers is the modern way of developing games for other studios but noy larian. ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"una obra maestra, probablemente el mejor juego que he jugado en los ltimos 5 aos, si te gusta el rpg y dd, este es el mejor juego, como jugar en tablero, pero mejor. 1010 recomendadisimo"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"for me, the goty by far ! the game is good as multiplayer as solo ! love it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,unbelievable. what a great masterpiece. you dont only have 1 or 2 decisions to make and path's to take. you can do everything! forget other games. you have to forget the old dialogues and paths of rpg's. in baldours gate 3 you have to think further and try it like in real life. kill orcs? be friendly to orcs? become an orc? fell in love with an orc? or use the orcs to infiltrate other enemies? everything is possible! thank you very much for that amazing game!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,what a breath of fresh air. finally an amazing and giant roleplaying game that doesn't require you to purchase a battlepass or any other microtransaction released this year. this is what diablo 4 was supposed to be. i am so happy indie studios are finally rising against these disgusting mega corporations that deliver broken products and want nothing but your money. this game was clearly made by people who care about the quality of their product. easily game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,this is the best coop game and best rpg game i ever played with my friend! i hope it will get official modding support soon
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"the best rpg i ever played since baldur's gate 1. first game that gives the feeling that your choices count and the feeling that you are actually role playing. it all starts from the race and class choices that got enourmous meaning. from dialouges to battles  you choose your fights, your tactic and try to come out with new ideas. every playthrough gets a new expirence. i can see myself playing this game for months and years to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,what a masterpiece! i first didnt know this game even dropped but after i saw it i immediately bought it. as a huge dnd fan myself i couldnt pass up on the opportunity to play this beautiful game. the way the dnd mechanics are implemented is magnificent and together with a beautiful landscape and good animations the games perfect. i would even strongly recommend it for someone whos not even interested in dnd as this is such a good game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"bad graphics, terrible animations, terrible story, stupid ai in combat. i don't get why this game is so hyped it is such a bad indie game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"created with a lot of love and attention to detail. the game has an insane amount of content from dialogues to hidden areas and unique interactions depending on race, class play history and certain spells. it is everything a game should be and worth buying at full price. the pace is on the slower side so it is perfect for people like me who have very bad reaction time and also want to spend time picking herbs and talking to frogs and dead people."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i've been playing video games for 25 years since i got my snes with 6 years. i am a typical passionate gamer that plays almost every genre of single player games, but my biggest love were always crpgs. it blowed my mind as i played dragon age origins for the first time as it's release. it was my first crpg and i never expirienced the amount of freedom in choosing between so many skills and builds. the story was amaizing and the companions were extremely well written. i also love pillars of eternity and pathfinder games and especially divinity original sin 2 what is one of my favourites game of all time, but i always missed the intriguing cut scenes and the full voice over. baldurs gate 3 is the combination of the deep tactical combat and great world building of divinity original sin 2 with the great and immersive cut scenes and a extremly intriguing story of dragon age origins combined with a stupendous amount of content. but what blows my mind is the amount of detail in every single side mission, side character, little details in the world in regard to the amount of content. this game is so good that i made a metacritic account and wrote my first game critique only to praise this game. my hype was huge after divinity series and the great early acces but they managed to excel my expectations. i played a lot of games the last 25 years in my life but this is the goat with a wide margin for me. well done larian, every single game from you in the future is an autobuy for me. this studio and fromsoftware are the kings of rpgs and game developement that shows the middlefinger to every soulless copy and paste game from ubisoft, ea, etc. i hope the studio will continue there course and will give us a lot of fantastic experiences in the future !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,amazing game. other developers should learn from larian how to make games. full of possibilities and solutions. game of the year guaranteed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,baldur's gate 3 is a corner stone of modern rpg and gaming in general. congratulations to larian studios for this beautiful contribution to the video game industry.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one of the best rpgs ever. the story, the characters, the world building. everything is top tier. my only gripe would be the slow combat. but this is more a personal preference than bad game design. and you get real bang for your buck with all the replayability."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"the game is not perfect. the gameplay can be clunky and punishing for the wrong reasons e.g., i click hide all, but somehow, one jackass on my team manages to unhide himself and my cover is blown. but, for every one of those instances, there are 3 in which i noticed some brilliant little design detail e.g. when all character inventories are open, you can sort all the inventories at once, or each individually, with a single click. and as far as the writing and story, you really can't get much better. even the random letter on a dead body, if you bother to read it, is beautifully written and crafted with love. if you like rpgs in general or even just beautifully written storydriven games, do yourself a favor and get this piece of art."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"best rpg game in existence. the multitude of choices, character development, epic story. already looking forward to expansionsother games made on this engine."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"a utter masterpiece. wonderful storytelling, exceptional gameplay and beautiful graphics"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i just finished my first playthrough about 5 minutes ago. holy lord, i have spent many many hours of my life playing this game since its release, downloaded the minute it unlocked with my buddies. the journey has been absolutely phenomenal, the narrative superb, the roleplaying outstanding. had many emotions throughout my first playthrough, laughs, rages npc shoves, and even a few tears here and there. it was a great experience and i am so glad i survived till august 3rd to be able to play it, who knows what could've happened. that being said there is one glaring issue, and i mean glaring from a narrative and immersion as well as an overall fulfillment factor. no, i don't mean the bugs, or the poor optimization in act 3 even 2 sometimes, or even the fact that your companions want to get with you at a moments notice. these things can be fixed quite quickly and will most likely if i had to guess. no, the big issue is that ending. oh my god man. i could look past all of the aforementioned bs, who cares about it, i'd have even have given it a 1010 but dude, that ending was pure heartbreak not to mention buggy as hell, had to reload twice for the menial shadowheart romance ending. i don't want to sit here and explain every reason as to why it was bad, just know that whoever reads this you will eventually make it there and you will understand. its really lame, ties up no loose ends for the most part, no character endings and i mean truly none, other than what would be obvious like if gale sacrificed himself, it isn't jack. not to mention the plethora of plot holes and all of these characters met over the story who didn't get a lick of appreciation, dame aylin who??, incredibly rushed, and overall just a total downer on an otherwise, in my opinion, near perfect gaming experience. i hope, i hope hope hope, larian studios does what they did with divinity 2 and release and enhanced edition to rectify this man. like come on man, where is the big party?! where is the send offs?! i don't even think i can restart knowing how it ends, all of that was for nothing. you could argue what difference does some slides or a more drawn out ending make???? and if that's how you feel that's alright, but to someone like myself it was an utter disappointment and just overall sad. i can't stop reiterating it, it was so weak man. great game otherwise, larian give it the dos2 treatment, please god."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,one of the most enjoyable games i've ever played. it would be a crime if it doesn't win goty.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"without any doubt this is best game i've ever played, at first i was unsure if i was going to like it at all as it was the first game with turn based combat. however it only took a short while before i was in love with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,best story exp after dos2. adorable characters what are inherently nicer than most of the real people i've had contact with. a good combat system and interesting quests. literally goty.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,one of the best games in history. merging cinematic storytelling and crpg elements. they made a masterpiece. thanks larian. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,show me better crpg in last 5 years  zelda is for 7 year olds and weak minds
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,absolutely love this game. had no idea what i am gettign myself into but wow this beats every expectation i have had. i did not know they make games like this anymore! support this company absolute champions!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"this is how a game of dnd should run on a pc. bg3 gives you tons of freedom. and of course it is slower than an action game like diablo that calls itself rpg although it isn't one. it is a true adaptation of a ttrpg, a game you play with dice, character sheets and pen and paper at a table with your friends. characters and storylines are well written. there are no microtransactions. larian cares for the players and the rpg culture, it is not looking to grab your wallet and run. this game shows how full of dedication a game company can be and still be on the good side. european developers show again that they can deliver culture instead of digital fast food. graphics, sound, everything is state of the art."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"my first crpg ever. never thought i'd be blown away by a genre i'd never touch before. i was afraid of combat gameplay but it turned out it is the first time in ages since a game makes me think thoroughly of any single move i have to make. the amount of possibilities, choices, storylines are just beyond amazing ! thank you larian for introducing me to this type of game. so great!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"huge amazing game filled with human interaction you can almost feel, congratulations to larian for making a masterpiece like a modern day digital michelangelo. would be game of the century but that will probably be their next game or the one after that. never stop pushing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,very great story. unexpected events. game of the year contender. finished game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,just to counter the stupid braindead ppl that give this game a 0. these ppl small minds cant comprehend the amount of work and love behind it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,absolutely amazing. the best rpg i've ever played. this is a real love letter to the community and well deserving of game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"baldur's gate 3 can be rightly proclaimed as the crpg game of all time. what larian studios has achieved with this title is nothing short of extraordinary. with this release, they've not only upheld the legacy of a cherished franchise but have also ascended to a status reminiscent of gtatier game development. such a pinnacle of achievement is not only commendable but also incredibly beneficial for the gaming industry, setting new standards and raising the bar for future rpgs. from the moment i delved into the sprawling world of baldur's gate 3, it became immediately clear that the gameplay experience is nothing short of perfect. there's an undeniable learning curve, as with many intricate rpgs, but once you surmount this initial phase, every mechanism, every detail of the game, seamlessly clicks into place. what truly stands out is the weight and significance of each decision you make. every action taken, every response chosen, ripples through the world, making you feel deeply connected to the unfolding narrative. it's a testament to the game's design that nothing feels arbitrary. each interaction, no matter how minor it may seem, carries consequences, fostering a sense of immersion that few titles achieve. simply put, baldur's gate 3 never lets you down it consistently meets and often exceeds the lofty expectations set by its predecessors. furthermore, the technical and artistic accomplishments of baldur's gate 3 cannot be overstated. the voice acting is toptier, breathing life and depth into each character, making every conversation a captivating encounter. this is complemented beautifully by the game's remarkable motion capture, ensuring that character movements and expressions feel natural, nuanced, and incredibly realistic. graphical rendering is another area where the game excels. the environments are not just meticulously detailed but are rendered in a way that they seem almost palpable. whether it's the flicker of torchlight in a dim dungeon or the rustle of leaves in a dense forest, the world around you doesn't just look real it feels alive. the ambiance, coupled with the dynamic interactivity, creates a universe that beckons players to immerse themselves fully, to live and breathe within its bounds. in the realm of rpgs, it's a rare delight to find a game that harmoniously marries topnotch technical prowess with deeply engaging gameplay. baldur's gate 3 achieves this with aplomb."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,its an amazing game. very immersive world and you can feel how much love went into the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"baldur's gate 3 is an incredible game. the story is one of the most engaging i've ever played in a roleplaying game. i was immediately drawn into the world of the forgotten realms. the characters are all welldeveloped and interesting, and the voice acting is topnotch. one of the things that i really loved about the story is how it gives you a lot of freedom to choose your own path. you can be a good guy or a bad guy, and your choices will have a real impact on the world around you. i also really appreciated how the game doesn't hold your hand. there are a lot of secrets to discover, and you'll have to be clever to find them all. the combat in baldur's gate 3 is also really well done. it's challenging but fair, and there are a lot of different strategies that you can use to win. i especially enjoyed the environmental effects that you can use to your advantage. for example, you can knock enemies into lava or poison clouds, or you can use exploding barrels to take out multiple enemies at once. overall, baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece. it's the best roleplaying game i've played in years, and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story and challenging combat"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,baldur's gate is the game of 2023 to me ! hope larian can make more exelcent crpg for our oldass!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,still in the beginning but totally enthralled. my only gripe is the learning  its also part of what makes it so special due to its density. lots of systems at play here
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"while she very minor bug issues, none have been game breaking. this had been one of the best, most polished, game i've played in a long time. more studios should arrive for this quality."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"well, where to begin. bg3 has ruined gaming for me as 95 of games in my steam library feel incredibly subpar and lack the effort required to create an immersive experience that compares to bg3. gaming is escapism from the real world and larian have crafted a near perfect game inventory management is a mess. i do not need to expand on my reasons why i feel this way as all the reviews both critical and user speak for themselves. those who are giving bg3 bad feedback have not taken the time to learn the mechanics and want an 'on rails' experience like cod. if storytelling and vast adventure is your thing, buy bg3. take your time learning the spells and abilities you have and enjoy a rare release in gaming history."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"most enjoyment i've had with a game since portal 2, my only complaint is that i can't play as a tortle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"extremely solid and well made rpg. this is by far the best game i've played in recent years, and i appreciate the attention the developers put into the story, dialog, optionality etc. i find the review bombing due to sex in the game interesting... where are all the religious nuts coming from? it's a mature rated video game for adults. don't buy it for your kids if you don't want them playing it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,alright just for the start i have to say i have played through only an act 1... buut what i have already seen is just so impressive i already can see how complex dialogue trees are gonna be story is good side quests are on point and most important game is fun to play this should be new industry standard 1010.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"a well written and well implemented rpg based on the dungeons and dragons forgotten realms setting. a must have for all the fans of dd, fantasy genre, good storytelling or even fans of tactical combat. it merges the best elements of the original baldur's gateneverwinter nights games, the tactics of xcom, the storytelling of torment, the complex nuances of fighting of pillars of eternity, and of course the advanced and deep map design of divinity original sin. well done to the developers at larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"that's what anyone would expected from a dd session. phenomenal game, choices are everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i don't understand why devs still try to adapt the inferior dnd sytem to digital. you can just make a half decent ap system and don't have a ton of rng  slow, trivial and dull gameplay"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"absolutely breathtaking adventure! the few flaws it has don't even matter, as almost everything that counts is miles ahead of anything else on the market. i've been waiting for true choice games all my life, and there have been a few, like wrath of the righteous, but this one is on another level given its cinematic nature"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"exactly the kind of game the gaming year 2023 needed in my opinion. this game has everything that a very good rpg must have. take a bow, you triple a companies. so far, i have enjoyed every one of my 100 hours of gameplay. thank you, larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"greatest thing since da origins hope they keep dropping updates, would love to play as a hexblade tho"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,been waiting for a dragon age origins successor for a long time! and this game does it in spades!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,epic game. it gets even better as it goes and you level up to gain more skills. it's initially quite overwhelming how open ended this is and i'd recommend everyone watch a few combat tutorials to get started as it can be punishing if you mess up. get over that learning curve and you'll experience a game that will be talked about for a decade or longer.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,1010 one of the best rpgs released this decade with a game that cares about the customer a feature complete game great companions great story telling and decisions to make an improved combat from dos2 and more just 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this is the best game that has come out in recent times. your decisions actually carry weight and the story is super fleshed out and brilliantly written. after 70 hours in the game, i am still nowhere near completion. baldurs gate 3 is game of the year 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,can't believe i love this game more than the og bg. truely blowing mind in a year filled with s tear games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,one of the best games i've ever played. it's obvious that larian put a lot of love into making it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,phenomenal game with exciting content. feels like a breath of fresh air after all these mid aaa games. 2023 goty if not game of the decade.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"lovely game! larian studios outdid themselves again and showed established tripple a studios how its properly done. big fan of the impactful choices one can make, from morally good to completely evil."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best rpg game of all times, simply incredible and amazing, everything i dreamed of in a game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game has been a fresh of breath air. depth is immense. gorgeously crafted and executed. edit the game has its faults. i'm allocating the score of 10 based on the fact that larian studios is quickly and effectively addressing them along with the matter than given their already established track record, we can be sure that they will remaster the less than ideal portions of the game based on community feedback."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i would give it a 9 because i think nothing is ever perfect. beside some rough edges here and there during dialogs when it come to the camera and maybe a crafting system that feel a bit ''basic'' same for the inventory unless you use the search bar or micro manage it it probably one if not the best game i played in the last decade. thing is as crpg goes this is probably the best thing you can play period or atleast on par with the bests if you got some personal favorites. and anyone who gave it 0 did it out of pure anger for a reason or another because i truly believe that even if it ''not your thing'' you cant help but admit that this game is atleast a 67 even if you cant stand some of it aspects, hate the story and all it flawslacks so i went for a 10 just to balance their trolling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i don't say this lightly, and i do say it with a fair bit of bias given storyheavy rpgs are my favorite genre, but baldur's gate 3 is probably my favorite game of all time. i had 80 hours in early access and 50 hours currently. not finished so consider the meat and potatoes of my review to come, but the joy of playing this game and the level it has me wrapped up in it are unlike anything in recent history but elden ring which i think is great, but don't scratch my roleplaying itch quite as well as this does. truly, truly fantastic. singular con is camera control could use work, not enough to detract a point though."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"one of the best games i've ever played. the amount of freedom that you have in this game is crazy! and the best part is that each of your actions have gamechaging consequences. sometimes good, sometimes bad. the only reason why i haven't given it a 10 is that act 3 might feel a little bit unpolished compared to the other ones. it's not something game breaking but it's there."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the best game i've played in years, you can do literally anything you want to in this game and your imagination  creativity is very much the only real limit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best game ever, 174 hours of cutscenes available, every single character voice acted, combat is complicated but once you get it it becomes second nature. baldurs gate is literally a city and its size is an entire map with never ending secrets and things to discover. until the end your a faced with many choices and you literally are not sure which is the right one. you can tell, this game was made by people who wanted to create something from their heart, unlike most games these days which are just cash grab games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is wonderful, you can play it several times and be surprised, even going through the same places. there are several choices and ways to play, to interact. congratulations to larian studios, this game is a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"great rpg game, made me feel the same level of excitement as in my childhood with fresh mind 25 years ago when playing 1 and 2 parts. i love deep development of roleplaying aspects, good amounts of lore, some small and touching references to the first two games. interesting story, great cinematic dialogues and voice acting. as a 5e ttrpg fan glad to see pretty close adaptation of the ruleset in such a massive and well designed computer rpg. love larian approach to companions with rich development, interactions and the story for each one. the game world is carefully and passionately filled with tons of small details that create deep feeling of immersion. the game is very hard to pull from, spending night hours and hours playing. great job larian, was well worth waiting so many years to get this gem and travel the forgotten realms once again!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"don't listen to the dopy review bombers and their 0 scores. this game is amazing, an immersive experience that makes you think and really drags you in. it will also punish you pretty quickly if you treat it like a hack and slash. this is computerised dd, and it is awesome. if this game does not get goty, then the system is rigged."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i can't put this game down! godtier game. at first, i wasn't sure about the whole turn base thing coming from an arpg, but after a few hours everything changes, a light switch clicked duh, this is like sitting around with your friends playing dd in real life. on top of that, you feel so immersed in the game because you don't have any microtransaction currency to remind you that if you buy this or that the amount going to equal your baby's weekly diaper expense."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best game i've played so far in 2023 or even in the last decade. the game world is big, but every single inch of it is filled with purpose. dialogue is great, puzzle difficulty is just right. update i am now about to reach a total of 400 hours play time. and the game has yet to grow stale on me. a high replayability value because you can explore choices you didn't take in your previous run."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"been watching videos of this game and it looks epic! great gameplay, great lore, awesome graphics and no micro transactions!!! thats rare my friends! i dont have a good pc to run this game but ill wait till its on console to play. ill change my review once i get the full scope on console but for now 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,70 hours in and with what feels like alot more to go. bg3 is a pretty game with interesting characters and companions who you get to know slowly through their respective questlines along with their input in different situations. i love the implementation of the dnd 5e system and the homebrewing thats been done to make it fit into a videogame instead of blindly keeping everything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is a masterpiece! long has it been since ive been so engrossed and excited by a video game. i will replay this game for many, many years! i hope larian continues to develop more games in the dd universe."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,the graphics are beautiful! game play is smooth and fun. been waiting a while for this release and it did not disappoint! highly recommend!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"larian studious provided us with a game that built atop the foundations laid by great rpgs before it like dragon age origins, poe 1  2, torment and kotor. the sandbox they built, and the limitless gameplay is unlike anything we've ever gotten. no microtransactions, no dlc, complete and full game apon release. larian studio knows it audience and corresponded and provided us with one of the best rpgs of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"in adore this game beautiful art work, labirynth of choices and so many things to try and explore. no desire to finish game soon but instead i want to stay there longer and discover everything that larian studios made with such love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"people review bombing this are straight up coping because it probably outdoes one of their favourite games on metacritic right now. most of the negative reviews that give it 0 o.e. here even praise aspects of the game, which makes a straight zero even less sensible. my personal experience with bg3 has been nothing but outstanding  sure, the camera can be a bit wonky and some stuff needs getting uses to, but it's the best crpg i've ever played, and i'm normally not even that into these sort of games. i had high expectations from what i had heard, but larian far surpassed those. and, of course, the fact that they are upfront about being against micro transactions etc., has got to be some of the best user experiences i've had in the past few years in the ever worsening environment that is the videogame industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"an excellent followup to its decadesold predecessor, baldur's gate iii sets a new gold standard for rpgs in the modern age. though it has its fair share of buggy problems, the vibrant world, intriguing storytelling, and captivating gameplay more than make up for its shortcomings."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"flawless story. so many different paths and aspects you can explore. every new playthrough can unfold in many unpredictable ways. the plot is easy to understand, but challenging to master and predict, which makes the game capable of making you invest time and emotion. combat is strong and effective and memorable. although lacking the momentum of action combat, the sounds moves and colorsanimations flood the experience with energy, action and intensity. the music is phenomenal and accurately picked for every situation. it follows and expands the dos and dos2 soundtracks, becoming richer and more impactful. the game runs exceptionally well, but even so, larian studios released 2 or 3 hotfixes already in a few days to fix small bugs. what studio releases hotfixes so rapidly for such a complex project? you buy it, you play it. from start to finish. no ads, no microtransactions, no random promises for future story dlcs. even if larian studios decide not to make a dlc, the story and gameplay mechanics are complete. this is how the games must be made. the respect to the customers and the pdoject itself is unquestionable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,excellent game so far. the story telling is nice and i like the player choice in making decisions with the dialogs. the graphics is very good and the cut scenes look realistic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"probably my favorite game since baldurs gate 2. ive played quite a few cross and it ranks among the best, easily."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,countless hours of adventure and fun. so far i have started 4 different save files and each time i have learnt and experienced something completely different.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"immaculate crpg. insane depth in branching story telling, beautiful graphics. dnd's best representation in a video game yet."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i've been enjoying everyday when i play this game, 10 out of 10. the game delivered in a complete package with no micro transaction. this is what game supposed to be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,first game in a long time that has me this hooked. while i'm learning how things work they story and character interaction is great! challenging and i'm sure some bug arise but nothing game breaking so far.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this game has redefined what a gaming experience is. for too many years corporate greed has ruined the gaming industry and shackled the creators with unrealistic time crunches. this game just goes to show the love and attention a game developer and their team have when given the time and no corporate interference.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i made an account just write a review. it's the combination of crpg's greatest mechanics, stories and player freedom, with no chose felling lesser then the next. and no microtransactions. thank you larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this game is amazing. i think it was review bombed by elden ring fans who don't want competition. so much re playability. best purchase i made 2 years ago.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this is game of the year easy! only thing that i could say negative is some minor performance issues. other than that it is true excellence, and i'll haven't played a better game all year. some were close but balders gate ended up king."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"excellent game, a masterpiece, spell binding. a worthy sequel to baldurs gate 2, and in many ways, even better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"greatest crpg ever, just narrowly beating out divinity original sin 2 since it took that system and added several years of work to it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the fact bots are raiding it with negative reviews just proves this game is making waves and managed to piss off big fishes in the industry, also many of them come to imprint their political views instead of anything that has to do with the game, pretty funny stuff. anyways, this game really is between 9 and 10, negative reviewers are just the salt to make it tastier."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"larian studios' long awaited rpg truly delivers a complete and rich experience, where choices matter, exploration is rewarded and the replayability is off the charts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,no microtransactions? no pay to win? no money hungry devs doing the bare minimum to get their hands on your hard earned cash? nope. just pure passion for the craft. fantastic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i didnt think when i started this game that it had any chance of becoming my favorite game of the year and possibly my favorite game of all time! after playing tears of the kingdom earlier this year, i thought it would be impossible for another game to come out this year with even close to the amount of choice and freedom that totk had. but bg3 managed to do just that. this is a game where every encounter has multiple ways to approach them, and often, much like totk, it is the most broken ways that are the most fun. i was a big fan of bg1 and bg2, but nothing prepared me for how good bg3 turned out in its completed form! it definitely has my vote for game of the year. note the only issues i have with this game are some crashes i have been having, but most of those are probably more likely the result of an older, lessoptimized pc. i am excited to play it in 4k on my ps5 when it releases, and hopefully play on a more optimized pc in the future. despite that it still competes with elden ring and bloodborne as one of my favorite games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is so good. very immersive, a lot to explore, many paths to take, interesting character..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,awesome game! one of the reasons that i didn't give up the on games yet. keep going larian studios
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"definitely the best game i've played in 2023, it gave me that feeling of adventure that i've missed for years, it managed to keep me awake from night until the first light of the morning."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i've been playing rpgs since the early 90s, and after 80 hours in bg3, i've concluded this is the rpg to rule them all. this title stands toe to toe with the greats in the genre, including mass effect 2, skyrim, chrono trigger, the best of the final fantasy series, the witcher 3, and persona. not even considering the game is feature complete, with no microtransactions, or seasonal bs, it is just a damn good game. bg3 is a monumental achievement in entertainment quality, story writing, and player choice. you cannot skip this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate 3 epic rpg adventure, flawless gameplay, captivating storyline! goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"absolutely breathtaking game! the voice acting is phenomenal, and really takes the immersion to a new galaxy. the freedom of choice and how you wish to play the story is what a fantasy fan dreams of. larian deserves all the good things"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i never write reviews and never sign up to websites but this game is so much fun i think it deserves to get the highest rating possible so i'm taking the extra time to give my opinion. please give this game a try, it will make you laugh and cry and quite possibly pee your pants. there are so many stories to explore you'll spend hours playing. i read some reviews about sex being pushed on you and in my opinion in every interaction with npc's you have the option to just be friends. i never felt pushed into any sexual encounter. i hope you give it a try, you wont regret it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,game totalmente incrvel! at agora o melhor jogo para quem curte rpg de mesa!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i don't understand how so many people can like this game. it does not innovate at all, and after a while of gameplay it becomes boring and repetitive i do not recommend it at all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"completely obsessed, haven't been blown away like this since skyrim. i'm really excited to take my time with my current playthrough, and i've already got a million ideas for my next playthrough, and the next one. and the next one. also, feels good to see a game that's actually finished on release. and isn't full of microtransactions. i bought, one time, in its entirety, a finished game, and i love it. just how it's supposed to be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best crpg i've ever played. i'm just having so much fun. the game has so many possibilties, that i feel like i'm gonna replay this game over the years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"excellent game. it has been a lot of fun to play, and i feel like a huge void in video gaming has been filled. the only improvements i think the game can even make is just in the polish category. some camera work, ui features, and what everyone wants from every great game... more of it. great characters and storytelling. nonlinear progression. and more tricks and secrets than i even have the curiosity for. i look forward to continuing this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,fantastic game. launched with no paywall or microtransaction. has the entire campaign at launch with no terrible battle pass or similar cash grab. played flawlessly from the moment i started the story and have not had an issue. multiplayer is perfect. the puzzles are amazing with depth and unlimited ways to solve or move ahead. nothing is off limits. perfect game for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this game is one of the most enjoyable experiences of the past 10 years. mustplay!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best crpg ive played in over a decade. good devs with fast bug fix patches, great story, and amazing freedom of choice. it also makes bigots mad so thats great!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,baldur's gate 3 is unplayable for 66 of the game. the atrocious amount of bugs and terrible wattpad level dialogue sully what very well could be a decent game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i have not been excited for a game like this since like ff7. this game is the new standard and if games don't reach this, i just won't but them , period. i'm tired of lazy companies just trying to feed off my wallet like vampires. i will now only vote with my wallet, i will support no companies or games that don't treat me like a human being. this game is fantastic. imagine thinking a game is going to be the best game ever created, then it surpasses your expectations. that is insane."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"absolute masterpiece. larian has done a great thing here, setting a new standard for rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i was really nervous when this was first announced. i was afraid it would be another abject failure. i've been waiting for this game my entire adult life. i'd never heard of larian. never played divinity... no one else could have made this game. it is absolutely amazing. i started playing dnd as a kid. the first videogame i remember playing was treasure of tarmin. larian has lived up to my every hope and expanded on my dreams. from character creation to credits, the depth of play is truly awesome. every decision holds weight and consequence. the sheer range of adaptability allowed is mind boggling. time to create a second character..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i'm giving it a 10 and having as many homoerotic relationships ingame as is possible in order to make all the neckbearded chuds mad. it's also genuinely a good game. a few minor ui bugs, but all correctable without even reloading a save. a game that makes me think about future playthroughs well before i'm even close to completing the first one is a hell . the backlash from industry titans remarking about it being anomalous speaks volumes about just how good this game is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"almost perfect in every way. polished turn based combat, interesting characters, total freedom where choices really matter, no microtransactions, amazing voice acting.. the list goes on. baldur's gate 3 will be a game that will be used to compare other games to for decades."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"my knowledge of dnd was exactly zero coming into this game. i'm still having a blast and learning the system as go. i'm not someone who plays games of this genre very much, but i'm deep in it now and can tell i'm going to be playing this for a long time. it just scratches some exact itch for games that i didn't know was there."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"very good game but very buggy in its current state. i had a lot of major questlines just break for me, especially in act 2. not as bad so far in act 3 but jesus christ act 2 was a nightmare when it came to broken quests and questlines, and in a game like this that really hurts the experience. i would give it a 1010 if it was bug free but the amount of the game that has been ruined for me brings it down to an 810."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best rpg game of the decade, very replayable, top tier voice acting, sound design, graphics and attention to detail. minor bugs and glitches on release, but nothing game breaking. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"alright, folks, pull up a chair and gather 'round, because we're diving into the pixelated brilliance of baldur's gate 3  a game so enchanting, i forgot i had a real life. remember when we thought sliced bread was the best thing since... well, ever? move over bread, theres a new game in town, and it's not just your regular runofthemill escapade  its baldur's gate 3. from the moment the game loads, it's evident my social life was about to take a severe hit. the graphics? crispier than my grandma's fried chicken. the story? more compelling than my aunt's teatime gossip. and the gameplay? smoother than that questionable pickup line from the guy at the bar last weekend. larian studios clearly sold their collective souls to some mystical entity or maybe just a beholder to produce a game this rich. every character seems alive with their quirks and unique dialogues, and if you haven't tried voicing them out loud in your best dramatic overtones, are you even playing it right? every decision i made in baldur's gate 3 felt weighty, and trust me, choosing where to brunch on a sunday has never been this difficult. whether i was scaling treacherous terrains, forging alliances, or just making a tadpoleinduced friend no spoilers!, every moment was an adventure, a challenge, and a chuckle. speaking of humor, the game's wit is sharper than a rogue's blade. it never misses an opportunity to offer a sly nudge or wink, reminding you that even in the direst of circumstances, there's always room for a chuckle. in conclusion, baldur's gate 3 didnt just raise the bar it launched it into another dimension. if this game were a dessert, itd be a sevenlayer cake, with each layer more delicious than the last. so, do yourself a favor dive into the world of baldurs gate, but maybe warn your loved ones first  they may not see you for a while. a game? more like a lifestyle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"no se, todavia no me termina de convencer, a decir verdad es un juego con mecanicas impresionantes, pero es un juego que personalmente a mi no me convence y soy de jugar mucho de este tipo de juegos recientemente, tanto el menu como el modo en que se narra todo no me genera diversion, es entretenido pero no me genera esa chispa de diversion que me genera jugar pero es solo una opinin mas, por lo que veo a muchos les encanct y eso es bueno, hace demostrar el cario de sus fans tanto viejos como los que apenas se encuentran y eso es de dar credito a sus desarrolladores."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,buggy game. i couldnt enter in the story with all these bugs and the camera is awfull. i gave up after some hours.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,talked to a pidgeon. the pidgeon had better dialogue than 99 of recent games. easily goty.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,the best rpg ive ever played and probably ever will. a real treat. glorious mechanics. captivating story. pure magic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,i've never been hooked on a game in such a long time. i've already sunk 30 hours into the game. i even stopped going to the gym regularly just so i could play. i'm new to this genre but i am enjoying it immensely. it feels like diablo but it plays like dragon age. this is my first dnd based game and i can clearly see how much other games are referencing this game or have elements inspired by it. the lore is massive and i could barely keep up. there are things i don't understand but seems to make sense if you delve into the lore which means the game developers really know what they're doing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"solid 910 game, gave it a 10 due to review bombing. there's some bugfixes and quality of life improvement needed also for veterans a higher difficulty to as past lv5 tactician gets to easy. its refreshing to see that good games can still be released this days with aaa devs money grab strats"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"longtime gamer in 50s, and this surpasses bg2, dragon's age 1, divinity 2, bard's tale 2, skyrim, diablo 3  4, and mass effect 2 in its features, plot, npc characters, customization, romancing, and tactical depth. just an astounding accomplishment. zelda's tears of the kingdoms may get 2023 accolades, but this is the truly nextgen game in crpgs and storytelling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i'm still in the first act of the game and it feels like i've already played a full game, it's been 40 hrs of gameplay for me... this is an absolute 1010 so far. i'll be back to update the analysis when i get to the next acts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"amazing game, a near perfect representation of 5e dnd while putting their own spin on it, definitely recommend for any rpg gamer!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this is simply the best rpg game for today without a doubt. larian is the goat
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,baldurs gate 3 is exactly what weve been missing and the best game of 2023 so farrrr.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,one of the best rpg ever made. the voice acting is phenomenal. i don't anything about dnd and crpg but this game changed my mind and i'm to try these type of games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it sounds like rpg, tastes like rpg, and looks like an rpg, but you will find an incredible rpg environment  everything else, i've never played a such rich game, for real."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,it's one of the best rpg's i have ever played. larian never dissapoints. my goty.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"game is pretty, and very in depth for a rpg. lots of character creation options, pretty maps, and there is so much to do with all the items in game. you can throw things at enemies and it seems like each one has some sort of unique feature. the story is pretty great and it is set in the dnd world so that is awesome. watch gameplay before picking up though. not everyone likes the tactical rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece of gaming, a feat that redefines the standards of rpgs. with its deep storytelling, breathtaking graphics, and immersive gameplay, it transcends traditional gaming experiences to offer something unique. it's more than just a game, it's a true interactive epic that will be remembered as the best game of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"there are things you can get addicted to alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, sugar....none of these are even remotely as addictive as baldur's gate 3. i had no idea what dungeons and dragons was. i've never played games of that category before. it's a revelation! this is gaming at its purest. i love it! tip play it with the gamepad! it plays wonderfully. like a 3rd person game. soooo awesome!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"despite a couple of bugs that will inevitably be fixed by an extremely present dev team, this is easily the best rpg since dragon age origins. i haven't been this attached to a game in years. i love everything about it and feel completely connected to the world and the multitude of characters within."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"good game, but the ending is extremely lacking. me3 levels of lacking. if larian fixes in, it will be 1010 for sure. for now i can rate as 910."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it has been eight long years since i was last filled with such an enormous sense of wonder over a video game. the story and character development are spectacular. the turn based combat system works well, and the unexpected ways that things can play out are so refreshing. the player is given choices not just the illusion of choices, but actual choices that affect the narrative. 1010, and a breath of fresh air."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"an amazing game where it is was designed with love and crafted with care. every playable character is unique beautifully voice acted and written well. the game is far superior to any game made today. the love, attention and care payed to the whole without the bs live service or macro transactions. the games gives you in the first 10 hours what other games would give you in 30."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"is just awesome. well polished, awesome mechanics, infinite options and its feature complete"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,what a truly fantastic game! i feel sorry for those who are not allowing themselves to enjoy this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"sinceramente, es la primera vez que me gusta un combate por turnos. ya no es solo eso, realmente sientes relevante tus decisiones para el transcurso de la historia, los personajes secundarios no se sientes como npcs que van a decirte 4 frases predeterminadas y que indiferentemente de lo que escojas x va a morir, y va a odiarte o z va a querer unirse a tu equipo, hay interacciones segn lo que tu decidas entre los propios personajes secundarios, hay personajes que literalmente tienen ms trasfondo que el 90 por ciento de las series actuales en lo referido a desarrollo de trama, me parece increible la profundidad de historia que tiene y lo bien q sabe meterte en su mundo. el combate me parece impecable, es raro cuando lo ves si eres nuevo en dnd pero una vez lo entiendes, me parece simplemente sublime la variedad de opciones q ofrece y la versatilidad de los personajes a la hora de ofrecerte jugabilidad. no se, soy amante de los videojuegos desde que tengo uso de razn, es de las pocas veces en mi vida q de verdad quiero agradecer a una empresa por crear un juego."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game has everything but mtx and lifeservice bs. story, charachters, gameplay, depth, graphics, animations, lore, choices andandand. everything is masterlevel it even surpases the the great divinity original sin 2 by alot. larian went all out with this one. if you love rpgs this here is a must play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it is brilliant! game of the 21 sentury. omg it is so cool, can't imagine the world without it"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,it's a very good game possibly one of the best games to come out in 2023 if you have the money pick it up
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"buena jugabilidad, gran historia, personajes secundarios interesantes, un mundo gigante lleno de cosas por hacer, nada vaco. goty"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,amazing rpg with loads of choice and consequence. very fun and challenging turn based combat. some of the best cutscenes in a game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"even well made games gets bombed by haters, these people are like cancer cells trying to grow, but with this title, you failed, this is a win."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"absolute gem ! i have 500 games on steam and this one has so many possibilities for how you play and shape the game that you experience in a challenging, yet fun and rewarding way. the fact it isn't glutted with microtransactions, day one dlc, battlepass, and a unnecessary 70 price tag is quite refreshing. kudos to larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"here we go again, having to give a 10 to fight against yet another unfair review bombing against a perfectly good game. just deleteuserscore. baldur's gate 3 deserves the popularity is gaining these days. i didn't see anything beyond act 1 on my pc as i'd rather play it on ps5, but from what i saw it's without any doubt a refreshing new entry in the rpg genre. dos2 was already a very solid crpg, but bg3 is giving me the same incredible vibes i only got playing dragon age origins for the first time. i hope the devs will manage to fix as many bugs as possibile so that everyone will be able to fully enjoy this masterpiece as truly intended on all platforms as soon as possibile. cheers to larian studios for the amazing job!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"literally the best rpg i have ever played. basically every choice that you make feels like it has some sort of consequence. pair that with an amazing story, world and characters and you have a 1010 game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"perfect game, great story, gameplay and characters. what a game should be, no micro transactions, a feature complete game, and it wasnt 70. other devs should learn, this is how you make a game, and if thats too hard, get a new job in a different field."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,just can't get enough of it. me and my friends are huge fans of dd and this game is gonna make us loose a lot of hours of pur lifes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"so many butthurt people giving 0s here as a gamer who waited for bg1 with anticipation after seeing the ad on pc gamer magazine, i had no expectation for this game. i didnt like divinity series but this really hit the spot for rpg crave. its fun and immersive. theres a reason why half a million people are playing this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best game i've ever played since crosscode. got a save for myself, a save for a campaign with my friend, and a save for an evil campaign with another friend. that's how replayable this game is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,a game made as a true labor of love. one of the best rpgs in decades. every class and subclass is available from the players handbook as well as some additional ones from other sources material. there are hundreds of spells to use as well as other abilities. what's truly incredible is the rp element. there are so many variations of outcomes to encounters and storylines it's almost inconceivable. this game has sooo much damn content it's hard to discover it all.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"um jogo grandioso! difcil, porm recompensador, os relacionamentos entre personagens est muito variado e muito bem detalhado graficamente, os dilogos em um todo esto timos, as batalhas requerem pensamento e estratgia!! algo raro hoje em dia, baldur's gate 3  um jogo grandioso, e o melhor do ano com certeza!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i can't say enough about this masterpiece! the detail of the world, the wellcrafted story that can change in so many ways, depending on your decisions, the deep and meaningful conversations with your companions, your story, as a player. different, every time you play it. every turn you take can be a new adventure, a new character, a new quest. a game that every click can change the outcome of your journey. after years of waiting for a new mass effect or dragon age like experience, larian studios was the one, bringing life to a world of gaming that cares about what gamers want, delivering us a game no, an experience! that deserves to be titled game of the year. i wish i could rate it more than 10. well done larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this is not a game of the year. this is a game of a decade. thank you larian for bringing this masterpiece for us.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,great game mechanics. incredible story. recreates the mechanics of dnd 5e beautifully.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it's been so long that i had forgotten what truly falling in love platonically, of course with a game felt like. this has exceeded every expectation i had for it since supporting it during it's very first days in early access. it has improved in nigh every region, and is an astounding achievement. i can only hope that other publishers and developers will follow larian's example."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game reminds me a lot of dragon age origins and that is one of my favorite rpg's of all time. love the story, the many many choices you have to complete an objective. i love the fact that there are so many endings, so many different outcomes for decisions you make, whether in combat or in just regular conversation. it is definitely competing for a spot in my top 5 rpg's of all time. also, i love the turn based combat, gives you time to plan your moves and make some silly outcomes happen!  hello oil barrel, meet my fire ball, everything goes boom!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,another masterfully crafted adventure from wizzard of an rpgs world. gratz larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"incredible game, fantastic rpg. very immersive, lot of choices and consequences. i know i ll be playing this game for at least a year !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,i know i've only just scratched the surface with the 25 hours put into this game. eagerly anticipated this years ago when i first played ealry access. there is actually world changing impact hours after a quest decision was made. so many different directions to go that i can already imagine replay being like a completely new character story arc. i can't wait to see what else this game uncovers for me. my hat is off to larian studios. congratulations on a real winner here.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"wow. to be honest, i hadn't even heard of baldur's gate and i was stuck in my own mmorpg life. a friend highly recommended it and i decided to give it a go. the storyline is amazing and there is so much depth to the characters. this game is just pure enjoyment. i've never played dnd before and the mechanics took me a bit to learn. you need to give it several hours to begin to comprehend the depth of the combat system. but wow  i'm amazed. this is the best 70 i bought the addon to support the devs i have ever spent. just blown away. i'm so glad i gave it a try. and, there aren't microtransactions..... welcome back to gaming how it should be!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"1010 game of the year. good rpg, interesting storyline. very complex combat if you want, or very simple."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,good to see a development team aim to complete and polish their game while avoiding predatory modern micro transaction systems.. plus having multiple endings and hundreds of dialogue options. missed when games were finished upon release.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best crpg to date. the story are great, combats are challenging. no microtransactions nor all the shenanigans u get in a modern day game. a featurecomplete game that truly deserve to ne a aaa gaming experience. definitely my goty"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,the best game in this genre actually is baldur's gate 3! nice work and keep doing what you doing production team.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this is an amazing crpg that deserves all the praise it gets. my only complaint is i occasionally crash. other than that this game is perfect. idiots are review bombing it because they've never felt the touch of another human. their own parents wouldn't even touch their stinky selves.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"easy 1010. absolutely incredible. goat material here. if i were to nitpick, i would like to see more faces to choose from in character creation, but what they have is already fantastic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. i had to see what the fuss is all about, and i should've known better than to listen to these inconsistent toycollecting muh dark story millennials. of course the critics were going to praise this game. literally any game where you play as weirdo with elf ears and a giant axesword is a guaranteed critic darling, as long as it's playable. that doesn't surprise me, but what does surprise me is these codhating millennials calling this quality. are you freaking kidding me? this outdated indie piece of garbage can't even let me do something as simple as opening doors in realtime, and people want to call this quality? it's embarrassing that i've played ps1 games where the protagonists actually open doors, and this 2023 60 game can't even do that. instead, doors magically open themselves in this game. nothing can be opened in realtime. i can make plenty of examples of this game lacking quality, but i feel like my blood pressure is going to increase out of all this anger. the greedy developers are charging 60 for an indie quality game. when i pay 60, i expect topnotch aaa quality. the graphics are ps3 quality. the animations are ps2 quality. the lighting is horrendous. the physics are beyond horrible. the lip syncing is a joke. the dialogue is cringeworthy. the textures in this game makes me want to puke. the gameplay is boring and repetitive. the dicerolling is 2d animationbased. the developers were too greedy and lazy to make 3d physicsbased dicerolling. it's funny seeing other developers either supporting this game or claiming this game is rockstar scope level. they know darn well this rockstar level stuff isn't even remotely true. forget rockstar, this isn't even on ubisoft's level. this is blatant propaganda to get players to demand for these low quality games. that way, these lazy and greedy developers can avoid making true aaa games. this game takes a massive amount of gb. clearly these developers are too lazy to compress their game, which explains why they're making excuses to not port it on xbox this year. the coop multiplayer is trash. the developers believe you should get the complete game with no additional purchases. i appreciate that, but that's pretty easy to brag about when your game is already overpriced. if these developers were genuine about their beliefs, they would've charged 40 at best for this indie quality game, and not charge a aaa price of 60. i will not praise these developers for lack of mtx. they want me to praise them for that, then they better add realtime online pvp. until then, they are greedy and lazy, worse than ea. at least ea doesn't feel the need to resort to the laziest combat system possible for their fullpriced games. they put actual combat in their games, not this cheap and lazy turnbased system. i'm sick of hearing people compare the broken state of aaa games to this indie garbage. this game has turnbased combat, it be pathetic for any developer to mess that up. even then, this game still had bugs and glitches. i don't recommend this overpriced indie joke  at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is being an absolute masterpiece, ir reminds me the excitement of starting a new game and actually being happy playing something again. larian did a brutal job on this and they deserve every good thing that happens to them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,g reat gameplay o bviously nice graphics t he soundtrack is fantastic y ou must to play
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the best game i've played in a long time. the story, the sole amount of options how to solve a problem... and the music... i thought noone is making this sort of music any more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"el mejor juego en su genero. la cantidad de posibilidades que tiene a la hora de avanzar es hasta mareante. en todos sus apartados es una obra de sobresaliente, y la cantidad de detalles y mimo te deja con la boca abierta. yo llevar unas 30 horas, y apenas he rascado la superficie, ya que aun sigo en el acto 1. obra maestra, seores. disfrutad."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i loved the 120 hours i put into the game until i reached act 3 and the actual endings the game offers you. there is a bottlekneck point where the game gives you 3 choices no matter how much you did prior, no matter what decisions you made, no matter what allies you gathered and it . this not even mentioning what seemed to me act 3 cut content related to karlach, the iron throne and the gnomes in the foundary. larian is know for this and they have made a sick game that is only 23s cooked. until its fully cooked after a year i can only give it a subpar score."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,a score of 10 is not giving this game justice. it's baldurs gate10  the game that lives up to the legend and can proudly be considered a part of the series. you actually did it larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best crpg of all time. it has amazing graphics, actually managed to make 5e fun, and great characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"imagine being provided a 100 hour, depending on your play style, solo or coop campaign. then being able to replay that a near infinite amount of unique 100 hour ways. we've been gifted a piece of art that is more interesting and engaging than quite possibly anything in interactive media entertainment. give the game your attention and respect and it will give you everything back and more. enjoy your time in faerun. i know i sure will be for many more years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"simply incredible, you have to play it to understand. the writing and character arcs are some of my favorite of any game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"je n'ai vraiment pas l'habitude de jouer  ce genre de jeu habituellement, mais alors l quel plaisir 1010 l'histoire, les personnages, l'ambiance tout est parfait. je recommande vraiment mme pour les nophytes du genre dont je fais partie"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i'm going to start by saying i have never played dnd and did not play the first two games. i saw the hype for this game and rolled my eyes thinking it was another incomplete mess like most games nowadays. my partner who played the previous games told me to just give it a shot. i have already sunk 26 hours into this game over the weekend because i could not put it down. stunningly immersive characters and settings, unique customization, hilarious encounters, romance options, and my favorite so far.. the weird goblin combat music. i don't know why, but it has been stuck in my head all day at work. hate to see people reviewbombing this because they included the option to have androgynous characters and gay romance options. it's a fantasy game? if that isn't your fantasy then just don't do it?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"amazing characters and storytelling that instantly got me hooked. voice acting is on another level, and the narrator, my god the narrator, i need her to narrate my life. the world is incredibly detailed and super immersive. turn based combat is fun and really well done, allowing for all kinds of approaches to any given battle. highly recommend this game. best rpg i have ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"60hrs in, enjoying each twist and turn so far in act2. brilliant combat, fantastic voice acting and the freedom that comes with every interaction is simply sublime. 100 my goty for 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate iii is a break away success that took a lot of people by suprise. but despite the immense attention that accompanied this game's release, the hype does not cloud the fact that the product is a labour of love, offering a play experience which is fresh, rewarding, and complete. the play experience is phenomenal, with supurb handling of turnbased and realtime elements which feel intuitive to the player. the enrapturing and mysterious main story holds one's attention, even throughout the plethora of side quests and smaller stories that the player is constantly invited into, placing baldur's gate iii on the shelf besides other just a little furtherone more turn masterpieces. the incredible freedom on offer to the player, from creating a character to the thousands of ingame dialogue and action choices means that multiple playthroughs will be inevitable for many. what really makes this game feel so fresh to play, is that it is offered as a complete experience. there are no pay walls, no onlineonly requirements, no ingame 'real money markets', no loot boxes, no paytoaccess skins, equipment, classes, etc. one purchase grants you access to everything. and beyond all of that transparent goodness, the game's production at all times feels like a labour of love on the part of larian studios, and everything but a washedup sequel mired in corporate greed like so many once beloved properties. that this game has followed so closely behind diablo iv's own release puts these observations into high relief. lastly, the game looks and sounds gorgeous, with beautiful graphical rendering, excellent motion capture and superb voice acting from an audibly diverse range of actors who sound as though they're really committed to their characters and the stories they are telling. baldur's gate iii truly exhibits what a videogame can be, not just as a singular experience, but as a legitimate storytelling medium. it is a showcase for video game excellence, and confirms it's place as a suretobe timeless masterpiece. 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,a great game. seems like people been putting a 0 because they couldn't do research on the game before hand to see if they even liked turn based combat or not. shame.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"mammoth game, excluding the bugs that are discounted in a giant of this magnitude and i'm confident they will be corrected over time the only flaw the game tends to penalize characters of an evil nature, precluding too much content between characters, objects and narrative lines."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game has been incredible so far. i have really enjoyed the freedom and amount of choices given to you. the amount of ways to possibly tackle any given problem is insane. the amount of content is incredible too, you discover some small hidden area and it suddenly gives you an hour worth of content. i love it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,best rpg in the last two decades second best soundtrack album right after divinity original sin 2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the first game ever, i can confidently give a 1010! it is just so good, really makes me happy i waited for the full release."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"fantastic! a masterpiece. a lesson on how to make an rpg. if you have the slightest interest, don't let it pass and give this gift to your time. peace."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,just the best game that i've played. this game is very generous with a crazy content. characters are very interesting. the lifetime of this game is infinite with new game and new random situations. each run is very different.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"these guys have perfected their formula and set a new bar for all rpgs out there. a bar beyond reach that is hardly attainable for most and will be surpassed by even fewer, because they're all infested with corporate greed these days. i wish larian to never stop putting this level of passion, dedication and love into their games"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"as a game developer myself, i can say that this is one of the most complete game experiences i have ever seen in lifetime. larian studios did an absolutely fantastic job crafting ever aspect of this game and the variety that can be experienced is insane. everyone in my household has been playing through the game on their own and are about 50 hours deep, and the stories everyone are sharing about their adventures are astounding and varied. huge shoutout and thank you to larian studios team, very well done!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i haven't played that rubbish in a long time, i let myself be tempted by ten positive reviews"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"very good game, a solid as  9 in act 1, falls off super hard to the point of insufferable to play at points from act 2 onwards with horrible bugs ranging from extremely annoying to straight up game breaking, you can really tell that after act 1 there was basically 0 testing. typical larian awful storytelling but still serviceable and with very cool, high points, but same as the gameplay aspect, in act 2 it falls off super hard but at least this does recover once you have spent a while on act 3. you will enjoy the game, you will have fun with it, and at points you will also want to uninstall it because of the insufferable bugs, and i just honestly hope you don't lose a save to them. update after playing the ending of the game i can't do anything but bring the score even lower. the last boos fight and the entire area before it is the worst garbage you will have to suffer in the game, and the ending is release me3 levels of atrocity."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"its divinity 2.5 with a bit worse writing. even the  camera is bad, get ze mod!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"perfect, absolutely perfect! incredible game! without dlc, without mods you can play it for 100 hours easily."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is everything i hoped for and more! not only does it feel like playing the next chapter in the baldur's gate series, but it also feels like a modern spiritual successor to dragon age origins. if you love dungeons  dragons andor rpgs then look no further. this is the kind of experience you only get once a decade in this genre. the attention to detail when it comes to the world, the characters, the voice acting, and the dd 5e ruleset is unreal. larian studios captured lightning in a bottle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"o jogo  extremamente superestimado, um rpg padro com uma perspectiva de cmera elevada, grficos bons mas que deixa certas reas do cenrio escuras e dificultando a viso dos jogadores"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,thank you for shipping a complete game with so much diversity. i hope the gaming communitys reaction sends shockwaves throughout the industry.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,does it have bugs? yes. is the inventory management tedious? yes. is it still one of the best games i have ever played? yes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it's been a long while since i really got into a game.thats not to say i don't play a lot of games, because i do. but for some reason i tend to lose interest fairly quick. and i've never played a turn based rpg of any kind, i honestly don't even know what made me try this one, but thank the gaming gods i did. i bought baldurs gate 3 in early access about a week before it came out, and i can say with all certainty that it is by far the best game i have played in years. it's a game i am so excited to play every time i get home . bg3 has brought back the joy i used to get from playing games but haven't felt in far to long . just a truly great game .1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i am more or less a hundred hours into the game and right now i'm in the middle of act 3. even with a hundred of hours i feel like ive missed a lot of content, so i cant wait to finish the game so that i cant start over again. thats the experience we are talking about, the game is so big that its impossible to really finish it in just one playthrough. its the first time in years that i feel like a video game its worth its price."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate 3 is the most great and ambitious crpg ever. i had only played one crpg, disco elysium, before playing baldur's gate 3, but since i learned in june that baldur's gate 3 was coming out and had an ea version, i immediately purchased the ea version after checking out the videos a little bit. baldur's gate 3 uses a combination of the original dnd5e rules and rules specific to larian studios to serve up a magnificent 3a run of facts. it is definitely the most 3a rated crpg to date. i truly love it, before starfield, this whole august is completely for bg3. and tips everyone plays bg3 for the first time should play a single game to dive into the whole story, and multiplayer game is for another experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"one of the best rpgs ever made, on par with the bioware of old. it takes the crpg formula but moves it forward for a new audience, with plenty of choice and consequence. if you look at the story, character development, and gameplay mechanics it uses the dd action system, not divinity original sin's multiple action system, you will quickly realize that this is more than just original sin 3 and love it for it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it's the most immersive experience i've had with an rpg in the last decade, every detail of the game breathes passion and care on the part of the developers, it's a game that marks an era and will forever be considered one of the pinnacle of its genre, it's not often that an rpg it's so good that makes the best rpgs on the market look mediocre. a must play"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"one of the finest, most detailed, indepth game in decades. character creation, npcs, world building, combat, number of classes, races, subclasses and subraces, the spells, the feat system i could go on. i spent 2 hours just exploring an inn and it isnt even that important a location. seriously, this good. beware, however, if you have a short attention span and just wanna make things go boom, maybe not for you although plenty goes boom!. also had some very dark stuff in it and full frontal nudity  just a lot of romance tho you can turn it off this is beyond triple a. studios seriously beware of being compared."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this game is trully awesome i was loving it since the start until the end and now doing my 2nd run. i dont know what to say about this game its just incredible
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"absolute banger! reminds me of golden age bethesdabiowareblizzard around 20 years ago. this dropped as hard as dragon age origins back in 2009 and the witcher 3 did back in 2015. these days probably only larian, owlcat and obsidian can drop a true banger. a game with soul, deep noncontrived narrative, player choice, fleshed out world, detailed and meaningful character creation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this is the game we all waiting for, just perfect. i spend 200 hours in one go and i can just stop. really the best rpg game ever create."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"tldr  1010  fantastic soundtrack  one of the best i've heard on any game and i've played a lot of games,  crazy story worthy of bg2 which was top 1 just with bigger consequences and choices that profoundly change your game,  graphically it's not a slap in the face like some fps games could be, but a very beautiful artistic direction that fits this type of game,  gameplay, we like it or not, it's turnbased, i don't mind even though i haven't played this style of game since 20122014  bonus no microtransaction. you bought the game, you got it, period. no battle pass, no skins at 1020 euros. refreshing, but i'm hoping for an expansion in the next 10 years or bg4  more deeply   replayability, you can play lots of games that are not alike. with choices between evil and good it unlocks different types of companions some who will be accessible to you just with good choices, others who will follow you without too much problem, and finally some with a violent choice i am thinking in particular of one. and finally, you can embody a dark urge who, without spoiling, becomes much more complicated to judge, either he fights against his nature or he fully embraces it. this is probably the canon story and it's marvelous.  we gain a lot of immersion thanks to the dialogues entirely in motion capture the actors are all excellent, it's breathtaking. and the narrator.. oh my gosh, if she tells me to massacre entire cities i'll do it without hesitation just to be clear i'm talking about the game here. in this regard, i am french and even if i regret the absence of a french version as it existed on bg1 and 2, i think it is extremely more difficult here. lip sync is very important in an immersion and doing it for all dialogue in this game takes a lot more work than in a series. so it's almost impossible.  i also have to make a point about the combat pause versus the turnbased, because it is one of the main flaws according to some. even though i appreciate the combat break more since i grew up with icewind dale and bg, i think it would be horrible in this game. and besides, it's a style of play that makes more sense in a dungeons  dragons game in my opinion. since this is a sequel, i have to review it as a baldur's gate 2 player. it's very detached from the story of 1 and 2 100 years between the second and the third just a few books which refer to it in particular candlekeep and gorion some characters which come directly from 1 and 2 but it's not all important. besides, they dont talk much about their past exploits. conclusion  i really feel the love from the developers for this type of game. well done larian studios, i didn't think i'd have a moment where i could say i had a better experience than baldur's gate 2 but that's where we are. amazing. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i genuinely believe this will be remembered as a generation and genre defining game... people aren't wrong that the inventory system is a little basic and i do wish my shield showed on my back but these are tiny inconsequential drops in an ocean of brilliance, you can literally get lost in this game and not only does it call back to the rpg glory days, i think it may surpass them!! one of the the truly brilliant things about this game is it's pacing and progression in terms of story and combat. depending on your class and companions you can feel a little weak at first but this is so worth it as i've never felt such a satisfying progression in power before and this fits so well with the story and how things always feel important but the stakes are raised bit by bit. the game just constantly gives you something to make you realise it's amazing... if you like it at the start you'll love it by the end"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,baldurs gate 3 is nothing less than an absolute masterpiece. from the superb dd 5e i love every second im playing this game! so happy i know im not missing out on quests and items just because im not paying any more than im supposed to. and thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,definitely the new standard especially for aaa. so much fun online and i bet lots of great expansions coming!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this game is so good its the best bg game ever done. the first time that you have nearly the same feeling like on the table playing dd. and the game master is doing a great job so many possible solutions for situations. also the fight is a big upgrade to the old pausable game its way more like dd now. also it the strategy more important now  so glad that larian did the game feels like huge uplift for the old games. some quality of live features would be nice. at the moment i dident run into a bug. first the great zelda this year now this what good gaming year so far
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"game is simply amazing. after years of mediocre trash releases and so called games as a servicedisasters larian really did it and released a complete and fun game, which takes the player serious and strives to deliver a great experience instead of boring stretched autogenerated content for monetization. i did encounter only one single bug in my 80 hour playthrough of this giant game, which is basically unheard of nowadays. all in all we need to hold other game publishers responsible from now on to even reach 50 percent of this games polish in their future releases."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,somehow even better than 1 or 2. this coming from someone who spent over 300 hours on early access
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"meilleur rpg de l'anne 2023, on ressent tout l'amour et le savoirfaire du studio, l'ambiance et le ct systmique rend l'immersion totalement folle, je recommande chaudement !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"perfect turn based game, its a solid 9, but ill give it a 10 just to counter some nonsense review bombings of people who seems to like only nintendo games  fuzi0n, krellsho, kilandra"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"amazing stories, combat design and soundtracks. it is truly one of the best games i have ever played in recent years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate iii firmly establishes itself as one of the greatest pc games ever crafted. seamlessly blending intricate narratives, rich character development, and vast, immersive worlds, the game stands as a pinnacle of the rpg genre. at its core, it pays a deeply respectful homage to the dungeons  dragons ruleset, beautifully translating the tabletop mechanics to the digital realm. players are gifted with an unparalleled freedom in choice and action, reminiscent of the most intricate dd campaigns curated by masterful dungeon masters. the game's ability to intertwine narrative depth with the complexities of dd gameplay mechanics not only satisfies longtime fans of the series but also introduces a new generation of players to the magic and wonder of this beloved universe. through its impressive design, storytelling, and loyalty to its roots, baldur's gate iii etches its name into the annals of gaming history."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"one of the greatest games i have ever played. totally unpredictable, great combat and a world created with the utmost love and care"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i'm not a pc gamer but i didn't wanted to wait for the ps5 version, so i tossed 60 to lord and saviour gaben and i was blown away. the game tied me to my chair and didn't wanted to let me go, it's exceptional quality . i still can't believe that there is not virtual store to buy skins nor day one dlc, nothing, just full game. the story is intriguing and i can't wait to play more and more. game of the year ?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"for some reasons, i can't make big reviews because the system detects bad words and 403 error appear. so i will make it simple, gameplay its bad and boring after a while, especially if you compare it with the old games, charisma build op, make the game too easy, graphic its good only in cutscenes or cinematic shoots, outside of it look bad for a game with a high budget 6 years into making, 400 people worked on it, 7080 million euro customization its good but also bad. you have so many options for some races, but barely anything for others. the writing looks like it was written by some redditors and twitter users together, from the situation you're in to the humor and jokes nothing like the old game, overhyped and overrated."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the greatest rpg ever. by the way here comes the mob of review bombers, kids becoming worse every year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i've been waiting for something to come along with this level of freedom, characterstory building and combat depth ever since dragon age origins dropped 14 years ago. and it was worth the wait. 100 hours in and i can comfortably say this game is one of the best i've ever played. hats off to larian, they gave a masterclass to every other developer on how to do a rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"not much i would change, maybe a bit more help from the game to find important quest locations.. i didn't see any bugs or had performance problems. this is how games always should look like."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i created this account just to review this game. it's that good. a true role playing game where choices have consequences and the gameplay is challenging, yet rewarding. other game developers should be taking some notes on how to replicate what baldur's gate 3 is and stands for."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate 3 feels like it took a detour through the divinity realm. the game's craftsmanship is evident, but it's like expecting a dragon and getting a fairy  both magical, just different vibes. some newer, 'woke' elements felt like seasoning i didn't order. while i appreciate innovation, it's not the kind i particularly cherish. i just missed that classic baldur's gate flavor."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"perfect game , nobody but larian could give that an excellent sequel for the baldur's gate series. i hope all the phobia people and boomer will not lower the rating too much cause larian deserve this , and i hope they'll have the goty !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"not fit for the baldur's gate title, it's a long xcom mission with a dumb down interactions, flat characterisations and feels superficial and in consequence fails to deliver on world immersion and environmental clarity sprawling fantasy world ought to have. the genre surely needs improvements in graphics, ui, interactivity, etc... to feel current, but without overarching conception more appropriate for involved fantasy saga, it feels like rather empty technical exercise."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,i'm an old man. i've been gaming since the early 80's. this ranks up with the best games i have ever played.. you are doing  disservice if you let this one pass you by.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i tried to like this game, i loved the originals and neverwinter nights, but between the story not grabbing me and the combat requiring expert level understanding of the battle system, it's really not a fun game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i spent only 20 hours but i can say it's really engaging. it can be also challenging at times. coming from dos2, i feel at home but it's definitely a dnd and baldur's gate game. it's a very genuine rpg experience, beautifully crafted so far and i cannot wait to see more and more and more. i rated this a 9 initially but set it to 10 to compensate people who give this game a 0. you are allowed to dislike the genre the mechanichs but it can never be a 0, this game is clearly a work of love."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"first online review ever. felt compelled to right the wrong of all the dishonest trolls giving it a zero. does it really deserve a zero? no, it ive been around gaming since the 80s and this is a great game and an excellent achievement by the developers. that it is a labor of love is obvious. hopefully the new standard that gamers will demand from a declining industry. now back to the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this is one of the best video games ive ever played. i havent had an experience like this since mass effect 2. im normally not the type of person to replay games right after finishing them, but with this one i cant wait to start again with a completely new character, with different choices, and a totally new story. such an epic game. highly recommend"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"what a great year for videogames! larian showing aaa studios how it should be done. pretty much flawless launch, with post launch patches coming out regularly. no microtransactions crap and a full game for a reasonable price, i've played 70 hours and i'm just finishing act 1. it improves dos2 in every aspect, which was already a very good game. support this amazing studio and buy this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"as a passionate gamer both pc and tabletop i really had high expectations for the game. the early access did not let me down and the full version of the game just blew me away. solid story writing, very satisfying adaptation of the tabletop rule set., tactical combat mechanics were beyond impressive. but what really stands out is the amount of freedom the game gives the players to approach any given problem and quest in the game. players are rewarded for exploration, as one can find hints strewn in the most unexpected places, which in turn enable more diverse and creative paths one can take to tackle objectives. never have i played any rpg on pc with such decree of freedom, which is one big selling point of the tabletop version. never ever have i reviewed a game before but baldurs gate 3 is just that good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this is not game no no no this is not game it's a life it's a passion it's a way of life this is baldur's gate
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,been a bg fan since 1998....never thought it could be this good. i have put so many hours into this game and nowhere near finished. larian studios made a game that is truly what games are supposed to be immersive and entertaining.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"150 hours of cinematics, no thanks. turn based nonsense can go lob itself out a window, not enough hours in the day for this game unless you're a 247 gamer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"best game ever! bg3 is not hardcore at all, in fact, it is one of the easiest game i ever played. everyone should give it a try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"gioco incredibile, personalizzazione del  straordinaria, totale libert d'azione di fronte alle sfide e alle vicende che il gioco ti pone. tecnicamente accattivante considerando il genere, con dialoghi ricchi di pathos dato dalle animazioni facciali e dal doppiaggio di livello. il gioco perfetto per chi sceglie un'esperienza di ruolo coinvolgente e dal combat sistem a turni stratificato e profondo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,larian and valvesteamgabe real creators! and perhaps the last who did not rot in the gaming industry

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"been playing since early access, the amount of details and permutations, and the attention to details is crazy. the world is rich and dense, every quest is fun and meaningful, the voice acting, thw writing and the music is stier, i can't recommand enough!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"melhor jogo do ano. eu espero muito que este jogo ganhe o goty, pois fazia tempos que um jogo no me prendia tanto."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,what a game ! yet another masterpiece by larian studio. absolutely magnificent.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"there is no live service, no paywall for content, barely any bug, and developer actually listen to gamer! there are so many things you can do, there are so many choices you can make, and sometime i lost sight of the main objective because there are so many side quests. this is what a game is suppose to be upon release. trust me, go buy the game! it will be the best decision you will make!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,the best rpg to ever exist. i love the combat system i don't get it why so many people are hating on it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it has been a long time since i have been so hooked on a video game. amazing, incredible, a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"amazing, simply amazing. larian have outdone themselves and raised the standard for what the gaming industry can and should accomplish."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i find no other game better then this one so i guess i will give it the maximum score. i am close to finishing act 2 and i'm having a blast, and i'm saying that from the perspective  that never played dd and never really was a fan of turnbase games. i love the game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,not here to balance out the hype. this is one of my favorite games of all times. sad to see people are dropping 0s on this because theyre bigots. larian is doing it all right. genitalia sliders and in game same ssd relationships included. this game is really everything i could ask for in a crpg and fully cements larian as my favorite studio working today.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i used to love playing videogames like mass effect and dragon age, i loved divinity os2 and i felt instantly drawn to this game when i heard snippets of information being released over the last three years of it's development. now, it's finally out and it is everything i've been waiting for in a videogame. deep connections with interesting party members, a flushed out and motivating story line, a loyal adaptation from dd, and flexibility to make my own choices and feel like they matter. i kinda obsessively played it for three days straight cuz i had the time before starting my new job. to say i love this game is an understatement."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"goat. fluid diverse story telling, balanced fights, incredible amount of choices to make, dice to roll. never played real dnd, but after this game i feel that i missed so much"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i can easily say this is my favorite video game ever created. divinity original sin 2 was my absolute favorite rpg before this game, and of course it would be the next game made by larian to outdo it. if dos2 was the peak of crpgs with its innovations as well as improvements to the formula, then this game takes every single aspect of that experience and cranks it to 11. we're early in the lifespan of the game postearly access 3 hotfixes and a smaller hotfix on top of the 2nd, all within a week of release, but knowing larian's track record with divinity, we can expect a wealth of qol content in the future, as well as wonderful mod support, making an already borderline perfect experience potentially perfect when it's all said and done. this is easily the best dnd game ever made, the best crpg ever made, and it might just be the best game ever made all my opinion, of course."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,easily game of the year! excellent voice acting and a great level of choice. a great introduction to the genre as well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"a worthy successor. branching, personal and ambition story lines, creative freedom in how you approach every encounter, quest or the environment. i played bg1  bg2 for hundreds of hours and this just scratches that itch in just the right way. yes, is has been updated into a modern game but the bones are the same. a strong story, memorable characters, customization and just plain fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"larian, you have truly created a masterpiece , i recommend it with both hands. everyone should try it, i wasn't a big fan of turnbased games, however, this one stole the show. 1010 goty for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,a lot of people coming here giving it negative reviews to balance ou the hype. so have a 10 to balance out the stupidity.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,one of the best games in recent decade. didn't expect it to be that addictive considering i'm not good at all in dnd system.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it's been a long time that i didn't feel that with an rpg game. so much choice, dialogue and dtail in every aspect of the game, we can see how much this studio love his project. thanks larian for this example of serious and respectful game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"it is abhorrent how some people are rating this as a 0 even if crpgs aren't your cup of tea, you could recognize the merits of this game... and it has some very strong ones. for people who have the attention span bigger than a toddler, this game is terrific, brings back the good ol' days of actually complete games upon release ok, it has a bit more bugs than those, then again, the scope and complexity is much bigger. is this as good as almost ancient stuff like arcanum or neverwinter nights 1 i.e. games from the golden age of crpgs some 20 years ago? i dunno, difficult to say, as those have a deep sentimental value for me. but this is clearly one of the best games release in many many years and all i can say is that i hope it is the start of a new trend... a few more games like this and elden ring and the likes of blizz, ubisoft, ea might actually be forced to change course from their anticustomer practices either way, i haven't bought one of their games at full price in a long time and i don't plan on doing so."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"as a fervent gamer, i have traversed countless virtual worlds, but never before have i encountered a game as remarkable as baldur's gate 3. this epic adventure has left an indelible mark on my gaming experience, introducing me to a level of quality and immersion that i've never had the pleasure of enjoying before. from the moment i delved into the realms of baldur's gate 3, i was captivated by its incredible graphics. the attention to detail is astonishing, bringing to life a world that feels as real as the one outside my window. the environments are beautifully crafted, each corner filled with meticulously designed elements that breathe life into the game. although i did encounter some occasional fps drops in specific areas, i am confident that the developers will address these issues, further enhancing the already remarkable visual experience. one aspect that truly blew me away was the lifelike animations and characters' expressions. it's as if the developers harnessed real magic to infuse their creations with emotion and authenticity. every smile, grimace, and furrowed brow is so convincing that i often found myself lost in the characters' emotions, forging a deeper connection to the narrative. combat in baldur's gate 3 is a finely tuned symphony of strategy and action. the balance struck between challenge and enjoyment is a testament to the developers' dedication to delivering a satisfying gameplay experience. whether i was embroiled in a tense battle against formidable foes or strategically maneuvering to gain an upper hand, each encounter felt rewarding and wellcrafted. one of the most refreshing aspects of baldur's gate 3 is its complete lack of microtransactions. in an industry plagued by predatory monetization schemes, this game stands as a beacon of integrity. the emphasis is solely on the gaming experience, allowing players to fully immerse themselves without the constant distraction of ingame purchases. the character creation system in baldur's gate 3 is nothing short of a masterpiece. the array of choices available, from races and subraces to classes and backgrounds, is staggering. this level of depth empowers players to truly shape their ingame personas, resulting in a unique and personalized adventure for each individual. lastly, the worldbuilding in baldur's gate 3 is a testament to the developers' artistry. the landscapes are enchanting, and each location tells a story of its own. whether i was wandering through a bustling city or venturing into the untamed wilderness, i was continually awestruck by the sheer beauty and intricacy of the world around me. in conclusion, baldur's gate 3 has set an entirely new standard for gaming excellence. my journey through its realms has been nothing short of aweinspiring. while minor technical issues momentarily detract from the experience, they pale in comparison to the sheer brilliance of the overall package. this is a game that every gamer should have the privilege of experiencing, a masterpiece that will undoubtedly be remembered as a defining moment in gaming history. areas for improvement i believe it is already work in progress pathing and interactions at times, i found the pathing system to be slightly awkward, particularly when interacting with objects like chests or crates, as well as during conversations with npcs. there were instances where characters seemed to navigate in unpredictable ways, occasionally causing minor frustration. however, given the overall quality of the game, i trust that these interactions will be polished to provide a more seamless and intuitive experience. fps drops while the game's graphics are undeniably stunning, i did encounter occasional fps drops, particularly in specific areas. these moments momentarily disrupted the immersive experience, although i have faith that the development team will work tirelessly to optimize the performance and provide a smoother gameplay experience across various hardware setups. camera issues in multilevel structures navigating the camera within multilevel buildings or castles presented some challenges. there were instances where the camera angle felt limiting, and it became difficult to effectively explore these intricate environments. i believe that refining the camera controls and ensuring a more intuitive camera movement will significantly enhance the experience of exploring these detailed spaces."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,the game since the early access have changed a lot... the success is partly because of the feedback.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,this is the best game of all time. i waited over 3 years and it delivered in more ways than i could ever hope for. i cant remember the last time i had this much fun playing a video game. so many little details pop out at you show the love larian put into making this game. this is a game made by gamers who created something theyd love to play.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"this game is amazing i have already 180 hours into the game 100 hours was early access and i just can't emphasis how much fun this game brings me, from story, to the characters, to random npc's the villains, music and artwork and everything inbetween! it's just that good. fyi for those who rate the game 010 to balance things out you should play the game first, maybe pass the tutorial out if it's not too hard for your shoe sized iq brain to handle, and that's not even saying the game is hard, you are just that dull, i get it that you like games riddled with microtransactions  p2w and broken on release that are uttered with bugs and unfinished or poor gameplaystory, for once in a decade there comes a game that is truly amazing and you trying to dunk on it, to that i say,  to you."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the game is clearly a masterpiece. also, for the people saying turn based was such a bad idea, you do realize this is a dd game right? you know... dd... the turn based game..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"no microtransactions, an actual finished and bug free experience, this is what all games should be at, as a basic standard, every other dev team should aim for this as there basic standard. goty for sure, even if its not your thing just enjoy a complete game at launch for the first time in 20 years"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,people critisizesing the combat are just too stupid to grasp even the simplest concepts of it. it is truely pathetic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"sometimes i think i am dreaming, congrats larian, this is the godfather of gaming. play the game, like really play it, you will see, there is nothing comparable to this. i love disco but this is so much better with infinite freedom to be whtvr you want be. this the most impressive immersive videogame experience i ever had in my 40 years of gaming."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,best game ever i played ! amazing rpg......... very good job larians studio games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"the best rpg i have played in a long while, this is how you make a game... good job larian studios. this is the game of the year! i am genuinely amazed that we belgians can make such an awesome freaking game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,exceptionnal wellwritten game with immersive story and plot. long live larian !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"as someone who plays dd i can appreciate the devs for tryingwith great success i might add at transposing the feeling and mechanics of it into a video game. i love it entirely, from the setting to the characters, to the different ways of solving a problem. i haven't even gotten to baldur's gate yet but from what i've seen so far i am genuinely impressed. this game really scratches a dd fan's itch when it comes to pc gaming not to mention you can feel the dedication and love the devs poured into it. for all the haters out there that complain that it's boring i would like for you to play an actual dd game with at least 4 other people to see how fastpaced a session really is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"everything is perfect, everything in the game is like a spider web. whether it's the enormity of the missions, the way the graphics reflect that world or the way every single detail has sound. the game is like a joke, i'm sure i won't see something i did in my next experience. the way the world reacts to each choice is incredible compared to what other games have been doing lately. for example, the mood of your comrades continues not only for a certain period of time but until that incident is resolved, or the attitude of an npc can become permanent as a result of the decisions you make, just like real life. forget the games that have been sold as rpg until this time, this game is a real rpg and definitely the game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i love this game so much, even though i never was a fun of turnbased games and dd and all this stuff, but... this game represents what modern gaming should be, and it deserves it's score for sure"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"baldur's gate 3 was highly recommended to me by several friends and i am so glad i did not miss out. bg3 is a masterclass showcase of the rpg genre and truly captures its essence. the rich storytelling combined with the incredible attention to detail immerses you in a world that is fantastic, in the truest sense of the word. the character and sound designs are amazing, the environment is beautiful, and the gameplay and story beats are engaging. player choice feels meaningful and the game encourages you to interact and explore. bravo to larian studios for delivering such a wellexecuted and refined experience. larian is a refreshing and welcome outlier amongst aaa game developers in 2023. they are a bright beacon contrasting against the gloomy sea of slapdash cashgrabs, whose developers are so fixated on microtransactions and battlepasses that they neglect to create fun and fulfilling games. i am excited by the high bar set by larian studios with baldurs gate 3 and optimistic it will continue to raise industry standards in the aaa space."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,one of the best rpgs i've ever played. the story is great and the gameplay is exceptional. a must play game.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,it's so much fun. i couldn't work because i kept thinking about it for days.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,i played bg1 and 2 back in the day. play a little bit of dos1 and more dos2. but this in my opinion is worth me making a metacritics account to voice how fun the game is. the only bad things i can say is stuff that gets patched quickly. gj larian. also merci pour la poutine !! haha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"one of the best rpgs made in the past decade or so. excellent story telling, game play, voice acting, sound design, ui, character design and it goes on, you get the picture. some bugs during release but none are game breaking. finally a truly good finished product without cash grabbing battle passes, microtransactions and dlcs. had so much fun and freedom to do things in game that i'm more than often spoilt for choice. after more than 80 hours in game and i'm not past act 1 yet. so much to explore. easily a minimum of 500 hour game for average players. focuses on player experience more than money making experience for developers. don't let the negative comments from triple a game developers from other studios fool you. this game is just that good, probably why they are being defensive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"everything in this world feels so alive and reactive. the focus on storytelling and a feature complete game with no game breaking bugs is something to be praised, it shows larian studios truly cares about what they are doing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,!         .    .  larian !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"indy studio blows aaa studios out of the water with this epic that will in all likelihood shake and mold the gaming industry for the next decade to come. while i never was a fan of turn based strategy or rpg style games. baldurs gate 3 early access got me to open my eyes to it. with the full games release, im now completely sold on the idea. but bg3 goes so much further than that. the story is extremely compelling, the character development is shockingly good, and the full gameplay experience is extremely optimized. while dnd interested me, ive yet to play a real table top game of it in my life. primarily focused on video games, i found this to be a good chance to explore the world of dnd in a format im more comfortable with. thats what got me into the early access. and the early access did the rest. 100 hours into the game since release with another 120 spent in early access and ive beat the game once on a semirushed through play though on the easiest difficulty option. if youre the kind of rpg player who strives to tick off ever possible quest line, you will easily sink over 200 hours into a single plaything and still not be able to explore all the game has to offer because of branching story paths that you get to choose. the combat while not for everyone is easier to understand than other crpgs ive tried now. id recommend you okay in easy its still plenty hard. the visual aspects are stunning as the characters feel very alive. i think this is from the motion capture they used on peoples faces. but everything works very well together. and dont get me started on the beauty of baldurs gate itself. this game is amazing and even though in a total 220 hours deep into it, i plan on playing it for years to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,maybe it's just not what i'm looking for in a game anymore but i have this a solid 2 12 play as i was off work and i jist couldn't get into it like the last game. it felt very generic like i'd played it 100 times before.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"phenominal, best game i have ever played. likely best game of all time so far."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,by far the best rpg game in recent years. thanks larian for making it happen!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"a game that truly delivers! with its outstanding content, exceptional gameplay, and remarkable graphics, this title stands out in today's gaming landscape. the story is incredibly intricate and compelling, urging players to dive back in and experience it all over again. one could say that a new benchmark has been established. but you could also say a game that returns to old roots, how a game should be and how games used to be. after years, we finally have a game made genuinely for players and not merely to appease investors. a mustplay!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"started off pretty alright, but then it blew my friggin mind! amazing story, graphics, voice acting and sound design. kudos to the voice actors, you all deserve awards for your flawless performances the gameplay took a while to get used to, cuz i'm not used to topdown point and click rpgs, but when i finally got used to it, i gotta say, it's one of the best turnbased rpgs i've ever played. let this be a lesson to square enix, you can make aaa turn based rpgs and still make a profit, because there are plenty of people who are interested. i would rather play persona 5 twice than play final fantasy 16 only once. to be completely honest, i was gonna just buy the game to support game devs that actually put their heart and soul into making proper mature rated video games full frontal and all. wasn't sure i'd like it much less get absolutely hooked on it lol. on that note, bring back nudity in the new god of war games sony, we're not kids"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,goty for me. i've played since day one of early access. this is absolutely a masterpiece courtesy of the devs at larian studios. i've put about 80 hours into my current playthrough and i still feel like i have a lot of time left. the story is amazing. the cutscenes are great. the dialogue can be cumbersome with some of the animations. if you're new to dd you have nothing to worry about. this game teaches you what you need to know for the purpose of the game. it's not overwhelming in my opinion. the combat is turn based but still very enjoyable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is probably the best game ive played in 10 years, i cant remember the last time a game held me up this late at night. its story is great, its gameplay is fun and engaging and everything is just.. great!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best rpg game i played to this date , addicting gameplay, beautiful story, incredible freedom of choices and interactions , game of the year for me !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"incredible game. the effor put into the game is on another level, larian deserve our love an praise."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,a grand adventure with unimaginable amounts of fun. a must play even if you dont like the combat system
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"ive only played a few hours but the visuals are stunning, amazing turn based gameplay, and the narrative and storytelling are phenomenal. its also really impressive to see all the individual personalities that can join your squad, all are unique and worth developing relationships with. this is shaping up to be one of my favourite games of the last decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,masterpiece! every tripple a should take that as benchmark how sidequests can be
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best game of all time, 30 hours and it's amazing.. you can do an be whatever you want"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,its as perfect a game as weve had in many many years. larian have given us a classic thats both created with love of gaming and not to gouge your eyes out financially with forced micro transactions and stupidly high retail costs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"was not interested, but after it came out everyone was saying it was good, and other devs were crying. so i bought. its a great game. also mods are already happening."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best crpg. i advise everyone to buy. interesting battle system, chooses in dialogs which affect something. 1210"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"ein meisterwerk, ohne battlepass, seasonpass und sonstige microtransaction. das spiel wurde mit so viel liebe zum detail entwickelt. ich kann nicht mehr aufhren zu spielen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best rpg i've played in a long time! looks amazing, fun to play, very engaging"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,game of the year! larian outdone ourselves once again. thanks sven and borislav slavov and the whole team! you guys bring back the joy in gaming! thank you!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"never played dnd but big fan of dragon age games, this game might be game of the year"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"whole bunch of hype with no substance. sure the game is pretty, but when every single dialogue option goes to an in game cutscene even for npcs that say one line and don't have any interactions then it becomes overindulgent. the ui is absolutely terrible. it fights with you every step of the way and will have you constantly save scumming. the actual gameplay is not fun. the max lvl in the game is 12 so just as your build was starting to feel good boom game ends. majority of the game is spent at low levels dnd which i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i know that many game developers have come out to say that they are worried that gamers will start expecting this games level of quality from them, and they are correct make better games and less excuses. thank you larian studios games for putting in the time and effort."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"okay so hey developers, why did you make fully nude in this game? undies patch would be appropriate. anyway other than that, i like the style of the game and good game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"1010 does not  perfect. people used to understand that games of this size, scope  ambition would inevitably have bugs, unintended glitches  even performance issues. however, the game does so darn much  is so insanely fun that any issues i experienced never impacted my overall experience. wacky things pop up in crowded combat, and there are times where i've had huge performance drops. it's inconsistent, but the nature of the game mitigates how much it distracts from the experience. it's a bit more annoying in cutscenes or dialogue, but otherwise it didn't bother me much. i have experienced one crash after level up, but nothing else. the only reason i'm detailing this stuff  not all it does well is because this review would go on forever if i took that route. better to touch on the handful of issues, then tell you everything else is just amazing. even though games like skyrim  botw are completely different games than bg3, i feel a similar level of this is amazing while also accepting the bugs  flaws that come with it. hopefully because it's not tied to some specific console via exclusivity, fans will be more tolerant of these things instead of latching on to them in order to bolster the fanboy console wars."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it's been a while since a game made me so passionate, amazing game, incredible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"baldur's gate 3 is a pearl, a letter of love from larian studios to all the fans of rpg's and dd fans, coop lovers and people who just want to immerse themselves in an amazing and immersive adventure. i praise the devs for the incredible work! 2023 has been an amazing year so far for video games on all platforms but especially on pc it's going to be a very tough battle deciding this year's game of the year, but i feel bg3 simply nailed it, and it will be impossible to ignore the huge numbers of players and reviews who are enjoying this experience. congrats larian, keep doing what you doing and gifting us amazing stories to get lost into!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i missed out on the collectors edition so 010. but the developers said no mtx so 2010. so that averages out to 1010. the game is not for everyone so please do not buy it if you will complain the combat is slow or there are too many cutscenesdialogue. the game allows you to do or play practically however you want and approach things in various ways with combat or game choices. its amazing. thank you for reading. enjoy gaming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i've sunk 115 hours in 6 days. i would put baldur's gate 3 on the same illustrious pedestal as star wars knights of the old republic which was released 2 decades ago. this game isn't just the rpg of the year or even decade but . every gamer and games company will be using baldur's gate as a point of comparison for years to come when talking about perfection.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"my very first review on a game ever to be honest, the best aaa game which isn't even created by aaa studio. thank you larian for creating such a masterpiece. your game will live on for at least a decade. you won't regret buying the game and if so giving a big middle finger to all the known big studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"just a master piece , probably goty. well optimized very good writing good music good combat"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a letter to aaa gaming companies complete game. true rating. dollar for dollar i have never seen so much content in a game. even with a same main storyline, it has high replay value. i did not like the last two games by the producer they fixed every issue i had with the previous games. it allows me to do everything in dnd that is inconvenient in actual play, that makes you feel like you are your character. endless environmental combat options, pushing people off cliffs, meaningful disarms, using jump and hide in a systematic and effective way. if you don't enter real time mode and hit a trap, it feels like a trap. not reflex save. no, you are gonna die if you don't toggle right now. the first act's pacing is immersive, meaningful evil characters with realistic motives and culture. the ability to make hard meaningful choices, and you aren't forced to choose between being purely good or evil in a linear fashion like in most games. my only and singular complaint about the game is wishing there was a way to enable faster walking speeds like a 1.5,2x button for basic walking, at least in towns or safe areas without enemies or traps. this game pushes boundaries with freedom, choice, consequences, and complete in its entirety no dlc. this was the game quality i had hoped diablo iv was. take notes blizzard, ea, and the other companies who used to produce a quality product and over the past 10 years completely lost base with their customers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game sets the new standard for the amount of individually created content that should be included off the bat in a triple a game. this is what we want. everyone is tired of the corportized clone copied and silo games that you get bored almost immediately with now. there's just so much content, so many tailored choices that actually have a meaningful effect of gameplay, and all of this was created without even using ai or procedural generation. im hoping they grow this game with more expansions, or even more avatar customizability or cosmetics in the future, but as is, would say it's definitely goty. everyone could learn from this game, and i myself never playing a baldur's gate game before have found a new love for this franchise. i also never like top down games before, but this completely change my mind about those completely now. thanks you for this beautiful masterpiece, i can't wait for my next several playthroughs because the replayability of this game is just astonishing i know ill be playing this for a long time in the future."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"literally a 1010 game. amazing gameplay, great lore, intriguing story and delightful characters. in an industry of rampant corporate greed, microtransactions, loot boxes, season passes and  larian studios' baldur's gate 3 stands as a shining example of how great gaming could be and sets a new standard in the videogame industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i have a total of 80hrs in bg3 30 of them were in very ea and 50 are post release. some people are reviewing the game highly because of video game politics. i want to clarify that i am giving the game this score because it delivered on all of my expectations and introduced things in games i didn't think were technically possible. i work in software development and i can't imagine the boring technical work, all the database problems they had to solve for items and spells and stats. the fact that this launch went so smooth is wild, though this was a pc only launch, far less to go wrong. as of writing this they have released 2 hotfixes, which i have not experienced any issues, but its good to see immediate response to things that have been found by others. as for story, its your own story. its crazy to think about, but yes things are happening in this world and there is a plot. it feels like my own story though. i truly feel the things i do and the chances i take have full effect on the world around me. the gameplay is spot on dd. which dd has been known for a great system, and at times can be min maxed and broken, but larian didn't shy away from the cons, they accepted the positives and the negatives of the system and trust its players and lets them do what they want. so ya i don't care about what other game companies do and i don't care about sending a message. this is a damn good game. its better than i expected. i have lost sleep, and played during work hours irresponsibly. i feel truly excited every time i start the game and i can't help but take notes for my next character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"absolute masterpiece, and i am rooting for it to be goty. i have never played any bg game before and so, this review is from someone who is new to the game and genre. and i have to say that i am absolutely blown away, and thats a heavy understatement. the game is full of content 100 storyline, vo, action, mystery, puzzles. there is so so much content and i'm about half way now and i dont want it to end!! i don't remember the last game i felt like this, where i wanted to keep playing because it was just so good. bg3 does everything right for me storyline is fully fleshed, pacing makes sense, dialogue choices are meaningful and impactful. skills, combat and action is fluid and most importantly, so much fun. you can sneak attack if you like to hide in the shadows, or you can knock enemies prone for crits if you prefer a hard hitting type play, or if you like range, you can also annihilate them from afar with a fireball. there's so many playstyles for everyone. graphics are absolutely gorgeous the character designs, environment and landscape. i don't know how many times vie stopped to take screenshots because of how breathtaking the game is. the game offers you so many items to play with that you never feel like you're not progressing. progression really is secondary in this game. you don't need to find op items or grind to level up to be strong. you play the game and it happens from all the exploration already. newplayer friendly you don't have to be a dnd vet to play the game, i am very clearly not. it doesn't hurt to learn what each action means so you know what to do, to better your chances of talking your way out of tricky situations or winning a fight but it isnt by any means a steep learning curve. its a game that anyone can really jump right in and start right away! honestly, there's so much more positives about the game and i would be writing a thesis if i listed every single one. but from my personal experience, it is the best 70 purchase i have made. i know i will be playing this for a long time. tldr this game is worth 70! it is a complete game, full of content, fun, repayable, newplayer friendly, no microtransactions, no wardrobe cosmetics, no extra cost for anything. you pay once, you get the entire game. highly recommend!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"fantastic alone, gut busting funny with friends. so many different ways to approach the same problem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is 5 years ahead of the industry, simply great in every aspect. what was expected from larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i created an account just to review this tittle. after 45 hours i still have one more area to do before leaving act 1, and one more boss fight. buy it, there is nothing else to know."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i haven't been this enthralled in a game since breath of the wild. honestly, the amount of care, passion, and creativity that went into this game has me floored. this game has a great combat system from dos2 and added so much immersion and even more dnd inspiration. there are a few bugs here and there with 3 hotfixes being provided in week 1, but for the sheer amount of content and immersion it can be overlooked. the autopathing can be frustrating at times too, but not enough to ruin the experience. be prepared to spend hours upon hours on this game because of how fun and compelling the story is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"an awesome and also complete game upon release. quite a rare sight these days, eh? d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i'm gonna make my future children play this game the day they tun 16 years old.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,the best game in years 1010 highly recommended if you loved dragon age origins and always wanted a proper sequel this is it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i live to game and this one has been a real treat! a must play for true rpg enthusiasts!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"every now and then a game comes out that not only challenges the norm to what video games can accomplish but also changes how we evolve the digital entertainment industry as whole. bg3 is an outstanding achievement in what it means to listen to your player base, while also telling a story you want to tell. as a developer of an indie studio, bg3 inspires me to want to achieve the same level of awe and scale that this game has done. congratulations to larian studios for pushing the envelope. a wellearned victory lap right here."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best game ever made,quited diablo 4 and many other new games just to play this game!!!!! and its fking awsome!!!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"one of the greatest games i have ever played. period! the story telling is superb, the consequences of your choices are real and visible , just amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is what video games used to be. when all my old favourite dev teams have been offered up as ritual sacrifices to the almighty dollar and their creative visions have been drained like the blood from their investor vampire overlords, larian has become a beacon of hope in the wasteland of console ports and pewpew battlegroundsurvival copies that is pc gaming. also inexile and obsidian doing great things aswell bravo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i loved the divinity games, had this early access for this game for about 2,5 years and only played it a some hour or so. now when released i decided to pick it up for real and i think they did basically everything right, the only complaint i have is that maybe it's a bit difficult to get started after the very very brief tutorial you're basically dumped out in the world with not even the slightest pointer of what to do, this is of course similar to the divinity games as well but it would been helpful if the mechanics was explained a bit more thoroughly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"fantastic game. not a massive fan of this genre. but after less than a week i have 35 hours in this game. the way you can approach combat, strategy, roleplaying, customisation, choice feels amazing. the world feels alive, fantastic voice acting"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,not much to say that hasnt been said. ive spent a dozen hours in just character creation and respec.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,llevo pocas horas de juego pero creo que se va a convertir en uno de mis juegos favoritos de todos los tiempos d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"muito bom a experincia, timo jogo. entrega o que se propuseram a fazer,  um mundo vivo, cheio de consequncias, dependendo da sua escolha e tudo esta funcionando bem. no tem muito o que falar foi a cima da expectativa. conseguiram trazer a experincia dd para um jogo, uma dos melhores em trazer isso. existe ponto negativo com relao a dd mas assim ficou mais atrativo para quem no conhece e  novo nesse universo"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"haven't had so much fun playing a game in a long time. gripping story, fun and challenging fights, excellent graphics and lots of choices to progress the game. 1010 well deserved."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,let me just say that i created a metacritic account just to be able to give this game a 10.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"so i have never played dnd or bg game. i have no idea what i am doing here, how ever the game managed to pull me in! i was skeptical because its not my style, but now i am happy i did buy the game. there is long road ahead for me, i have so much things to learn and understand, its overwhelming but i think it will be a good journey. this is the experience we have all be waiting, big studios say this should not be the standard you judge games. i say yes this is my standard from now on and you wont get a cent if you cant match it. this got me back in 2000s when i was playing games just for what they are, we had no mt and , you buy the the game and you play it, that was it and i am happy bg is bringing dead times to players like me. recommended for the 37 year old gamer, have a taste of what gaming was long ago!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,great game. provides the full experience on purchase and doesn't have any microtransactions. one of the best games of 2023.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i waited for years to find a game worthy of dusting off my gaming pc and this is it. baldur's gate 3 continues to blow me away with all it has to offer. the branching story lines, the attention to detail, the characters, the world, the combat, the graphics, the freedom to play how you want. everything has surpassed my expectations. a new standard has been set. an easy 1010 for me. probably the best game i've ever played. i made an account just to give this special game the praise it deserves."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,best video game i've played in years. i'd give it an 11 if i could. every turn reveals new mysteries and wonderful experiences like i've never seen in interactive media.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"thank you for making a game for the consumer. no greed no cosmetic shop no battle pass. great content ! wasnt planning on buying the deluxe, but i will to encourage the studio !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"my personal goty!!! best rpg ever made, i will be playing bg3 for years till bg4 release"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best turnbased rpg i have played yet. i played it for almost 100h in early access and now i have played it already for 70h more, can't wait to play it again to see other outcomes of the story. also i'm amazed by how creative you can be with some solutions to the things you face in the game, it's almost as if they thought of every stupid thing that played might try and said yeah add it, someone gonna do it for sure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,amazing game lots of dialogue variation in the game and this is a huge win i actually feel like i have agency in a game and my decisions matters a lot more often and i see the repercussion for my decisions much sooner vs i see it at the end .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,im 10 hours in and im almost done with the tutorial. this game is so dense and feature complete its impossible not to give this a shot.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"what would be the outcome if you combined the very best of william shakespeare, pier paolo pasolini, alfred hitchcock, federico fellini, john ronald reuel tolkien and ken russell? it would be called 'baldur's gate 3' baldur's gate 3 isn't just a video game, it is a total experience where you are the director in an unseen fantasy world. once you step into that world, it's hard to escape. and as soon as you escape you want to return immediately."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,absolutely the best game i have played in years and i say this as a person that did not use to enjoy turn based rpgs. this is the standard.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best game i've played in recent memory. already a cut above the industry standard by providing a full game with no battle passes or microtransactions and then the game itself is clearly a labor of love. do yourself a favor and really give this one a go, lose yourself in the choices and surprise yourself!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,bsicamente un nuevo referente en la industria. de esos pocos juegos que van marcando pocas y son el espejo en el que se fijarn muchos futuros ttulos.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,loved alot of the game except the combat  just some of the absolute ridiculousness of it where it got pantomime silly.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a flawless return to the forgotten realms. i'm old enough to have played bg1 and 2 when they came out, and this game is such a rich comeback for this game series. combat is turn based like real dnd. the conversations and story rely on chance dice rolls which are addictively fun. there is so much detail, you could play this game 100 times and not see everything. with the races, classes and other character features there is almost limitless possibilities to try. seriously this is a goty for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,more than a game its a lesson to studios. thank you larian to make feel us respected and not customers only.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,najlepsze rpg ostatnich lat. jeli nie wiesz w co pogra to sprbuj bg3 i masz jakiesz 150h z gowy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,game is very good but a bit too long for me also if you have never played a crpg wait for sale it like any game depends if you like the genre
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"baldur's gate iii leaves early access, reaching its full version. it already points ways to be the best fantasy rpg of the last decade. immense roleplaying experience loaded with hours and hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"everything i expected in a 2023 baldur's gate game, and tons that i did not! plenty of depth ensures that i will continue many playthroughs, probably for years to come. character creation literally took me two hours, my first time, as i just took everything in and fiddled with every little change. tons of choices and variations allow you to build almost the exact character of your dreams! the storytelling and world building achieved in the tutorial areaship has way more depth and player engagement than the entirety of diablo 4. you can tell that the team is passionate about their work, as it shines through in every moment of gameplay. the game is extraordinarily charming, and it is worth every single penny."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i've played the game since early access and it has come a long way. its 1010 for me. great story no microtransactions no ingame purchases no paywalls no game passes no preorder exploitative content no internet connection needed to play. lots of content, highly detailed world on a loved and tested concept."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a shockingly deep and expansive game with incredible production values. the developer, larian studios, respects its customers by foregoing drm and excessive monetization. a true spiritual successor to dragon age origins in the best possible way, exceeding all expectations while still feeling familiar."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the game is phenomenal and a masterpiece in rpgs where it sets a new, gold standard! from the customization, to the characters, classes, story and gameplay, there is something for everyone to enjoy even if you're brand new to the series. for new players, the game walks you through with excellent beginnerfriendly tutorials, all of which can be toggled off for advanced players looking for a challenge! additionally, there isn't an ounce of transphobia or homophobia nor does it support anyone who uses their clout to go against transgender humans. unlike jk rowling, this game tells a riveting story that will keep you hooked based on the decisions you make. buy it, play it, and see for yourself as to why this game is phenomenal and game of the year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,easily the greatest crpg of our generation. larian deserves all the praise they are getting for this incredible masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"as someone who has always held rpgs dear to my heart since childhood, i can say that this has become the best rpg i have ever played. i don't know if it will with certainty remain my favorite, though it is now, but no matter what i feel confident saying that no game has ever done a better job of giving freedom and choice to characters in a way such as this. combined with the mind boggling number of lines and cinematics, the world around you truelly knows and reacts to every single one of your actions. big and small."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"one of the best crpg i've ever played, the story, characters and world are incredible. gameplay is addicting and intuitive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the closest to a perfect game i have ever played. the scope of this game is massive, the story is incredible, the gameplay is tactical and exciting, the design and graphics are gorgeous. there's not enough words to describe this game. as a dd player i love this game. friends who hate dd or have never tried it love this game. larian studios has eclipsed all other game studios and it shows in their last two games dos2 and bg3. this is the only game i have played this year that is worth the full price and even more. not diablo 4, not zelda, not hogwarts legacy. there will not be a game of this quality, scope and care in the next decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game feels like its worth the 60 and then some. larian does care about making a good game and aaa game companies should learn from them when it comes to making rpgs
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"el juego es excelente, en tiempos donde ningn estudio se arriesga por miedo a no generar ingresos y terminan lanzando juegos casi standar y con poca originalidad llego este ttulo que es sumamente arriesgado en su propuesta ms de nicho y al hacer un juego con tanta pasin y buscando abracar cada detalle y eso es de agradecer. ojal sea elegido como el juego del ao. simplemente una joya."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"muy buenos grficos, pero la jugabilidad deja algo que desear en cuanto a eso"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"well, i was hyped but the history isn't that great to be honest... bad camera movement and slow as hell, also i got some bugs too bad, not impressed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"an absolute masterpiece, baldur's gate was already a very famous and important ip for cprgs, so the bar was high, but larian did the impossible with this title, dos2 was already excellent, but this game is out of this world, congratulations! my personal goty!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game is not banned in my region russia and i'm genuinely happy about it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"em resumo, baldur's gate 3  mais do que um jogo  uma jornada pica que vai te prender do comeo ao fim. com sua personalizao rica de personagens, histria envolvente e possibilidades infinitas, este jogo merece um lugar de destaque na coleo de qualquer f de rpg. no perca tempo  mergulhe de cabea nesta aventura magnfica e preparese para se perder em um mundo de maravilhas e desafios picos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"an incredibly complete rpg, setting a new standard for the genre in terms of gameplay, story, and especially freedom of player choice. the world is so immersive, interactive, and malleable that it truly feels alive in a way that even mmos have not managed. the overall quality exceeds even the golden age of bioware rpgs. it is the best game in the turn based rpg genre of the decade so far, and it belongs in the conversation of best of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,just i say wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!!!!!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it is an absolute masterpiece , finally after such a long time of lifeless profit games a game with heart and soul! i will enjoy it for a very long time, my new favourite game of all time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"larian studio exists as a proof that a privately owned company with a few hundred employees is capable of producing games that are better than any triplea title. this is because they can focus on delivering an amazing, complete experience, without having to be concerned about shareholders and profits constantly. they clearly have an amazing team, amazing talent, and good management. the ceo of the company is a great guy and a big reason why this is a massive success. it's a wake up call for these massive, obsolete triplea studios to step up or fail, and i'm all for it. we need more studios like larian out there. the game itself is the greatest game i've ever played, the absolute pinnacle of the rpg genre. enough said."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"great rpg, no  so it is possible, other developers. take note. no more excuses. get money as a forefront idea out of your heads. create art. its not as complicated as some want it to be. do it right. give the people what they want. the data exists and you have it. so use it for good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"amazing game, the possibilities for multiple replays are fantastic. this game will keep most people entertained with unique and refreshing playthroughs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,baldur's gate 1 and 2 were one of the games of my life. baldur's gate 3 will be too. little can i say about this absolute masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,best game in years. no other game this year will come close to being as good as this game is.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the attention to detail is unreal. the cooperative multiplayer play is an absolute blast, hilarious with 4 people. best game of the year, by far. i haven't had this much fun in so long"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a simply incredible achievement. i feel like i'm playing neverwinter nights for the first time again. larian proves they understand not just dd but crpgs as a medium in general. i hope we see more subclasses and perhaps more races in the future, but as a released product, it has a polished, mtxfree, and most importantly finished feel to it. some bugs and glitches here and there but in a game this massive that's to be expected, and i personally haven't run into anything worse than the odd graphics bug. it's my 2023 goty for sure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,the game is great! devs have been updating nonstop on any issues that are reported. i think a lot of people who gave negative reviews don't understand what's at stake. what makes this game a 910 is not just the game but the fact it does not use explorative techniques to steal your money. you don't need to buy 20 dlcs to play the full game. this is the standard we need to expect from every big title game. if not you will get diablo immortal where only the whales get to have fun.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i made an account just to say this. this is the best rpg game i have ever played. if you didn't like turn based combat before, this game might change your mind. there are multiple choices for every situation, and those choices have consequences. interesting, well written characters. great graphics. great music. excellent game design overall. play with your friends or play solo, both are great experiences. larian studios, thank you for making this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"after years finally we come back to forgotten realms! graphically it's perfect, gameplay is as playing dungeons and dragons with friends. just love it more than my family. little bad thing the character creation and level up is too much simple, in the second chapter levelling up was more complicated just for many possible choices"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"loving this game and its many dialog options, combat feels challenging and fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,es ist das beste spiel das ich seit langem gespielt habe. keinerlei probleme beim erst start es ist fertig und nicht manch andere games halbgar. es ist einfach mega und in sich perfekt ich kann es nur absolut empfehlen
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is a fantastic game for anyone who appreciates or even has considered playing crpgs, it is absolutely worth the price and i'm probably going to be playing it for months, i didn't take any time off work to play, but it's only been a week and i'm already up to 29 hours of playtime, and looking forward to playing more this weekend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,best and most memorable game i have played in a very very long time. 150 hours in and i feel like i have barely scratched the surface. this is definitely not only a new standard for the crpg genre but for the games industry as a whole. a complete game not burdened with a store or microtransactions that delivers a top notch and unforgettable experience.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"meine erste rezension und gleich eine als absoluter noob im fantasygenre, der sich dazu berzeugen hat lassen zuzuschlagen nach mittlerweile 26.5 stunden in den letzten vier tagen absolut grandioses spiel. es war definitiv die richtige entscheidung einzusteigen. wenn einem das genre grundstzlich zusagt und man bock darauf hat sich richtig einzuarbeiten, der wird zu 100 auf seine kosten kommen. fr mich ist bg3 der inbegriff von spieltiefe und storyflexibilitt. wem das in anderen spielen immer wieder mal zu kurz kam, ist hier absolut richtig. die detailreiche und tiefe der bisher gesehenen dungeons ist einfach faszinierend. allein quests a la finde den pilzsammler und der damit verbundene teil des unterreichs ... wahnsinn. mit jeder googlesuche die man wiederwillig starten muss, weil es keine optionen mehr zu geben scheint um ein quest voranzutreiben ... wird einem nur vor augen gefhrt, dass man noch aufmerksamer sein muss. in der summe fhlt es sich so an, als wrde man in 2023 breaking bad, the wire und sopranos entdecken, hat die erste staffel rum und wre eigentlich selbst damit schon unfassbar zufrieden  aber man hat einfach noch 15 weitere gleichwertige staffeln vor sich  so bekloppt es klingt, aber gefhlt mchte man fast mehr tuen, als nur den preis frs spiel zu zahlen um sicherzustellen, dass larian studios exakt in dieser form weitermacht."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"very recommended, lots of content, amazing companions, va everywhere, i would love to see more legendary loot but it is legendary it should be a small amount, fights are long but you have a lot of possibilities to end them quickly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the game has deep interesting turn based combat and a great story filled with interesting characters and choices.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is amazing. you have so much freedom in how to handle encounters, quests etc. the dialogues are interesting, the story is compelling, and the sheer depth of it is nothing short of impressive. good job larian games, this is absolutely amazing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"fantastic game. looks amazing, plays amazing, excellent writing and story so far. chapeau larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"not a typical game i play but i instantly fell in love with this game. larian seems to be in touch with their community and what it wants and delivers on what they say. many other studios now a days just focus on microtransactions and huge cash grabs where larian seems to just want to make a great game. i hope this sets a new standard for the gaming industry in general, gamers making games for gamers instead of corporations coming in and charging while ruining the games. hats off to you larian best game i have played in a long time, thank you!! keep doing what you seem to do best!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,for me this is best rpg ever. bg3 definitely to beat fallout 2. bravo larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"holy moly, a game like this is pretty much one in a million. amazing characters, amazing story, great build variety and great gameplay that's almost a 11 recreation of 5th edition dd. probably one of the best games i've played in years, and this is coming from someone that really isn't all that crazy about crpgs. the only downside is that i wish that you could go crazy and get to level 20, but those 9th and 10th level spells can get crazy, so i'll imagine that implementing them would be a nightmare. also, you can turn into a squid if you want to. btw, even if i usually never address this because obviously everyone is entitled to his own opinion, and i'm totally fine with people disagreeing with me not problem, i do find it pretty clear and funny that there's some poor sod dedicated enough to manually flag every positive review as not helpful, what a sad existence you are living my guy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,larian studios knocked it out of the park again. baldur's gate 3 gives you boundless options from character customization and choices to make during your journey. it has a fantastic and immersive story. if you buy this game know that you are getting a full product from the start and not a broken product riddled with micro transactions designed to deprive you of as much of your money as possible while providing you with as little as possible. as far as i am concerned baldur's gate 3 is the gold standard for rpg games and furthermore serves as an indictment of the aaa game studios that consistently shovel out inferior quality games for exorbitant amounts of money.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"so i just finished 2nd act of this game. it's not perfect, there was couple of bags, there is a few things that can be improved such as camera movement and sound. but i still give it a 10. that rating comes from my heart, cos i wanna show to larian studios that we gamers appriciate their efforts. we love an full completed games without ingame shop, we love good script and characters. and we feel with what awe and diligence this game was made, for which we are incredibly grateful to the developers. this gratitude is expressed in support, both by a simple assessment and by the purchase of all possible editions of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i have been playing this game since the release, and, in one week, i haven't managed to finish even act 1 after 25 hours real life and all that. still, just the first act is more complete than 90 of the games i have played. every corner you turn, there is a new secret, a new way to finish your mission. you can do everything you can think of doing and some you probably can't think of. at one point, i managed to talk my way into the enemy camp, mess up their ritual, and release the prisoners, then i placed a silence spell on a room, killed one of their bosses, went to the next boss, repeat. that one section reminded me of the hitman games. everything reacts to your choices, the game even realizes you have multiclassed and reacts to you. remove your cloth and run around naked? people will comment on it. i think i can play the first act 5 times and still not get every variation and that's a 30hour section. i think i will be too busy with this game to play anything else for the foreseeable future. oh, and there is a cute owlbear cub who gets adopted by the dog you adopt as the dog's little brother. what's there not to like?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is the best rpg in the last 7 years. i am surprised when someone in the game industry says that larian studios has some privileges, and they are biased toward them. the people who work at larian studios are simply obsessed, so much work has been done and so much desire to do something wonderful. you are simply the gold of the gaming industry, i wish you and your management good luck because you are the ones who set the rhythm of the gaming industry. let all other companies start learning from you how to make games, not services. i am waiting for your new announcements after the rest, i have a strong desire to help you during fundraising if there will be any on kickstarter or elsewhere."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"wwwwwwwoooooooo doggggy what a game ! , what a darn  game . this is absolutely amazing its tooooo toootin good it gets your blood pumping in all the right places . pick up bladurs gate 3 you hear"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game is so good that i made a metacritic account just to put a score on how good it was. high amount of replay ability and so many options from classes to how you fight combat encounters. worth every penny.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"absolutly perfect, down to the last frame. a great deep dive in dnd experience. every piece of the game is a handcrafted to make your choices relevant. its probably the most ambicious rpg game that i ever played, and certainly creates a new standard for the default experience of the genre in the aaa segment."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,smashed my expectations after divinity 2. easy game of the year and probably best rpg i've ever played.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"one of the best rpg's to release in years. beautiful graphics, awesome optimization, released with no game breaking bugs, no battlepass, no microtransactions. good dd gameplay implementation. truly a game held to the standards of years past that have been missing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i made an account just to say amazing game, definitely game of the year. amazing job larion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the new bar for rpgs has been set, and the gaming world will never be the same. gonna be real hard for certain aaa studios to ask 70 for their latest generic shovel ware crap while this game exists for 60."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a very amazing game in background, story, and gameplay. an indispensable classic from now until the end of time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"honestly the best game i have played in years, maybe even a decade. there was so much love poured into this game and it has blown me away."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,550 hours in 3 years and this game still continues to astound me. it's worth every penny.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"amazing game, everything i've expected. happy to see a game make with love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,larian studios vc superou. todas empresas de games de rpgs do mundo fantstico pelo preo por tudo obrigado por no cobrar a mais esse sim  o game maravilhoso
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"enjoyable, replayable and totally faithful to the lore of faern, with the distinct and unique flavour that larian brings. they truly raised the bar for everyone that wishes to make a crpg, because not only did they do a very very good game they launched it without annoying the fanbase to tears. stellar graphics, varied and interesting companions, lots and lots of interesting things to do, find and discover. i have waited a long time for a game like this, and i was worried they'd somehow wouldn't make dd justice, but boy did larian deliver! it was worth the delay, the extended wait, the uncertainty. they took their time, and all i can say is thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"o melhor crpg que j joguei na vida, superou seus antecessores, divinity, pillars of eternity, neverwinter, entre outros. elevaram em muito o padro do gnero. supre todos os defeitos de divinity e melhora tudo que j havia sido feito anteriormente usando dd, os personagens so cativantes, a histria  tima, as batalhas so desafiadoras e recompensam bastante a criatividade e o pensar fora da caixa. muitas das vezes eu me sentia jogando um literal rpg de mesa, a sensao  emulada muito bem em vrios momentos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"from never playing an completely roleplay game with this style and turn based combat to absolutely loving it. larian did an awesome job. review after 30h of gameplay, still a lot to discover, can't wait to play more!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"dear lord, this game is so goooood! played it for nearly 30 hours and still in act 1 out of 3 acts. so much content, so much to do, so much to discover. i've locked myself out of certain side quests because of my decisions but i am still having a blast and know that this game has so much replayability possibilities. the world, characters, atmosphere, voice actors, writing and the cool turn based combat with so much depth to passivesactives and classes, it's all so amazingly cool. this game is a completefeature game. i can't believe that i have to be thankful for something like that... we live in 2023 and we are constantly getting unfinished products with mtx plastered all over it that have a premium price slapped on it, meanwhile this game just offers it all without any invasive mtx. only preorder mtx which is totally fine. 1010 game for me! this is coming from someone who's not an avid turn based combat gamer. thank you larian studios! i am not setting my expectations to be always as high as bg3 for you, but you've won someone over. looking forward to your future projects."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i love shadowheart i love karlach i love laezel i love jaheira i love woman

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best rpg i've ever played! sublime implementation of the dd 5e mechanics. a story with rich characters, choices that matter, and awesome moments."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,i am so glad that i bought bg3 3 years ago! this game has been too fun to put down. your can only be limited by your imagination!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"el mejor juego estilo rol por a cantidad de decisiones abiertas que puedes tomar, cualquier personaje que te caiga bien o mal puedes ayudarlo o directamente matarlo para robarle los equipo y haces desaparecer personajes y la historia sigue sin ellos o te dan mayor narrativa si siguen vivos y as todo el mundo completo de baldur gate 3"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"highly customizable characters with brilliant writing, impacting open world decisions, great music, and amazing voice acting. big bonus that it's micro transaction free and doesn't require you to be online all the time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,its a masterpiece. all aspects of the game shines. its amazing how much love larian has put in this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i haven't felt this emotional playing a game since i was a kid. from the voiceacting, soundtrack, combat, and reactive storytelling, everything is topnotch. there are a handful of bugs, especially in act 3. but for a game of this scale and ambition, bugs are forgivable at launch. an absolute masterpiece and mustplay for anyone who considers themselves a fan of rpgs. the only thing truly bad thing about this game is that it ends."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,the fact that anyone would even dare consider this game not being a masterpiece is just sad for these people
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game is absolutely amazing! so much freedom! it's gigantic in scope and complexity. even aaa developers like blizzard and insomniac cried on twitter or x that it's unfair to compare other games to bg3. lol. what better advertisement do you need for this beautiful game? the competition thinks it's way too good! go and play it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is an absolute masterpiece and the only hate is coming from insecure men who cant handle seeing a pixel dong bigger than theirs in a video game. this game really shows that given the time plus tender love  care you can make a game wildly imaginative with immersive battles and story progression. combat  extremely satisfying, complex and difficult within reason which creates scenarios where you must observe your environment and use it to your advantage lore  the story is of course a complex weave of beautiful monologues and interpersonal relationships that alter the past present and future of your gameplay and personalized storyline. artcinematics  breathtaking cinematics with meaningful dialogue and meaningful story progression, the graphics are simply amazing. this game is truly something special. i have logged just about 60 hours since launch and i see easily 200 hours or more of gameplay left for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this is a wonderful game. being around since early access and it is a nice shift to have a developer actually listening and caring for the players. i've been playing almost non stop now because the immersion is so deep that i forget my life exists.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a good solid 910. not a 10 because i loathe 5e. the levelling progression is just so dumbed down compared to something like pathfinder. it has the same flaws as solasta in this respect. some of the races have lacklustre bonuses. you can see from their own data that half wood elf is overwhelmingly the most popular race. i feel particularly aggrieved for halflings, half elves make better bards, which seems wrong. combat is very good though. its difficult to have an unique perspective, its the best system ive used to date. storytelling is good and the music is appropriate and atmospheric. great"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,absolutely addicted to the game after lunch day and have reintroduced me to the wonders of gaming that i used to feel as a kid. one of the best games i've ever played!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is huge, full of content and with a very high quality. larian definitively made a good work in this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i'm a huge rpg fan. my favorite games of all time have always been bioware classics, like mass effect, kotor, and dragon age. but surprisingly, baldur's gate 3 was never really on my radar. i picked this game up on release and... just wow. this may be my new favorite game of all time. the narrative is so strong, the characters unique, and the gameplay is just so enjoyable even if you don't usually like turnbased games. i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a long and replayable rpg experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,lovely! larian packs so much in this. the benchmark for crpgs sits now way higher!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i highly doubt a single person giving a 10 actually finished the game. first off durge is tav it was clearly the intended way to play, and im happy i chose it first. secondly, the camera is actually genuinely the worst camera in a video game since kingdom hearts 1. you don't feel it much until act 3, but oh boy does the verticality of act 3 tell the camera to go f itself. third issue is the game is not as complex as people make it out to be. the interactions certaintly are, but there are 2 endings. good ending, bad ending. then the endings of your companions. but overall its 2 endings, and not only that the way you play and previous decisions do not dictate it, you can see both endings regardless of playthrough by hitting f5 30 seconds before the end of the game. the pacing suffers from larians common mistake. act 1 is phenomenal in every way. act 2 is great aswell. act 3 is a mess. act 3 contains as much as act 1 and 2 in terms of content, but to be slapped with go here to end the game right away as you enter act 3 just feels terrible, no buildup every single quest you do in act 3 besides 2 are side quests that have no bearing on the ability to complete the game. and the level pacing. 18 takes 2030 hours. 912 took me 5 hours. you also feel the badness of items in act 3. you get all this mega cool stuff, which makes you a bit upset that some of those cool mechanics for items are only avaliable with a few hours left of the game  i understand those items should be, but some have mechanics that could be on less dps heavy items earlier. with a few hours left in my playthrough i was so damne excited to start a new playthrough, and then after that ending i just felt absolutely no desire. it's not a bad game. its an amazing game and i'll stand by that, but the story replayability is much less than people think. the balancing is also really bad. tactician became a joke after level 8. up to that level its very well balanced, but again falls apart in act 3. also one huge gripe is a nat 20 is a success, they give you multiple rolls youd need to nat 20 on at the end of the game, and if you save scum to get them the same beats play out. really really bugged me. music is a 910, and a specific fight theme is an 1110. combat itself is a 910, but the balancing is a 710, but the groundwork is there that a mod could make the balancing a 1010 and the combat stands alone at 910. visuals are easily a 1010. interactibility is a 1010. story up until the end is very good. 910, but the ending is really really bad like 510 there. performance is great until act 3 and im on a 4090 and got sub 60 fps on 1440p nbut that can be fixed overall a great game for one playthrough but not the second coming of christ like the people still in act 1 and 2 are claiming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it's great, you can do lots of stuff, the characters are interesting, interacting with them is fun, roleplaying is fun, fighting is fun, the map is fun to explore and never gives the feeling of being empty. i spent 25 hours in the game so far, i haven't even done the main quest for most of this time, all the side quests are interesting and different. i didn't even know i liked this genre, it's just a great game, play it, and have fun that other developers are complaining about how good it is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,worth the wait. this is what a crpg should be. a breath of fresh air in a games industry too focused on profit over quality.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is up there as one of the most indepth and story rich games ive ever experienced, with a beautiful and immersive world in the mix. huge props to larian studios releasing such a perfect gem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the definitive dnd experience in a videogame. great characters, story, voice acting. larian did an amazing work with this game, which is a gigantic sandbox with hidden timers that force you to pursue an objective before the story progresses and you find only the aftermath. definitively an amazing replay value. if you enjoy dnd, be sure to give this game a go."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,este juego merece el goty y no el zelda ya que su target son obesos mrbidos que juegan smash todo el da y viven en el stano
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game is awesome literally i lost my mind. my 3rd crpg game since baldur's gate and baldur's gate 2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,a must play if you ever played dd.. and if not also a really good way to enter this world
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is how to make a game. ea, activision and blizzard should learn from larian studio."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this is a brilliant game. possibly the best rpg i have ever played. every single npc has a voice line. its possibly the grandest rpg i have ever played. this is my first dive into any game like this and i love it. i see a few of the negative reviews and they seem to be boomers stuck in the old times about how baldurs gate games were back 20 years ago. times have changed for games and this game is way better than how they used to be as i tried them as a kid and they dont come close to this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i don't play crpgs, the turn based gameplay always seemed repetitive and boring to me. i can safely say that baldur's gate 3 is one of the best games i have ever played. after the prologue, it absorbs you into the dd universe and does not let you go, because you don't want it to. i would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"though constrained slightly by the dnd system, bg3 manages to make a great experience in both single and multiplayer. a small peeve is that some of the dialogue with companions seems forced and unnatural, but it manages pretty well all things considered. there is a huge amount of content and even with nearly 100 hours i have not seen it all, so 910 for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"for 60 you get turnbased rpg game with interesting story, many cool characters, great combat, huge world, 0 microtransactions, no battlepass, no dlc. as a man who never played any baldur's gate game before and has low experience with this combat system i can say that this is the best game this year and it really deserve goty. i can't stop playing it, it's so good. last game that i had much fun playing was witcher 3 and skyrim. nowdays devs should take an example from lorian studios how to make video games that players will enjoy it for many many hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,too busy actually playing this chad  so i am writing filler words for this review
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a complete game without microtransactions, thats completely playable, and is a new standard for rpgs and video games in general, in 2023?!? miracle, thy name is larian. baldurs gate 3 is a beacon of light is a dark abyss of lazy developers and greedy publishers. even if you dont like the genre, you should buy the game, just to support what larian is doing, but i guarantee, youll love the game. what larian has done is only possible from a studio that listen to their fans, and actually cares about their players. studios two and three times larger have been crying, because they know they are too lazy to do this, but larian showed everyone who they are, and they are making the lazy studios look bad."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,1010 game very nice. well done. just play and see. you should play to understand how beautiful the game mechanics and how it lets you do anything you can imagine.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"absolutely the best gaming experience i have had in years. i fondly remember the original baldurs gate, bg3 has captured the essence of the original game and improved it in all manners. i have the hugest respect for the developers and the mindset that lies behind making such a mammoth . bases on my experience the have never said that's good enough during the development of the game, but kept working until it was as perfect as possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is a truly incredible game. playing through it with my wife and i'm sure we'll be doing so for a long time to come,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it has been said before, lets say it again... congratulations to larian and the success of this game. no microtransactions feature complete game the message is out that this is the new standard in video gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,an absolute masterpiece. i played 2 acts right now and i am really thankful that the world still has developers who care about their games. thanks larian keep up that good work

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best game in decades, great with friends or solo and overdelivered expectations."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"not a bad game, but worse than the previous dos2. and by no means it's baldur's gate. it's dos3. btw always ignore 10 and 0 reviews by the botsshills."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"simply remarkable, so much attention to detail. the world, the story, the characters  a masterpiece. and then there is this consistent freedom of choice, which also always leads to more or less severe consequences. i haven't played a game this good in a long time that can keep me in front of the screen for night after night. and even though the game is only a little over a week out of early access, i've only encountered two minor graphical bugs so far, but they didn't affect my gaming experience in any way. 1010  worth a try for anyone who has the time to dig into such an extensive game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"what to say when you see that something like that got a score of 9.7. bigger than some classics like half life, bioshock, portal, vice city, starcraft, etc. you can see the state of the gaming industry, a large part of the game is just a bad movie, 10 minutes of talking, 5 minutes of turn based combat , then another 10 minutes of talking and let's not forget the 5 minutes of cinematic where someone someone moves their lips and eyes as if they are constipated when the narrator explains everything to us, because we are blind and deaf. some locations are decent, but apart from them everything is pathetic, the biggest city its just a joke, no spoiler, but look like a joke how they hyped it and nothing in the end. companions are annoying and there just to piss of the main character, same with the romances. gameplay its a turn based 5e system, so bad from the start, the story is full of cliches and predictable, while the endings, only one is decent, no spoilers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"tengo 43 aos, jugue en su dia baldur's gate 1 y 2 de salida y esper muchisimos aos por esta continuacion y tengo que decir que super ampliamente mis expectativas. todos se resume en que graficos, sonido y jugabilidad son perfectos, la historia es excelente y hace mucho que un rpg no me engancha tanto como este. no lo dejen pasar. valio la pene tanto tiempo en early access"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"60 hours in, having a blast. absolute nerdgasm! of course i can find cons on this game sometimes clunky camera, for someone a weird animations of main character in cinematics but hey, when you have a game which is 1110 it makes it 1010, right? it's a must have in your collection. i'm so excited during the first playthrough about my other playthroughs as i see how many options and roleplaying aspects you can get in this game. and that is indeed a rarity in these times of remakes, sequels for sequels, etc.. go for it, don't wait."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"for all the dungeons  dragons lovers this game is a must. larian studios has taken the top spot for best game developers for me, no doubt! keep up the good work. already looking forward to the next title."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"est es la manera de hacer un juego gente pensando en sus jugadores, tomando el feedback de cada parche en el early access, con dedicacin y con amor, con una correcta direccin en hacer un buen juego y no en cumplir metas econmicas, larian lleg para dar clases a todas las empresas de tercera en el mercado, as es como se supone que son los juegos, as es como se supone que eran los juegos cuando a todos nos empezaron a gustar, dirigidos al jugador, al disfrute, a cumplir un sueo y no a usar al consumidor y abusar de l y su billetera baldurs gate 3 es mi juego, no del ao, sino de la dcada, imponente"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,baldur's gate 3 is easily the best game i've played this year. i love playing it with my gf! although multiplayer isn't perfect and some aspects of the game are definitely dated.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is so good it inspired me to make an account on metacritic to give it a 10. i have never posted a review before. i am both lazy and suspicious of giving any company my email address.. but i did for this game. apart from being a breath of fresh air in gaming it is just a really good game. it is fun even parts that should be boring are fun. i don't words good, but i would like to convey my absolute love for the game. if you have even the smallest interest in this style of game, then buy it. buy it for your friends, give it as a wedding present. give it as a funeral present. buy it again. send the folks at the studio flowers. so good!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,incredible game. best i've played since elden ring and completely different. not trying to be anything other than an amazing dnd game. larian is the ultimate gigachad for becoming the most clutch dm we've all ever had.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game is out of this world. good in so many ways. so beautiful, so deep and so satisfying. completely unlike so many recent aaa games. truly a must play experience even if you are not a fan of the genre. the gameplay, story and characters are steller and the cinimatics and character interactions are good enough to be in a top tier movie or series your choices matter and there is so much to say and do it's overwelming in the best possible way. the detail and interactivity in this game is mind blowing. beautiful visually and sonicly. should get game of the century nevermind game of the year. the best video game i have ever played..period."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game has been a breath of fresh air for the gaming industry. ever since the gaming industry has garnered popularity, microtransactions, and cashcow garbage has been more prevalent with these modern gaming studios, even the companies with the big ips are doing it cough cough, blizzard, cough cough. it feels incredible playing an immersive game where i can explore a massive world and do the cool thing because larian wanted to create a work of art that catered to what dd players and gamers alike wanted. larian did their job making quite possibly one of the best games of all time, and i look forward to only playing games that follow the golden standard that larian has set for the industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,it is definitely a perfect example of a role model in the gaming industry. an absolute masterpiece for fans of the genre and a sign that there's still hope for modern games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"great game, needs patches, and atm randoms can join your game, and they become permanent to your party. this is not good. i want to make my own party. make sure your in offline mode at start of character build to stop this or it's a full restart build if it happens. there is also no option to enlarge inventory screens. icons are tiny at 4k. will update review when patched. this will be a 10 when sorted."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"best game ever 2023,it's very nice game. nice story,nice graphics,nice sound,nice music. nice all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it's a joke if you compare it to the old games, from the gameplay 5e turn based only to the dialogue which is cringe to the core, you'll roll your eyes every 5 minutes, especially the humor companions that are all the embarrassment, but unfortunately if you play alone, what's the point of playing a game like this? romance and s44x is only there to lure people into playing the game it doesn't deserve the name baldur's gate, but here we are, 97100 critics, for what?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the best game i had in a while . very interesting game play, amazing cut scenes, non linear etc etc etc only positive . highly recommend to anyone. even my wife who is far away from gaming are playing it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"reminiscent of the golden age of pc rpgs, only better. dd rules, strategic combat, full scope interaction with the world. this game is the absolute gold standard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the legend of zelda is also good but bg3 is something more different. 1010 i think bg3 could be game of the year. not only fun but represent the big breaking thorough of crpg, the influence is hard to see these decade. did raise the bar for all past and future crpg games. just as swen said in panel from hell, the peak they bring to the game just same as bg2 did as a pioneer before. larian is carring the torch and lead us to show what crpg could be in the future! no matter what goty for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"baldur's gate 3 is an absolute masterpiece that takes the rpg genre to new heights, delivering an unparalleled gaming experience that will leave you utterly spellbound. larian studios has outdone themselves, crafting a game that seamlessly blends captivating storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and deep gameplay mechanics into a symphony of gaming perfection. this is 100 game of the year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"updated my review after finishing first full playthrough. this is a 1010 game. can't express enough how almost perfect this game is. it captures everything that is great about dd and makes a brilliant crpg. dd has issues, it is not the best ttrpg but it works very very well as a video game. however it is as close to perfect as a game like this is ever likely to be, absolutely without a doubt one of the best video games ever made. it is staggering what these developers have pulled off. i can only wish that other developers would take similar approaches, i don't think that will happen. this is probably a unicorn... and we are so lucky to have it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,100 goty. there is no way that some dlc for zelda will be rated higher than this big and interesting journey.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game showing we,the gamers,can be treated with respekt. baldurs gate 3 is complete game, complete product, complete expirience with working plethora of mechanics, posibilities and vary good scenario in plural. this is not half ptofuct for full price from gigantic companies. yes you xan!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"overall boring indie game, combat is obviously outdated, unless you wanna feel nostalgic and pretend it's 90s again. i personally don't want to do that. graphics are fine, but nothing amazing, not even comparable to stuff like cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"1010 one of the best games i played in years! no microtransactions or  dls, just a great finished game, i hope more games will come out like this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,probably rpg of the decade. unbelievable amount of quality content with player choice and consequence. strongly recommend for every gamer even if you usually are not into turn based rpgs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,love everything about the game except the turn based combat. kudos to larian studios for making such a great game.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"fights are really slow, even tiny battles feel endless. the talking is as bad as fan stories. the friends are either bothersome or not at all interesting. and the whole game is very dirty and full of weird stuff. it's really disappointing to see what they did with baldur's gate. i won't play it again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,this game has made me happy about gaming again. its such a high quality game clearly made with love and passion instead of only checking of a checklist of things there should be in a game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a game that's finished developing on release  a game that has more content as expected  a game that is not sold more expensive then other games lately  a game that does not try to implement buzzword features  a game that sticks to it's heritage so you can call the complex system and turn based battle oldschool and complicated, but that's the direct adaptation of the dd rules from pen  paper. and not your controller skill will decide if you succeed, but your tactic and character stats. you have to like this, but then... this is the most perfect game of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"even me, who is new to this genre, impressed me. great game. a real roleplaying game. i don't think it will get any better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,best game ever. buy it just trust me dont listen to soy noobs. spent 150 hours in this game and will spent more if i have time to

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i had high expectation because i was hyped by the first and second games of this trilogy. i wasn't disappointed and the quality of the scripts, the immersion, the game play, everything show me that this game is the best rpg game ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,rare to find a game these days where you pay one price and one price only and get thousands of hours worth of gameplay. loads of customization on characters amazing story great cutscenes and good looking game. the big companies need to tanke notice. no massive issues with release it was very smooth. game of the year if not decade
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"me and my partner cannot get enough, this game is amazing in scope and polish. what this team has achieved is truly breath taking! thank you larien for bringing us so much joy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"there should be more companies that think about making a good game well done and put money in the background, which will come anyway. 10 not for the game, but for the commitment and attention given to development even after launch."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it's very rare when i can't stop playing. this year brought so many disappointing games, but this is not one of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this game looks outdated and terribly overloaded with game mechanics. in addition, the authors of the game have absolutely no taste in design and style, the game looks like the most primitive fantasy with multicolored tasteless outfits, it does not have its own unique style. the characters in the game don't seem to be alive, they look like plastic dolls trying to portray emotions through dialogue written by a first grader during breaks between lessons. if you want to see welldesigned charismatic characters, look at them in the same the witcher 3, where any npc will give 100 handicap points to all the characters from bg3 combined. the game itself is nothing more than jerking off on the numbers of characteristics. such a mass psychosis around this game i explain with an incredibly aggressive advertising bombardment in all social networks and publics, where people were inspired through a sex scene with a bear that it would be unbridled fun throughout the entire gameplay, although this is not so  the game is very mournful and boring for most people, like any turnbased tactics  these games are absolutely not for everyone. but i am sure that many people do not admit to themselves that they did not like the game, firstly because of public pressure and fear of being hated for it, and secondly because of their unwillingness to admit their mistakes, that they spent their money and time, succumbing to mass influence, because they will already go to the end and inspire themselves that they like everything and put 1010 just so as not to admit to themselves that they were deceived. in fact, the game is the most ordinary crpg, in which there is nothing special and this game does not really deserve such attention to itself, but it received it only thanks to marketing. don't be afraid to say what you don't like, don't be afraid of public censure, don't be afraid to admit mistakes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,game of the year to me. larian studios proved again that they know what they are doing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"breaks the trend of dumbing down games in an attempt to appeal to the masses, this game appealed to the masses. amazing graphics, story, mechanics and no game breaking bugs. no shoehorned in microtransactions, this game will make its money on its own merit and if they ever release new adventure packs in the future, i'll be confident that they won't be cash grabs and will have received the care we deserve. side quests are interesting, not just repetitive go to map marker, do the thing, go back to start, rinse, repeat, they feel like realistic distractions from the main storyline. add in the freedom to pretty much do whatever you want and we have as close to a perfect game as we've ever had."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,why can i not give 11 as a score? the only people who should not like this gem  should either hate turn based combat or rpgs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,besides divinity original sin ii the best game in 10 years. baldurs gare 3 shouldnt exist but it does and its all i have been waiting for 3 years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"probably the best game i have been playing since a very long time. addictive, story is  amazing i can't wait to discover the rest of the game. if you are familiar and like the turn combat system mod. it is a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"excellent exploration but as soon as combat starts it gets boring. looks great but lacks any form of facial customization besides color and has a total of 1 likeable full party member with absolutely terrible party management, it shouldn't take more than 10 clicks to give your inactive party member a new piece of kit. the camp overall is not very enjoyable with its layout changing every 5 minutes, meaning you have to find your party members new locations. and there are way too many active rolls that stop the flow of whatever it is you were doing with your party skill not mattering at all  sure you might have that historyexpertiseman sitting next to you but he ain't going to help you with that dc 15 check. oh and the ui isn't very good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i can honestly say i haven't played a game that made me cry, cheered outload, laughed hysterically, or get angry like this game can. i'm on my first full playthrough and i've grown extremely attached to my companions. astarion, la'zel, and shadowheart. all of their characters are so different but i feel an actual connection to them. the story itself honestly could have ended at act ii and i would have felt satisfied it's just that good. the whole end to the second chapter was the best by far experience i've ever had in a video game rivaling fallout 4's brotherhood of steel ending or the last mission of halo 3. for the first time in a game i feel like my choices actually matter, and i can do things the way i would really do them if i were my character. bravo larion studios you knocked it out of the park."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it is a good game but over hyped. it inherits all the problems from divinity i and ii. the camera is horrible, the game is clunky as hell, the map is a nightmare, there are a million bugs who would have said this had a 3 year early access, inventory management is from the last century, and a long list everyone seems to be completely ignoring. the devs essentially are hiding all these problems behind the ridiculous amount of content and diversity in choice options. i specifically did not like the new edition of dnd rules  they are oversimplified and a lot of the appeal coming from overall complexity in mechanics and classes is gone. now we have 'fun' things to do like pushing enemies off screen and throwing objects. it runs boring pretty quickly. i also cannot stand the fixation of larian with elemental damage the need to cast water spell to put out a fire surface  same as before, this is fun the first time but becomes boring very quickly. turn based combat is a step back for the franchise but larian can only do turn based and a level cap of 12 is a slap on the face the game in general and the narrative in particular are extremely slow, specially for martial classes you literally go through irrelevant levelling upgrades other than hit points most of the time. i would have preferred a more focused experience in terms of content, dialogue and choice and a level 20 cap to properly develop your characters. having said all of this it is indeed a great game and a very good classic rpg but i really think obsidian would have done better justice to the franchise as a whole. i miss the fun in the contained experience of pillars of eternity and the depth outside of narrative from games like pathfinder."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the game has multiple unique properties that make it awesome. in my opinion the story telling, the continously more immersive story and the plethora of good writen character makes this a 1010 rpg. moreover every combat situation has been challenging fun and i never encountered something that felt unlogical or unnecessary."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is one of the best games ive ever played. i made an account on this site just to say this. larian studios have created a masterpiece . so much content, lore, and unexpected surprises are in the game and the fact that your past choices in quests effect future quests is truly magical. im 90 hours in and i had to take a break because i didnt want to finish the game already. if i could only play one game for the rest of my life, it would be this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is a letter from love to videogamers, what a game, this game remembered me why i love videogames so much."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is how game should be made. amazing story, amaazing gameplay and amazing company!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,the game is great. it is also very good to have turkish language support. i hope we can see it in other games. a behaviour that all companies should take as an example. thank you for this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"the 3 years in early access has this done this game the world of good. i have not enclosed one bug so far  to my amazement, compelled story and characters are abound. beautiful and easy to understand gameplay, top tier voice acting aswell. the perfect game for those wanting to start dipping their toes into this genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"fantastic game, only held back by crashes and scripting issues. but t will likely be a 1010 befor ethe end of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"a great game super entertaining and interesting. good story, excellent game mechanics. almost as good as the original games. the bad? i don't know why it's called baldur's gate, it looks more like an improved version of dos. excellent work done by larian. but it leaves me feeling that something is missing to deserve to be a sequel to baldur's gate. still, it's a great game that everyone should give it a try, especially if you're not a fan of the original series. 10 points for larian studies. 50 hours played in ea 70 played since launch day."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"this is the best thing that has happened to the gaming industry over the past 5 years. it turns out that if you do not make battle passes and other rubbish, but are inspired to make an interesting game, then people like it! who would have thought?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"i have been playing dd every friday for around 8 years or so now and i have been looking for a video game equivalent for a long time now, but none have ever felt close to what dd can bring. this is the first time i have ever seen a video game come close to the feeling that dd gives and i highly recommend it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,1010  best crpg ever and sets a standard that game developers should strive for.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"absolutely incredible. i'm just shy of 50 hours into my first playthrough and i am only just now finishing up the last side quest that i can find in act 1 and about to advance into act 2. so, considering it sounds like i'm no where near done with the main story, which has been incredible, as have the side quests, i can't wait to see what is in store for me in the rest of the game. i have already gotten more than my monies worth out of the game, and i can't recommend it enough!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,sencillamente espectacular... dificil creerse la cantidad de opciones y libertad que te da este juego... pasa a la historia...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,".           .   ,        ,     nw2     ,              .   . bg3.  larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is the dream rpg come true. played over 500 hour in the early access alone, and the full release has lived up to the hype and more. if you're going to buy one game this decade, let it be this one. there's never been a game with so much reactivity and player agency. there not a single boring fetch quest or collect x items to save character y, all the quests comes with a natural flow as you progress and all characters feel alive. almost every single npc of the over 2000 in the game have some unique dialogue. you can enter every single house in badlur's gate and talk to every npc there and many have hidden stories that can lead to quests. on the higher difficulty mode the ai isn't simply buffed with stats like every other game. instead the ai gets smarter, and has access to more abilities and uses potions or the environment like exploding barrels to its advantage. on top of all this comes beautifully crafted environments and characters that will make you laugh, upset or even cry, not to mention the absolutely awesome music scores. this game's a must buy even if you are normally not fond of the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"a worthy gave to carry the dd ip, a worthy successor to bg12 and a worthy 3rd game after dos12. for context the best game for me was kotor 1 .....i can say now confidently after so many hours that bg3 surpassed it and my expectations! the story, the va, the environment, the choices, the combat everything is spectacular!!! thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,the best rpg i ever played. i'm so impressed with larien who made this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i made a metacritic account solely for the purpose of rating this game a 1010. baldurs gate 3 is larian studios at their best, and what theyve managed to accomplish with this release is nothing short of astonishing. faern has never looked better, and larians gorgeous depiction of the iconic dd setting is complimented by a wellwritten story told through a cast of memorable characters. the combat is smooth and exciting, the core mechanics are true to the source material with some liberties taken to adapt to the digital medium, and the voice cast does a stellar job of bringing the world to life. get ready for an unforgettable rpg experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,saw that this game is getting 0 point reviews from idiots. so i'm leaving a 10 point one as counter.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"definitivamente era lo que esta industria del videojuego necesitaba algo fresco aunque de un estilo conocido pero mejorado al mximo con verdaderas innovaciones, no un refrito o un juego repetitivo, solo se que es una obra maestra."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i gotta tell you, it was perfect... perfect. everything... down to the last minute details."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i'm now 32 hours into bg3, i spent my whole week on this game love from divinity 2 to this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,giving this a 10 because it's not made by blizzard and githyankis are cool.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,master piece i love this game. i think it maybe the game of year. good well larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"just finished the game today and it's phenomenal. if you like old school turnbased rpgs or like dd you'll like this game. there is a ton of detail and larian allows you to tackle situations in a multitude of ways. the story is fairly good and varies based off of player choice. companions are well flushed out, albeit some can be frustrating at first. only criticism would be that some companions are too willing to have romantic relationships with the player character with little effort. overall this is one of the best games i've played in a long time. larian's philosophy of releasing a full game with no paid dlcmicrotransactions is a breath of fresh air."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"easily the best game of this generation, maybe even the best game of all time. the unlimited possibilities of crpg combined with great voice acting and cutscenes is unbelievable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"such freedom of customizations of characters, indepth stories and just overall enjoyable gameplay"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,",     .   ..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i just finished the game and i gotta say this is honestly one of the best games i've ever played. i wish i could give it a 10 but there are unfortunately a decent amount of bugs in the final act. most of those bugs aren't anything terrible, it's just stuff like npcs saying dialogue that doesn't line up with what you've done, helmets appearing on your companions even though you've turned them off, or your ui in combat disappearing. the only truly annoying bug i had was one that wouldn't let me complete a quest because the npcs bugged out and were just standing in spot. outside of that though i honestly recommend this to anyone interested in rpgs, this truly is one of the greatest games i've played, and reminds me of what made me fall in love with gaming in the first place. i'm sure as time goes on, a lot of the bugs i mentioned will be fixed and i might even come back to give this a 10 because i truly think this was a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"no estoy exagerando cuando digo que es el mejor juego que he jugado. adelantado a su poca y hecho un cario increble, este juego es el futuro de los rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"a landmark in the rpg and industry as a whole. this game sets new high and even if you don't like the turn based combat, do yourself a favour and play it. a complete product void of microtransaction, excellent performance, virtually bugless. str is excellent, char are excellent and so is the music,voice, animation. one of the best if not the best game ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is a wonderful game brimming with life and passion im yet to finish the game after 80 hours spent in it and what can i say it is amazing, im really looking forward to replaying it on different difficulties doing different choices and going different routes after finishing my good guy run. its been years since i felt that addicted to the game that every time im not playing it on my pc im playing it in my head. the freedom, the companions system, the storytelling, hundreds spells to choose from everything is pretty much my cup of tea. also no censorship is great! it makes the game feel more real and mature. the only thing that made my wonderful time in game a little bitter are bugs, the game has a lot of bugs but devs are fixing them, and the game is so big that i feel like even after years someone is gonna find some choice or action that have some bug in it. and you know thats ok. when the game feels good even with bugs it is truly a mark  game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,once every 5 to 10 years you get a great story driven rpg. don't miss it!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i cannot express how impressed i am with this game. it has come out of nowhere for me, rocketing almost instantly from yeah i can play this if i'm bored to a game i'm absolutely glued to. the last game with which this happened was elden ring. baldur's gate is already clearly among the greats when talking about rpgs generally if we restrict the comparison to just other turn based isometric rpgs it's clearly in an entire league of its own. i hope larian expands and suppors this gem  for years to come, and i hope other publishers sit up and take notice this is the kind of game we want. elden ring, tears of the kingdom, now baldur's gate 3 these are setting the stage for how gaming could and should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"a truly remarkable masterpiece, larian has expertly crafted a vibrant and enthralling dnd world, which is undeniably their crowning achievement thus far. throughout the gameplay, i am constantly struck by larian's commitment, as evidenced by countless intricate game details and designs, superb battle enjoyment and strategic depth, rich and immersive dialogue choices, as well as an astonishing degree of freedom that effortlessly causes one to lose track of time in the real world. keep up the fantastic work, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"in a year full of totk, ffxvi, re4, diablo 4, etc. baldurs gate 3 comes out of nowhere and smashes their hopes of winning goty. this is a once in a generation game. i envy the people playing their first time from the start. the journey is just amazing, the characters are so well fleshed out, and the world feels alive. the story is great and every single action has a reaction and its so good. i hope everyone gives this game a shot. if you thought turn based games arent for me give it a shot. this one is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is just a great game where you have several solutions for every moment of the game and as many secretive ones. in bg3, you can be anyone you want. the drow is a barbarian without problems, a dragonborn with the multiclass of a sorcerer, a barbarian and a bard, also without problems. i am a person who was unfamiliar with dnd, i say that this does not interfere with playing and delving into the plot in any way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"crazily fun game, with nearly infinite choices. and larian studio has expected all you thought, they prepare all the scenes for ya."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. gorgeous graphics, great characters, amazing writing that had me laughing, crying, in shock and disbelief, and fun gameplay,. not only that but a studio who is for the first time in a long time proconsumer, who delivers a bugfree, full gameplay, experience, without preplanned dlc and other anticonsumer strategies. this is a return to form, and what's been sorely missing from the video game industry in a long time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"tudo que precisvamos para voltar com rpg decente, atualmente est em grande falta de jogos assim."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"it doesn't feel like a sequel to baldur's gate, but that being said, it is still a great game. combat can be hard, but you need to think through your actions, which i am sure a lot of people don't like. sometimes they aren't too forward with actions and bonus actions. but i do really enjoy the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"played the devs other games and wow this is amazing to play something like divinity in the dnd world, love it so much and beat totk for me as my current game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game is just insane!! great quality game, music, visual everything! this game got me hooked! really emjoy every minutes of it! pay once you get the full game no  battle pass or cosmetics at 15 a skin. this is game of the year for sure  big love to larian studios for making such a great game really worth the money!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"me est encantando el videojuego y eso que este gnero no ha sido nunca mi estilo, solan aburrirme y me costaba mucho entenderlos pues no s que ha ocurrido que con este no puedo parar de jugar llevo ms de 40 horas y no me canso. es cierto que me he perdido con alguna misin alguna vez pero he  muy poco en encontrar alguna gua o sugerencia que me haya mostrado el camino. el juego por lo que he ledo tiene 12 niveles, actualmente voy por el 8. los primeros 4 niveles me costaron muchsimo porque no paraba de morir una y otra vez, luego leyendo, resulta que los dd son as, empiezas con un nivel muy bajo y los enemigos no tanto por lo que una estrategia deficiente o pecar de excesiva temeridad va a desembocar en literalmente la muerte, pero transcurridos estos primeros niveles que ya os digo, cuesta la cosa sigue igual de difcil pero ahora tienes ms margen de maniobra y si eres un poco listo en tu planteamiento de los ataques puedes salir airoso ms veces de las que mueras. en definitiva me encanta. le doy un 9 por no estar doblado al castellano ya que la voz es fundamental en un juego tan exageradamente narrativo como este. entiendo que son muchsimas lneas de dilogo y traducir sera caro pero no imposible, adems que mis 60 euros valen lo mismo que los 60 de cualquier estadounidense el cual va a tener una experiencia muchsimo ms inmersiva. dicho esto si no te importa estar 120 horas mnimo leyendo sin parar el juego merece muchsimo la pena. para mi no es el goty porque no es de 10 pero casi."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"baldur's gate 3 has revitalized my love for fantasy roleplaying games. there are so many unique ways to build your character, fight enemies, and resolve the story's conflicts. the game captured my imagination with its beautiful world and interconnected subplots. the developers at larian studios spent years on improving every aspect of baldur's gate 3 before its full release, and it was worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"um game que eu estava com um espectativa baixa, e me surpreendeu tanto. cada hora jogada  uma surpresa diferente, sem falar na mecnica que no tinha como ser diferente, pra quem ainda tem preconceito com jogos por turno, esse  diferente, tem uma pegada nica e muito dinmica. estou com 50h jogadas e infelizmente no tenho tanto tempo por dia pra jogar. parabns larian."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"juegazo de rol, historia increible, jugabilidad unica, todo esta super bien hecho. esperemos no le roben el goty a esta obra maestra... ese jueguito para nios de zelda y nintendo ratas."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is what happens when an studio makes games with love and passion, congratulations to larian, you deserve everything that is coming to you now"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"worth every bit of the wait. 23 hours in and only halfway through act 1. can already tell it has insane replay value, will be playing this one for years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best rpg game with coop what you can buy! larian, you are amazing! the only thing that was bad in divinity original sin 2 was boredom after act 2, in the new game the narration is better than any praise!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"larian has shown us how a triple a game shoud be done! what a game my friends!! it is, in my humble opinion, the best game of the year!!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolute masterpiece, one of the best games i have played, 30 hours in and cant stop, i even dream about the game, and i don't like the genre, that just says it all 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,a true crpg masterpiece. for everyone that loves a good story and deep characters buy it! the only bad thing in the game is that every companion is horny af d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"its hard to fulfill expectations for new instalment in truly legendary series. but larian did not only succeed, but exceed... 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is how games should be, no pre launch dlc no microtransactions, high mod support and feedback is actuallly listened to. biggest flex for any crpg ever released, i highly reccomend you check this out even if turn based rpg's are normally not your thing, the writing the story the characters and all the options make it more then worth to check it out!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolute masterpiece. the fact that a crpg is as successful as it is in 2023 should speak volumes. you can just tell how much love and passion larian poured into this game by the amount of well thought out variance for every possible situation you can run across. the amount of voice lines that are in the game is staggering, fantastic quality va. great music. immersive and one of the best adaptations of dnd 5e into a video game solasta's a great adaptation of the system aswell. i think the strength of this game really lies in the replayability because of the sheer amount of choice you have. dialogue choices, class, race, combat all of them have important and impactful decisions that will likely make you want to play this game again down the road. solo or with friends, this game is just a fantastic experience all the way through. larian really raised the bar with this release and takes the genre to an entirely new level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,the best dd game! amazing gameplay great story line and i love the option of multiplayer
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"amazing game. this much love put in a game by a developer is so rare nowadays, we must encourage it so it's the new norm"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"it was a long time coming but the final product is finally here. i played it first when it was freshly released into the beta. while it was good and had outstanding potential it was not yet ready to come out of the oven. i have returned now that it has finally released and wow. this game is outstandingly good. the story is rich and combat is addicting if you enjoy tbs games. and by rich story i mean to say that you can play through multiple times using different classes and taking different approaches, all resulting in a totally different story being told. perhaps you saved an npc who comes into play later and helps you. perhaps you left them to die and you run into their allies who blame you for the death. everything is so intertwined with the world that it provides an exceptional sense of immersion. that small act could snowball into something else which will impact future events. and the level ups, oh boy the level up. i was super turned off by the low level cap as it sounded terrible. until i started leveling that is. you really feel each level up. no need go level 5 times only to get a small and ultimately minuscule boost and maybe one new skill in hopes of beating that boss. each level up will grant a variety of boons and bonuses depending on your build. talk to animals as a druid, bash in the skull of everything as a berserker, speak with the dead as a cleric, play the lute and perform overdramatized dialogue options as a bard, the possibilities are limited only by your own imagination. you can pick up a goblin and beat another goblin to death with them. i mean do i really need to explain more? 1010 would recommend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best game 2023! real rpg! you can do what you want and where you want. great opportunities to interact with the environment and characters. and you buy full game for price, not half piece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,absolutely amazing game. best this year for sure! the effect of your decisions just seems to naturally effect the world and the events that you come across later on. brilliant stuff!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game has made me gasp, laugh and for the first time made me genuinely interested in npc's that i play with. i personally was skeptical of the turned based combat mechanic but i got over that really fast. i think the combat is great but i had no idea what i was doing at first. now i am having so much fun with the game. thanks to the team who made this. its great!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"never in my life i played a game so immersive as as bg3. i am inside this story, it feels amazing, i feel invested, involved. the combat is just glorious, the dialogues, the characters. always something different to do. how often a game makes you feel so much? this is not a game, it is an experience. bravo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,its more than just the bears. this game is as close to table top dnd anyone will ever get and is going to bring a whole generation into dnd. the amount of choice based consequences makes it feel like a different game everytime. i have 3 games going at once an they are no where near the same.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i'd be slightly surprised if this game doesn't win game of the year. it's a very immersive deep rpg with dnd mechanics that i find incredibly fun. personally, i'm not too crazy about dnd or turn based games, however this one is an exception. i have submerge more hours than i'd like to admit in this game and haven't even scratched the surface. this may even come off as overburdening but the different and unique experiences will keep feeling fresh over and over again. its overall a 1010 for me, graphics are incredible, story is extremely deep and will vary with each playthrough, combat is like a creative sandbox for you, deep character customization both how they look and the how they play, there are plenty of classesmulticlassessubclassesspellsitems to keep you entertained and allow you to create your own unique experience for a long time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"how videogaming used to be, but is sadly a thing of the past. kudos to the developer for making a proper game that everyone wanted, and without the corporate greed aspect of it. i hope this developer succeeds in every aspect and keeps doing what they do best! congratulations on this release and i hope all the best for their future in videogamemaking! you're amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"jogo muito imersivo, tima histria com diversas possibilidades, personagens cativantes e com belos cenrios. estou testando uma segunda classe, embora os personagens e cenrios sejam os mesmos, o desenrolar da histria  muito diferente da primeira vez que joguei. isso demonstra o quanto o jogo  bem construdo. alm da diferena de dilogos, tem tambm mudanas na gameplay, onde as caractersticas do personagem permitem resolver quests e alcanar determinadas reas do mapa de outras formas. arrisco a dizer que este jogo  to pico quanto a the witcher 3, meu nico receio  que o estilo dele pode no agradar a todos. sempre tive dificuldades em jogar games com combate por turno, pois torna o desenrolar do jogo muito lento, por outro lado requer mais estratgia para vencer.  questo de gosto pessoal, mas isso pode afastar alguns jogadores. eu, particularmente, preferi jogar no nvel mais baixo e focar mais na histriaexplorao. de qualquer forma, vale a diverso de cada um e baldur's gate 3 sem dvidas  um jogao."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"its a great game, not perfect of course bet still deserves a 1010, specially to balance people giving 0 because its different of a 23 year old game or for it being too hard even if its easier than dos 2."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"closest pnp experience ive ever experienced in a videogame. i liked divnity os1 and os2, but i love baldurs gate 3. my dnd group is on a long term standby for a long time now and this game gives me the feeling back i missed so much. its not for everyone, but if you like crpg or pen and paper  tabletop rpg, this game is literally a masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"an epic masterpiece and master class on how to design and build a game for the fans. we've have all been waiting for something like this since dragon age origins, and my god it sure does not disappoint. i pray to god that the usual mega corps don't try to buy out larian studios. we need this game company."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"incredible accomplishment. both visually and storywise. there's music for every action, every story beat. each character, from the most random npc or animal, to one of the main cast of characters, each have lovingly written lines and expertly performed voice performances. perhaps the greatest game ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,a phenomenal crpg and an enthralling forgotten realms adventure. i always want my crpgs to feel like sitting down for a well run table top adventure with friends and bg3 does exactly that.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,one of the best games i've ever played. deserves an 11 instead of a 10..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"game is simply phenomenal. i remember playing the first 2 games, then ice wind dale. this game is just such a joy to those who are fans of the series. from the start i was wished back to taking my first few steps in the first game. the new implementations of new features works pretty well. i suggest trying it out even if you are not a fan of the original i would give it a shot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"storytelling, cinematics, graphics, coop, local coop, combat, true permutations, companions, options, blah blah blah blah blah.. the list goes on and on. this game has it all. this game reminds me of the golden days of gaming. knights of the old republic, mass effect, dragon age. this game acts a true successor to what a masterpiece is for its time. its passion. its love. no dlc. no micro transactions. no bulls. please, if theres ever a video game youre going to play, let it be this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is the best game ever written and created. growing up with dd as well as all the baldur's gate games, this was the successor i was waiting for. being a forever dm for tabletop games i never had a chance to experience a well structured world. this gave me the opportunity to play all my characters i have created in my head over the years and do pretty much anything i want to do in a world."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,.         .     .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is the absolute pinnacle of gaming. from somebody who has never had a metacritic account until now, never played any or know any of the rules of dnd. this game is a masterpiece, i was born in 2001 and was a kid when these groundbreaking video games were coming out and just thought it was normal for groundbreaking games like this to be the norm. however, as i have gotten older my love for video games hasn't changed but the passion i have for it has. that feeling of excitement of getting home to play a game like i'm a kid again has returned, i'm thankful to larian studio to put all their love and effort into this game and making me remember what true passion for a game feels like."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i kicked a squirrel today with my halfelf ranger and it felt really gorgeous and as it should be in a baldur's gate  nuff said.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"as an avid dungeons  dragons fan, it pains me to say that baldur's gate 3 falls short of capturing the essence of the beloved tabletop game. the game's narrative lacks the depth and intricacy that we've come to expect from the baldur's gate series."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolutely one of the best games i've played. you'll probably find the occasional bug here and there. but the overall stories you explore, the characters, the combat, everything is just very polished and welldesigned. this game sets a new bar for rpgs. play it with friends. you won't regret buying this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"life is good, god is good, im happy, and thats all, thank you larian studios"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"most likely game of the year. no microtransactions, no dlc, listening to the consumers. a very big project for a company that was truely invested into making this. wish them all the best."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i never liked turn based rpgs. they feel slow and boring. give me speed, give me loot! i tried the old divine divinities in the past, i tried divinity ii.. it just didnt click. but then i decided to try bg3. damn. this got me right away. it is turn based. but it feels so smooth  i actually enjoy it. wish i had friends that had more time to play, but even solo i do have a great time rerolling different builds and figuring stuff out!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this isn't your typical no monetization, good game meme. if that's what you're expecting, click away. with that said, let's dive in. in baldur's gate 3, players engage from an overhead camera angle, embracing exploration and puzzlesolving while relishing the impact of dialogue choices on the game's narrative. however, the mechanics of the battle system appear generic and lack the depth expected in other turnbased rpg games that i played. i genuinely felt a lack of engagement in the combat system. while the game boasts somewhat decent visuals, the performance and optimization don't seem to be as they could be, resulting in lowerthanexpected framerates relative to its visual fidelity. one distinct mechanic in bg3 involves the system rolling dice to determine outcomes in various scenarios. this incorporation of rng might discourage some players, especially when faced with unfortunate strokes of bad luck. in essence, bg3 offers a rich blend of exploration and interactive storytelling, but with generic battle mechanics, belowaverage optimization, and a reliance on rng elements. it might be fantastic for some, but certainly won't appeal to everyone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"being realistic, yes the game has some awkward animations during dialogs, but it's such a minimal thing that it doesn't matter, the music, story, environment, characters, combat, it's just too good. also of course being a complete game without micro transactions is an instant 1010 in my book. f u blzrd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i have visited metacritic for nearly 2 decades, and never made an account or posted a review. this is the first time i have contributed a review score, due to baldur's gate 3. i was part of early access when it first launched and watched how it grew and improved over time. larian studios has built what can only be called a masterpiece in this crpg genre. if you are familiar with dd 5e mechanics, this game will feel like home to you. even if you haven't, you will learn it relatively quickly as it does all the math for you. you buy the game, start it up, make a character you think is cool.. pick some spells that sound fun and engage with a rich environment and hundreds of characters through visualaudio story driven dialogs and cutscenes. everything is dynamic and responds to your decisions and how you talk to people. the combat with enemies is turn based, and while this might put some people off.. it's extremely refreshing to have the ability to take your time and think out your strategy and be tactical. do you see a barrel that explodes? pick it up if you have the strength! and hurl it across the map. create explosions, push people off cliffs, and wind up powerful godlike spells to slay your adversaries. the whole game is an incredible story. it's masterfully created, and after doing 5 playthroughs, each one was different, and not by a few dialog options. each one was different in entire story altering ways. to be honest, i don't know how larian pulled it off.. because it just seems magical. and that's what you end up feeling while you play.. the game feels magical, in a very magical faerun. this is a very special game in this day and age. a fully released game, as polished as larian could muster, with no shareholders or publishers driving profits as their only agenda. larian is comprised of passionate artists and developers who wanted to tell a story, by handing over a keys to you, to tell it. there are no microtransactions, or paid anything. it's another reason, this game is special. it will no doubt, go down in history as not only, one of the best selling and played video games of all time, but be one of those games that is forever remembered. the journey you took, and how much fun you had while venturing in faerun. and if you haven't already, you will one day look back and wonder why can't more games be like this. well done larian, you guys are a diamond in the rough. thank you for sharing this wonderful game with all of us."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"so i have never played dnd . i never really played bg 1  2 . just a little bit a few months ago. it wasn't really for me, i found them quite janky. baldurs gate 3 on the other hand is by far the best rpg i have ever played. it is well put together , the interface is fairly intuitive and the voice actors are really very good. it has such an immersive world and the characters are interesting and fun to have around in your party. the interactions between them can be fantastic and occasionally go in quite unexpected ways. i am very much enjoying all of the core characters stories and find myself actually caring about most of them . even the initially very unlikable gith lady. she is actually my favorite 1010 because i cant give it 20"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"geralmente no fao review e avaliaes de jogos, mas com esse no deu pra segurar. que jogo absurdo de bom, estou simplesmente viciado!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolutely outstanding. it's all the classics rolled into one and given a modern shine  no hint of developer bs with microtransactions, just a beautifully realised game in every single way. art design, graphical fidelity, story beats, voice acting, game mechanics  everything is near enough flawless for the type of game it is. i score it a 9 solely because of one minor   i think it could have been easier on the beginner early on with a better tutorial system and i think the beginning overall is a bit weaker than the rest of the game, but i'd be scoring it like a 9.5 if decimals were allowed. well worth the asking price, in every way imaginable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i made an account to review this beautiful game. i don't mean beautiful graphically, although the graphics are nice too. i mean the sheer scale, and attention to detail is wonderful. not only that, but studios can't seem to make a game 110th this size without having 10x the bugs. this game has some flaws, but it is hard for me to care at all because altogether this is the closest we have ever come to a gaming masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"ce jeu est magnifique. je ne suis pas fan de ce genre de jeu d'habitude, mais celuici est tellement bien que j'aie tout de suite ador y jouer. il est unique en son genre. je le recommande vivement. peuttre le goty 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"increble juego, desde el primer momento se nota la calidad que tiene. hay mucho que hacer en el y de maneras muy diversas."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i'll start off by saying i bought early access and was very hyped for this game myself. i played at least 124 hours in ea before jumping into the complete game finished it after 112 hours. act 1 was clearly polished to nearperfection the amount of freedom of choice and things to do is mindboggling here. i loved this game and would recommend it as a mustplay, but i am afraid i cannot give it a 10 out of 10. the positive the character development of most companions felt really gratifying all throughout you won't be able to recognize some of them by the end. the amount of spells, weapons, potions, gear, and just stuff there's around to do is huge you will be rewarded for exploring. in terms of enemy variety, sure, you've got your typical humanoids with their respective classes, but you are bound to be surprised. there is no shortage of unique enemies. the world design feels great and immersive, going from the fairy tale setting of act 1, to the ghastly and otherworldly look of act 2, and finally the city in act 3. the negative you see, the problem starts right when you leave act 1. again, the content available in act 2 and act 3 is great, and that goes for the main story as well. but after experiencing what felt like total freedom in act 1, i couldn't help but feel a bit more contrived in act 2 and even more so in act 3, with choices being narrowed down greatly. i understand the time constraint of the devs and i am hopeful they will dedicate more time to continue polishing these aspects of the game in the future. this one depends i personally enjoyed it, but i can see it being a problem for others that are new to the genre. the turnbased combat can sometimes be a blessing or a nightmare. it might make you approach some encounters differently to avoid getting stuck waiting for a bunch of enemies to finish their turn even when making difficulty easier, you can still get stuck with this for a while. in summary, this game has been an enthralling journey marked by vibrant character development, a treasure trove of spells and gear, and a diverse array of adversaries. act 1 stands as a shining example of nearperfect game design, offering what feels like boundless freedom and engrossing choices. while acts 2 and 3 maintain the quality of storytelling and content, they introduce a more controlled narrative progression, a departure from the unrestricted exploration of act 1. the turnbased combat, though enjoyable for some, might pose challenges for newcomers or feel too timeconsuming. this game is worth buying for the rich experience offered in act 1 alone. however, i advise players to approach the later acts with tempered expectations regarding the same level of freedom. if the developers continue refining their creation, there's hope that the enchantment found in act 1 can be seamlessly woven into the later acts for an even more satisfying adventure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"in 2023, we're delighted to have this exceptional aaa rpg that stands apart by not relying on microtransactions. it's truly a game that demonstrates respect for players and their hardearned money."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i havent given a game a 10 since half life 2 launched or the witcher 3. bg3 is a little slower paced than your usual fast paced action games but the story telling, the complexity of the world, the detailsi could go on and on. its refreshing to see such a good game released thats actually polished and functional. exceptional! ive put 20 hours in already and cant wait for the rest of the content ahead. master stroke by larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the best bits of dragon age with the 5e rule set. it's dungeons and dragons the video game, and i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"made an account just to sing this game's praises. i'm usually a 'waitandsee' type of gamer that hold off for at least a couple weeks postrelease to decide whether i want to drop 60 on a new game especially something as hyped as bg3. well, i just couldn't resist this time around. i've never played a crpg but am relatively experienced with dnd 5e. after seeing clip after clip of the ridiculous and unpredictable sandbox that is bg3, i knew i had to give the game a shot. and boy am i glad i did. i'm only 20 hours into my playthrough and can genuinely say bg3 has revived my love for video games. as someone who often struggles with open world games, something in bg3 just clicks. can't recommend highly enough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"no microtransactions, no drm, no always online and it's only 60 at launch. this is such a perfect release in every aspect and deserves a perfect score."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"el mejor juego que he jugado en aos sin dudarlo, me tiene atrapado, posiblemente goty, rol puro y duro."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,first game i have thoroughly enjoyed in decades. it brings on the type of nostalgia and difficulty that makes games great. it's like they brought back a lost art.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"easily my favourite game! best game i've played in years! i simply can not put this title down at all, when i'm not playing i am thinking of baldurs gate 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"o que a larian faz com seus jogos deveria se tornar padro da indstria! muitas empresas matam um estilo de jogo para migrar para um mais popular afim de lucrar! enquanto ainda temos a larian exaltando e trazendo o melhor contedo baseado em rpg de mesa, ainda h esperana!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"un verdadero videojuego, me recuerda en espritu a los juegos de 19902000 y ya hacia falta un juego asi, estaba harto de microtransacciones, mobas y demas juegos que solo se basan en sacarte el dinero"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,truly a once in a generation game. probably the best computer role playing game ever made. full voice acting and a system where your choices really do matter means you can replay this one with new classes and see totally new stuff. very few games in history would deserver 10 out of 10 but baldur's gate 3 is one of them. it really does live up to the hype.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"top 3 rpgs as of right now, the game is so detailed and the story is so interesting and the characters are perfect very good cutscenes and amazing voice acting, complex combat man just get this game already"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"at its core bg 3 is the closest anyone has come to putting a dnd experience on the computer while it should be noted if you have a problem with 5e you wont like this as that is what the game is set in, if you have no clue what that means dont worry about it. this is above and beyond the quality of rpg that fans of the genre have been craving since dragon age origins, no other well known game short of larian's own original sin 2 came close to that level of rpg, but baldur's gate 3 while maybe not the continuation of the story told by obsidian in 1 and 2 has in my eyes more then earned it's place next to those classics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i played this game a lot in early access and i absolutely adored it, but the full game has surpassed my expectations. it is a masterpiece, and how gaming should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,game is awsome. i guess it will be my favourite game forever. huge thanks for ukrainian localization. its truly amazing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"never played previous baldur's gate games, but damn... this game is so addictive that i never even notice how much i already have hours. truly masterpiece, would want to have more games like this. larian games good luck and wish for another game like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i've never played a game like this before because i felt i wouldn't enjoy the combat style. the game did a great job of helping me get comfortable with the combat system. i love how many different ways you can play and how each class and race can really change the way things go for you. i haven't finished the game completely because i'm taking my time, but i'm enjoying my party members and the story so far. overall, i couldn't be happier that i took the plunge and tried a game that i thought i wouldn't be able to get into."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best game in a decade. thanks larian. enjoy this goty, take your time playing this perfect game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best rpg i have ever played, definitely a must buy if youre into this genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is just perfect. the goty by far, but it's by far more than a simple goty. it's perfection. i dont think you can play it, and be like meh, it's ok, it will for sure surprise you and you will want to play it for 12 hours straight. astonishing, beautiful"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,perfection. an absolute gem overall. a very polished game. amazing depth of character for all npcs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,if this masterpiece is not getting goty 2023 we live in a cursed timeline !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"gioco stupendo molto bello graficamente e artisticamente,il conparto rpg  meraviglioso, esplorare il mondo di gioco  molto gratificante ogni npc che trovi in game puo dirti cose interessanti o sorprenderti con opzioni di dialogo e rende il mondo di gioco uno dei piu credibili. si percepisce tutto l'amore che gli sviluppatori ci hanno messo nello sviluppo. super consigliato"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"such a refreshing game. in a world of fomo, microtransactions, and exploitation, bg3 feels like what gaming should be an adventurous journey where you experience and shape the story the way you want it to be told."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"boy, oh boy what a game! i played the divinity series and that was mind blowing.. but this just takes it up a  actually a full feet! started first playthrough while doing a lan party and it was so much fun... now doing a separate one with my friend and we are just cruising enjoying different paths that the game has to offer. sure there are some bugs that can be annoying at some times, but the fact that this studio made a game purely for gamers not for their own greedmicrotransactions, battle passes deserves a 10. i already can't wait for my third or fourth playthrough. well done larian! may you never stop making great games!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"ao meu ver, j  goty. creio que nenhum outro lanamento desse ano ir proporcionar uma experincia to incrvel quanto essa. larian t de parabns."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,best game i've played in a very long time. possibly the best game i've ever played.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,finally an rpg that is worthy of the title. goty for me. after the disappointment of diablo iv it is good to get an amazing single player experience from an amazing game. no monetization or live service aspects which is how i want games to be.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best rpg i've ever played in some time, baldurs gate is consuming my soul, send help"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"great game. the studio behind this masterpiece had time, budget, and talent to make this colossal piece work. but they made it work, really well in fact. everything is reactive to what i do, who my character is, and most importantly they made custom origins much more appealing option. im not bogged down by the fact if i dont play them i loose the cool story like dos2, and im not just a blank slate. i have plenty of background, race, and class options that make the world feel alive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,best game i have ever played. as a life long gamer this is the first time i have gotten the true awe and excitement that i got from amazing games as a child. truly a master piece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this will go down as an all time great of the century no micro transactions , no paywalls , no advertising, no game passes , no level cap or levels behind paywalls , straight 100 game fully complete .. the gameplay mechanics, the story , 17000 branching endings , over 300 hours of voice acting and story , and cinematic videos . absolutely insane . you have game devs and people who love micro transactions review bombing the game so they dont feel stupid for paying for game passes and micro transactions . you know who you people are you clowns"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"pretty cool game with plenty of options and pleasant gameplay. i haven't played divinity and cannot compare to previous developer's projects but baldur's gate 3 is a quality one that was done by really talented people.  graphic it is great, everything looks awesome and i cannot tell anything bad about it. the locations are detailed and the game is plenty of cool views. during the whole game completed 2 acts so far developers managed to convey the right picture of locations and it makes you fill right atmosphere at the right place.  gameplay it offers you pretty decent turnbased strategy gameplay, it is not that easy and makes you think and manage your characters properly. you have no tank or healer? well, you will suffer. but the game aways give you an option to change your party, hire some random mercenaries or simply change your own class or your companions class. there are multiple ways to fight your enemies, burn, freeze them or just push off the cliff or they will do the same to you.  storyline haven't finished the game completely but 2 acts give you the full picture of what is going on and what will be your final goal although it is possible to finish the game in act 2, but no spoilers here. common thing, you fight the evil forces that want to destroy the whole world. each companions also has their own story that you will reveal during the game and will help to choose their destiny... or just ignore and let them deal with their problems on their own, it is up to you. still, everyone has their secrets and you are up to discover them, maybe by noticing them doing something weird, like biting you at night?  optimization it is worth to talk about optimization and bugs. larian studios polished completely act 1 and you will not face any difficulties playing this part of the game. but starting from act 2 you will face bugs, glitches and stutters that are not that pleasant when you want to have a smooth gameplay. talked to one of the npcs and your interface is gone, opened a chest and you cannot open anymore and so on. they happen not always but you will experience it from time to time. big cities  oh, it is better to kill everyone there to boost your fps.. like i am serious... it helps to get more fps. in general i liked the game and will put 8 our of 10 2 points for optimization but developers work on it and i hope it will improve in the future. i have completed 2 acts in about 40 hours so far and i would like to complete the game at least twice. there are so many options to do in the game and i would like to see other solutions and what it will bring to me. also i want to check dark urge character and how it will be different from the original storyline. so, it is a game definitely worth buying and playing no matter which platform you use."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"gioco fantastico ma che ha alcuni difetti. innanzitutto la presenza di alcuni bug in gioco durante le battaglie non cambia turno tra un  e l'altro e si rimane bloccati, costringendo a ricaricare, inoltre ho riscontrato parecchi crash del gioco che ne minano l'esperienza"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i just finished the game after 3040 hours spent with it. i was really enjoying it and i was ready to give bg3 the highest score possible but the ending really soured it for me. i really don't like how there always seems to be a way out of every situation imaginable but in the end you have to just sit and watch your companion die. also why can't you keep playing after the final boss is dead? straight to credits then all you can do is load a save. i was looking forward to completing all the side quests and finding all the secrets but now i won't. 510
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"fazia tempo que um jogo no me prendia por tanto tempo igual baldur's gate 3, eu vou jogar e se passam 5 horas sem eu nem me dar conta. este jogo  uma obra prima e ele foi a minha primeira experincia com rpg, at ento eu tinha preconceito com o estilo de jogo, espero vlo como goty porque merece muito!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"good game, fun dd experience, heavily influenced by dos2. 910 instead of 1010 for pretty much two reasons 1. the customization leaves much to be desired. options are preset and very limited. 2. in my experience, the visuals when loading especially in really hectic cutscenes are buggy, i imagine turning down the graphics would make this easier but i have seen this issue enough that i think the game is just not fully optimized yet. overall the game allows for some creative solutions to problems and is a very fun experience. it's good, worth a shot for dd fans that like turn based rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"truly a masterpiece from larian studios! huge world, true to dd tabletop game, fabulous narrative and a fun combat system. best game ever"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"picked this up back in october of '20, and have never looked back since. three years of picking over act 1 in early access and we never once got bored or disinterested, every new patch was a reason to try another run through. the full release of the game is absolutely otherworldly  playing another game at the moment feels like a waste! never has a game managed to enthral and entertain me as much as this one has. the potential for replayability is crazy, player agency is almost limitless, and the diverse cast of characters extremely lovable and hateable in their own rights. all the hype, praise, and attention bg3 is receiving is thoroughly and rightfully deserved. i had a feeling this was going to become my favourite game of all time three years ago, i'm so glad larian has proven me right."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"larian really outdid themselves with baldur's gate 3, the amount of freedom you have is incredible. this game truly lets you think outside of the box and do so many rediculous things, it's so much fun. we need more studios to create masterpieces like this, the writing, gameplay, music, it's all so so good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,when a game makes you stand up from your chair and walk off what just happened. absolute masterpiece. can't wait what larian does next.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"amazing game all around, highly recommend. a perfect opening for new dnd players"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"larian does it again. another game, another masterpiece. the world is amazing, the characters and their stories are amazing, beautiful animations, goated narrative. and finally an aaa that is worth the cost and you dont pay for a broken game you can clearly see why aaa devs were throwing trash at this game, they were scared of his success and his optimization. best rpg in the history of gaming. and clearly game of the year"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,already a timeless masterpiece. i am flabbergasted by how on earth the people at larian managed to create a game this immersive.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"been playing pc games since the baldur's gate 1 era. i've poured thousands of hours into bg1, bg2, icewind dale series, nwn and dao. since those days i've gradually come to accept that i would never experience something of that scope and passion again, that is, until bg3. this game just succeeds on every level and my old ass is hooked like it's never been before, save for when i discovered bg2. this is the most faithful successor anyone could have hoped for. the graphics are great, the world building is jawdropping, your companions are just so, so well written and full of life and the voice overs take them to a level unrivalled by whatever else is out there. just reached act 3 with this strange feeling that the game should've been over by now, since the ending of act ii was so epic. i had to remind myself repeatedly that this was only the halfway point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,in a nutshell phenomenal game that brings me back to the good old times of gaming
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,best game. the best rpg. the best tactic. from the best devteam. from the best game designer. with the best sound and music design.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"mejor juego del ao, goty 2023, por lejos mejor que el zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzelda"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"good game. all the right changes since early access. please make an arpg, the blizzard that was once loved by gamers is long gone. we need someone to come and take their place. diablo 4  and larian could surely do far better based on it's track record."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,the rating is first and foremost for the negative reviews. they are too entertaining. the 20 hrs i spent in act 1 were amazing though so i expect it keep it up. i'm in a addiction and games that get me into addiction i rate a 10. easy as that.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the game of games. this should be the gold standard for a game. this might be one of if not the best game ever made. the last time i had this much fun and was this invested in the world, story, characters. i hope more games like this is to come! well done larian studios this is not a video game, this is the video game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best game of 2023 for pc. perhaps best game of tenth anniversary for pc. thank you larian from all fans of dnd, baldur's gate series and crpg fans! bravo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"no tenho muito o que falar, quadriplicaram o contedo que divinity tinha e ainda aumentaram muito a liberdade de escolhas de dilogos, rotas de histria e explorao no jogo, a gerao estava saturada de lanamentos ruins, mas agora eu tenho certeza, que esse jogo vai ser referncia daqui pra frente e muitos jogos vo imitar. jogo da dcada com certeza."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the game provides some feature, we thought are lost to this day. a complete experience without paying extra for storyrelated stuff, interesting characters with a deep story and a highfantasy world, that every rpggamer wanted. if you want a game to enjoy even for months and replaying it and get every time new stories, this is it. larian deserves this huge support! go buy it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"best game i've played this year so far, and i doubt anything will beat it. it truly makes you feel like you are in an adventure and where your decisions really matters. there's always multiple ways to solve different situations. be creative and try crazy things. an approach which might seem like will end in a game over screen might end in a different road to continue with the story. if you like fantasy books, films, board games... you'll like this. take into account this is a turn based game, in case you don't like turn based games it might not be for you. the difficulty in normal mode seems very well calculated, there is no autoscaling for enemies and it can cause a situation where you have to avoid a combat and come back later with a level or two higher. or.... solve the situation without fighting, which some times is a viable option. solid graphics, amazing narrative and interesting characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i cannot stop playing, such an amazing experience. definitely one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i made an account just to review this near perfect game. best game i have played in years. the sheer scope, the rp, the characters, the story, the depth. it is actually so good. i've never played any bg games, nor the divinity games and i don't like turn based games, but i'm having a blast playing this game and i cant seem to stop playing. the only reason i took out a point is because of the camera controls sometimes being really annoying and a couple of bugs. other than that, the game is absolutely incredible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i'm constantly amazed by what this game offers. the amount of work and attention that went in developing the game is astonishing!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the hype of this game its crazy and for what ? a turn based 5e game with garbage writing, companions who are so annoying you want to just throw them off a cliff, but then you remember you're going to lose so much content, so many characters are into the protagonist, i get it, s34x sell, romances who were written by twitter users. you can play naked, look at him go naked yeah, funny jokes, i heard them in high school what a man can say, an insult to the old games, doesn't deserve the name baldur's gate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"from dialogues to graphics presentation is really strong in ths game, makes you want to play it non stop for hours characters are so likable that makes me wish that the party size to be more than 4."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"a spellbinding and enchanting entry in to the widely acclaimed baldur's gate series. 23 years after bg2, larian has managed to make a game that built on the original rpg elements, while bringing forth high quality graphics, character depth, an imaginative narrative, and player choice to the forefront. an instant classic that has raised the bar for all past and future crpg games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"first of all, i must say that it's an amazing game. everything it does, it does well. deep gameplay mechanics, memorable characters, great graphics. but, what's the big but? perhaps too much hype. i've read many times that it's the best game of the year, maybe even in history. is it so? definitely not. is it among the best? absolutely, yes. i don't find that the game brings anything new there's nothing in it that i haven't seen before, for instance, in dragon age origins. what larian has done well is precisely thatdoing everything well, but in my opinion, they've taken very few risks."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,its the best rollplay game that i ever played 1010. i can highly recommend it to everyone who loves playing a different character.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,beter than any game i have played in years beter than any game i have played in years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"baldur's gate 3 is a complete masterpiece, larian has done it again with a fantastic game where your choices actually matter, its not just good choice or bad choice. awesome character and world design. combat is amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"first of all, it's a game that i launch up everyday after work. not because i feel like i have to or that there's nothing else to play but because i want to and to me that means a lot. it's not perfect, i was pretty overwhelmed by how much reading there was when creating my character and selecting skills so i sped through it and as a result struggled a lot in the early early game fighting twice as many monsters as i have companions and them dealing twice as much dmg was pretty frustrating ngl. my characters are now level 4 and i feel a lot stronger and my understanding of spells has improved. maybe more guidance at the start would be helpful or a slower introduction to mechanics. as for the story telling and story mechanics it feels great. one of the first story games that i've actually listened to the story in. i'm not sure yet how much weight my decisions carry, but it seems like a lot which is impressive. i'm using different companions to do the things that they're good at. rather than having a single overpowered character that does everything and 3 stat sticks following it around. everything has meaning and it doesn't feel forced. great job larian studios o7"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game deserves 10 points, it's a statement for what is possible. you find bugs, but you don't care if the game prove's to be excellent. you will enjoy the epic story and music, don't miss your chance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i've been waiting for a truly good crpg since divinity original sin 2. giving the baldur's gate 3 license to the same studio was the best option. bg3 is amazing and the freedom and versatility has no ends. there are so many details and fun mechanics that you just need to do reruns to try it all out. this will be my top game for quite a few months and may not see an equal for quite a few years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,this is actually probably the greatest game ive ever played. theres so much do do and it feels so complete. this is what i think ive always wanted out  my entire life. would highly recommend everyone give it a shot.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"awesome game! thanks for fantastic journey, larian. we need just such games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the best rpg of the decade. very creative game design, missions, upgrades, and so on. you companions and all npcs are interesting, there's a surprise in every corner of the world. addictive and challenge! a solid 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"for people who is in love with this type of games there is no excuse to not buy it, especially from guys like larian. if you are never played something like this before, feel free to start from this one or from its little brotherdivinity original sin 2. even though game is not quite polished yet, its still worth of trying out. words cannot describe how good this game truly is. imagine elden ring but with 10 times more replayability and variety of gaming experience. anybody who's saying that its boring probably just boring by them selves because the game is giving you too many options how to go through it, and some of them you wouldn't even consider of. it doesn't requires you to know the rules of dd or anything like it. worth of trying out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"a week into playing the game and it has tied fallout new vegas as one of my favorite games of all time, this is the type of quality of game i expect from every big budget aaa, and aa studios to make and will hold them to. it is sad that almost all aaa games nowadays dont even come close to reaching how good a game this one that larian made here is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,best game in my life by far just cant understand how ppl put 0 i mean yes i understand nintendo fans are a bit weirds and so need do review bombin cuz if their fab game isnt the best they just cry but really this game is the best byyyyyy farrrrr

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,this is the best game this year so far. good old rpg brought back to life in a new and better form. gameplay is easy and smooth not mentioning that it will grab you and  you up for many hours before you notice the passing of time. npc characters are well designed and have personality. this should be new standard for at least rpg games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i'm still in act 1 after playing round about 30 hours and that game gave me more joy than everything i've played so far.. not a single second i felt like i'd wanna take a break or something. if my biological hollow would not keep me from doing so, i would play that game to the end in one session.. and then start over."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"flawless crpg  enormous interactive map, really focus on rp aspect, great characters which all of them are voice acted and have strong personalities, truthfull dd mechanics and the combat stimulates creativity. it feels like a dream to have a game like this youre rewarded for exploring, since everywhered every corner you go to you're likely to find something new. every npc has a story to tell, as well as the scenario."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"last time i played any crpg was when planescapetorment and icewind daleneverwinter nights were the best rpgs you could play on the pc. fast forward to the 2023 and the baldur's gate 3 returned me to those days. every aspect of the game is thought through, possibilities are endless, enviroment can work for or against you, characters are beautifully voiced over and the story is nothing short of perfection. anything you point at is top notch, no microtransactions, no monetization after your purchase, no bending to the current game industry standards. as small as larian studio is, they provided new standard. and every game from aaa studios will be compared to baldur's gate until something even greater is created."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the new pinnacle of western roleplaying. every aspect of the roleplaying game, every approach, every conversation sets new heights in its genre. apart from a revisable camera handling and a map approach that can certainly be improved, this game is a musthave experience for all lovers of the genre and beyond."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,after nearly 40 hours in and not even putting a dent in the game this is a true testament to what a single player game should be. it's hard to say anything without spoiling this marvel in modern gaming. the only negative thing i could possibly say is that it's a shame that this is the exception and not the norm in the gaming industry and there are even attacking the game and studio because of the quality and scope of what they have delivered.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,great game. the game has so many option its insane. this gonna be a victory landslide for goty.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"for me, best game since fixed, goty version witcher 3. would recommend for any fantasy genre fan."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,from the graphics to the story to the characters depth this game is awesome in every way! thank you larian for this masterpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"it blown me away. i am not a huge fan of turnbased based but this is different. all these details, twists, choiches you can make, the open early access for years. they were listeing to their community and and and. no microtransactions and over 200h of content. a complete game. it is insane i love it. this is my new standard"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,this game is so good i remember how playing baldur's gate 2 on release felt like.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game absolutely blew me away, i've been itching to try out dungeons and dragons for a long time, never had the chance to time, groups, obligations, etc. so i saw baldur's gate 3 release into early access a while ago and bought it going in blind. i sunk around 25 hours into the early access and decided, after completing it, i should wait to play more until the full release. i made my account just to rave about the game and how much fun i've been having since day one. not only was i excited for the final release date to be set but larian even pushed it forward almost an entire month! i have never been so enthralled by a game before. i have never been one to care too much about the fine details in lore and story, but this game is a completely different story. there is so much to learn about every character and the characters are tied together and it makes me want to exhaust their dialogue and explore how they interact with one another. the world is rich with story and developments and your actions do matter and change how even side stories unfold. at this point in time i've put around 6065 hours into the game and i only want more. there is something in every corner, there's a ton of class combinations to explore, and playing of tactician difficulty makes me really think and synergize my party together. i am playing a noreload decision playthrough i will obviously reload for deaths as i would have had to do the beginning at least 25 times by now and i am loving it, every mistake, every decision, every action has meaning and i'm curious to see how it will end for me. this game is very thorough, the developers, larian, are clearly people who love games and love dd, and you don't need to know anything about dd to play the game. debuffs, buffs, environmental effects, dice roll modifiers, etc. is all explained ad easy to digest. there's no microtransactions, no pay to win, no battle pass, etc. the game is a complete experience out of the box. larian has truly outdone themselves, and proved that the real thing you need to make a good game is passion, dedication, and a willingness to listen. i'm looking forward to seeing what's next in my playthrough and already excited to start my next as a multiclass somethingorother. simply amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i have not been too much into dd and it's world before, even though i like fantasy. initially i also thought the turn based combat is a huge turn off, as i'm not a fan of that gameplay design either. however, watching videos of the early access combat and larians approach to a world building and reactivity within that world is something my heart longed for since the fallout series. you are rewarded for paying attention in both lore and the story itself, your choices carry an immense amount of importance to how the story proceeds. additional voiced cutscenes with dialogue based on as smth as a little tiny note in a secluded hidden area? insane, there is filled to the brim with things you can miss and this is ok, even better to find something new on a new character! this game is packed with so much stuff and the replayability if you missed something or wanted to try a different approach to quests is insane. the combat is super fun, no fight is the same and scales nicely based on the diffculty, i've tried all of them with seperate playthrough i've started. the companions all have unique personalites and have great stories with all of them feeling like actual people with conviction and ideals. and still they are developing over time, making them do thing different then they would gives them a perspective and they change their ways quite drastically. there is so much more to say, but it all boils down to this game is unique and we will not see in this decade. it opened a whole new world to me that me and my friends are excited to delve in to and larian should be proud of this beautiful masterpiece they have created. finally a studio that understands what people want because they are just creating a game they would want to play. thank you so much, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"great writing, acting  the scale is enourmous. hopefully  platform for more in the future"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i played similar games like divinity 2, but wasn't a huge fan of the gameplay, as i am not into turn based games usually. however, baldur gate blew me away, while my expectations were low. the story and the way it paths out is simply amazing. talking about it with friends, our experiences are vastly different and it is fun to hear how our storyline has changed between us. i don't think i've enjoyed played a game so much since i first started world of warcraft. i highly recommend giving it a try, even if you don't like turn based games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"solo or with friends, this game is a must have. we will playing bg3 for years !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,here to balance out all the dumbos who rate it 010 because its too hyped or other stupid reasons since i respect the game and the developers and the game deserves to be rated highly.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"it's just great! thanks larian! i would never have thought that a turnbased game could be so enticing, but it is! i can't tear myself away from it, every evening i sit for hours in this game! and every day i discover something new for myself in this game! i don't think even starfield can take my attention away from baldur's gate. definitely  this is my game for the next few years, which i will replay more than once. i want to see it all!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"amazing game from an amazing company that truly understand what people want and didn't put and kind of microtransactions in the game, please learn from them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,years of rpg was enough to satiate our hunger. the most beautiful rpg game ever made after the witcher 3. congratulations and thanks for the turkish language option larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,definitely a video game that revolutionizes the genre not only of rpg but of how a game should be and should be created.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"so good rpg, i can play it all time and everywhere, ehehe, not bad larian, not bad"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"bought game, havnt played giving score of 10 for what it is, and also to balance the stupid 0 review's who probably dont own the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the game is so good my only real complaint is that it will end at some point. there are some minor issues and bugs, but nothing that sours the experience. just a quality game with a lot of love and care put into it. i'm 60 hours in still not finished so hesitant to give it a 10 just yet, but it's very much looking like a game that perfectly executes on it's promises."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i didn't consider divinity a good game for four reasons mediocre characters, bland writing, bad world building, flawed combat system. good news is a lot of the flaws are alleviated here. the combat system is now merely dd5e. that has its pros and cons i'm not a fan of dice rolls in general but its considerably better than divinity. larian still has given quite a bit of freedom in the combat with all the barrels and stuff but its harder to break. the worldbuilding is also just forgotten realms. once again, pros and cons. the world is kind of generic high fantasy but its a lot richer than divinity. on top of that, the game has a much higher production value. the art style and the vistas are exceptional. that said, there's a lot more of divinity's dna here than baldurs gate 2. for instance, the game follows a somewhat linear act structure rather than giving the player total freedom like in bg2. the acts provide quite a bit of ways to tackle the problems, and the choice and consequence is impressive, but it does feel somewhat limiting until act 3. larian's weak writing is present here and is the weakest part of the game. the overall story is pretty engaging but won't blow you away. the companions interact with the story well largely due to larian's odd obsession with 'origin characters', but their interaction with a custom character is bland. nothing about the game is particularly deep but i understand thats not what its really going for. the gameplay outside of the combat is also quite weak. you are never going to come across well designed puzzles, for instance. its also very annoying how virtually everything can be searched for clutter like plates and cups and spoons, that serve no gameplay purpose and just waste my time on the off chance and it happens enough to make you keep doing it that theres something useful inside. overall this is a great game. the polish and the production values are making people overrate it a bit, but it definitely belongs near the top with the best crpgs ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolutely love this. i finished baldur's gate 1 and 2 multiple times years ago, they are probably the two of my favourite games of all time. baldur's gate 3 is a worthy successor. just amazing. the one thing i am not a fan of is the switch to turnbased system from the real time with optional pauses  but it's only a minor issue and i guess it also serves portability to consoles."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,i liked kicking the squirrel 1110 best game. i liked making love with a bear. i liked this game .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the thing that i don't hear from a lot of people that make this game so good is that they have created a game that can be as woke as any game can be but at the same time you don't have to deal with any of it. that alone for me in 2023 is worth 7 stars but i give this a 10 because it is meticulously crafted in all of its elements from story telling to combat and beyond. great multiplayer experience, great solo experience, great viewing experience even as there are so many choices its unlikely anyone is going to have the same playthrough. kudos to larian for such a wonderful game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game absolutely deserves a 1010. you can tell the entirety of the developers heart and soul were poured into this game. great story, telling, attention to detail and combat. to those giving it a 0 because they think its rigged and people are falsely giving it 1010's.. you deserve to play games made by blizzard and ea forever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"hi, this game is not my taste this game has a bad style, i wish it was first person"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"one of the best games of the last 10 years, i advise fans of the genre! 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"easily the most in depth, enjoyable, cinematic, and engrossing translation of dd to a crpg i've ever played. the only crpg's that i would say come close are the pathfinder series from owlcat games. if you like crpgs you really cant go wrong with this, it's the good stuff we love from the genre but with the passion and budget to push it to the next level. genuinely a 1010 game when taken in the context of the niche genre it originates from and how its bringing that to the forefront of gaming. also anyone who rates this 010 is an  and should be reported for abuse of the voting system."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"probably the only game of all time that most closely matches the definition of the rpg genre. 1. a monstrous in the best possible way amount of mechanics. 2. a huge handcrafted world that generates an incredible amount of events. 3. absolutely enchanting soundtrack by borislav slavov. 4. perfectly written script, dialogues, etc. 5. at the start, the game is perfectly optimized and polished. 6. no  transactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"it's a great honor to be able to play baldur's 3 while i'm alive. the original flavor of the rpg was wonderfully expressed, and i hope the developer will have the honor of being selected as the best game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,",     !       ,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,great game! thanks larian! true adaptation of dnd with great performance.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,played initially at the start of early access  loved it then but on full release its even better. turn off karmic dice and just roll with it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"absolute masterpiece. rpg of the decade. should be the standard for years to come. larian made some enemies because of what they accomplished here. this is not an anomaly, this is the standard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this game is a great example of what to strive for when creating an rpg. there are many details, consequences to your actions, and the few bugs dont take away from the game at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"an absolute masterpiece. there is no way around it. i was not following the game at all during it's development, and going completely blind into it probably even enhanced my experience. this is not just an homage to rpgs of old. this extremely high quality game from aa studio that shows aaa how it's done. the game is polished, well written, extremely fun and just a has a very fair pricing model. more games like this and there is a hope for this industry as a whole. larian ascended to the best rpg studio in the world right now. and rightly so. please never change."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i really love crpg, and bg3 are fantastic game. amount of freedom in your actions, spell system. character customization and more  i could tell you a lot of points that i liked in this game, and i dont remember any actual negative  excellent work larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is for sure the best rpg since quite time. so many decision, so many choices to do, to be... finally a game that challenge you to think and not just grind. thank you larian for this masterpiece. one disappointing thing though  why shields not visible when not in battle? hope you'll fix this, or at least give option to show shield or musical instrument while not in battle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"this is how games used to be made, so other aaa devs be hating because they don't want to put in effort to make a game like this, they would rather focus on making money with in game shops. i dont expect indie devs to match this quality, but any game asking the same price or more, i expect this kind of quality. stop being butt hurt and complaining. rant over, now for this masterpiece review with about 40h played and trying to avoid any spoilers. visuals the environments are amazing, the locations look and feel amazing, the underground fortress gave me goosebumps, it looks epic like a fantasy game is supposed to be. characters feels expressive, my drow's smug face gives me a giggle sometimes. visuals on the spells feels believable and effects on the ground are marked properly so you can see what is where, and where it is dangerous to traverse etc. world interactions they are making this game worth it alone, the amount of effort they put into npcs is astounding, at first it felt like the usual and then you start noticing the unexpected ones sometimes very well hidden. the amount of times i saved just to take make an alternate interaction just to see wat happens is easily over 100, and most of the times worth it. one of the best things i found was a trader that was selling rare items, but reading the description they are all garbage. read descriptions of items, even underwear. gameplay the ai is not the worst, they make good decisions 910 times, had a few instances where i could see the ai was not sure how to react to my party's location, but overall they will kill you if you don't plan or position properly and this is on balanced difficulty, so not sure how it is on the higher difficulty. traversing the areas are nice, got lots of waypoints to tp to, so moving back and forth is enjoyable and not punishing. ui is pretty decent, got all you skills automatically added or you can make a custom one. story main plot is typical of rgp, but decent overall and reading the books actually tells you more details that you would think. party member's stories are not bad either some seemed obvious but unexpected twists are still there so good job overall on them. based on the options available so far, it seems you should be able to side with the bad guys, so i will do a bad guy playthrough, after beating the game and see how well it plays out. overall the game is even better than what i expected, same amount of excitement when monster hunter world released on pc. also same amount of quality content. thanks larian studios for making us an epic game and don't listen to the haters."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"honestly, best game this year this game caught me off guard this game better win got cause i've played every big release and so far this one has the most replayability and just the most flawless"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"0 microtransactions, a world full of thousands of quests, characters well designed, the story is really cool and the graphics are amazing to be an isometric game, 1010 to me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"having adored bg1  2 with bg2 being the first game to have ever made me completely lose track of all time when i discovered it was 4am in the morning, i had hoped that bg3 would at least be able to give the same sort of experience..... man did larian deliver!! bg3 goes way beyond my expectations and it is utterly captivating. the freedom and choices it gives you in just about everything is mind boggling. you know a game is good when you spend your days thinking about it when you can't play it. larian studios deserve all the praise they are getting as the game is nothing short of a masterpiece and i'll be shocked if this isn't a goty candidate."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"el juego es impresionante, un obligatorio para todo amante al genero de rol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"feels like im playing bg2 but with turn based instead of rtwp, alot of strategy involved in character building and turn based combat, game lives up to its predecessors by having a ton of landmass to explore with hidden quests and treasure in every corner of the map it lives up to the legacy of baldurs gate and stands at the top with games like kingmaker pathfinder and pillers of eternity, bravo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,best crpg i ever played. the world and story reacts to your choices. free choice in combat style and customization of your class. the very catching story that is tied into the lore of the forgotten world setting. the devs listen to feedback and try their best and succeeded to deliver a game that pleases the players
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"can you feel that feeling of joy, of satisfaction, when you see a 010, or 410 review for bg3? reason? cos the game is too good andor they didn't understand what they were getting. probably balancing out a 1010 review given on diablo 4.....simply sad and amusing. as for the game. 1010 for some reasons. 1. amazing story. 2. incredible replayability, starting from a minimum of 14 playthrough of a 70100hrs game, considering only goodevil route for all the main characters. 3. choice matters. a simple choice at the beginning, killed or maimed a main origin char...a branching plot 20 minutes in the game? then more options 30 minutes into the game? oh god yes 4. as for now every dialog is voiced over and acted, even simple dialogs without option, and just a line from the random character you're not supposed to interact with 5. i killed a goblin after jumping next to him and pushing him out of a cliff........this alone is worth a 1010 oh let me add, to those bots or diablo 4 fan who are giving poor reviews. this game came out less than a week ago and already has a huge amount of 1010 reviews. that is what happens when you have 3 years of early access by giving people 25 hours of gameplay to replay to infinity with every class, more than what most games give at full release another reason for a well deserved 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"hit around 100 hours played today, came to give it a 10 after just experiencing the end of act 2. this is better than i could have imagined, been gaming since the 90's and i've played almost every big crpg out there and most aaa rpgs in general. this is on another level of depth and quality, what a game. hope other studios take notice and i get to play another game like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,big middle finger to aaa industry. this is what gamers need but probably don't deserve.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"the game surprised me. for the first time in many years, i got so attached to the game. hope for dlc"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,this game is a work of art full of mysteries and things to do. for a long time that no game made me want to play 8 hours every day and want more and this game did it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the few complaints one could cherry pick are heavily outweighed by the good. this game understands what makes in game choices fun and what makes an rpg fun in general. the fact that this game promises no microtransactions and is a complete and full experience without milking it's audience for more and more money is a godsend in today's game market. the story is engaging, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is fun with zillions of choices. fantastic game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,basically a perfect version of what it's trying to be. literally my only complaint so far is that some mini map quest markers display what quest they're for and others don't. they've done an incredible job of bringing dd to life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"game as good and innovating as original was. truly masterpiece! it is goty for sure and by far. clearly, a product of love and respect to originals."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i didn't expect to enjoy this game since i'm not big on turnbased gameplay, but everything this game does is so good that even the turnbased style of gameplay becomes fun too."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,best game of the decade. even if you are not a fan of turn based crpgs.. this is the game to get you into the genre.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,best game of all time ill give it a 1010 must play i have 50 hours in the game already and its only been out for a week i put 35 hours in the game in the beta but now the game is in full release i can experience the story fully without limits combat 1010 loot 1010 the environments are a 1010 i couldn't ask for more in a game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"its a masterpiece, great rpg games. goty 2023 for me. congratulations to the developers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"finally , a crpg with a good graphics and easy to learn mechanics. thank you larian studio"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"1st time i've enjoyed turnbased combat. the story is interesting and your dialogue choices actually matter i've reloaded a few saves just to see what happens if i choose something else, and am usually surprised how different the outcomes can be. i find myself playing until 2am most nights and feeling like a zombie at work the next day. rinse and repeat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a beautiful game, it shows what could happen when devs and publishers treat their product as a work of art, not a cash cow."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i'm not even going to try to write a review about this game. review that you are not likely going to read in a sea of positive reviews d. i'm just going to say this is larian, what bioware and other mythic studios used to be before being bought by greedy companies. that this game is made with love and passion, and that 20 years into the future, it will still be considered as a reference. buy it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"act 2 and 55 hours in. this game is the best game i've ever played in my life. i look forward to replaying it and playing with friends tomorrow in a planned weekly campaign! well done! you earned this 1010, you actually really did."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"best rpg game i've ever played, im extremally immersed in the world and characters, playing with friends is a blast. all these other gaming studios and the developers that they employee, need to step there game up. all i got to say is i never thought i'd see a bugbear and an ogre.......... xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,absolutely phenomenal game. act 1 alone feels like what i would get from most modern games. the amount of content present in this game is absolutely perfect and plentiful. still only on a first playthrough and im already thinking about ideas for new characters and playthroughs. goty easily.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,amazing game done by company that does care about it's customers. love the story and game mechanics.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the greatest game ever!! it's a masterpiece. every character is amazing, the story is unforgettable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"pro's excellent narrative choices matter true to dd no micro transactions great itemization and build options exploration is rewarded moddable con's buggy! some areas are unbalanced such as moonrise towers can be frustrating  you've been warned here faux difficulty aka forcing you to go against 10  20 enemies occasionally limited party options weak puzzles camera angles can be a problem character ai is pretty bad  whilst enemy ai is too good bosses can be cheap and annoying act 2 and 3 feel very rushed now, looking at the cons  which outweigh the pro's here and still giving a positive review? the game's narrative and story telling is on point, many of your choices will matter and that can heavily change your outcome, some areas could be  harder, you might even lose party members or gain new ones. graphics are pretty good, although camera angles occasionally bug out and can cause problems. the greatest issues are all related to either serious bugs, some potentially game breaking such as corrupted save files or minor graphical glitches. gameplay is great, with high replayability but once again, it isn't a masterpiece here as many have immediately reviewed without getting into the actual meat of the game, and later especially towards mid  endgame it becomes frustrating fast with many encounters opting for numbers vs tactics, such as moonrise towers is notoriously difficult, not because of high level enemies? oh nono, but simply because you'll be facing large scale battles sometimes upwards of 15 enemies, and if they decide to attack any of your party, you can't survive against it and will cause frustration, even on the easiest difficulty it is without a doubt, soulslike difficulty level here. party options are limited, the idea of playing it 'your' way is false, you still really need your tank and healer especially in difficulty encounters, no matter your level. another issue, i've personally seen is that ac armor level is broken, you could have ac 20 or even 23, trash mobs will still hit you quite easily just as having someone in cloth armor with ac 15 for example, overall does not feel true to dd in this respect and probably done to insure some level of difficulty once again, it needs tweaking for sure, because trash mobs 5 levels lower than you, shouldn't be able to hit someone with ac 20 'that' easily, but 910 times they'll hit each and every time. overall, baldurs gate 3 is a great game but it does require some balancing and mods maybe the solution for that, some upgrades such as animation skipping or increasing enemy turn speed on large encounters is absolutely necessary because they can take way too long. act 2 and 3 are significantly more rushed and have considerably more bugs, this is part of the problem as all the reviews are just for act 1 without really getting into the meat of the game, once larian fixes many of these issues then i'd increase my rating, but out of the gate its clear it was released too early from ea to capitalize on diablo 4's failure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,best game i have played in a long time. if you liked dragon age originsor dd. you will love this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i loved diablo iv release, heard about baldur's gate 3, ignored it. then came diablo iv season 1 and patch, and boy, all of a sudden did i pay attention to bg3! so glad i did. game of the year! sure, base diablo iv is awesome, really enjoyed the campaign, but the blizzard corporate greed has got me ill and season 1, damn, it is so disappointing. turn to bg3 for relief and what an extreme surprise. the turned base combat i enjoyed more than i ever i thought i would. i'm a stickler for rules, so i was careful about understanding the combat rules, and all the it is too hard complainers need to watch some bg3 combat videos. it is not that difficult. common sense in most cases, but it is mostly understanding the dd rules that ensure combat odds favor you, though dice role by luck turn off that kharma dice setting can ruin you regardless. i get wiped, reload, and try again looking for alternative solutions or going somewhere else to gain a level. oh do i love it. this game is so massive and well implemented that my jaw keeps dropping. it is amazing. it is not a double a title, it is a quadruple a title, because triple a corporate greed companies can't match it. how larian studios accomplished this while other aaa companies fail leaves me astonished. please larian studios games, don't be bought out. you folks are heroes now to the playercustomer base. you have our trust, our love, our admiration. for everyone else, buy this game, buy it. just to show support and vote against the monetization of the other corporate greed gaming companies. they are not about gaming and customer satisfaction, they are about greed, period. larian studios games is about customer satisfaction, and boy have they delivered. i don't want to give a 10, no game is perfect, i have never given a 10, it is an impossible bench mark. but with respect to what other aaa companies push on us the consumer, my goodness, it is a 10."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"buy this game on steam, try it out and if you don't like it you can refund it. you will not refund this game. the gameplay is so different to what i am used to, i was a bit iffy about it being turn based combat, but once i got into it i learned that its so much more complex. heaps of youtube videos out that will explain everything to you in case you don't understand it either. i have been playing it every chance i get since released. 62hrs of play time."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"an actual masterpiece. not only did larian make what is probably the best rpg of all time, they did it without any scummy business practices."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,larian has absolutely knocked this one out of the park. thank you so much for showing other game devs how to release games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,no encuentro nada malo que decir de este ttulo. todo lo que hace lo hace de forma correcta y las cosas que importan en un rpg de este estilo las hace de forma brillante. haca mucho tiempo que no disfrutaba as de un videojuego de rol.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"by far, the best game i have played in so long. def worth the 60 without a doubt."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,so much fun to play. never been a fan of rpg's or turn based combat but the visuals and story options and characters and world and choices and everything i didn't mention make it so much fun to play. if i could sacrifice my nuts to forget everything about the game and play it again for the first time. i would.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the best rpg game released ever. it takes crpg genre on a different level in terms of quality and quantity of contents. honestly, 60 is too cheap. i really hope they continue to make sequels or new titles for dnd games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i don't normally leave reviews, in fact i signed up to metacritic just to leave a review for this game. this game and every single person involved deserved the praise and reward they've earned since this game's release even since early access. the passion from the team bleeds heavily into the full game. from character design, story, music, art, choices and many many more aspects of the game that we'll never see. and god damn it shows how much they care about this product and the legacy that the baldur's gate name carries on with larian studios and baldur's gate iii, forever endeared in my heart. i thought i've reached an age where i stopped enjoying video games, but this game made me realise that i live in the time where most video game companies are just copypaste cashgrabs and eventually everyone in the community forgot what it feels like to enjoy an actual game. it makes me feel like a kid, wanting to do just one more quest before switching off, only to realise it's 4am, i have a job and no longer a kid that have ample free time. it's like coming out of a toxic relationship thinking damn maybe the problem lies with me only to be welcomed by baldur's gate iii that actually understands you, makes it really easy to talk to and make an effort back to them instead of feeling like doing a chore when doing anything with them for hours on end and you never want it to end. thank you larian for producing such an amazing game, cultivating a great community behind it, and showcasing to others in the industry that once again, games can be fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i was skeptical at first, as a longtime fan of bg and bg2, i didn't think larian would do it justice. i didn't want it to be a divinity clone and the long period in early access made me more fearful. . however. . god damn if they didn't deliver a great game, with no  i can't stop playing. . . this is one of those games we see once every 10 years. they even had two hotfixes out within the first week for bug fixes. . . that's . . incredible compared to what i expect from other aaa. they are passionate about the game, and it shows. thank god larian is still doing us gamers proud."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i'm not gonna give any game a 1010 but if this is your type of game then it is pretty close. just to get it out of the way, i think the biggest issue with the game right now is its questionable performance even with dlss enabled. there are multiple areas where the fps gets really choppy. movement and combat can also be a bit clunky and annoying and ive run into some really frustrating bugs like a chest that i spent many lock picks getting into which then gave me a huge pain trying to actually access it before eventually flying off the screen in a straight line and disappearing. but beyond that, the game itself is really very well done and probably one of the most immersive games i have ever played. i won't ramble, if you are looking into this game you know how well regarded it is. i look forward to not only completing the game, but playing it again and again over the years hopefully."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"sets standard for coop games. the coop feature is fully independent, each player can popin to the others dialogue and battles. it's also friendly to nongamers since combat is turnbased, it can be easily learned."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"solid story and gameplay. the mechanics are amazing too! there are so many options that i think ill play this game for the next 5 years, at least."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i havent had such a true gaming experience in years. im reminded of the impressive rpg world of dragon age origins, and the joy of multiplayer battle mode in mario kart. this game checks so many boxes. last night i played couch coop mode with my girlfriend who has never played a video game before and she loved it. giving this game a 1010 is unfair unless all other 10 games get demoted to 9. my new favorite game, by a long shot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,overall this game is a perfect 10 for me. so many dialogue options and the rpg elements are just next level. i spent over an hour in just character customization. with over 50 hrs of game time i can confidently say it's game of the year for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"esse jogo me surpreendeu, no sou f de jogos de turnos e algo que me fez quase no joglo foi por esse motivo, mas resolvi dar uma chance e me surpreendi, com os grficos, histria, os detalhes. tudo neste jogo  lindo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,master piece. master piece. master piece. master piece. master piece. master piece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"so just got about 25 hours into the game and i have to say that these people on here giving it a 0 score for the dumbest reasons are crazy. this game is just straight up beautiful, and as a person who grew up playing pathfinder ttrpg this game felt right at home. this is not a game for low iq players unfortunately, console players will have a hard time with this computer roleplaying game. simply because its not their speed. 1010 game for dialogue, atmosphere, voice acting, combat, music and with zero microtransactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"absolutely beautiful. engaging story, interesting companions, amazing voice acting and a fun and vivid world. one of the best games i've ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,made an account to make a review. game is easily one of the best in the last decade. a complete game for a one time purchase in 2023? imagine?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,friend turned into a barbecue after trying to sneak loot. bg3 teaching friends not to be greedy! 1110
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i played it when early access came out, and after so many years i finally can play the full version. the experience of baldur's gate made me reluctant to finish the game. i read every article and note carefully, marveling at larian's arrangement and atmosphere of each scene, the immersive feel of the game was unmatched, and i was shocked by the whimsical approach to each quest line."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this game is simply put amazing. the sheer amount of content, graphics, sound, gameplay, story, it's just spot on. not many developers these days are capable of releasing an actually finished product, which is pretty sad, but goddamn did these guys do their job and some. game of the year material, period."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this might be the best crpg game that i have ever played. it is so close to the dnd experience that it blows my mind. they have poured so much love into this game and you can tell. the writing is top notch and the visuals is nothing short of amazing. the turn based combat system might not be for everyone but i beg you to give it a try and you'll find that you will pick it up quickly and it makes the game more fun. i hope that over devs look to this as a new benchmark in what games should be when they are released.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"while i would've liked a more faithful adaptation of dnd 5e rules for combat ala solasta, i cannot deny the sheer magnitude of what was achieved in this game is mind blowing, which compensates for my minor gripes with the itemization, inventory management, camera, and ui. visuals and art style and animations are all top notch, barring a few minor hiccups and glitches with the camera, but the soundtrack and music more than makes up for that with some of the most iconic and epic music i've ever heard in gaming. borislav's genius really shone through with this game. the level of ambition in this game with the attention to detail and the amount of pathways to navigate the storylines and plots for each origin and each act are mindblowing. and with all of the visual fidelity and cinematic animations on par with many aaa studios. the level of care put into ensuring nearly every pathway for the various class and race combinations are explored in a satisfying manner is truly jawdropping. easily the game of the year for 2023, and rpg of the decade, if not a top 3 rpg of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"game lets you check out your equipment down there before starting out on an epic journey. enough said, also countering trolls who hate on the game because it actually gives a proper game for the price you pay."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"so much to explore, so much interesting stuff and people to meet, every fight is fun, don't know when i played such a good game. and the best is i'm not even through the first chapter after over 30 hours. i hope other aaa studios will look at bg3 and decide to make games like them, without microtransactions, big first day patches, pay full price and be the betatester and dlcs after a short time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"at the beating heart of this game is the developer's passion for their craft and it absolutely shows. the rpg elements, the faithful dnd experience, the vibrant world full of life it all made this a dream come true for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the original baldurs gate games were big shoes to fill, and larian has done that and more. already looking forward to future playthroughs with so many options giving me inspiration at new ways to play. bg3 is what a proper triple a game should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"absolutely godly game with developers who genuinely care about the audience and arent  into crappy marketing tacticsgreed, thankyou larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,if you love turn based rpgs you are going to love this game. if you love dnd you are going to love this game. if you like rpgs but have never tried a turn based rpg you should this is an amazing game to try the genre. the graphics are beautiful and i haven't run into any bugs so far. the game is feature complete which is so rare now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"while it isnt revolutionary in terms of gameplay, in terms of production value it blows its competitors out of the water. larian has elevated both crpgs and the industry as a whole to a new level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,better than tears of the kingdom 10 of 10. some of these people are giving this game 0 scores are either mostly trolls or just plain stupid. now im not talking about people who just dont dig the combat i get that. but there is one person who said that the game has graphics and animations from 2010? wtf lol you gotta have severe brain damage if you actually think that.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"wow just wow, a game like this only comes around once in a generation, a true game changer!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"ever since divinity original sin, larian has earned my trust. with this title they made good on their promise to honor the 20 year old games i have so much nostalgia for. truly one of the most immersive games, filled with lovingly crafted characters and stories. one of the easiest 10's in my life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece straight from the heart of its indie developer, larian studios. i had never played a crpg that i actually enjoyed before divinity original sin 2, by larian. i've spent countless pandemic nights lurking around fort joy's prison halls and played through the story dozens of times. i've never played baldur's gate 1 or 2. but when baldur's gate 3 was announced by larian, i was hyped. i bought the game on early access, and believe me it was that good back then a full experience with rich story, fun mechanics, tons of customization and player agency. but with none of the quality of life features and countless bugs, of course. seeing baldur's gate 3 go full circle in its launch amazes me. it's truly one of the bets games ever made, especially if we consider what the new standards from corporate perspective of the game industry are today."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"absolutely undescriable experience. what a journey this game took me on. it is and will rightfully be called one of the greatest games of all time as in my mind even the giants of this media can barely stand toe to toe. there is no perfect game, but this, like dragon age origins, witcher 3 or even persona 5 and three houses, gave me the perfect experience, and all that i could hold against it, is that there isnt more. tho frankly, i doubt i will ever truly finish this game also, why the heck isnt down the river playing during the end credits, what a grevious oversight"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"1010. ive not a huge dd person and im not a hardcore gamer, but the sheer amount of choice, repercussions and variation in the game is mind blowing. it took some getting used to at the start as i had not played similar games, but now im just drawn into the gameplay so much. i usually play games for around an hour or two but somehow six hours had passed last night."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,a fantastic way to have a dnd experience with a couple of friends around the world.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the ultimate dnd experience, a perfect combination of turnbased combat, spectacular scenarios, unforgettable stories, characters that you will love and hate in equal parts. rarely does the video game industry reach this standard of quality. 1010 ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"combat is ruining game for me, too much rng, i preordered the game and it is not that great,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this is the type of game that needs to be the new standard. absolutely a masterpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,very good game but doesn't raise the standard set by pathfinder wrath of the righteous for the genera. being unable to turn into a vampire and having many cool things reserved for companions only eg patron interactions makes this game very good instead of amazing and genera defining.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i decided i am not going to let me fool by the hype, because earlier games in the series was crap. then i discovered my favorite gaming streamers praising it, then watched some gameplay videos. so i gave it a chanche, since i love rpg and mmorpg with fast pace and demands using your brain a bit. no i'm 40 hours in, in 3 days.. its a lifewrecker and you have a hard time letting go because of the constant cliffhangers. the choices and consequences, possibilities to develop your charachter, the voice acting and the massive amount of voice acting is very good! it looks very good for using older engines like dx11 and vulcan. i whish there was more multiplayer options though, that would be the killer of mmorpg. sending a certain company ms just tries to buy directly to hell without passing start.. monopoly reference i am truly amazed, the second and third games in a series usually makes them crapier and crapier. but this is like a new start, a good start, a finnished and featureperfect game that just works with no bugs at all for me. the story is long large and entertaining, and you make it the way you decide to. i am tempted to say this might be the best game ever made to date, i think even hardcore fps gamer are able to like this. but for the beautiful art it is fully fledged, you do need a good gpu. i play on a rtx 3080 and that is enough to run it on high or ultra. i cant really put that as a minus, because that is our own choice what hardware we use, they just makes it possible to play with lesser, and ofc if they are going to make it very nice no matter which game it is, you need fast hardware. if they made all games to look alike and the weakest hardware as reference there would be no development and nicer graphics. and all the gpus would go to the miners rather than displaying how good games can look and feel. i just get mad when people whine about that they are not able to play graphic heavy games on their laptops with all the whistles and bells that a premium graphics card gives the game developers to build into the game. stop it, you need to understand that gamedevelopers want their products to be smooth and nice like high framerate uhd video and have a lot of graphic features making it real and smooth, and for that they need power. in 10 years you probably can buy a new laptop which gives todays games run like a new premium gpu today."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"first crpg ever played , and all i have to say is wow. the story telling , graphics , and size of the world is truely amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"1010. if you're a fan of hardcore, narrativedriven rpgs like what bioware used to create once upon a time, then you can't ask for anything more than baldur's gate iii"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"140 hours in, i love the game! very nostalgic, having grown up playing dnd. i played through bg1 back when that was released and that is an alltime memorable game for me. for bg3, the gameplay is great, the combat is satisfying, the spellcasting feels good, and the story and cinematics are enthralling. i buy and play a game. this is literally the first game i have played in 5 years or more where i wasn't watching tv or a movie while playing. 1010 for me. thank you larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,everything you could want from a fully finished game. these 010 haters are obnoxious i think there should be a way to link to steam to prove you own it to be able to rate.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a very good game so far, i have had a blast. seems a lot of reviews are just copypasting to bomb that 010 because they just parrot their political opinions, it is a game just play it or don't. i can respect a bad review that is based on the merit of the game itself or personal preferences, but most of these come off like contrarians and don't see the irony in them calling others 'sheep'. so far the game has been really good for me, i am just gonna enjoy playing it for a while and actually have a good time. the game is not a 1010, but it also isn't a 010 unless you are just being disingenuous and got an agenda to contribute to. the things i enjoy about the game so far are a mix of the mechanics from divinity original sin 2, and ttrpg dd 5e. both of the positives and cons from each respective property are still there, but the game blends it together decently. characters are interesting, i definitely have my favorites and some that rub me the wrong way, but at the end of the day i get to choose how to respond to them and who i have in my party. voice acting has got my attention through a lot of the game, some stars shine brighter than others, but an overall good performance. main issues i have with it are how it feels some of the writing and voice acting are very detailed in some areas, but when you go off the rails a bit there is a lack of voice lines recorded, and a quality dip. not uncommon in my experience, but i would expect a little better based off the areas of the game given attention. i bought the game in early access and already knew i would at the very least enjoy it with friends, i stopped following the progress in development and was surprised to hear the direction they took with romance. the nudity took me by surprise and i was not sure how i felt about that until i realized i could censor it or just not participate in that part of the game, them including it in the game had at least shown me that they were committed to an adult game and were not trying to haggle the esrb to a lower rating to have a wider audience. that was a problem i had with star wars titles, that didn't want to fully commit to adult themes in order to keep that t rating. alright, now for my biggest issue, in bold for those of you who still care. if you are like me, there is one thing i do not enjoy in my rpgs when it comes to being in this format. dice are fun and quirky in ttrpgs but i will die on the hill that the inclusion of them in video games just bog down the gameplay, especially when you can save an load whenever you want. why not just have a skill threshold to meet and succeed rather than roll a natural one on the only thing that character is good at? weighted dice help, a little. an option to skip the middle man and just play through the story how the characters intend is better for me. also it was just nice to buy a game that doesn't require to be online and isn't already asking for the rest of my wallet. i know it is played up for marketing, but it would be nice if more games followed example and just sold their products honestly. as idealistic as that is i would like to reward that behavior as a consumer. people have to stop talking about degeneracy and pretending to be philosophers, you are the bottom of the social food chain, and you look like a fool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the first turn based rpg game i've played but not the first consequencestory driven one, its top tier and i don't think anything else is even close."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece that may have topped baldur's gate 12. i played over 65 hours and i still want more
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"childhood dreams made into reality. the developers know what they wanted to do, and it clearly shows."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this is the game all new rpgs will be compared to for years to come. maybe even all video games, since you pay 60 and get an entire video game. no battle pass, no dlcs, no microtransactions, no subscriptions, just one really good complete video game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i was born in '91, i have been playing video games my whole life since the minute my brain could fathom the controls of doom and wolf 3d. i have played a lot of video games. i tend to favor action fpses and similar genres due to that being where i started and thus do not usually enjoy isometric turn based games. mass effect and the like is usually more my speed of rpg. i typed all that to make it abundantly clear this is by far one of the best games i have ever played and easily the best traditional rpg i have ever put my time into. hands down. i thought tears of the kingdom or dead space remake would be my game of the year, they were amazing. this is better. maybe armored core will stand a chance at dethroning it but i doubt it, as amazing as that will probably be. this is a once in a decade or two quality level game. larian deserves all the praise that is being heaped on them."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"thank you for a feature complete amazing game, it's been a while and i'm beyond happy to be playing it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"honestly cant believe that a game like this has released. but if it was gonna be any studio to do this larian was the best bet, theyve made a fantastic game based on the world of dnd and have put so much love and attention into it, its overflowing with carefully thought out details and chok full of content. one of my absolute favorite things to do is read item descriptions because you can just tell how much fun the devs had in making the game from reading em. and for all the people  on bd3 just giving it a 0 review score out of spite, yall are a bunch of white knights for game development studios that couldnt give a rats ass about ya."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"in a world of mediocre aaa games titles baldur's gate iii stands tall as one of the greatest computer role playing games to be released in the last 10 years. it makes the dd ruleset accessible and fun. the storylines are deep and rich, the characters all have personalities, and the writing is excellent. the divinity 4.0 graphics engine shines in this game and the spell and environmental effects are excellent. the map is very dense and there is always something interesting to discover."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i had no idea that baldur's gate 3 would spark such a crpg hype. typically, this genre has been a small market played by a small group of enthusiasts. also, before the game's release, turnbased roleplaying games were considered dead. even the recently released final fantasy 16 attempting swith into an action rpg. baldur's gate 3's turnbased combat system was heavily criticised compared to the realtime battles of previous games in the series, but larian was right. i'd write more, but i have to go play baldur's gate 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"incredibly perfect western rpg video game, best to date, deserves full marks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"no games deserved to be 0 and even gollum are realistically a 3 or 210. below that is just a hate reviews and review bomb, you can look at bg3 0 reviews with little to only a few paragraph i don't think they even play the game lol, they don't score the soundtrack, the gameplay or even the story, they just put 0 and a few quick line that's it. aka the haters.  now onto the game itself  this game for me is a solid 9 or 10 because it's fun, consumer friendly with no micro and a lot of paths you can choose at your own pace, and mods! yes you can mod this as easy as skyrim does, now i am a dd player and i have been a gm for at least 10 years experience and i rated this in the prospective of a dd casuals the new players that doesn't understand dd may face confusion such as why my attacks are all missing, even xcom are not this bad or why everything is a dice roll even each attacks or defend, that is a given and will happen but as everything goes in this life, keep on learning and playing you'll soon learn a whole new world in the dd perspective and you'll thank me later"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"baldur's gate 3 is a fantastic game with no microtransactions, good graphics and gameplay. this game should be the standard today and not like the greedy aaa studios that are releasing unfinished games nowadays."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a friend asked me why is baldur's gate 3 so hyped? thinking about it a little it comes to the fact that it is indeed a good game. the community has been so abused in the last years with broken cashgrab protogames that most of us have forgotten what games once were before corporate greed. and that's exactly what bg3 is a good game. larian studios shown that the community will appreciate effort put into a game, the effort of responding to feedback when given, that by making a good game it will be profitable. that being said, the game is a crpg fan dream. the adaptations from dd5e done by larian are pretty damn good i keep getting surprised when i see something that would actually happen in a dd table top session being possible in this game. i had around 90 hours in the ea phase and atm i'm still in the first part of the full game and i see around 35 hours of gameplay has passedand that's only in 1 character so far!. i have full intent to pursue different paths with other characters so i believe this is going to be the most played game in my library. if you crave for a dd adventure and don't have the possibility of playing the tabletop rpg, this is a very good place to satiate your needs. congratulations larian studios for what i believe to be a game to be placed among the halls of classics to be remembered for years on end. don't pay attention to the lazy devs that are claiming anomaly instead of aspiring to do better work in face of this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"its a game built from the ground up as a game, to be played and enjoyed by buyers. simple as"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"wonderful music, great story and amazing voice acting. i can't stop playing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,excellent game! 10 times more than i've expected. in best traditions of divinity original sin.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"ive never played such a masterpiece game in my 25 years life. this game has so many possibilities, so many options that you can be in this dnd world. you can truly become who you want to be. a good guy to save the world, or slaughter all the npcs in the entire gameyes you really can do that holy crap that ship blow my mind. the characters all well design with lively animation capture expressions and each npc you talk to then at least twice they give different dialogues and expression. don't underestimate this game just because it's turnbased. put down your arrogant you will see it's not simply just turnbased its much more complex and interesting than your conception."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"best adventure game ever played. outstanding, a true new level for the industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,tremendo juego excelente historia y un sistema de combate increble esto si es un juego de rol con mucho cario espero que gante el goty 2023 porque lo tiene bien merecido gracias por pensar en el consumidor
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"after 20 hours straight of playing through this game, i can say that it will be incredibly tough for another game to replicate the magic that larian gave me. this is an astounding achievement."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"everything you see about this game on the internet is about sex, if i wanted something like that the last place i would look would be in a medieval era rpg set in dd, the game doesn't bring anything new about the system, the story it's full of clichs, but the amount of options you have to make it the way you want is the only strong point, unfortunately forcing romance with so many npcs is really forced and makes it lose quality"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,best crpg ever made. personal top 5 rpg. the game has no business being as good as it is. i haven't even skipped a single line of dialogue. it's the adult fantasy sandbox i've been craving for years now. gorgeous visuals and audio. compelling characters  even the random npcs feel like they have life. everything hits in this game. thank you larian  bunch of norwegian goats.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"simply magnificent, sensational game, even the style of the game is not the best action the care with the game makes it deserve one of the best rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"great story, gameplay, characters, world. best of all no microtransactions"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,very immersive game! its great to finally have a game with zero immersion breaking micro transactions
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i've never truly liked crpgs, but i fell in love with this one. amazing storytelling, great characters with a lot of depth and some hard moral dilemmas. it's amazing that larian achieved this ideal balance between sandbox and linear storytelling, so it's almost like playing tabletop rpg with a perfect dungeon master. unfortunately it has some minor bugs, unclear mechanics and other small flaws, but as overall gaming experience it is definitely 1010 for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"honestly one of the best rpg i have ever played, it defines the genre. larian studios have not only delivered what they promised on but have gone above and beyond, exceeding every expectations i had for the game. the way the world and the characters react to you is simply amazing, the combat is fun and offers creativity beyond what you would imagine. i am incredibly happy and excited to see new players pick up the game who otherwise would have never gotten into the crpg scene, and i warmly welcome all of them. great work larian, thank you for delivering what you promised on! keep doing what you're doing, the community is with you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"gonna give it a 1010, simply because i can, never played the game, but i'm buying to support the dev who clearly cares about the people buying their product unlike a certain d4 game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this is the first game out of this genre that i'm playing and i'm absolutely loving the characters and how combat works. the only thing i'd personally criticize is that you can't create a party out of only custom characters without a workaround. tho i can understand that it would take out a lot of interaction and conversation options when there are only custom characters so that's totally fine for me, i just wished there was the option even if it was a new game or so. as this is my only really negative point and it's really just my personal preference of creating your own chars and classes, i'm still giving the game a 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,haven't played it but that's not gonna stop me from saying it looks like an okay game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a high quality, and anything can happen experience. i strongly recommend bg3 to rpg genre lovers, and games in general. icing on the cake is no micro transactions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i'd give 10, but character creation was so confusing that i didn't realise that i can have a custom character. after 10 hours of playtime i found out that you don't have to play one of the orgin characters"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i really don't get all the 1010's. did this game reinvent the wheel? no. it's okay but it's nothing extremely groundbreaking, i do understand i was not a huge divinity fan  and this game feels like another divinity game. it's all there. but i suppose if you are a pen and paper dd nerd your head will explode as now its dd meshed with divinity. i respect larian but come on... do you really have to add beastiality to a video game? isn't it enough that you can join the idiot woke crusade in the dd world why it has any place there is beyond me. everyone made such a big deal about 'spending hours in character creation'  then i got the game and just wondered to myself what the hell everyone is smoking  must be that fluoride in the water you pick on of five or six faces, add hair, add facial hair, makeup, scar all premade options, and then... get ready... you pick your genitals... if you want a  you have three choices,  is two. how anyone sat in the character creation for an hour, or two or three, is insanity. maybe people got excited because you can have a female, sorry, nonbinary with a full beard. or perhaps it was the amazing addition of vitiligo. people then rave about the visuals it looks like the same old engine used back in 2017... oh wait, it is that engine with a few tweaks. it gets the job done, but seriously, it's not setting any bars in that department. voice acting is on par with dos2. and the gameplay is on par with dos2. then you have the people freaking out that bg3 is now, get this, the highest rated game of 2023. i guess i was in another dimension because it's been pretty bleak in regards to interesting games being released. good for larian but be realistic. if hollywood puts out nothing but the same trivial crap like marvel and another liam neeson clone of taken, and someone releases something that was highly anticipated and it scores high on release, it's kind of a win by default out the gate. i get that i am in the minority, and massively so, but i just don't have larian's bit dripping out of my mouth that i failed to swallow and i don't drink the koolaid."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a once in a generation game. no micro transactions. no seasonal bs. no in game shop with 20 cosmetics. this is an example of what games should be in their purest state. the passion of this game burns so bright i cant remember the last time i was so enticed to spend 60 hours on the game and not even finish 14 of the content yet. not because had to go it slow, but because i wanted to explore every nook and cranny. this is one of the best games of all time and it sets the gold standard by witch i will compare every game going forward. larian studios is punching above their weight with this one. bloodydam fantastic. 10d10 out of 10"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"for how long this game was in early access, theres no excuse for how bad the character creation is. really embarrassing to make a dnd roleplaying game then give players no choice in making the character they're roleplaying as. i also don't think they added enough new characters. theres a couple, but its mostly the same as early access. who made the decision to cap levels at 12? this makes it challenging to multiclass effectively. i do think the combat system is pretty awesome, i like the different personalities and how they all have issues that the player doesn't necessarily like, it makes them seem more real. i like how choices affect gameplay. but that being said, i dont think this game really compares to dnd and i dont think theres any excuse to overlook things like basic character creation in a 2023 rpg. skyrim literally did a better job."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,an absolutely amazing adventure . i couldn't be happier playing it. the developers deserve a lot of praise.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,divinity original sin 3 is definetly goty potential. will try every character combination and build potential in the following years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i've never been a fan of rpg electronic games like baldurs gate, dragon age and so on. but this is the first title that i actually enjoyed playing. i have over 30 hours in my main save and i'm completely hooked by the narrative, the storytelling ad combat experience. i'm absolutely blown away by the game and i'm so happy that the folks at larian studios delivered a feature complete game with no micro transactions. having a game like this in modern days is like fresh air in the predatory environment that gaming has become nowadays. congratulations for this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"48 hours in and still in act 1. the game is nothing but a breath of fresh air in the rpg genre. so many options all over the place. character creation, classes, subclasses, races... then the world building , the characters and their stories, the multiple ways you can complete quests or enter areas... so much work and love put in this game from larian... a game company from gamers for gamers. you can literally feel the love the devs and writers have put in the game. i will return with a more in depth review at some point when i complete this journey for my first complete playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"amazing game with outstanding story, almost any interaction has the same level of care and attention, not a single game in this industry has surprised me as much as this one. no microtransactions or additional content to give you more to explore, everything is in it for the affordable price of the main game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,i played for 30 hours so far this is one of the best games i have played since baldur's gate 2 long long time ago it doesn't come with microtransactions that are overwhelming nowadays hope major companies learn from larian studios' success
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,simplesmente larian studios e o goty de 2023! joguei bastante de ea e  notvel a evoluo do jogo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the only reason this isn't a 1010 is because you can't change your appearance yet after you leave character creation. that's literally my only gripe, and i've put 5o hours into the game in less than a week while working a fulltime job."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,very good. very cool. very nice. very gamer. u will like it if u like it. if you don't then you will not.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"insane, utterly insanely good game. you like swords?  baldurs gate you like bows?  baldurs gate you like demons?  baldurs gate you want to fight to survive? baldurs gate you want your entire existence to revolve around a 20 sided dice? baldurs gate baldurs gate takes everything you want in a game, smushes it together and makes a masterpiece. da vinci himself would have wet himself with pure at the artistry on display in this game. my god i wish i could do it again. oh wait i can because the replayability is insane b a l d u r s. g a t e."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,i'm only partway through act 2 and already i feel the need to leave some positive words in a public forum. this game is a treasure. the depth of experience here is one of a kind. there are so many ways to play and express yourself  i'm at a loss for words. i feel lucky to be able to have something like this. it's been a breath of fresh air in this chaotic world. i haven't been this excited and then pleased with a game since my childhood. if you're on the fence about this game  don't be. jump in and have fun. there's only good to be had.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"excellent story telling, immersive, choices matter, great graphics, characters, just to keep it simple. reminds me of the older school rpgs that actually had soul think the original dragon age, earlier mass effects, etc. i bought this game with little expectation because of how games have been lately, now i'm blown away and addicted. it's been a long time since i stayed up til early morning playing something. this needs to be the norm in modern gaming. masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"finally a great rpg game for us! it's something that rarely happens during these days. especially in the personalizations offered to the player, and the multiple kind of approach that can let to the player the actual sense of control and strategies for the battles. adding an amazing plot with a phenomenal graphics to the mix, and you will cook a delicious desserts to taste. baldur's gate 3, with his whole structure hugely inspired by the classic dungeons and dragons, it's exactly what should be a great rpg game today. p.s. baldur's gate 3 is an awesome game that's just 20,000 times better, more layered, more fun, and enjoyable to play than that ff16 crap"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"not sure how, but somehow i didn't even see this game coming, and only really heard about it from friends. i have no regrets getting the game and have been having a great time with it. it even has a bit of nostalgia for me, reminding me of other dnd centric games that i played many many years ago. excellent story telling, gameplay engaging, and paced just right for me. i admit turn based may not be for everyone, but hey not everyone is perfect right? if you are new to dnd systems, the learning curve may be a bit intimidating, but never fear, there is plenty of help available online. worth every dollar."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the game is all that a crpg fan could dream of, and then more. the writing is superb, the voice acting is unparalleled, and the whole story is ripe with choice and consequence. me and my partner played separately and we both ended up playing a completely different game. it's just absurd how good this game is. i won't say it's the best game ever, because it's hard to tell with just one week since release, but it's definitely a genuinely amazing experience like no other i remember, and i'm old enough to have played bg1 and 2 when they were released."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i have finished the game no spoilers small rant about penultimate fight but wont reveal any characters or story baldur's gate 3, is a masterpiece, pure and simple, tons of replayability, customization and freedom for characters to do whatever they want within the confides of the game. the classes feel weighty and balanced, and the story is a roller coaster. pros strong cast of characters, with good humor serious emotional moments and compelling stories. diverse combat with multiple ways to go about tackling opponents. tons or replay ability. there are whole story lines companions and quests locked behind different paths. dnd elements actually mesh well with the crpg gameplay. the game looks spectacular. cons performance is sketchy, even after the driver update today. memory leak is a real problem for some people and i was sadly one of them. minor bugs and soft locks, save often! the penultimate fight is a slog. i hate the way its layered and no way to rest for 12 hours meaning you run out of spell slots real quick. it's just a boring fight all and all. mechanic in start of act 2 forces you to be in turn based mode for 30 minutes unless you have a torch, which probably you won't because why would you? the cons apart from memory leak are very minor which is why it gets a 910 for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i can't explain how much fun i'm having with this game... it's honestly my personal goty, and it feels really nice to play with friends too. i'll recommend this for any tabletop rpg dd mostly fan, it feels like a campaign. but i'll let you know, if you prefer action games, this might not be a good game for you."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"baldurs gate 3 is an unexpected rare gem  that in todays industry is a needle in a haystack, full of unfinished early access titles charging full retail aaa prices, amongst locking content behind further paywalls.. todays industry is also full of games that pose their product as a finished form of media, but in reality you're paying ridiculous prices to play a hidden early accessactive development title.. however, baldurs gate is completely different in every aspect, a game that promises and delivers entirely on a complete and finished experience from release, with one purchase and then everything in the game is present without further pay walls. baldurs gate 3 sets a high bar of standards when it comes to how far this industry has fallen, and how it should be. i am not one that is usually interested in table top games, but baldurs gate 3 mixes aaa cinematic experiences, with the strategic gameplay of a table top, and blends it masterfully to further immerse you into its rich and diverse world full of unique and interesting characters that stand out individually. its truly phenomenal work, and deserves all the love and praise it gets. the story is well written, with masses of side content that often distracts you from the main story line, without much notice being taken from said distraction, with how great a quality all the quests actually are all round.. the side quests often quality wise feel like their own main quests, short stories that has ever lasting effects and consequences to the world and story line going forward. its amazing. i actively encourage exploring! this game is amazing, and deserves this full score of 10. i do hope that they intend to explore expansions and dlcs that add more races, mixing races gimme the changeling!!! and more stories, companions, exisiting companion scenes, story and more. id love an expansion that continues the story beyond the endings, and allows you to face a new threat, or just explore the world again.. new game plus even.. as it  to say good bye to my character after the story ends. buy this game, worth every penny. and even then, by them actually priortitising a good product and fan service over greed, you feel more obliged to buying the additional content deluxe edition upgrade.. please release more in this in form of expansions p.. love the game, amazing story, amazing character, great writing, great voice acting all round.. truly earns the masterful seal of approval. which no game has earned in my eyes a ten in this decade. red dead 2 story came close with a 9."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the game is amazing and a worthy successor to baldurs gate 2, also its a full game with no microtransactions and that alone is worth supporting these days. oh and enjoy the free clown show on the negative review new accounts jealous this is way better than their microtransaction filled corporate trash game lmao"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"awesome game. it draws in its nonlinearity and variety of everything you can do. there is everything here, from stealthy and thoughtful passage to madness and rash decisions that will most likely complicate the game, but the game does not become less interesting. in general 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,one of the best games i've ever played. it reminds me of what bioware used to be.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,wellbuilt storyline. money instead of advertising and stars here actually went to the quality of the product. additionally. no paid dlc on release day. no microtransactions. no lootboxes even the recently fashionable politicalideological propaganda is not too intrusive.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"it's an oustanding rpg experience with player agency and world reactivity like never before. it's just great. and in some aspects, for a crpg, the game is innovative. p.s. i've read some negative comments and... plenty of people praising the game with a score of 0? don't forget the score before you post, people."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this game is a masterpiece. it manages to capture the fun and excitement of dungeons and dragons dnd 5th edition rules with the perfect tweaks needed for a computer game. while doing this, it expertly adds on to the story of the world from the tabletop version of dnd while incorporating the legacy of the two initial baldurs gate games. larian studios has simply created a masterpiece!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"larian did not disappoint. this game is in my opinion the best adaptation of dnd system there is. the system doesn't hold your hand, you can choose yourself how you want to play the game, with endless choices. what i also like is the heaviness of those choices. even things that don't seem important at first might impact your playthrough. with that comes a great multiple playthrough potential. you can choose if you want to be a knight in shining armor, saving everyone on your way to glory, or if you want to become the next funny mustache man, pillaging and murdering everyone you see. this is quite frankly the best crpg i've ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the best rpg ive played in a looong time. turnbased combat is not for everyone, but the level of depth in this game is incredible. dont pay attention to the haters who review bomb this masterpiece. try it out for yourselves."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,larian is easily one of the best gaming studios of all time. they just keep getting better. very happy for them and their accomplishments. cant wait to see what they have in store next
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,i just beat the game and am going back to start a new character because there is just so much stuff i have missed. its possible to spend 60 hours in the first act.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"not a good game, slowpaste and a rip off dnd. if you like dnd then enjoy this game but overall the game is average and nowadays people overhype wrong games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the game is fairly enjoyable, though it comes with numerous shortcomings that regrettably went unaddressed prior to its launch. it suffers from glitches, instability, and frequent crashes, especially in the later parts of the game. the first act stands out as its strongest aspect. during this phase, characters are introduced more effectively, the story setup is wellexecuted, and the overall experience is highly immersive. however, the quality of the writing noticeably declines in the second and third acts. this decline, coupled with the technical performance issues, makes it challenging to maintain the player's interest and motivation to continue playing. in summary, the game is still a commendable effort, but it would have greatly benefited from additional time for refinement and more attention to enhancing the writing in the subsequent acts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"larian studio shows the other greedy devs how to make a game when you are in with pashion! no microtransactions, no battlepass, no  just a solid game programmed with love and a heart i can throw goblins 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i am nearing 100 hours single player and 5 hrs multiplayer and i want to say this thing is a masterpiece. from the story to the characters and player agency in game, it scratches every rpg itch there is. the amount of flexibility and tools you have at your disposal to solve a problem or tackle an encounter is mind blowing. anyone who is afraid of jumping in worried about not playing the previous games, don't bother, it's not needed here. if you're still on the fence about it, i recommend checking any streamer or content on twitchyoutube. game of the generation this is. go support it you need."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the best dd rpg game for pc. awesome graphics, history and mechanic. the developers delivered a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"every time i login into baldur's gate 3 and play a session, i can't believe how good this game is. the npc character's that take the journey with you are as well fleshed out as any hollywood film actor's role. the voice acting is best i've heard ever in a game. the amount of ways a player can go about a situation is unparalleled in the genre. there is so much content it's easy to get overwhelmed, however the game gives the player tools to manage this well. jaw droppingly beautiful, high res cinematic moments are only a bonus. larian has just taken the crown to lead the crpg genre with their efforts. great drama and humor and excellent narrative make this the best crpg i've played in decades. baldur's gate 3 is game of the year. i'm calling it now."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,just play this game and lost in forgotten realms. amazing. masterpiece. thank you so much for creating this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"baldur's gate 3 is an unparalleled gem in my gaming collection. the freedom it offers isn't just about making choices, but about crafting a personal narrative that feels uniquely mine with every playthrough. the characters spring to life through stellar voice acting, making every interaction memorable. however, it's the captivating music and meticulous motion capture that truly weave magic, immersing me deeply in its fantastical realm. exploring the vast world is an adventure in itself. every nook and cranny seems to hold secrets, each corner beckoning with the promise of a new tale to be unfolded. the landscapes are not just visually breathtaking, but they resonate with stories, quests, and mysteries that are begging to be unraveled. playing multiplayer is reminiscent of those epic dd sessions with friends  a mix of strategy, camaraderie, and shared tales of valor. and the depth of content? staggering. but what truly gets my adrenaline pumping is the character progression. every level up feels like a triumph, ushering in new avenues of gameplay and strategies. in essence, baldur's gate 3 isn't merely a game for me. it's a continuously unfolding epic, an evergreen adventure that i deeply treasure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this game is phenomenal. there is a play style for everyone. it has drama, romance, action, great driving story. and it perfectly incorporates several familiar aspects for fans of dnd. i highly recommend this game to anyone who has the time to play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this game is everything i've been looking forward to since the beginning of early access. i don't want to put it down.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"mejor juego de lo que llevamos de ao. infinitas posibilidades, personajes carismticos, fantstica bso, magnfica accin... lo tiene todo, se nota cuando un desarrollador hace un juego con mimo y viendo lo que opina la comunidad. sin duda un 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"game of the decade. i don't say that lightly considering how incredible games have been these past few years. larian took high expectations and exceeded them. they are a heartwarming story of an underdog studio making a aaa game of all aaa games. there is so much quality in this game that it makes aaa studios look like kittens. i don't know why it's so difficult nowadays for most studios to deliver a complete game from the very beginning that focuses on the consumer experience rather than making money with things like dlc or unlock artificial experience blockers. larian didn't fall prey to the lootershooter facade where you need to collect tons of random gear that they can then force you to paytowin for the best. there is so much to do in this game but not like assassin's creed nonsense where you get inundated with side quests after side quests. there is so much hand crafted story telling, so many cutscenes, interactions, and reactions to who you are and the choices you make that it makes it feel like a real, breathing world. bg3 delivers an experience of the decade all for just one price while making other bigger studios look like amateurs. you can really tell this development team has such an amazing passion for making games and making the player enjoy the experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this is the best rpg i have played in a very long time. i personally preferred divinity original sin 2's combat, but everything else here is improved from visuals, story, quality of life, cutscenes, etc. this is a rare find in the modern gaming landscape and you are doing yourself a disservice if you are an rpg fan who does not try this. also, you do not need to know anything about dd to enjoy this game, the experience is even better if you do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"just a perfect game. thx, larian. somente um jogo perfeito. obrigado, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"phenomenal crpg and goty for me, probably even best of the last 5 years. 100 recommend to any gamer. really hope to see more great rpgs like this in the future!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"embarking on a journey through the realms of baldur's gate 3 has been nothing short of a captivating and exhilarating experience. as a passionate rpg enthusiast, i recently had the privilege of diving into the final release of the game alongside my friends, and the result was a truly unforgettable adventure that showcased the game's prowess in both storytelling and cooperative gameplay. from the very beginning, it was evident that baldur's gate 3 had transcended its early access phase and emerged as a polished masterpiece. the attention to detail in its worldbuilding and character development was immediately striking. every location we explored felt alive, teeming with both subtle nuances and grand landscapes that invited us to immerse ourselves fully. each character we encountered, whether ally or adversary, was intricately woven into the overarching narrative, adding depth to a tale that was as engaging as it was expansive. the heart of our journey, however, lay in the collaborative experience that baldur's gate 3 effortlessly facilitated. playing alongside my friends, we found ourselves strategizing, planning, and laughing as we delved into the game's intricately designed turnbased combat system. the battles were not just opportunities for victory, but canvases for creative problemsolving. we reveled in leveraging the environment to our advantage, capitalizing on each character's unique abilities, and triumphing through teamwork. these moments of shared achievement reinforced the idea that baldur's gate 3 is not just a game, but a conduit for strengthening the bonds between players. the game's departure from the early access phase was evident in its refined mechanics, seamless gameplay, and the assurance that the developer, larian studios, had paid heed to the invaluable feedback of its dedicated player base. it was clear that the journey from early access to final release had been a labor of love, resulting in a product that was meticulously crafted and enhanced with the player experience in mind. however, what truly resonated with me was the way baldur's gate 3 ignited a sense of camaraderie among my friends and me. the memories we forged, the challenges we conquered, and the stories we cowrote within the game's expansive universe will undoubtedly remain cherished for years to come. baldur's gate 3 had not merely entertained us it had united us in a shared narrative, weaving our personal tales into the grand tapestry of the game itself. in comparison to other rpgs, like the highly anticipated diablo 4, baldur's gate 3 stands tall as a testament to the genre's evolution. its gripping storytelling, meticulous worldbuilding, and emphasis on cooperative gameplay elevate it to a league of its own. while each game has its own merits, baldur's gate 3's ability to forge connections among players and offer a multifaceted experience is unparalleled. in conclusion, baldur's gate 3 is a triumph that surpasses expectations. as both an rpg enthusiast and a friend, i can attest to its ability to captivate, challenge, and unite players in a way that only exceptional games can. whether you're a fan of rich narratives, strategic gameplay, or simply looking to share an unforgettable journey with friends, baldur's gate 3 is an adventure you won't want to miss."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"baldurs gate 3 is a true genre defining masterpiece by an extremely talented and wellmanaged studio. it is difficult to find words because i am simply so blown away by the depth of both the game mechanics and the story. the amount of possible interactions in baldurs gate 3 is just unprecedented. i've been playing pc games and plenty of crpg's since 1994 but baldurs gate 3 takes the cake and is likely the best game i have played in my lifetime. take what you expect of tags such as choices matter, story rich or turnbased and add a multiplier and the end result will be baldurs gate 3. i hope that the gaming industry giants will thoroughly research both what makes baldurs gate 3 the game it is as well as what makes larian such an amazing studio. i believe the seeds of what would become the studio that could create baldurs gate 3 began already with the difficult financial situation larian was in before divinity original sin i and there's a lot of important lessons to unravel and learn from in how to foster a good culture within a gaming studio, how to lead and manage teams, how to technically develop games and how and when to listen to the community and the gamers. thank you so much larian for baldurs gate 3  you have created a truly special gem  that a lot of us will love and enjoy for a long time to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,un vrai chef d'uvre ! largement mrit et bravo a larian studios qui nous ont fait un jeu extraordinaire. une histoire captivante avec un gameplay ultra jouissif et addictif. pour moi actuellement c'est mon goty 2023 xd !!! on verra avec les prochains jeux s'il le reste.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,without doubt the best rpg i've ever played. it has such a nostalgic feel with modern gameplay enhancements. it has transcended genres and customer base to become an absolute must play for anyone.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"boring combat system. uninteresting companions. terrible location design. sjw. this is not a good rpg, but a marketing product."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this game is something very special. i will leave just one word outstanding.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,a majestic foray into what rpg's and aaa games should be. even the negative reviews are only positive information but people feeling its their duty to rate it lower cause trolling. stupid zelda fans
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a sheer masterpiece . a true project of passion that respects gamers time, money, and desire for quality. nearly every aspect of this game is evidence of a love for the craft as opposed to overt greed via bare minimum aspiration. this game is gorgeous, and the environments are varied. the companions are fascinating and extremely interesting and likeable. itemization is great, its actually fun to find magic items and learn about all the neat things they can do. freedom of choice is interwoven in to the very fabric of every fork in the road. combat is a bit slow, but extremely fun and interesting. they nailed the feeling of 5e dd. the game is mindboggingly repayable as every narrative choice has the potential of profoundly changing entire outcomes of the game as you play on. in an age where everything needs to have a shallow battle pass progression system, overpriced cosmetic store, paytowin mtx, and treadmill gaming where you feel like you're going in circles without any actual meaningful content to make it worthwhile, this game feels like an absolute unicorn, and it's sad, because just 1520 years ago, this type of game was the expected norm. of course no game is perfect, and there are some minor blemishes here, but i honestly wish i could give this game 1110. larian deserves it, and the game industry needs to take note. i sure hope they keep hitting it out of the park. they feel like the old blizzard and bioware used to feel like when every game release was a massive legendary banger. do yourself a favour and buy this game, and while you're at it go back and try the divinity series as they are also fantastic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,best game i played in years. worthy of the baldur's gate title indeed! it is also uncommon these days to get a full product with no microtransactions that works out of the box. well done to larian

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i heard about this game a few years ago, i didn't touch the early access version, i played it now for the first time when it was released, i didn't know anything about it, i didn't watch videos about it either. i can say hands down that this game is amazing! i can't remember when i enjoyed a game like this before, and i am sure this is the best rpg i ever played. there are some annoyances in the game, that camera problem in combat and some other small things that gets frustrating sometimes, but rest of it is just perfection. the voice actors is incredible and the emotions that radiates from the characters are amazing. if there was no annoying glitches and if there was an a.i option for companions, this game would have been a 10 out of 10 for me. i can highly recommend this game, if you are a fan of slow paced and story driven rpg, it will be a huge loss for you not play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i dont even like turn rpg games, but im very addicted to this game. you can do everything you want"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"minor graphical glitching, and possibly other little launch hiccups, but overall it was playable from release. the game mechanics feel well fleshed out. the branching paths and customization should lead to insane replayability. it produces stories you can tell your friends how you tackled something in the game. it looks good, and well acted. i am not that far yet to know how much time i could spend on a playthrough, but i likely won't finish because i have little time to put into games these days, but it's still great if you can only put in an hour at a time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"the hype around this game feel like cyberpunk all over again, in the end it was a bad game, same like this one. hype culture its a cancer right now. bg3 its bad, from gameplay, writing, graphiclook good only in cutscenes and the characters, everything else look like a ps4 game from 2016. even with so many flaws, somehow got a 96? while games who are hard and focus more on gameplay got a 78 system shock"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this game really has rekindled a childlike spirit of adventure in gaming that i thought i may not obtain again in my later years. this has everything you'd hope to expect in a modern triplea title graphics, lighting, voice acting at a high level, but then has none of the things you'd dread to expect here's looking at you, microtransactions. the real magic here though comes in the form of an evolving narrative and player agency on a level that would only be rivalled by previous larian studios titles. i have lost count of the amount of times i have tried to catch the game out or tried an odd solution to solve a problem only to be greeted by cutscenes or voice acted dialogue lines that perfectly fit to what had just transpired. this shows the passion and thought that the team have put in with every such instance being like a we knew you might try that nod from the developer. first ever review posted on metacritic. sometimes you just have to tell people when something is that good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"despite a few bugs at launch, it's an excellent rpg, with turnbased combat as good as dd, good graphics and a story with many variations... your gameplay will be unique according to your choices and that's too good!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"such a damn good game! minor inventory organization stuff like possible a partition solution could do but its a complete game so far. 24 hrs game time i would fully recommend this game! major studios take note, lose the greed and follow this foot steps"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"absolute fing masterpiece. in your face blizzard, thats how you make aaa game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"77 hours exploring act 1 and playing with friends. this game is it, no doubt about it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,a true rpg in every sense of the term. it gives you choices with a aspect of randomness that will effect your entire experience. this hits the mark that the vast majority of rgps miss and sets a new standard for gaming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,one of the best games ever made. everything about this game is pure perfection.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"just the perfect emulsion of a lot of perfect things. this game is the next step of rpgs, while still maintaining the feel of larian games i love since i played divinit 2 ego draconis in 2011. regarding responsive worlds there is no better game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"can someone explain how some people gave this game 1010 next day after launch? thoe type of games crpg's are long, i am talking about 100 hours at least. overall the game its bad, it has nothing to do with the old games, only locations and some characterscompanions for example. gameplay its turn based 5e, that's a bad system from the start, people who played know what i am talking about, second no real time, so big encounters are going to be a pain, because you need to wait for x number of enemies to move until you can. writing made something like fallout 4 look like deux ex. ironic writing and reddit type of humor, make your eyes roll out every 5 min. companions are bad, the only decent ones are gale and wyll, the old companions don't count. if this game its a masterpiece, that would explain why the gaming industry its in the toilet right now"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this game is the essence of rpg. it has improved in every aspect from the previous work. strong candidate to threaten zelda and starfield at this year's goty awards.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"keep in mind that i'm a devoted fan of the baldur's gate series and larian's work as well. my expectations were skyhigh, yet the game managed to not only meet but exceed them. additionally, i find the adaptation of the intricate dd mechanics into a computer game format, while still being accessible to newcomers, to be an impressive feat achieved by larian. i can't express enough how much i adored the game. it resonated perfectly with my expectations and even managed to surprise me in the best possible ways."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"aprs 45h de jeu et un act1  peine termin... je reste compltement abasourdi devant le degr de finition du jeu, la richesse du monde et des interactions... et le doublage !! il est juste incroyable ! tout est cohrent. chaque qute est intressante et on ne regrette jamais d'avoir pris plusieurs dizaines de minutes pour tenter un truc ou se perdre en chemin. c'est simple  mme si le jeu s'arrtait juste l pour moi, ce serait dj de loin mon jeu de l'anne et dieu sait que j'ai aim totk.... la plus grosse claque pour moi depuis gta5. un grand bravo et merci aux devs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,larian did it again! outdid themselves again! this is a masterpiece! alone or with friends! enjoy!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,its reminiscent of the old baldurs gate while being fresh and dynamic! and absolute masterwork!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"larian has done it again, one of my favorite rpgs of all time was dos2, and now they have made an even bigger and better rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"es impresionante.. hacia demasiado tiempo que no la pasaba tan bien con un vi9deojuego,, creo que estamos ante el mejor juego de rpg de la historia"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"larian voulait faire la suite d'une lgende... ils l'ont fait et c'est lgendaire. un digne successeur de baldur's gate 1  2 modernis et une claque  tous les soit disant rpg sortis ces dernires annes proposant des choix. nous y retrouvons le plaisir de mass effect, jedi the old republic ou witcher mais avec une libert d'incarnation du personnage que nous souhaitons tout bonnement incroyable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this is the best rpg i've played in years! works at launch no microtransactions no day 1 dlc fun replayability great gameplay looks amazing this is the first preorder i haven't regretted. i preordered no man's sky and came to love it after a couple years of updates from the devs, anthem we all know how that went, some call of duty game, and something else. the point is, this is huge. not only did they sell a game, they finished a game. which is more than can be said for the last ten big games i have bought. that's no fault of the studio, i'm guessing it's the ceos at the top trying to appeal to the investors by getting the product out as soon as possible. i truly appreciate the hard work that went into this game, it's a breath of fresh air. the aaa games that have been coming out these last few years are disappointing at best. with elden ring and god of war ragnarok being exceptions. studios like ubisoft, activision, ea, and bethesda have been putting out some really lackluster games. that's not the studio's fault, it's the executives that only want to make a profit from these games. and it's extremely prevalent. i hope this game's success shows those companies what we want out of a 8090 game. cad i'm going to be enjoying this game for a long time. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i never played a baldur's gate game before nor dd. however, this game is top notch! i'm about 26 hours into it so far and i'm loving every minute of it. i'm 99 sure bg3 will end up as my goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"masterpiece. only 3 problems  dd mechanics are not so fun in a videogame, most are counter intuitive and boring.  mute heroes in dialogues.  you must create a custom character to join a party in multiplayer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"it's a masterpiece, larian confirm it's one of the best studios around. thank you larian for elevating the rpg genre again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"phenomenal. captures the essence of dnd in the best ways possible, emphasizing the rp in rpg. insanely large in scope for a game of its quality and price. a must play for any fantasy rpg lover."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,masterpiece  i cant wait to explore the world of it again in the coming weekend
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this is the best game i have ever played alongside disco elysium. easily the best rpg of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"tried it because i loved bg1 and 2. not a dd player. looks fantastic, voice acting is great, stories are compelling, puzzles challenging though you will probably have to google a couple, combat super satisfying. also huge. that's the rest of my life gone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i love games from lariana and baldura gate 3 is no exception. great crpg with puzzly combat, amazing exploration and great story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed witcher 3, when you start playing you have no idea when the day ended."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i was also very disappointed by baldur's gate 3, as some other reviews have already well explained. i thought i'd get a sequel to some of my favorite games. i got a completely different game, supposedly the best rpg forever, but stopped playing only after a few hours because it wasn't my type of game, although many of my favorite games are storyheavy rpgs with tactical gameplay. for example baldur's gate 1 and 2, icewind dale 1 and 2, planescape torment, wasteland 3 why is this called baldur's gate? if you want to make something new, why not also call it something new and independent? 3 points i'd like to add  combat in the original games took 510 minutes. bg3's encounters drag on way too long for what they are, some take more than an hour, missing the social interaction you would have playing a tabletop rpg. in comparison, baldur's gate 1 and 2 used the computer as a means to faithfully realize the vision of dd dd's rules say that one round equals 6 seconds in which all characters act. that's how you normally imagine the action sitting at a table and how dms tell the story. the tabletop experience is turnbased out of necessity. a limitation a computer isn't bound to.  the inventory management is very cumbersome. there's too much loot you don't know if it's trash or not and it takes a lot of time to sift through.  glitchy performance and a lot of frame drops on my system in comparison to all other current games i've played which run fine. suddenly, larian was not only painted as the underdog fighting against big evil publishers. no, it was attacked for having developed the best rpg of the decade, a singularity. so much is true might have been the best social media marketing of the year. there is no opinion, however absurd, which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can be brought to the conviction that it is generally adopted. example affects their thought, just as it affects their action. they are like sheep following the bellwether just as he leads them. schopenhauer in conclusion bg3 indeed is a phenomenon considering its marketing and the impact social influencers had within the last two months."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,such a great game for rpg fans. the quests are so good and there are no microtransactions or battle passes!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,played about 90 hours. it is an amazing rpg that i was waiting for so many years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i am an old gamer, so old that i played bg1 the day it was released. i did the same with bg2, and that is still my favourite game of all time. still, i didn't expect much from bg3, i didn't play the early access, i didn't even pay much attention. perhaps because i didn't want to risk the memories being somehow tainted by a game of the same name that didn't live up to expectations. but being around the gaming community, it was impossible to overlook the hype of course. so i thought, at least give it a try. very good decision.  from the fist minute this game did something strange, something that is rare in our time, it exceeded my expectations. and so i can say, it is a worthy successor of bg2 and one of hell ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"it's a 410 for me. it is not baldur's gate rather it is a divinity original sin 3 in a supposed dd forgotten realms setting. it should be named anything else than baldur's gate, the name was used to draw attention of fans of bg1 and bg2 also iwiw2 fans along but it's a totally different game. also if it would be named like that i would just simply avoid buying it so probably that was the plan  squeeze some money based on nostalgia. the combat is dull, takes too much time, even the simplest encounters are spread to several minutes yes i know it's based on tabletop dd which is turn based bla bla bla ... that supposed swarm mechanics is not working as it was advertised. game is totally out of any form of balance  it's more of a dd based dark souls with very heavy emphasis on tactics like a jagged alliance game would be. you party is mostly on a disadvantage and heavily outnumbered  which is infuriating at lower levels where your mage and cleric are put down like dogs in the 1st 2 turns of combat, the enemies can dash from any distance to your party while your characters can barely do 5 steps. party composition is not the best  if you think about this later on in the game you're very limited to your character and you need to disband one of the interesting characters larian created cause your party composition will be bad or you will miss out on some opportunities, fail some crucial dice rolls due to doing ability checks that are not proficient with which results in spamming quick save  quick load which breaks the game feel for me. the rewards for completing fights loot and gear are in 95 of cases, worthless and pathetic. most of the items that you find do ot benefit you like you would like it to be  you don't feel your characters gaining power. still they get the same ass whooping from all directions like before. also in the gameplay what i don't like is that i'm constantly going forwards and forwards and forwards with the main story line. there's no rest, there's no such thing like having a stop, going to a tavern, getting some quests and getting new good gear and decent xp as rewards. no. seems that from dungeons  dragons we did not get the dungeons to explore point of reference would be the bg2 once you leave the 1st dungeon to athkatla and there's a whole game world waiting for you. during exploration, almost everywhere you go there are op enemies that outnumber you so again there's something wrong with the game balance not to mention enemies that roll with 600 or 300hp once you're like 6th or 7th level. i don't even want to write about the skills and the dice rolls ... it's infuriating and spamming the quick saveload breaks the feel of the game. advantages are  charactersparty members lae'zel, shadowheart,  graphics  animations,  overall optimization,  some parts of the world some are not  no spoilers,  a lot of voice interactions even if an npc has 1 line of text  it's voice acted,  music is quite ok. most of the stuff is very good but for me the show stopper are the things listed below  boring and dull combat system with not working what was advertised  balance of the game including party composition of 4  rewards, xp and gear is weak  no sort of a sandbox where you can skip out of the main story and get some better gear and level up map exploration doesn't count cause you' low levellow hp while enemies are tougher, in higher numbers and you're dead most of the time  it shouldn't be named baldur's gate, it's not a sequel  that's a money grab nostalgia tactic"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,it has been long time since i enjoyed playing a game so much. its a masterpiece !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"overhyped game again, like cyberpunk. a big red flag for me was when the marketing was 80 about romances and character creation instead of gameplay. crpg's are about gameplay and adventure, who cares how good my character look or about romances? only people who play those type of games for romancescharacter creation and nothing else. the gameplay its turn based instead like the old ones in real time, turn based for something like this its boring, you need to wait in turns for each enemy to move, so have fun fighting 10 enemies over and over again and waiting for their turn, i am not saying turn based games are bad, xcom its very good, but for crpg's its a bad idea. writing its cringe, i don't use that word a lot, but its the true, romances and s4x scenes are there just for marketing and to bait people into playing the game, they serve no purpose for the game. overall this game its an insult to the old games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"impressionante como esse jogo conseguiu minha ateno, nunca fui de jogar rpg de mesa nem sigo o universo de dd dei uma chance para este jogo e ele conseguiu me fazer vibrar a cada vitria em batalha, lotear o inimigo aps a vitria  gratificante. fazer a estratgia e cuidar cada detalhe do seu grupo, o jogo est lindo e bem feito. estou empolgado com esse jogo como nunca antes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i really can't believe this game is real. larian studios manages to make the rpg genre shine again in a masterly fashion. oh gosh, it's a masterpiece. one of the few remaining studios to respect the video game medium in an exemplary way, and it feels great. congratulations to the teams, and many thanks for all your hard work. i'll be playing this game for years to come!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"absolutely amazing for an rpg. the best thing about it is the absence of microtransactionspaywalls and the abundance of content, all of it extremely polished and very, very enjoyable. even better with friends or for finding new ones while you play! it's absolutely refreshing to play and not feel screwed over for monetary benefit by the developers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"best game of 2023, amazing, no microtransactions, the devs really care for the game, amazing world, incredible characters, awesome writing baldurs gate 3 is simply the best the rpg can give in a game"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"graphics  1010 the graphics in baldur's gate stand out as one of the game's strongest features. special mention goes to the eldrich blast animation  a visual treat so mesmerizing and detailed that you can spend hours watching it unleash its force upon foes. lighting, shadows, and textures are all executed at the highest level, adding to the immersion in the game's world. gameplay  1010 baldur's gate offers something unique and daring in the gameplay arena. one example is the ability to gain a goddess's blessing through bdsm practice. this unusual mechanic adds depth and complexity to the character and opens new horizons for exploring the game's world and culture. where else can you find such a bold and original feature? story and world  1010 the plot of baldur's gate is intricate, multifaceted, and captivating. every character has a story, and the world is steeped in legends and myths. all of this creates a living, dynamic universe that you'll want to immerse yourself in again and again."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"wietna gra, dawno si tak dobrze nie bawiem. rozgrywka zachwyca swoj prostot mimo rozbudowanego systemu, wystarczy pomyle i mona rozegra walk lub dialog na wiele sposobw."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i loved divinity original sin and divinity original sin 2. as such, my expectations were quite high, just not as high as what baldur's gate 3 came to be. best rpg ever, period."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,just amazing game! so much depth and player choice. amazing graphics. must play!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"hasta ahora con aproximadamente 25 hrs de juego, est llenando ese vaco que me dej mass effect y baldursgate 2 si, jugu la saga original. llevo tiempo sin jugar un juego que me atrap tanto. el estudio me dej sin palabras con la forma de iterar decisiones, es una locura las formas en que puedes desarrollar las misiones y como ests afectan la trama. no s cmo saldr starfield,pero para m bg3 es goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"well worth the wait. its not the same a sitting around the table with your friends, but its a good substitution. people are reporting some bugs ruined save games and such, but i havent encountered any, so far. im still in act i. graphics are good, but not amazing. however, thats not the main point of this game. still, theyre a lot better than previous larian games, so thats nice. gameplay. for some people this will be a game thats too slow. turnbased isnt for everyone. i like it though. if youre a fan of such games, then bg3 will be a great experience. ui. a bit clunky at times. characters sometimes walk into traps they spotted earlier. spellcasting can be difficult in the beginning of the game. but once figured out, its easy to use. story. not the most surprising story out there, especially if youve been reading fantasy books and have been playing dnd since the eighties, but its well written and entertaining. environment is well designed, recognizable from previous sword coast environments. and when theres an encounter, its easy and advisable to use the environment to your advantage i have the high ground. all in all, i really like this game. theres room for improvement, so thats why i only give it a 9 out of 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"70 hours in in act 3. didn't played ea, cos i found that waiting for the story for 2 years was too painful with original sin 1 and 2. all and all, it's an okay game, entertaining when i don't have to dig through reddit for a way to solve a bug. certainly not the 1010 game people made it out to be. pro  characters and writing are very, very good. interesting cast all around.  combat is very tactical and very satisfying when you outsmart the enemies, as it is to be expected from larian.  builds are fun and respec is so cheap you can experiment to your heart content.  the world is beautiful, big, and engaging. i search every nook and cranny and usually i find something interesting waiting for me. cons  bugs and glitches. loads of them. especially beyond act 1. my act 2 last boss cutscene glitched out so bad i couldn't tell what was going on.  autosaves are pretty much useless cos they are so few and far in between. drove me to f5 like a mad person.  ingame cinematics are... really awkward. you can tell it's not larian's strong point and it shows, but they've managed to draw my attention to other good things in original sin, but in this game, it's the complete opposite. camera works are very amateur. the conversation cutscene is alright but when the actions happen it's really, really awkward.  i don't know if my game was bugged or not but in act 2, dialog options and npcs' lines do not reflect the consequence of my action at all. people talked about dead people as if they are still alive. minor act 2 spoiler here but i am keeping it as vague as possible. there is this place that totally got destroyed as a consequence of a battle gone wrong, and never once i saw a dialog option that recognizes it apart from the one dialog immediately following said event. it is an important event that should diverge how quests that tied to it play out. consider my experience ruined."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i would say this is as close as you can get to free form dungeons and dragons in videogame form. the game is grand in scope and has so many nuances and interesting mechanics. i'm new to dnd and crpg but this presentation of it has me instantly hooked. hoping for an amazing story with deep lore and characters. a standing ovation is deserved for everyone at larian studios for the way they chose to handle this release, especially in the current landscape of the gaming industry. you can really feel the passion and fun permeate through the game, enjoy!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"firstly, i am not the type to write game reviews, but this game is too good for me not to. after only 30 or so hours, i can confidently say that this is without a doubt, one of the best rpgs i have ever played. larian has done it again, raising the bar so high for the genre while singlehandedly shifting crpg mainstream, and that is no small feat. the game is right up there with the likes of kotor and the original bgs, and personally i think it may have even surpassed them all. the story so far has been captivating, the voice acting incredible, the writing amazingly written, the characters very interesting, and the gameplay second to none. the game also looks stunning. in the past i have played many rpgs that have branching plots, multiple paths to take and ways to deal with situations, but in bg3 everything just feels so natural and perfectly woven together. the amount of time and effort that went into developing this game is truly staggering. larian is now my favorite studio alongside rare. this is what gamers want in 2023. a lengthy but gamer focused development, a smooth launch with perfect technical performance, zero microtransaction  and most importantly, a team of passionate people doing what they believe in. kudos to swen and larian. in my opinion, they are now a top dog in the gaming industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"an absolute banger. this game was created with so much love and passion for rpgs and dnd, and just fun gaming. the developers made this the priority over being greedy and it paid off. great job!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"es una obra maestra, tanto para la gente que jugamos dd, como para los que no lo han jugado nunca. si te gusta la fantasa y el roleo, este va a ser tu juego por excelencia. bueno una infinidad de horas para explorar el mundo y pasarte el juego. es 100 rejugable gracias a todas sus diferentes clases, razas, tipos de personajes y dilogos si lo logras acabar jeje. ni una sola micro transaccin. unos increbles grficos y una msica espectacular. puedes jugarlo solo, donde tendrs una inmersin increble y muchos sentimientos encontrados a la hora de tomar decisiones, o jugarlo con amigos lo que sern todo risas y posiblemente acabis quemando aldeas enteras y exterminando a toda su gente. malo la facilidad de guardar rpido la partida antes de cada toma de decisin. con esto me refiero, a que quieras o no, acabars cogiendo mucho cario a tu personaje, y tendrs que tomar decisiones muy complicadas, y puedes perder un poco de la emocin de tirar dados, si guardas cada dos por tres antes de cada decisin. escribo esto, por poner algo malo. conclusin"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"masterpiece said someone on metacritic 1 day after launch for a game where you need 100 hours to finish it the game has many problems, from the writing, boring and long gameplay need to wait for each enemy to do his turn, if you fight 10, have fun  garbage companions, the only good ones are the ones from old games, but that don't count. overhype again, like cyberpunk"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,what can i say wrong about this game. absolutely nothing bad. only good things such as tons of cinematics. epic battles. exploration. crafting. good classes design. endless possibilities.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"this is a gem and im so thankfull that larian studios show how it should be to make games for gamers. i love every aspect of bg3 and im forever grateful that we can see such a perfect release and treatment from a puplisherstudio like yours. thank you larian studios love you guys ! my goty ! ps attention rockstar, blizzard, ea, ubisoft, bethesda, insomniac, naughty dog, sony, and all other publishers and studios, see? this is how you truly show appreciation to your customersgamers and earn genuine admiration and financial success. it's about time to rethink your strategies and embrace a more ethical approach. put an end to the excessive reliance on microtransactions and steer away from predatory and anticonsumer practices. we have enough!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,thanks to larian and their team for this wonderful masterpiece . same as every other person who knew this game was coming out i wasn't expecting it to blow up because of how niche a genre it was though i was going to play it and i know this game is going to be dear to me forever. just mind blowing. it's not easy for me to get immersed in a game but bg3 has done that to a level i wasn't expecting. it reminds me so much of the old bioware games. i'm not a dd guy but so i don't know how this game will feel for people who played the old bg games or the board game but i can say that people who know nothing about those games will most likely love this game. the only thing that might push some people away is the isometric view and the turn based combat. which i love and can't imagine playing this game any other way. definitely my game of the year. once again thanks to larian and their devs and also the community who helped in the early access since 2020.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"a genre defining, expansive rpg in the vein of dragon age origins, dnd 5e edition. larian does incredible work, and this is their masterpiece so far"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"fantastic game that builds on all that made dos2, but adds so much more your head will spin"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"it's a perfect game. every detail of the world and characters are carefully looked after. for being on early access for so long, nearly nil technical issues. i'm having a great time with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"the game is excellent. the only problem is that god damn  more if you want to see above a floorsurface.  walking is so slow, they need to add a fast camera speed up the game to go to point 1 to 2. the ai can be very cheap. but the reply value is incredible. i hope they make tons of dlcs and ways for us to make our maps, events, missions and spellsabilities. woot!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,absolutely breathtaking experience. game of the decade for me and it isn't even close.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this game takes rpgs to a whole next level, from the great turnbased combat to the variety of ways you can approach situations, i think there is enough stuff there for 5 or even 10 runs. a must play gem!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,absolutely masterpiece !!! noone in the industry do the games like larian. this should be standard imho for all other developers. eapeaially for blizzard whi dissapointed me with d4
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"one of the best games i've ever played, the depth to the combat, the items, the story, the world, the graphics, all the little interactions, fun solo, fun with friends, challenging if you want, etc. highly recommend, especially if you enjoyed div 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"apparentrly a great portion of players have all lost their minds no progression a system of magic twisted and completely unbalalanced with all cothers classes and the worst a complete combat system based on cheated dice roll for the ia and characters and monsters controlled by the computer, the 3 difficulty correspond with 3 dset of so called random roll dices, all combat is controlled by cheated roll dice , the tactical is completely wzasted by cheated roll dice. no set of equipement fo characters , 20hours to achievce lvl5 seriously, no decent set of equipement, all the univers is wasted by convoluted and cheated combat...pure garbage"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"baldurs gate is terrible for game developers no longer will the game developers have an excuse for why their game  and is full of microtransactions. they have had their a firmly handed to them by larian studios who is spanking them and asking who is your daddy? this is easily the best rpg that has released in 2 decades and you can tell was made with love, care, and genuine respect for gamers everywhere. with an amazing story that captivates you and has you constantly asking yourself what is happening behind the scenes, phenomenal companions that each feel like their own person who you want to learn everything about, to the streamlined mechanics that feel as smooth as butter. other game developers should feel embarassed that they have been so thoroughly outclassed. all aaa games by big studios should be on this level of quality, but their laziness and greed has held them back to the realm of mediocre. shame on every large developer that isn't larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"it's a good game. yes i know, it's a good game. this is without a doubt a good game. how do we support such a good game? we buy the good game. i wonder when we'll get another good game. it's definitely worthy of being a good game. let us all pray for another it's a good game.."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"if this game doesn't get the 2023 goty, it's going to be a huge injustice the affection that larian studios put into it is evident in every detail, it is simply impressive."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this game rocks! the sheer amount of detail is incredible. my wife and i play this each evening using a laptop with xbox controllers on our living room tv. the integration was done extremely well. we find ourselves discussing possible builds, strategies, and ideas throughout the day. just waiting to be able to play again. we are already planning out how to tackle our 2nd playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"really good,cant stop playing it! time flies fast,fun every corner,well done developers,i can see the passion..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,very good game. this along with elden ring are proving big business game developers wrong. i do wish you could have 6 party members and get to level 20. seems an odd choice to limit these things in a dd game....
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i fell for the hype and purchase this game because i wanted to see what all the fuzz about after seeing it do breaking numbers on steam. i have played it for over 40 hours and feel like i can make my review on it on metacritic. anyways to start the review, this is a game for boomers. has that old windows 98 feel like playing morrowind, you will get lost alot. old school feel, it felt like i was in the bc era as i was playing it. turn base check. why is this game turned based? its 2023 not the 90's. turn based is something that needs to completely die so gaming can reach its next level. the only thing keeping turn base alive are boomers because their fingers cant play a real game without getting arthritis. just like boomers are holding back the world, boomers are holding back video games with their outdated mindsets and refusing to adapt. you can see this when they whine and cry when a game is not turn based but log in their metacritic accounts to give a 10 score to their favorite game being turn base like this one. showering it with nonstop praise like if they were playing ocarina of time for the first time back in the 90's. now to sum up my review. 00 overrated outdated boomer trash. final fantasy 16 was way better than this junk."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,absolutely fantastic game experience. thank you sven and team. i am already cant wait bg4 or dos3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"owned since early acess released in 2020, and am 19 hours into my full release playthrough, and i love it! one of the best rpgs i've ever played. the player freedom reminds me of playing the og fallout games from '97 and '98."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"bg3 is just a proper, outsanding masterpiece . a project that took 6 years made by a rare, classy and passionate video game studio, who not only have the expertise of making rpgs, but to also to listen and relying with the community to make what we are witnessing right now. larian studios had done it again, and this the breakout that they needed and deserved. this game will be remembered as one of the all time best modern games around, and definitely will set the new standard of rpgs. this is really a love letter for not only dd fans, but the oldschool gaming and rpgs in general. god bless, larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"masterful game, if you want it to be more imersive or action oriented, fix the camera using the options and map 'w' to be forward, it will be closer to a witcher 3 type of exploration. keep in mind it's still a great tabletop rpg simulation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,one of the best games of the year. the new gold standard for rpg's and an obvious competitor to zelda for game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this game has made me realize that i need to give isometric andor turn based combat video games a chance. also, it's been quite a few years since i've had to debate whether or not i'm going to call in sick to work just so i can keep playing a video game. this game is easily in my top 5 all time and something i will most likely end up putting 400 hours into. 105 hours so far and counting. if you're a fan of rpg's but don't like isometric andor turn based combat video games, i still highly recommend giving this game a chance. buy it on steam, make a character quickly, and just play for an hour."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,father of role playing games. i have nothing to say other than perfect. biggest game of the year nominee.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"hey finally a good game the next big step after elden ring towards the gaming industry to become better. no micro transactions, tons and tons of content, very few bugs, a complete game!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,this is the defenition  rpg. every developer that wants to develope any kind of rpg should take a close look.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,fun game and a fantastic product. they rolled a 20. baldur's gate 3 is a critical success!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"you know, once every 10 years or so there's a game that shake the trees. i was blown away by the witcher 3 wild hunt, a game that introduced me to the open world rpg genre. now 8 years later i discover baldur's gate 3 and my first dd experience. i'm like 40 hours into the game and i guess close to the end of the first chapter yes, there's quite a steep learning curve for a novice like myself but what a blast this is! everything in this game is topnotch the voice acting, the narrative, the graphics, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the cutscenes, the possibilities... and so on. just wooooow !!! all my respect for the people i should call them artists who made this. larian studios from belgium, hail to you. thank you."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"goty! best game of the year, there's no one, if it doesn't win the award it's because it was bought by another studio"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,this game has become a classic. thank you larian studios for the new standard rpg
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"the game is beyond expectations. the goblins are so likeable. i've resurrected and interrogated nearly every corpse i've encountered. i've forced shadowheart to switch classes to a shadow monk  much more befitting imo because there's only room for one trickery cleric in this group. i've permanently lost several companions sorry gale, but a true friend is someone you can trust with all your secrets and i can already imagine 10 other ways i'm going to play through this game. i hope armored core gets delayed..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"great successor to the original series. stunning cinematics. story that provides depth. satisfying combat. a game that makes you feel like they respect your intelligence. it makes you feel like its not dumbed down for the masses, ald at the same time isnt overly complicated either. a lot of spells, but no one says you have to use all of them if you dont want to. choices have consequences. will be playing for a long time. contrast with the letdown d4 just proved to be could not be greater."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,so much to do and experience. the dialogue is amazing and with quicksave you can experience every line if you wish. game is a winner. larian studios just knocked it out of the park into space.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"jogo do ano, obra prima feita com carinho, cada detalhe e lugar que voc entra no jogo com historia e detalhes incrveis"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"a modern masterpiece delivering old school crpg brilliantly. it brings back all the memories from the times when rpg games were the best. what makes me laugh is idiots giving this game score 0 for being a true crpg, because apparently it's too slow, too strategic, with dice rolls, blah blah. go play fortnite and let others enjoy this type of game. it's like me going to play fortnite or apex legends and giving it 0 for being too shallow, too fast and too primitive"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"absolutely incredible game. truly reminds me that games are still art, and i hope it reminds other devs this too"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,i implore you to play this game even if you don't think you'll enjoy turnbased battle systems. this is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,this game is so good that it made me buy 1 and 2 plus ill probably but the third one on my ps5 as well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i'll start with the basics i'm a big fan of the neverwinter series of games in particular and the dungeons  dragons universe in general. neverwinter nights and its addons still fascinate me in terms of story, characters, and gameplay. i am a happy owner of all the previous games in the baldur's gate series, so if anything, i understand what it's all about. baldur's gate 3 is a truly artificial product that comes out once in a decade and only when fans of quality rpgs are lucky. roleplaying system, variability, lore, character development, graphics, combat system, chemistry between characters, dice, etc. these are all things that make this product worth choosing. to all those who give it 10 out of 10, i have no questions. for those who give it 9 out of 10, you need to play more. ps and i haven't even mentioned the friendship with a bear and the possibility of getting a dog."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"just a masterpiece. enjoying every aspect of this real rpg. the combat, the decisions, the dice, the narrative and more and more. its a real dream come true for all rpg fans!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"there is so much good i can say about this game in every aspect that would take me more than 5k characters. its a 1010 period, and my personal goty so far, after 47 hours i can say i am addicted hard to this game, i didnt played the early access, any baldur's gate or dd game before this, i like rpgs in general but never tried these games, the closest i played similar in some ways was all the dragon's age saga. if you like turn based rpg this is a must in your life, if you are broke and cant afford it right now at full price, just go the jack sparrow way and when the price is on offer or you can afford it, please buy it if you liked and enjoyed it, this devs pour love and pasion into this game, and you can see it from the first hour playing it. its amazing the work and effort put behind this game and in top of that no microtransactions at the date of this review, i hope this age well. this is not a game, this is a life experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"about 50 hours in, and am having an absolute blast. larian has clearly learned a lot from their previous games, and it really shows here."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"it has been ages since i have not been disappointed with preordering a game in recent years. baldur's gate 3 is the first one in recent memory i am happy with completely. in last 50h of play i have encountered whole 2! bugs, nothing gamebreaking. larian studios have done an amazing job at interpreting the 5e system for crpg setting. i fully recommend you try this brilliant game yourself."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"good history and artistic works but the combat style isn't the best for me, bit i consider that someone that likes the genre could have a good experience"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i've played many games like that, but often i was bored or just i wasn't engaged in them too much. with baldurs i feel like i am wasting time writing this review because i could be playing it more rather than do stuff like that. so yeah, go play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,i signed up just to rate this game with 10 points. this is madness. my review is over.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,i have been waiting for this game forever and it has delivered in all categories and some!! game of the year!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"jogo tem nada inovador, porem a liberdade de escolhas e historias que te envolve em mundo rico de detalhes e experincias. basicamente faz perfeitamente o que propem que  um rpg de mesa em um jogo de vdeo. no  perfeito tem seu problemas e limitaes. se voc procura um rpg com mundo e npcs ricos em detalhes com um fator replay e centenas de horas esse jogo  pra voc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,the best surprise of the year. definitely deserved the goty. no words can describe how much fun i have playing this game with my friend. so many choices and unexpected plots. out of the box and the developers deserves to be praised.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,congratulations larian and thank you so much for making not only an amazing game but doing dnd justice and finally giving us a great game in the universe. everything in this game is so well done and i wish i could give larian more money.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,it deserves a 10 for the sheer ambition and bold vision. it will be a serious contender for game of the decade. i hope this becomes a model that inspires future developers to deliver quality content.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"what an incredible game this is! there is so much to do and so many different ways you can play. i would say that my only issue i've had is that it's a bit overwhelming at first. but after a few hours, you start to really set in. this might be the best game i've ever played. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"superb dd experience in a computer. almost infinite possibilities, real consequence management, amazing visual and storyline. it's a must play if you like rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"a true labor of love, where every angle is considered, every corner of the world lovingly crafted with its own story, and nothing ever feels recycled, halfhearted, or onedimensional. do not use this title as a bar to measure other crpgs, or everything else will surely disappoint."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"can't remember the last time i had this much fun gaming. if you're a fan of crpgs or dungeons  dragons, this is pretty much an essential experience you should look into getting. the mechanics may be confusing at first to those unfamiliar with tabletop dnd or related genres. graphics are beautiful and the musical score is masterpiece tier. the sheer scale of the game and the different story routes is mindblowing and i can see myself doing multiple playthroughs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,this game is 2023 goty. absolute legend and goat. you can literally wield salami as a weapon.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"overrated, how can some people say its a masterpiece after a day of its release? the gameplay its an insult to the old ones who were in real time, writing a jokehehe, s3x joke, get it ?  companions are annoying, etc. 210 because of graphic and choices."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i played and loved bg1 and bg2tob and i can say that bg3 is as good, but with new technology and design. sure, the game has some flaws and bugs that most probably will be fixed soon but it is so great that i still give it a 10. it is the first time i give a 10 on metacritic. kudos to larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"20 hours in and it's absolutely amazing. you can approach combat however you want and it really rewards creativity. if you want a true dnd experience in a game, look no further."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"pretty good game so far, i'm only 250 xp away from level 5. i do need to get used to the low level adventuring at this length. which turns out to be very dangerous. i never thought leveling from level 3 to 4 would make me feel so much stronger. facing off against a level 5 big monster in the underdark felt so epic, a real life or death battle. can't wait to get to level 5. for the low character levels, potions of speed are your friend, grenades are your friend, destructible environment can be used and pushing people in the depths is an insta kill, but you'll lose the loot. only bug i've gotten is a graphical one with a flouting helmet while moving."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i really only bought this game because i loved bg 12. i wasn't that excited for it, but playing it has been really enjoyable. there are a lot of in depth quests and choices to make, and combat feels good. i'm not a huge fan of the stat checks, as you can have a character with 10 roll a 1 and fail, or a character with 10 roll a 20 and succeed. there are some creative ways to get around failed checks, but sometimes it feels like i'm going to miss out on content on a fail so i'll just reload. overall, i like the 5e rules which offer much more customization than the first two games, i just need to get over looting every single thing i see so i can make some progress in the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"what an amazing game. 50h and not even finished act i. extremely engaging. i could stop playing it right now and it would still worth the money. well done larian, again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"masterpiece. replicated 5e dd perfectly. i don't know how they managed to allow so much player choice, from throwing your small companions and sneaking into a basement through a hole as a mage hand or cat  it is just incredible. the story is great and the dialogue choices are unique. i can't wait to replay as other classes too. one of the greatest games ever made that i'll be playing for years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"baldur's gate 3 consegue trazer elementos do rpg de mesa para um jogo eletrnico como eu jamais vi. os personagens tem personalidade e histria nicos, com segredos e ambies individuais que torna tudo muito imprevisvel. aqui no temos o arqutipo dos heris puramente bonzinhos, no comuns nos rpgs de plstico, e isso  timo! a explorao  recompensadora pois alm de grande o mundo  denso. eu no tinha hype nenhum sobre este jogo, mas confesso que hoje tenho a sensao de estar jogando o melhor rpg da dcada! gostaria de estar jogando ele no xbox series x, mas at l estou adorando a experincia no pc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this is not just game of the year, this is game of generation. i played divinity original sin 2 and was blown away be the how good the game is, and then i looked at the kickstarter, and realize larian studios is true to their words and completed all the goals they promised. this made me to believe this studios is the one. i am glad i was right, and preordered the collector edition. this game is phenomenal, it has a lot of more mechanics to learn compares to dos2, but since the game is made by the same company, some design ideas are the same, so it's not hard to get started without any prior knowledge of dd 5th edition. this is the game with many replayability, i would suggest anyone who want to try this game to slow down, and enjoy the world larian created, appreciate the little details. i certainly do. i enjoy doing some silly things, and then giggle like an idiot in front of my computer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"nah, combat is bad, way too much sluggish and boring. every combat encounter in act 2 is boring af and take waaaaay too long. like 45min when any other turn based rpg would take 5min...."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"larian studios is showing the gaming industry how games must be made, with love. bg 3 is a love letter to tabletop rpgs. its such a fantastic game. if tought the early access was already great, the full release will blow your mind. for me, its 2023's goty easily"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"the best rpg game ever play ! storys, characters, skill, decisionss, the art the goty without discussion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i have been playing baldur's gate 3 for a few years during the early access times. once the game fully released, i have been enamored with how in depth and elaborate every aspect of the game is. for someone who has been playing dnd as a dm for over 10 years, i could see why some people might not like the game since it does have dice rolls and skill checks for many aspects of the game. the turn based combat is also just like dnd in that players roll for initiative and then characters go in the order that they rolled. same with the character development, as dnd offers almost limitless combinations for your character to choose from. this is the closest iteration of a true to form video game adaptation of dnd that i could imagine, so well done larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"the elden ring magic, absolutly stunning. never play dnd. will do again. everything feels perfectly planed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,larian studios have managed to create something that feels like the spiritual successor to dragon age origins and might just have set the new rpg standard for years to come
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,what a beautiful game! perfect! incredible! absurdly immersive and deep. every detail in it is unique and was thought of with lots of love.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"if you played divinity os 2 , this is putting the baldurs gate lore on top of a that engine, with improved graphics and awesome voice acting that sell the story really well. if you have never played a crpg before, it is a bit daunting and overwhelming at first just fight through that initial struggle and you wont regret it. oonce you learn the game mechanics and a little patients, few games have been this rewarding and exciting for me since the witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this is one of the best games i've ever played, hands down. bg3 transports you into a mesmerizing realm that's beyond imagination. can i live here? the graphics are seriously mindblowing. cut scenes and storylines are heart wrenching. i love how you can be tactical or guns a'blazin, or even super sneaky. almost everything i come up with, the game lets me try it! really kicking my dd cravings. romance options  they're not just subplots, they're like heartandsoul connections! and i'm here for it. halsin daddy!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i'm another early 2000s n64xboxhalo guy who never really experienced top down games or never thought it would peak my interests. it was always fps and third person shooters. after hearing about this game through the decreasing population of diablo 4 and its lack of endgame, i needed anything to fill the void. i ended up buying this with my brother and it's been one of the most unique experiences in gaming i've ever had in my 20 years. the strategy and chess mindset involved is something i never thought a game could be. if you don't plot your moves and turns right, the game gets pretty demanding and challenging, which is a great thing. the challenge is there, the soundtrack is beautiful think fable, kingdoms of amalur, the graphics are beautiful in they're own comfortable way, similiar to that of diablo 4 or path or exile i personally love that style. last but not least the gameplay and story both sit way above water and id give them both a 9. on top of all the other attributes this game brings to the table, along with such a custom and unique path and dialogue system, this game gets a 10. the last time i gave a 10 to a game was uncharted 4 so this says something. to all fps guys who never really tried something like this. give it a try and sit with it for a few hours."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"arguably the best game i have ever played. i loved bg 1  2 and i loved dos 1  2, so maybe i'm just an easy mark but god damn this game is gooooood."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i know 40 hours in is a bit early to review a 100 hour game, but i imagine at this point, my mind is not going to change. this is the best crpg in recent memory, hand's down. they adopt some modern elements while still sticking to the classic role playing game format. everything about this game is so well done. between it's polish, graphics, character interactions, customization, turnbased battle system, writing, and sound design, everything about this game screams masterpiece. it's so refreshing seeing a game like this, full release, no mtx, no battlepass, single player with option for coop, doing so well in a world ran by soul , microtransaction laden corporate games. the concurrent player numbers on steam hitting the over 800k milestone the week of release just goes to show that gamer's still love these experiences. so far, it is my goty. it offers everything i could have asked for and more. huge thanks to larian studios for this amazing experience!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"was an early purchaser of this game on steam. can't say enough good things about this game. i hope the big studios are paying attention. zero micro transactions, just a really good game that you only have to spend any money on once."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i already have more than 60 hours of gameplay the game is amazing for any dd player is very happy with the fidelity of the world of baldur's gate. after 20 years without a game in the series, we have a game that lives up to the classics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"created an account just to give this game a rating. it's mindboggling the amount of content, permutations, and attention to detail in this game. been an rpg enjoyer all my life, from muds, to the original baldur's gate, to diablo, to dragonage, and the only rpg i think that comes close to the amount of content this game has is witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"didnt expect the combat to engage me, started at lowest difficulty just wanting to see the story since that's more than worth the purchase. after only a few battles i was as engaged on the battles as i was on the story and ended up switching to tactician. max difficulty never expected turn based combat to be so thrilling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,may be the best rpg i've ever played. i was cautious at first because i was really a big fan of the first two baldur's gate games. but little by little my suspicions disappeared. this is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"its divinity 3 baldurs gate  edition. i can look past the questionable character creator they added a slider for vitiligo, but no boob slider, and no other sliders for bodylimb size. you can also be nonbinary and put a  on a woman. mc is mute, other than some grunts and short one liners when you click objects etc. and only 4 voices, for both male and female combined. want to play a rough and tough halforc barbarian brute? enjoy sounding like a posh british dude. thankfully you can turn these remarks off and enjoy a fully silent mc. by the way, wrath of the righteous wotr had like 8 voices, per sex. skill checks during dialogue only use the char who is talking, other party members are useless. if you accidentally start dialogue with someone, like running into a room which automatically triggers dialogue, and there's an arcana skill check for example, which the character cant do, your mage companion just chills and is useless. thats a quickload. also there's no indication which dialogue option moves the conversation forward. if you click it accidentally but wanted to ask the other questions first, quickload. and better get in the habit of quickloading and quicksaving, since there's no timebased autosave. people lose 3060 mins of progress because they forgot to press f5 every 5 minutes. highlight hold only, no toggle doesnt show interactables, only lootable containersbodies. and from those half are missing too like vases, boxes etc. loot is 99 trash, yet the world is littered with containers so you better check them all in case you dont miss out on anything worthwhile. uiux is godawful. inventory management is the worst i've experienced in a very long time. there's no tabs for different item categories, its all in just one big pile. every character has their own inventory and carry weight too for no reason. half the game consists of fighting the inventory. you have to rightclick to get a popup menu to mark items as junk one by one, and there's no sell all junk button. so its useless. after a few hours in the game i stopped picking up loot because i didnt want to micromanage my inventory anymore. surely a sign  crpg. thanks to the braindead design of 5th edition of dnd, getting a level is not exciting at all. my rogue companion got 2 level ups and no options to choose anything except a specialization. one choice for like 6 hours of gameplay. build diversity and depth is in the gutter, especially if youre coming from pathfinder games. level cap is 12 and you get a feat once per 4 levels. thats 3 feats for an entire playthrough. in wotr some classes start the game with 3 feats, with a level cap of 20 and a feat every second level. the map is bad. and you cant click on the map to move the party, you have to close the map, then remember where you were looking to go while the map was open. there's no indication of camera position on the map either. dialogue is cringe inducing at most times. so far none of the companions are enjoyable, and most are irritating. you have a rude girlboss fighter, an aloof gay elf vampire who totally isnt a vampire, a token black dude, and a forgettable priestess. the mage companion gale is best of the bunch. who also turns out to be gay. wotr does everything this game does, except the cinematics and graphics, and does it much, much better. all this game made me feel is firing up wotr again, for the 6th playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"though it feels like i've waited a lifetime, it has only been 23 years. i've played early access for a couple of years now, and it is exactly what i wanted in a sequel to the greatest rpg of all time. i went karlach first playthrough, and have not been disappointed in her dialogue options."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this is one of the most incredible games in the last 10 years. single player. multiplayer. no micro transactions. beautiful voice acting, rich story, meaningful decisions, i could continue to go on. my god i cannot put this game down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"best game i have ever played. we need more like this... no need to be online, no micro transactions etc. just the perfect 300 hour experience which is more addicting the more you play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"as a dnd lover, i feel like a child playing for the very first time baldurs gate 3, when im at work im thinking about playing, when im playing im thinking in how i want to keep playing, i just cant stop playing and thinking about it. the game have so much stuff to explore that i cant feel anxious to miss something when im playing around. the best crpgrpg i have played since dos2 and pathfinders 2. 100 recommended if you love crpg and dnd. i love you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"its a masterpiece, the best rpg game i have ever played in my life. thank you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this game is broken as of hotfix 1. i have not even left the nautiloid and encountered so many annoying bugs most notable one is camera moving to a random location during enemy turns i am quitting. unmeasurably more broken than the early access version. see you in few months, i guess. how come larian gets a pass and everyone loves them, even though the game is so utterly broken? how come media outlets do not talk about this? this is as broken on release as tlou for pc or jedi survivor! they should have delayed this to christmas, not move it forward one month!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"larian did an amazing work, you definitely have to try this game if you love crpgs. goty for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i never write a review. but man, this game is something else. this game is like a gasp of fresh air, this game is like a holy hand, that gonna pull you from the dark room with all those cash grab games, and lying devs. after cdpr lie about cyberpunk, i was lost my faith in gaming industry completely. but this game restored my faith. this game has proven that there's still developers that can bring that aaa experience, without falls promises, without cash grab. thank you larian studios"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,never has been so much detail and content compacted into a single game. the dev team really did an incredible job. i would never believe such ambitious project was ever possible masterpiece. game of the decade.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i am not a hardcore dnd player but i am loving the depth, different choices and different ways you can carry out every quest in this game. i haven't finished the game yet but loving every moment of it, its characters, story, world, lore and gameplay everything is toptier. a mustplay game for every rpg fan regardless of if you like crpgs or not."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i know larian since divinity original sin 1 and so far all of their games since then have been special to me. you can feel their passion for games in every aspect. and bg3 is the pinnacle so far. it shapes up to be among my favourite single player games of all time, so there cant be less than a 10 from me for this gem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,unbelievable game. i really hope it stands a chance against totk in the game of the year race and i personally believe it should win by a landslide
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"if you want to be taken through an amazing journey, this is the game. it was quite of a rollercoaster for me with diablo 4 making me hate big studios but baldur's gate is a one of a kind. i haven't played it much yet due to personal reasons but just the few hours i've spent were quite amazing. you really have the feeling of being part of a story and no greed from the studio. that's very sad that nowadays it's all about making more money and not listening to what the comunity wants. or even worse, showcasing something that was a total scam i.e. diablo 4"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,4     .      dragon age origin.     .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,very immersive and joyful game. probably the best game i've ever played. already 100 hrs in it  love it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,bg3 is pure enjoyment for me. larian is hitting 1000 with their crpgs. it is a masterpiece
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i thought i could have conceptually grasped the scope of this game. i stayed away from reviews and videos about how to start, so i just went in blind. it is mindblowing the number of choices, and how easy your game could take a total 180 degrees. it is hardcore fun!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,absolutely amazing game. amazing experience. simply the best rpg of all time. this is something special.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this is a game. love that your choices have immediate consequences. one time for example, i kicked a squirrel who bit my toe. consequence the squirrel went flying and exploded against a tree. too much bugs and lag though."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"one of the most fun and enjoyable rpg. the exploration is amazing, never feels boring. the sense of progression is amazing and reward."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"fantastic game from a great developer that sets out to achieve and even exceed the high expectations. only some minor qol flaws like group management, but all in all it is the definitive game for all rpg and especially crpg fans."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i never heard of baldurs gate and i easn't familiar with dungeons and dragons, out of curiosity i bought the early access version. i was astonished of how much potential this game had and larian delivered, all my expectations were fullfilled and more. larian implemented all of the wishes the fans wanted, and did it in a way that is just out of this world. the story, the character progression, the fighting system, the depth, the setting and all this love, detail and effort that went into this game i just can't describe it. if i had to compare this game to the recently released diablo 4, there is no comparison bg 3 is in my opinion already game of the decade. if someone would ask how would you describe baldurs gate 3 in one word, i would say mastepiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"we need more games like this. no microtransaction  no bugs, good graphics and art direction, featurecomplete and a roleplayers dream. perfect in every way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"a full on awesome game! the attention to level design and the amount of side quests, that actually feels like tiny story missions. when you buy the game, you get hundred of hours of unique gameplay. and the depth of the story and the characters is so good. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,by far the best rpg out there it's just amazing words can't even explain please support the devs and don't pirate it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,will go down as one of the greatest rpgs of the decade. made with passion. pure 10 out of 10.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i have never played a turnbased game and that is why i was hesitant to purchase this. however, i love rpgs and i am glad i purchased it as this game does not disappoint at all. i am having fun and loving the stories and how you have choices. it is incredibly immersive. thank you larian!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this is an absolute masterclass. designed by quite possibly the most passionate and community sensitive development team i have seen for a long long time. larian have segmented their legacy as one of the greatest and most trustworthy developers of the modern day era. they are more like passionate gamers that know how to code. they listen, communicate and embrace their community in ways i wish other development studios would do. sadly the corporate machine has crashed through the gaming landscape in recent times driving the soul and gamer driven ethos to near extinction in favour of corporate greed and lining the purse strings of the already wealthy. to me the most important thing larian have achieved here is not just making an absolutely phenomenal game, but they have restored my faith that maybe the future landscape of gaming is not completely lost. even if you don't like crpg's, get behind this group of amazing developers, lead by an amazing leadership team. show other companies that is ok to make games that don't try to squeeze every single drip of blood from the community in favour of making games driven by passion. made by gamers for gamers. the way it should be. 1010 don't miss it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,larian studios have done the impossible by releasing a full game in 2023 with now strings attached. it's all here! no dlc or cosmetic stuff. the game itself is also a 1010. thank you larian studios from the whole gaming community!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"30h into the game since release, just love all of it. even the premade characters are pretty fine."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"1010 greatest game ever made! larian studios made an excellent work, storytelling, graphics, gameplay, coop everything is just perfect, this game does not limit players in any way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"this game is sooo good! i don't remember last time i actually would be unable to stop playing a game! complete game, everything done with love... awesome job, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i have never played dd, never played any crpg but damn this game is awesome! larian did such a great job! i am so thankful that i am able to play this game and enjoy it and i hope everyone can enjoy this game the same way. this is such a great breath of fresh air in today's gaming industry where all you can see are microtransactions and unfinished games with huge open worlds that are most of the time empty. this game has it  story, the decisions that matter, the open world where all the time something is happening, the characters that have soul and i am not even talking about that super awesome voice acting...i can only recommend this game. even if you don't plan playing it, just buy it to support larian, they deserve it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"great game. played some other, similar dndlike rpgs like divinity os2, pathfinder kingmaker  wotr,... but this one is just better than any of them. great story, characters and lots of choices that actually matter. combat system is good aswell, only part some ppl might miss is a realtime with pause mode some other rpgs have, but i like turnbased more since its less chaotic. only critique is character pathing. sometimes they just walk into traps youve already found."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,finally a great product worth my time and money. thank you larian studios for this wonderful product! can't wait for the new dos!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"what is this! a game that doesn't have microtransactions!! the full game on release day! a game that doesn't seem to have gaming stopping bugs on day one!! a game where the servers were able to handle the load of everyone downloading the game at the same time!! well played larian studios, i love it. the game is also extremely good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,this game is everything i was looking for after the let down of recent releases
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"while i don't agree with a lot of the negative reviews as they just seem unfounded, i also don't agree that bg3 is advancing gaming to the degree that the masses claim. personally, i see the game as 'good'. pros  graphics are great. i think anyone who argues otherwise is not being honest.  the combat and animations are fine.  the story is interesting.  you have a wide range of role playing options, you can do more than you can in other games.  it really showed us which developers would rather bicker about a good game rather than create one themselves.  no microtransactions is only a good thing.  no fps or crash issues. cons  some of the characters' dialogue comes across as more fan fiction than realistic.  larian studios copy pasted divinity original sin 2 far too much, from the ruins, to the interactions, to the loot, to the text.  like divinity, the loot doesn't feel rewarding. a rare glove that provides 0 armour and an effect that i may use 10 of the time is not something i look forward to receiving. the basic gear even has fixed stats so every piece of gear i pick up has the exact same stats.  i feel like the difficulty options are cosmetic when quicksave  load exist as it removes any challenge.  there is no customising of the eye shape, height, weight, nose, lips, ears or body tattoos, removing armour makes neck tattoos look unpolished with seeming.  bugged a few times. sometimes my character, or characters i need to interact with, will not be interactable. oftentimes just needs to be reloaded but this lowers immersion.  while you'd expect the climax of the game to be the best, i feel like act iii is the most disappointing and it seems clear that the team put the most effort into act i and it slowly begins to show.  as much as i like rolereversal, the lack of strength orientated men as followers or even npc's is quite disappointing. it's true we have halsin, but he feels too kind hearted to be a ruffian strongman follower."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"uma obraprima, um jogo de verdade onde suas decises so to importantes quanto a evoluo do personagem. e todos os npc's so extremamente carismticos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,amazing game. if you like classic turnbased rpgs this game is for you. 6 years ive been waiting and it didnt disappoint
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"it's great. it feels different than the old school baldur's gate games, and plays a bit more like the divinity games, but overall it's excellent. the production value is top notch, sound and visuals are excellent. it plays a little slow in single player, but is surprisingly faster and smoother in multiplayer. it's been one laugh after another playing it with a full group of friends. also, it's a complete game, no dlc, no microtransations, and so far seems bug free. aaa publishers need to take note."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,leaving this review so more company's will try to match larians level. the game is 1010 and im hoping for it to beome game of the year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,goty in my heart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"a masterpiece of the decade, 10 out of 10. you won't find such variability in any other game. i hope other developers will realize that games should be made like this, but the main thing is for publishers to understand it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,",  larian    ,   ,         .     .."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"simply a masterpiece. this is wat gaming needs. full on passion. this takes everything from dos2 and somehow manages to make it even better. dos2 was already a 1010. people rating this game below 8 are simply haters or didn't even play the game more that a few hours. you cannot deny that this game is needed in the space especially with all big aaa games releasing with season passes, micro transactions etc. this igame will be remembered as one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"immersive world, great combat, no microtransactions, no ingame shop. this game will set new standards for all games to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this game is a gem that we must all treasure and enjoy. it is a labor of love made by gamers for gamers. truly the most accurate representation of a dd board game brought to our gaming machines. moreover this game is huge and was not sliced into pieces to be sold separately, which in this day and age should be seen as a remarkable display of backbone and integrity. i almost cried happy tears when i realized what we have here and i hope that larian will never sell their ip, because this is what we need in order to have the games that we deserve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"so basically i hate playing this game, but hear me out! before you jump into conclusions i'd like to explain why i gave this a positive score. 1. baldur's gate 3 spits in the face of ps and xbox by standing its ground and delivering to pc players first. it's been a long time since a aaa game has given us anything good because normally big studios would develop their games for consoles first and then throw up a halffinished, halftested title for the pc gamers. don't get me wrong, the game is still buggy as hell but what's happening right now is historical and it hasn't been seen since probably 20062007. 2. another thing that plays a huge role as to why this game will receive a positive score from me is ... yep you've guessed it  no battle passes, no microtransactions, no lootboxes. you pay for the whole game and you get the whole game. simple. again, something that nobody does nowadays and yet everybody wants to see more of. 3. you can literally undress your character completely but when you see that 800k daily player count something seems off, doesn't it? when was the last time you saw a aaa studio do this? i personally haven't. 4. you can play offline. 5. aaa title for 60 usdeez  the way it's supposed to be. as an fps player i absolutely despise the camera in this game and how it moves separately from the character. the bugs and the crashes don't help my experience either, however i'm willing to support it solely because larian studios flashes their butt cheeks in the faces of those conceited nobs at sony playstation and microsoft xbox and shows more backbone than all of the studios in the west combined."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"good game, i'm glad larian finally made it, ever since the early access i knew it'll be awesome."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"game of the year! 1110 the game is wonderful. this could be the end of the review, but i'll write about the emotions of a person who likes to play classic rpgs. firstly, i'm shocked by the graphics, i can't get enough of the characters. the scenes are set perfectly. dialog options are also more than enough. the game has grown a lot and i say this from a height of 400 hours in early access and observations of its development. i also really like the fights and the stepbystep approach gives me huge options for tactics. i get sincere pleasure from immersion in the game, from communicating with companions, from interesting fights. i love the first parts of baldur's gate 1, 2 with all my heart, but the fights there frankly bored me from the first hours of the game. communication with satellites there was also not enough for me. everything is fine for me here. and it looks like i will spend hundreds and hundreds more hours in this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best videogame 1010 goty larian studios has impressed once again. they've created an immersive world, full of interesting characters, endless choice and consequence in how you interact with it and fun, thoughtful and addicting combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldurs gate 3 is a great game, putting us deep into a great world. fun fights, great characters, great graphics, awesome sound effects and breathtaking music. a fun story, meeting many old chars from the previous games, would recommend to play this to everyone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"first time ive ever left a review on metacritic, thank you larian its everything you could dream of!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this game is even more amazing than it was during early access. the story is really great, alongside the combat, the immersive world.. it is really hard to find a negative point about the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"simply just wow. this is not setting a new standard for rpgs, this is setting a new standard for the whole game industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best game ever, love it. can't get enough. the problem with newer games like diablo 4 is the people being them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,aaa studios pay attention. this game feels complete on launch and even as someone whose last turn based game was ff7  ff8... this is a fun way back into the genre! polar opposite of the disaster that was diablo 4!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,bg3 is such a fairytale from beginning to end. easiest recommendation of my life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,best game i played in a long time. thank you for that one. hioe all of you has much fun.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,my first crpg and it's incredible. i can't stop playing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"by far the best rpg i've played in the last decade. can't get enough of the combat, role play, music, or world in this game. everything is 1010 about the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"as someone who couldn't get into divinity original sin 2 and has never been a crpg fan, this is an absolute masterpiece. do you ever play rpgs and are impressed by great rare rpg mechanic, choices that really do matter, quality characters, great customizability, fun loot? this game is that nonstop. i imagine once i finish this i will be going back and giving dos2 another chance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,never liked turn based games but got dayum this game is amazing. totally recommend to anyone and everyone.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning for a aaa game devoid of pay walls, ingame purchases, passes, or alwaysonline play. larian delivered an underdog title deserving of every award the industry can give. they've created a new industry gold standard and proved video games don't have to be a casino to be profitable. ea, ubisoft, blizzardactivision, square enix, capcom your days are numbered."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,a triple a game made by gamers. ill be playing this for years to come. better than bethesda can do nowadays
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"epic excelent work ! bg3 is defenitely the best rpg i have ever played, very enjoyful fantasy journey"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"bg3 has been quite exceptional. there really isn't a complaint that i can give it. there are incredibly few bugs freezing, ctdt but that is likely a machine stability issue that is personal to myself rather than a genuine performance issue. i typically play several hours without issues, but save often. as a personal rule, i don't save during battle. it's beautiful to see what's been accomplished. i love it dearly. follow the larion's lead. you don't have to make every game this immersive, but completing the game before release should be the standard at the least."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a true masterpiece, and the only real comparison is divinity 2. the immersion, story, character building and freedom elements are slightly better than div2, while the rest is about the same."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,the most phenomenal  outstanding piece of artwork in gaming that i've experienced in a long time. it has never been so easy for me to be completely immersed in a game  it's world. this is the epitome of a roleplaying game. buy. this. game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i've been playing all weekend and i'm constantly blown away by the insane amount of freedom a player has in how the story unfolds. i've caught glimpses of streams and see other players story unfold completely different from my own, i love it! it makes me sad that other games don't have this type of player agency. the good thing is that this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay to enjoy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"30 hours of game and still on the first act, this is one of the games that makes me feel like i'm living inside that world, the options available at the character creations allows me to create someone that i will never be able to be on the real life, thank you larian studios for this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"jogo fantstico, para quem gosta de rpg de mesa e  f de dd,  um prato cheio!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i am not even a huge fan of dd and just can't get enough. very well made, complete game, no microtransactions. carefully made, guaranteed fun and very well balanced. best turn based rpg i ever played. companies should learn from larian instead of making excuses."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this is the best crpg i've played so far, well maybe the second right after the witcher 3. despite the fact that this game has some problems, compared to other productions from recent years it is sensational. if you like crpg and you don't like this game because you think it should be called divinity 3... i'm sorry for you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"amazing fun and complete game, no dlc, no microntransactions. this is the new standard, dont accept anything less"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,the freedom this game gives to the player is outstanding. never have been more immerse in a game before. not a 10 because it keeps crashing after playing too much.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldur's gate 3 is a return to an era of gaming that is all but extinct in today's aaa world. no microtransactions, a working game with full content at release, and obvious love from the developers poured in to it. it's not often that i can play a game with actual soul anymore. what's more, coming off of diablo 4, it's refreshing to play a game that remembers when games used to be fun. for crpg fans, rpg fans, and even people who don't typically follow the genre, it's impossible to overstate the appeal of this game. it hits on every criteria one can use to judge a game. the game play is fun, inventive, and dynamic. the story line is engrossing and original while very approachable. the voice acting is professional and demanding. the graphics are beautiful. i'm gushing, i know, but this is a game that doesn't just redefine its genre or compete for goty in a year with several great titles, it is the new paradigm for a a generation of gaming, much in the same way that skyrim was. rpgs for the next decade will be compared to this one. play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i've played dd only a handful of times and i've never played previous baldur's gate titles but i had a lot of fun playing this game with friends. besides i think the practices behind this game are something to stand up for.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"the game is obviously pretty good, but i'll try to offer one atleast slightly more critical point of view about this game and the things that i'm not liking so far. dos2 influence is strong, i know it's a good game, but i wish there was more distinction between the two. ssome of use care more about dd than divinity, and come from games like nwn2 and pathfinder kingmakeretc, and this influence might be annoying in some things. there are a lot of scenery and environments that feel a bit recycled from dos, also many elements from the ui and game engine are obviously recycled. terrain influence is also a bit too much, as it definitively was in dos. there is even a specific dip bonus action that works on many elemental terrains and nonsensically adds big elemental damage to almost all weapons even in unlikely scenarios at almost no cost. there are the usual oil barrels, and much more stuff that can change terrain a bit too easily and frequentely for my tastes. the plot. i don't want to make spoilers, but it startes a bit too strong on the edgyhighfantasy style, offering straight away a kind of scenario that might seem something that should be more fit for endgame, just to reel people in, and that was a bit excessive and a bit anticlimatic. i would have appreciated starting to immerse in a magic world a bit more gradually and slowly than this. the companion npcs are a bit disappointing i wish they were more and more interesting than they are, this might sound silly, but there' a whole romance option, and there's literally not even a single female character that looks appealing for that. further content may help this in the future. again, the game isn't bad, that's why i gave it a 7 and not a 2, but i was expecting a bit more, and i kinda miss the old obsidian level of work, larian stiil seems a bit unconvincing to me, even with the dd ruleset."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldur's gate 3 has left an indelible mark on my gaming experience, proving itself to be a true masterpiece that captivates, challenges, and immerses players in a fantastical world like no other. larian studios has truly outdone themselves with this title, creating an unforgettable journey that seamlessly blends captivating storytelling, intricate gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals. from the moment i stepped foot into the mystical realm of baldur's gate 3, i was greeted with breathtaking landscapes, meticulously detailed environments, and a level of realism that made me feel as though i was truly a part of this world. the attention to detail in both character design and environmental elements is astonishing, lending an unparalleled sense of immersion that few games can achieve. the heart and soul of baldur's gate 3 lies within its compelling narrative. the game's intricate web of interconnected stories, rich lore, and memorable characters drew me in and refused to let go. the branching paths and choices that shape the course of the story offer a true sense of agency, making each playthrough feel unique and genuinely impactful. the writing is topnotch, filled with wit, emotion, and depth that adds layers of complexity to the characters and the world they inhabit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"in the mid70s, i was a teenager, a friend introduced me to dungeons and dragons. i joined the u.s. navy when i was 18 it was 1981 my friends and i played on the ship while at sea on the weekends and holidays for hours. now, i'm 60, and that game is on my pc, just like i remember it. if you have ever played dd, get this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"playing bg3 after a 3 year break from early access has me completely enchanted all over again. with a combined effort of patience and early access player feedback, the larian team has crafted a masterpiece. with this fantastic effort and of course the divinty ip, larian has perfected the crpg secret sauce. i'm hopeful both wizards of the coast wizards and larian larianstudios build on this success, and of course more epic tales in faern !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"featurecomplete. massive amount of content and replayability. great visuals, soundtrack, voice acting and mechanics. well made adaptation of ip. no microtransactions. smooth release. in a time of overpriced, buggy, halfassed games, larian studios goes against the trend and has released a game that has the big boys shaking in their boots. it doesn't waste your time. it doesn't expect you to constantly open your wallet. it doesn't treat you like a gullible idiot. however great the game is, this release deserves a ten to show bigger developers that this is how customers want to be treated, and to give larian a solid pat on the back for not being the knife in the back and hand in your bank. for those that want to see more stuff like this in the future  buy it to cast your vote. for those that don't care about all that, this game is really solid and worth the price  buy it to have a good time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i am not much of a crpg fan. the last memorable game i enjoyed was pathfinder but im more of a arpg fan such diablo, path of exile, last epoch etc. but this game has to be the very best crpg experience, i have had, in years. amazing depth, choices matter, multiple different outcomes from the most simple to complex events, taking the very best of table top experience, perfecting it into a digital medium with very satisfying gameplay. extremely pleasing rolling that die from dialogue to combat. if you have yet to experience this genre of video games then start off here in baldurs gate 3. extremely easy to pick up and play. no need to master the rules or proper ways to build your character etc. just purchase, download, adjust initial settings and enjoy. the characters are interesting, the story is good and the gameplay is clean. stop reading and play. oh wait! if you have a friend then invite them as well. the multiplayer works well and is a blast."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldur's gate 3 has set the bar for what is possible in a true rpg. other developers are angry at how good this game is, they are actually upset that larian made such an incredible game. how can they compete with such a masterpiece?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game is evrything i ever wanted its my wish granted by genie. very nice graphics with so many option to play that suit you there is evrything in this game you ever wish be in a rpg game from roaring at people to straight murdering anyone at sight no f. live service with buged gameplay or stupid microtransactions and you dont need to be always online so no waiting in queue this game and developers deserve evry cent from my purchase thank you for this game luw yo
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"an excellent rendition of dd 5e, almost as though you're playing the tabletop with friends and this is the story before you. a deep but not overcomplex combat system, literally hundreds of choices for classes, species and choices to make. and best of all, it's a complete game without ingame purchases or loot boxes. it's a full product released in the condition they said it would be. sadly that's all too rare these days."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece of an rpg. i'm in absolute love with everything!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"yeah this game is an absolute masterpiece.  blizzard, activision and ubisoft. larian is king"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game is amazing. you can pet an owlbear you can pet a dog freedom no playthrough is the same bear sex
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"the negative reviews often complain that this is turn based game and that it's slow ... yes it's in the description of the game  that is what turn based games are lads . in any case, the game is seriously one of the best releases in certain years... what ea, ubisoft and similar studios get away with these days hello? jedi survivor? madden nfl?! is absolutely crazy and they deserve to get a review bombed for it! however larian studios cares about the product they put out and it shows. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"just a great game. everything i wanted from larian's next game. add in the fact that the early access campaign was productive and didn't overstay it's welcome, and you have a product worthy of every cent."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"sorry for my english since it's not my language. i started playing bg3 few weeks ago during the early acces. even if i'm not a big fan of the turn based games the only thing that binds me to this genre is a feeling of affection for the old final fantasy games just after 20 hours i understood that this game wasn't only the goty of 2023 but probably the best game i ever played. if not the first i would say for sure the second. this game can aspire to become one of the best 5 games ever made. im not overreacting. as i said im not a big fan of this genre and i never played larian studios games. i want to be really honest and objective. i was curious of this game just because when i was young i played the 2 baldur's gate dark alliance not from larian games since i am a fan of the old diablo 1 and diablo 2. when you play bg3 in every single cell of this game you breath the love of the larian studios developers. it's unbealivable how a indipendent studio made such a beautiful opera. everything in this game is soo beautiful... level desing, character design, storytelling, mood, balancing, ost, side quests. it's just unbelieveble. they demonstrate that even if you don't like a genre you could like it if this is made with love and innovaton merging the old and the new in such an epic way. they took one of the most static and for some people boring genre of game making it really dinamic and funny. its just so good that a small studio like larian proved that there are small productions able to make much better games in quality than big production. there are people who make videogames only to grab money and people who do it with love like fromsoftware. personally for me it deserve the goty without any doubt let's wait for starfield release but sometimes for some reason goty awards are given without any objectivity just because people are stupid. this game have complicated mechanics for the mass and it will sell less than other videogames but this is not a good reason to not be awarded. so, for me.... no zelda, not this time  !!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,best role playing game in a while. high replay value and has zero microtransaction.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"jogo maravilhoso, combate, gameplay, grficos, personagens, tudo muito bem detalhado, vai ser difcil algum rpg superar esse."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"good excellent presentation, from the cutscenes and visuals to the music and voiceacting. wellwritten dialogues and a compelling story with excellent pacing. a great, fullyrealized cast. several fun quests, with memorable characters to meet and impactful decisions to make. extensive customization and build variety, with numerous options for spells and actions. robust combat embodies the chaos of dungeons and dragons. bad some bugs and a bit of cutscene jank take away from the immersion. frame drops occur later in the game. thoughts baldurs gate 3 is a triumph for many reasons. storytelling, combat, dialogue, choices, visuals, music, voiceacting, pacing, side quest design, complexity  everything feels spoton, and the attention to detail is insane. thats not accounting for the sheer replay value with all the classes, subclasses, spells, paths, decisions and much more. even with its imperfections, slight as they may be, larian has once again raised the bar for roleplaying games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i have been playing this game since day 1 of early access, so i have been following closely larian's work. this is a labor of love. the amount of work they have put into this game is just unbelievable. this game is a good adaptation of dd5e ruleset, with amazing graphics and cinematics, has a great story, dialog choices and freedom of play. it's a worthy successor to bg2, no doubt about that. this is every crpg enthusiast's wet dream coming true. on top of that, larian treats their customers with respect. no microtransaction bs and dlcs at launch. they just deliver a good complete game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"stop reading reviews and go buy the game, this is one of those games that come out once in a lifetime. incredible replayability, mindblowing mechanics, graphics, story, and everything a true rpg should have. no microtransactions of any kind, not live services!, polished experience, a true quadruple aaaa game. because aaa games today are horrid. as i said stop reading and just get the game, don't waste your time that you could invest in the game  a true 10 out of 10 game.  i really missed that kind of games"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"top studio created top game, maybe the best rpg in these days. for total perfection is missing my native czech language and tuned functional controller on pc currnetly works , but weird, only in coop split screen mode,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"as a huge fan of the baldur gates franchise this might be the biggest disappointment of all time and i am not exaggerating. the game literally looks like a playstation 2 graphics despite requiring a soupedup laptop to play. controller support is nonexistent so enjoy playing it with a mouse and keyboard in 2023!!. and don't get me started on the historical inaccuracies.. but worst of all is the story which i won't spoil but rest assured it is a huge slap in the face of the long term fans of the franchise who grew up playing siege of dragonspear and hanging out on the subreddit, sharing tips and tales with the awesome community. at this point i honestly believe it would have been better to not make a new baldur gates so we can keep the great memories instead of this cashin garbage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"the best game i've played in 10 years. an absolute masterpiece. story, characters, gameplay, variability, attention to detail, graphics  everything is at an incredible high level. i can't believe that this game could come out in our time. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a competent crpg from the postquality age. i could write a list of glaring faults example no text or voice chat in multiplayer so long that your eyes would glaze over. other than that, the game narrowly skates by on the enjoyability of its mechanics. not a 010, not a 1010 it is truly insane to suggest either score."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,best game ever! best studio ever. care about the consumer. most addicting thing ever played
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"highquality cutscenes, indepth dialogues, rich exploring, good optimization and decent turnbased combat you need to think on, and of course possibility of sex with bear lol. the game has everything we've dreamt of so far. if starfield does not end up as good as this game, baldur's gate 3 is a top candidate for goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"finally a triplea game worth playing in a long time. carefully crafted game with interesting storylines, amazing amount of content and no hidden costs. it just seems unbelievable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"and yet again another outstanding work from larian. baldur's gate 3 remind me of the old days playing bg1 and 2. the story surprises you, makes you laugh and keeps you at the border of the chair. combat is engaging and really enjoyable. it's incredible to see a game made with such love and dedication from a company that know and respect it's customers. thank you, larian. keep the great work and never deviate from this path"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this is my witcher 3 in the crpg genre. larian hits a nat 20 with that one.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"god damn it, this game is good. it is sometimes buggy and glitchy, i had one crash, but nonetheless this should be game of the year, no doubt. huge worlds and huge gameplay options, the content of this game is ridiculous. so much to explore, so much to do and with so many choices! everything has an impact to the gameplay, yet still connects to the story! many characters to get to know and with the lore to back them up. 51 hours in, just started act 2. please never change, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"insane level of details, so many complex relations with the companions and the npcs, every decision you make gonna impact the whole story . such an amazing game guys"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"jogo genial, feito com esmero nos mnimos detalhes. um game must play para todos."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"the game is amazing, larian did an excellent job, probably the best game ever done on the dd ip. could go for goty for sure. so much possibilities, the writing is excellent, graphics too. very fun to play and a lot of replayability. i hope the succes is there for larian it seems to be there, we need more real rpgs like this, in an era where rpg label is put on any game with a level system, and where a lot of rpg ips are turning more into action rpgs, this is a relief to see that there is still some place for real role playing games. we lost bioware a long time ago, thanks to ea, larian is the new king now, so long live to the king!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,exceptional in every way way possible. this game sets a standard that will be hard to match.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldurs gate 3 is... an absolute masterpiece, it's everything one could dream of for a dd game and a sequel to the previous baldur's gate games, as someone who has loved larians previous divinity titles, this goes above and beyond and is just bigger and better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"brilliant game. must play. best crpg ever made and best rpg since witcher 3, possibly ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,the game does the romanceor should i say sexmance lol! a little too much but that's about it as far as con's. there is a ton of content in the game if you choose to do it. i have about 50hrs in and i'm not even close to act 3. 10 out of 10 for me! now if only someone could do a complete remake of the old nwn single player gameor a new that would be great! i glad it's breaking records....that means more possible games like this!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"tengo 46 aos, llevo jugango desde nio y ste es el mejor juego que he jugado nunca. en cuanto a juego de rol, esto es un juego de rol, que hoy le llaman a cualquier cosa, the witcher es un buen juego pero es un juego de aventuras, que puedas subir de nivel y coger objetos no quiere decir que sea de rol. espero que mucha gente lo apoye, se seguir hablando de este juego dentro de 20 aos y veo extremadamente complicado que alguien lo mejore, como no sea la propia larian y tambin complicado ya que ya han declarado que van a hacer juegos ms pequeos. as que disfrutad del mejor juego de la historia"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"yes, there is no game that is 1010. but considering what larian managed to achieve here as a relatively small studio it was around 100 people before it expanded to 400 during baldur's gate 3 development is incredible. when they said that you can play this game in so many ways, they weren't kidding. you can be anyone and side with anyone or completely obliterate everything in your way. just don't forget that actions have consequences  this is implemented on a whole new level. i absolutely love dos2 but bg3 managed to improve on many aspects. i'll be playing this game for hundreds of hours. probably the biggest achievement is that they managed to make a crpg quite approachable for people who never touched the genre. as a result, more people will be looking into other crpgs, which is a win for this relatively niche genre. larian really loves what they are doing, and it shows. i applaud the fact that this is such a massive success. not only me, but it seems like the devs didn't expect it to be such a massive hit either. well deserved."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"finally, after years and years of degradation in the videogame industry, comes a game that shows all these horrible other publishes how it's done. thank you larian for staying true and releasing this finished, working, featurecomplete and without the usual crap that plagues other games such as additional ingame monetization and the live service roadman crap. this is how videogaming should be. this will set a new standard, whether the turdheads at ubisoft, blizzard and obsidian want it or not. this will make all the copypaste games from all these horrible studios that don't deserve to be in the business look like what they really are generic bulls1t. thank you larian. end everyone else, buy this. this is a game of the century."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"great game that surprises more and more with each passing hour. the presentation of the story, the characters, the visuals, the dialogue and, most importantly, the roleplaying component  everything here is done on some almost unattainable level. this game reminded me why i once fell in love with video games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldurs gate 3 is nothing short of incredible. it's evocative story, nuanced characters and the beautiful presentation of the forgotten realms puts this rpg in a class of its own. the voice acting and script are superb, and every character's personality, preferences, and mannerisms brings them to life in a way that makes you feel attachment to the heroes and hatred for its villains. under the hood, the game has perfectly adapted the dicerolling tabletop rules for dd without alienating those new to 5ed rules by making them have to learn the ponderous tome that makes up the rulebook. if you want to learn the ins and outs, or you regularly play 5ed rules at a tabletop you will feel right at home. if you don't, then you simply don't need to. all the dicerolling is done in the background and hit chances in the turn based combat shows percentages of your success in killing your enemies. i had already racked up 99 hours in early access over the past 2 years, and seeing the development unfold in a way which has included its community at the centre of every decision has been a privilege. i look forward to seeing more of bg3, whether that's in dlc or fullblown expansions which raise the level cap to the godlike levels of 20 and beyond."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"o melhor jogo de rpg feito ate o momento. parabns larian studios, superou a qualidade da serie divinity que e maravilhosa tambem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"gameplay and the pacing is really slow, character customization is fine, not my type of genre. i didn't understand the hype hysteria that was across all over the web."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,phenomenal work of rt devoid of the trappings of modern day monetization. this is how games ought to be going forth.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"one of the least casual games ive played in a long time, and i love it! i mention casual, because my other favorite game this year is dave the diver, about as casual and accessible as they come, baldurs gate iii is completely the opposite and it took me several hours to get a decent handle on the mechanics of the game. and what i mean is that this game is so much more than just a crpg with a good story and very advanced combat system. its an amazing story and numerous side quests, a point and click adventure, a true dd roll playing game with dice rolls on the screen, a deep tactical strategy game and all set to an amazing score and better than average graphics. i am actually surprised that there are not some negative reviews only because it is not a quick play or easy to get far into in a couple of hours. i think thats a testament to the story telling and how even though complex, players are compelled to keep playing to see whats next. great game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"um rpg massivo que inova o genero de rpg isometricos, embora nao seja perfeito por ter alguns bugs chatos"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a masterpiece, as simple as that. and i'm not even a rpg gamer. my only minor worry is the mechanics might be overwhelming for newcomers. be patient and you will be rewarded!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,perfect combat perfect storytelling perfect sounds you should have been playing this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"rpg elemnets are amazing, but the moment to moment gameplay is boring af. sad i can't play it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"saia da bolha por achar que o jogo  ruim por ter batalhas por turno,pois  isso que vai te fazer usar suas estratgias e inteligncia para vencer as lutas e se aprofundar na histria desse belo jogo feito com amor e dedicao por parte da larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best rpg of it's category. best overall rpg of the last decade. this is so awesome. if you are looking for a medievalish adventure in an immersive microtransactionfree world with strategic combat, optional romance and some pretty entertaining situations, you have to buy it. i hope i can see more aaaaa studios take their example and make games for the love of the game and not as a means to extort money from consumers. larian just showedreminded them how its done with an awesome nonpredatory game that is achieving major success on all fronts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"dd faithfully implemented, considering it's a videogame, dephts and mechanics are astonishingly good. audio ambience is immersive, voice acting is stellar and music is a masterpiece. combat is never boring, character leveling is engaging, companions are interesting and fun. even npcs are great! the world is reactive, feels alive and full of discoveries to be made. menus can be better, and that's the only downside."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,best rpg for decade!!! baldurs gate 3 is an epic adventure with thousands of choices
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldur's gate iii undoubtedly stands among the best roleplaying games of all time. from its exceptionally deep and captivating narrative to the multifaceted characters, it is a masterpiece in the realm of computer games. every npc, every dialogue, and every quest is imbued with the spirit and atmosphere of the forgotten realms. characters aren't just companions in your journey they have their own histories, motivations, and conflicts, making them realistic and memorable. the combat system, based on dungeons  dragons rules, offers players endless strategic and tactical possibilities. every confrontation can be a genuine challenge, pushing you to carefully select party members, spells, and abilities. in conclusion, baldur's gate iii is not just a game it's a journey into a world of magic, intrigue, and heroic feats. it's an experience that will stay with you long after the screen goes dark"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a massive world with lots of quests, excellent writing, a true roleplaying game with thousands of different choices!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i'm not normally a fan of these kind of games but with the buzz surrounding it and a long weekend at home i thought i'd give it a shot. i'm so happy i did, so much to do, so much agency, sprawling unique narratives and reactionary dialogue trees that respond to my playthrough. a huge map that is packed with adventure and intrigue. also, a game that functions at launch on pc, who would of thought that was something that needed to be said... not a hint of a microtransaction in sight. i love this!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,after careful consideration and testing both upon release but also during the early access i only have one relevant sentence to describe this. now this is gaming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"there are very few game development studios who are focused on delivering a truly great game compared to their competitors, larian studios is clearly filling the gap that blizzard, ea and ubisoft are leaving in the gaming market, they clearly value passion, enjoyment and creativity over money and it shows in bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"amazing game. im so happy to see that larian, one of the only studios i can trust in, is making so big numbers on steam."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"no hyperbole, but this really is just as absolutely close to a perfect game as is possible given our current technology limits. playing this in early access, i knew that the full release was going to be outstanding, but i didnt foresee just how incredibly good it was going to be. might just be the best game ive played, and i really mean that. its amazing. play this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game is amazing. it reminds me playing old baldurs gate games and first dragon age... but it is actually better in all possible ways.. i have played for 25 hours and it is still getting better and better.. roleplaying mechanics and options and ways to go with your character are just amazing.. it is just excelent game with hundreds of hours of fun. and fun is something that is missing in a lot of aaa games in recent years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"just the best rpg ever, a must play for sure. its world, its characters, its reactivity, just everything is on top. there are so many ways you can solve quests its unbelievable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best rpg ever made, the developers are what every other company should aim to be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i love every second im playing this game! so happy i know im not missing out on quests and items just because im not paying any more than im supposed to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,one of the best games i've played. played 40 hours... still in act 1. a worthy successor to bg2.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"not having micro transactions and not wanting them alone makes this at least an 8. this is the new standard for an rpg. it's amazing that a company can actually make promises and actually deliver. 30 hours into the game and i'm still in act 1....amazing! there is soooo much to do in this game. you get xp for dialog choices, killing or for not killing. you actually get to shape your own story."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"if i don't give a 1010 to this game, i'll never give a 10 ever. this is the epitome of everything a game developer should do. abosolute perfection and attention to every detail. story amazing. characters deep and interesting. gameplay simply the best game since wotr or divinity 2. graphics top of the genre. bugs almost completely absent. this is it for me, i think even starfield will need to wait a couple of month after launch for me to pick it up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a big step up from the dos2 and that game was a masterpiece. bg3 is not only the goty, it's one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"from a nondnd player impressively expansive and immersive game, but weighed down by spots of flat design, particularly in combat liked  unbelievably large world with enough discoveries to be made throughout multiple playthroughs  highly engaging and immersive experience when not save scumming  voiceovers, ost and sound systems are great  rare game that allows for fully fleshed out multiplayer coop experience did not like  game seems to be quite faithful to general dnd systems, a lot of dicerolls that aren't entirely necessary, and very strict turn taking, and makes for a rather slow paced game  loot and leveling were mostly bland, truly exciting abilities  unique loot were quite occasional, with good portion of shinies being unusable due to different class  build  takes quite long to play out turns and events, making multiplayer progress and scheduling for working players quite difficult, there were problems finishing dos2 with same team and it's only worse now  build variance initially feels like it would be extremely open, but ended up feeling quite narrow, build choices when given were few and several ability options felt mute and uninteresting overall scope of the game is incredible and unmatched, the novelty of it will surely last a long time. however for a nondnd player, i felt that some aspects of dnd especially the ones that slow down the pace of the game, should not have translated into an onscreen video game. also, i personally prefer when combat mechanics reached deeper when it comes to synergies and combos, after a while baldur's gate 3 combat started to feel too limited to taking honest turns and influencing diceroll numbers, failing a diceroll and ending up doing nothing during your turn feels quite bad especially if you have to wait for 6 enemies to take theirs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a fantastic game with everything anyone could want from a dungeons and dragons rpg. it's the closest you can really come to playing the table top, without actually playing it. the story is great, the freedom of choice is great, the graphics are great, and the divinity style turn based combat suits the dungeons and dragons ip fantastically. this is one of my top rated games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"mkemmel, size zgrl sunuyor, olaylara, savalara farkl alardan yaklaabiliyorsunuz tek bir seenek yok."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,no greedy devs and purely done with love to gamers. game of the year. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,one of my favorite games of all time. the amount of love that was poured into making this game is plain to see.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"amazing game, fantastic graphics, environment, story, living wolrd.. but combat system should be like bg2  realtime with pause anytime.. turn based combat is sooo time consuming here.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,larian seriously knocked it out of the park with this one. a work of serious creative passion
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"combat is incredibly slow, even the smallest skirmishes drag on forever. the dialogue is fan fiction levels of awful. the companions are either annoying or not in any way interesting. to top it off, the entire game is extremely sordid and full of degenerated nonsense. it is very sad to see what larian has done with the baldur's gate ip. never again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,don't listen to the haters. this game got me addicted since it released and i can't put it down. game of the year 2023.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"im so deep in the game playing for 2 days, that i almost forgot to come and say something good about this game here. i encourage you to play this even tho dd3 rules and combat might be dry at start, you will love this adventure called baldur's gate 3. p.s the game is not a continuation of any precedent bg storygame not a joke, i cannot state how much of a contrast larian delivered against blizzards diablo iv  and this comparison is needed at least because both games were heavily expected for years and years if not for so many other reasons..."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game is huge in both ways content and quality. until now i played three sessions with my friends and we all are hyped for what's comming next every time!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i have never enjoyed a game so much in my life. i loved divinity original sin 2, and i grew up on the forgotten realms books still waiting to hear about drizzt in bg3 and this game marries those two together so well. i love the environments, the dynamic combat, the dialogue, freedom of quest order and direction, the graphics, the amazing variety of classes and multiclass combos. this game just has it all. the origin characterscompanions all have their own stories to experience, and they're even more engaging when you play as them ... this game has at least a thousand hours of fun available to those who want a game with a lot of replayability. brush up on your dd 5e knowledge before you try it, but know they don't do everything exactly how dd does."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i havent been this astonished by a game since tw3 although this game is a much more deep rpg. the amount of probabilities and choices just by playing or using different characters is incredible. a pure labour of love without any micro transactions, season passes or other gaas crap, well optimised and absolutely huge on content. like a dream come true buy this game to support this! ill buy it again on ps5 when it will release next month."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,great dnd based rpg adventure for solo play or with friends. highly recommended for those who like this genre.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this isn't a game, it's a work of art. best rpg ever made in my humble opinion. congratulations to larien studios, you've just created the game of the year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best rpg i've ever played. finally a game without microtransactions, but still making a sh load of money. how is it possible?! excellent work larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"larian studios delivers yet another masterpiece 6 years in the making! pros  excellent story  characters are colorful and unique  gameplay! turn based goodness with a lot of different paths and choices you can make to effect the story!  music is fantastic!  mastering the games mechanics is very rewarding! easy to play, hard to master. cons  tutorial could be a bit better.  act iii has some performance issues and bugs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i can't stress enough how good this game is! one of the best rpgs ever made, if not the best! this one is must play for all rpg lovers, the amount of depth this game has is surprising me everywhere. freedom and the ways how to approach every situation in this game is mindgobbling to me. larian proved once again that their team is so talented. if i could, i would personaly thank them for one of the most memorable experiences in my gaming carrier. i think that this game deserves rating of 1110"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"wow, just wow, once in a lifetime quality of game. hope it sets a new standard. no dlc, no micro transactions. every npc, object, item has 3d models and animations. characters are so well written, voice actors did a tremendous job making me care for these characters. story drives me forward and the pacing is on point. i love this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a piece of art of a video game, just amazing!!! this coming from an active gamer since 1980... have not had such a great experience since maybe the witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game is the closest video game has felt to playing actual dnd.. playing it in a group of 4 has been a blast so far.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"baldur's gate 3 have set the bar of what rpg should be. the game is phenomenal, and truly one the best gaming experience i had in a in a very long time. i can't stop singing praise about this game and i'm not even sure where to start, the game offer a rich and breathtaking environment, great voice acting, distinctive characters and classes, with tons of unqiue quests and most importantly the freedom of what you're able to do in this game without any constraint, which is a core substance that what seems to be forgotten by many rpg developer. on a side note, it could be a little intimidating for someone who never played dd like myself, but learning the game mechanics as you go is also part of the fun about it. now, the game is by no means perfect as there are some issues i like to point out, the game do have some minor bugs here and there but nothing too ground breaking and hopefully fixed in future patches. there's also random fps drops and crashes but it could be varies with different users experience so i would not go further into it. another qol that i hope they implement in the future is adding a pause button for the game. otherwise the game is just perfect, with a tons of replayable value and every time you replay the game its a different exprience and you could never get tired of it. fingers crossed that with the success baldur's gate 3 is having right now, it's a start of the revival of the crpg genre and hopefully more developers out there realized that everyone still appreciate a great game that is fully furnished and not just dlc expansions, season pass and microtransaction."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"best experience i had, since i firstly launched skyrim and the witcher 3. i liked this game so much, that i'll buy a ps5 version, just to play it again on my ps. the only concern is dd mechanics, but it has it's own charm and it's easy to get used to it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"bad attempt at turning baldurs gate into a diablo game. the story is bad, and the game play is worse. before level 4 killed vampire, hag, mindflayer, devil, harpies, goblins, ogre, gith, artifact killing lvl 2 wizard. and so  that pace i would expect to kill demogorgon at lvl 6 and bane at level 12... worse attempt at throwing the entire monsters manual at us at once..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"absolute gem , do yourself a favor and play it! no mtx bs, just pure enjoyment.."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"larian makes good rpg's and this is a game that is worth trying but after the hype this game created i am not satisfied with the game i play. i think problem is about dd. both game rules and world are not interesting. i feel overwhelmed by the game when i try to play it. open world makes it difficult to focus on an area. i still have high hopes about larian studios, i hope next game will be dos3 instead of bg4."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the ghrapics and the music is so good. the story? it's amazing. i've never played an rpg this good before! the choices in the game makes such an huge impact on the story and your companions. larian! amazing work and congratulations for your success. it's hard to find companies like yours today.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"very refreshing that the goal the developers had in mind was making the game fun, and not exploiting you for money. a well made quality game with creativity in mind and not corporate greed is a rare find lately. the story is interesting and creatively inspired, and the combat is extremely diverse and never dull or samey. if you like dnd or strategy games i fully recommend bauldur's gate 3."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"one of the only genuine rpg's of the last decade. stunning attention to detail and further proof people will pay serious money for games that aren't filled with fetch quests, battle passes and online only."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"baldur's gate 3 is a rich and immersive gaming experience, although its dense content can at times feel overwhelming for new players. it certainly takes a few attempts to truly grasp its mechanics and nuances, but once you do, it's incredibly rewarding and downright addictive. what stands out the most are the intricate backstories of the characters each one is laden with challenges that not only drive the narrative forward but also seamlessly tie into the broader storyline. every quest feels purposeful and meaningful. i haven't been this captivated by a game since dragon age origins. in essence, baldur's gate 3 is nothing short of amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,best game ever. finally a game that just works as it should and no political nonsense or micro transactions. support this company. we need more studios like larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this game has delivered on every front and exceeds my expectations of what an rpg can be. the cinematic experience is like being able to play out my own movie.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i have played this game since early access and it's been amazing to watch it grow and evolve over time. it's polished, funny, dramatic, emotional, tactical, intriguing, and compelling. this is one of the greatest rpgs ever made and this is one of those games that everyone who loves the roleplaying experience should check out for themselves!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the best rpg i have played in a very long time. tabletop type combat and tons of choices for the dialog options. this is the game i have been waiting for my whole life for an rpg that is my story the way i want my story. worth every penny of the price and better yet no microtransactions. you buy the game you get everything that is in the game. if you love rpg's you will love this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i never write reviews for games, but bg3 was so good i signed up to support them in any way i can. what a game!! my time just melts away, no micro transactions, i have nothing bad to say. must play!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"good game. one of few modern games with love and passion put into it. my favorite part about the game is how much choice you have, already from the start when making your character your choices will influence the story, all the way to how you speak to people and act."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"perfects the crpg with the huge benefits that come from the matured, familiar, and extremely popular dnd 5th edition ruleset."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i don't even want to write a review, do you like wellmade rpgs? do you like or have ever been remotely interested in dd 5th edition? have you wanted a game as good, if not better, then the first dragon age? well here it is, and if someone doesn't like this game, that's about the genre, not the game itself in most cases, in my humble opinion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,graphics   you forget what reality is  beautiful good  decent  bad  dont look too long at it  msdos  gameplay  very good  good  it's just gameplay  mehh  watch paint dry instead  just don't  difficulty   just press 'w'  easy  easy to learn  hard to master significant brain usage  difficult  dark souls  story   no story  some lore  average  good  lovely it'll replace your life  game time   long enough for a cup of coffee  short  average  long to infinity and beyond final score   6  7  8  9 10
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i don't typically play games like this that often and was fairly cautious when considering whether to buy this or not. please though, be assured that if this sort of game is anywhere near up your street  you'll absolutely bloody love this! the graphics aren't really important here, but they are good enough. the combat is excellent with a huge variety of environmental interactions to chain together. the vast array of skills, builds, classes and char customisation is second to none. the story is strong, but is enhanced by having a fantastic array of side quests to compliment it and allow you some time away from chugging right through the story. excellent game 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"the best game ever created. play this game, suggest it to your friends, do not trust anybody who does not like this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"modern, fresh, great graphics, characters, story. this aint elden ring crappy evadebutton mash type of game. this is legit great. game of the year contender, cause there is still starfield, who might show some hope in industry as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"amazing game! game of the year contender. give this game a shot. some bugs, complicated ui, it is still worth every penny."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"it's not about the graphics... it's not about the turnbased gameplay... it's about the magnificent story... it's about the freedom to play, to use the scenario to your advantage, to create your strategy, to choice your path and deal with the consequences... your money worth here, a huge game with a immense replay factor. i recommend this game to everyone, it's a must to play, or a must to try play even to who don't like of turnbased rpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"finally a developer that understands what players want in a rpg as this gives unmatched varietydepthfreedom in it's gameplay. i hired a female dwarf barbarian who has some cool perk where she gets stronger with less armorclothing on... so the game let me take everything off including underwear and she now charges into battle bare naked with just a axe and boots on and she is easily my strongest character. i didn't think i was going to like the slower turn based combat coming from games like diablo 4 and remnant 2. to compare, those games feel like babies first rpg compared to the options and depth in this combat. not only are you controlling a party of 4 but they all have their own skillsgearpersonalities. and the loot system is amazing as well as 1 chest in some random ladies house you ransacked will have amazing boots for that naked dwarf barb i mentioned earlier. i wasn't expecting to get this game but i had to jump on board once i saw the numbers on steam and i am so glad i did as this is easily one of the best rpg's ever made. even if you don't like turn based combattactical rpg's i would still buy it just for the amazing possibilities the game allows you to explore that many games lack."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"easily one of the best games i've played in recent years. story is amazing, graphics are great. combat is slow but strategic. there is no micro transactions in this game which i find rare in popular games these days."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"definitely one of the greatest rpgs of all time. larian have been at the top of their game ever since divinity original sin 1. it plays a lot like an improved divinity original sin 2 with much more interesting characters, more attention to detail, excellent writing, crazy amounts of detail relative to the scope, and an imo more interesting core game system and a much more interesting setting dd's faern. it does baldur's gate iii justice and for once dd 5th edition doesn't feel cumbersome like almost all other video game adaptations do. also, no drm, no microtransactions, no lootboxes, no battle passes, no greedy cash grab dlcs, etc. if you like crpg you have no excuse not to play this absolute masterpiece. other than dos2, the only games that's even been remotely as good on the crpg front these past two decades are dragon age origins, mass effect 2, and neverwinter nights 2, and knights of the old republic 12 yet baldur's gate 3 still manages to be leagues better than all of these."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"lorian hq  manager ok so what do we do romance wise, some gay options some straight options? writer no. manager no??? writer no we make them all gaybipan and your character can be trans legit though you don't hear anybody complaining about the game being woke because if asked, totally straight not at all gay gamers can claim they made the character straight, don't worry about it bro, i'm totally super straight alpha male. some incels were mad about the bear scene though, but they were only mad because on sight wasn't playing when they were making love to the bear.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"ive played dd for two decades, this is the greatest tabletop style video game that ive ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"larian have made the rightful successors of baldur's gate saga , a work well done, this game shows how a game has to be done"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"best rpg ever. a true one as well unlike that cash grab hogwarts legacy using rpg to just get more players. i hope other studios apply the good parts larian does here, somethings like no in game purchases, great voice acting, amazing and detailed story that tries to be natural and immersive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"what a game, loved every piece of it and will keep me going for months and years in the future. larian and from software are the only two studios, the two remaining devs still give us gamers hope, will always have my full support if they continue what they are doing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"a new gold standard for not only rpg's, but game design as a whole. while the game is rooted in the dd 5e ruleset that may present a steep learning curve for beginners, players will be quickly rewarded for learning the mechanics. the writing and world building here is a benchmark for gaming, and combat is satisfying in its habit of rewarding shrewd and creative positioning and party building. easily a 150 hour experience, stop reading reviews and go play this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this may be my favorite game of all time. so much story, beautiful graphics. depending on the person i could understand its not their cup of tea, but how can there be any negative reviews for this masterpiece. shame on you, negative reviews are for broken games and ones with ridiculous monetization."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"not a fan of these western rpgs, the character design is awful, the 34 camera is very old school and there is absolutely nothing about this game to captivate me. still i am able to recognize it is a great game for those who like the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,absolutely love this game. i preordered this as soon as i could. i loved divinity original sin 1 and 2. this brings it to a whole new level
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"an absolutely incredible rpg! from the dialogue to the characters to the horror to the humor it's all incredible. please support this game, and larian studios. larian made a 200 hour long complete game with full voice acting, fully mocapped with dynamic camera angles, and unreal levels of freedom and reactivity, and they did it without any dlc, microtransactions, loot boxes or any scummy aaa tactics. if you wanna spite corporate suits that demand more money while giving you less game, than supporting this game is how you do it. a couple bugs here and there, but they were all very minor, and did not detract from my enjoyment of the game at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"the best rpg ever created. also free from predatory practices such as ingame currencies, microtransactions, seasons and games as a service. bg3 gives you 100 distraction free quality gameplay. their implementation of the dnd 5e ruleset is great. the story, the sounds, the music, the graphics are all amazingly well put together. they evidently put a lot of love into this game. this game will give you a different experiences for at least two full runs, maybe more. and did i mention mods? the lifespan of this game is fantastic. throw all your money at larian studios. show the other studios that this type of game is more profitable then their predatory practises. every game should be like bg3. pay once and enjoy the game  without the studio constantly grabbing for your wallet as you play. hail larian studios! hail the new king! long may he reign. o7"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,incredible game!. its my first dnd turn based game. i never liked that type of combat but i pushed through it and glad i have!. the story is so exceptionally detailed  compelling. the characters your actually intrigued in hearing the story!. visually its a masterpiece!. im playing on rtx 3080 with high settings in 4k getting over 100fps!. its very well optimised!. only bug i found was a npc getting aggressive with me when it shouldnt have due to the story. but other than that top notch!. cant wait to see if the company will introduce a free movement style of combat in the future as that would make it perfect if this world was like that!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this game is truly special. it is truly rare in life to find something this comprehensive, deep, and robust. if you want to learn more about rpgs, dd 5e, turnbased combat, etc., this game is for you. if you already love rpgs, this is a true gem. at launch, it was good, and it will only get better as it settles. larian studios is an incredible developer, and i am very happy to see their success."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i played divinity original sin and divinity original sin 2, i'm a dd fan, i played a lot of mmorpg specially wow, rpg game and mmorpg game are the type of game i like most, when i saw larian working on bg3 i didnt believe it a first , at first i didnt touche the ea but then since the game was nearly on release i tried the ea and man this game is amazing ! its an ovni in today gaming circling around getting as much money from you and forgetting about the true passion of gaming, i was surprised i love the game so much ! but then the game released and i was like wtf they good do even better ? they improved every aspect of the game listening to community feedback , larian studio, just thank you , i love you guys , you gave me hope again in video games world i will enjoy this game with no transaction no additionnal feature with money just pure gaming experience with so much freedoom and an amazing gameplay thank you !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"some of my favorite games are kotor, dragon age origins, but also some different generes like, zone of the enders 2. i was waiting forever for a good rpg with modern graphics and gameplay. bg3 really goes above and beyond. if i have to criticize something is the amount of time needed to take care of items, i hope the devs or modders makes something to make it less time consuming. but that said, the story, the freedom of choice and variety of consequences, cure to detail in every single little bit of the game is astonishing. this is a masterpiece, the devs have all my respect, especially to reject the current microtransaction model of most mainstream games. also, this game has so much replayability that i'm sure ppl will keep playing it for decades. it could feel pretty complicated for whom is not familiar with dd, like myself, but there is plenty of guides in youtube that explains everything is great detail. i'm sure it will be added to my small list of all times favorite videogames. thank you to all larian studios developers for such a gem"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"best game. i am literally playing 3 games at the same time. one solo play through, and one each with two of my friends, and im still enjoying every one of them. one of the reasons why is because in each play through i have a different party composition. ill be playing this game for a long while."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,literally masterpiece! this is mustplay game. all aspects of the game are perfectly integrated and high quality made
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"best rpg made since red dead 2 and witcher 3. graphismes are amazing  with a few minor bugs, as color on tiefling horns, but larian studio is currently working on a fix gameplay is really dynamic and fluid for a tactical rpg. scenario, side quests, main quests, world complexity ... just wow i did not see a world so full of content since games like witcher 3 or skyrim. acte 1 map is huge, i didn't see other acts map yet but, the map 1 only is already big enough for a triple a game. larian studio is the new rpg god. may the actionnairs not corrupt this studio."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"im not even fan of turned base games and dice rolling... but this game really kicks in, gameplay 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"best introduction in dd , had alot of fun just burnt thru 30 hours in a weekend this never happened for a long time just play it you'll see"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,best game 2023. better than any game i have played in years. this game is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i waited for this game to be fully released, but honestly, in the last couple of days i have made so many characters and played the first few hours of the game so many times, that i think i could have played the early access and gotten even more out of it. this game is incredible. few games come along that really challenge our jaded expectations as gamers. here's the thing about baldur's gate 3 that to me, really stands out. it's so complete that it feels like a real dd game, you can choose so many different ways to approach anything, that if you want to like me play the same parts of the games as different personalities you can see a different part of the game and world every time. this game is so good, i think it's going to take over the best rpg game of recent memory for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"review s pra lembrar a nota que eu dei pro jogo jogo mt bom, agora s escrever pra passar dos 75 caracteres."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"best game i've ever played, immersive, deep, retrospectve and immeasurably horney. finally, a game that respect your time and intelligence."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"definitely the best rpg of the last 10 years, i bought the game as soon as it was available in early access and i've been following the journey, in these 3 years i haven't found a single defect in this game, unbelievable!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this is the ultimate rpg video game experience available to date. that's it, that's the review."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the worst part of this game is trying to make it through an act and not restarting multiple times just to see different interactions and possibilities. this game has set a new standard for gaming in all genres.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"simplesmente o melhor rpg que j joguei na minha duvida,  tudo muito completo e todos os personagens tem um background fantstico, simplesmente temos que agradecer a larian por essa obra de arte maravilhosa. goty 2023"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i had really high hopes, but this surpassed all of them. hard to believe something like this is still be made nowadays"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i am not a rpg or dnd game expert, but even i can see how wonderful game is this. i see they dont steal the money from gamers. they just sell a good game. and thats so rare in 2023 thats for sure. i really like my experience with this game so far. i am gonna end it. and i am definitely gonna play more than once."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this is a great game. if you like looking around and exploring there is much to discover.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"a worthy addition to the baldur's gate games of old. great use of dd ruleset, no garbage microtransactions to milk the customers of their money, great graphics and story, great character customization, and great quest design where i feel like i can approach quests from multiple angles an improvement over old bg games. the long beta process helped this game launch with far fewer bugs than i'm used to in similar large crpg releases, which are normally notoriously buggy. at this point, i'm happy to preorder whatever the next game larian studios puts out because of my confidence in their vision, talent, and products they've put out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this game is absolutely fantastic! it's everything one could expect from the baulder's gate revival and more. it reminds me of the good old days of rpgs when developers put their heart and soul into a game to make it truly jawdropping. larian hit the ball out of the park with this one well done!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i am 36 years old, and this is the kind of game that has rekindled my love for this genre. we are enterting a new era of storytelling. last time i felt like this was when i played mass effect. what an amazing game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"dnd nirvana!!!! best rpg in years. bros, we are living in the golden age of games, this year will go down as the best in gaming history! game long and hard!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i had to sign up just to review this masterpiece, i was worried it wasnt going to live up to my expectations after waiting several years for the full release and not playing early access at all. i am a massive fan of divinity so had massive hopes for bg3 and i am truly happy that larian have pulled off another special game. this is the complete package for any rpg or dng fan, larian we love you, never change. play this immediately. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"im pretty disappointed to be honest. the gameplay is super boring and uninspired. the characters, dialogue etc are great, but the game is ruined by boring combat and strategic elements."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i deliberately did not play the early access version as i wanted to experience bg3 in all it's glory, and boy am i not disappointed at all!!!! i have been playing rpg games since the days of eye of the beholder and might  magic and probably haven't skipped many games of the genre since then till present day and i can easily say that this is ranked up there amongst the best, a solid 1010 and a contender for game of the year. the gameplay, combat, graphics, voice acting, facial expressions during conversations are outstanding. thank you larian studios"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,another masterpiece from larian studios. the best game i have played this year.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i assure you guys, this game will be remembered as one of the best crpg games ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"you really start to pick up on the brilliance of this game on a second play. how everything is so familiar, yet completely different. i'm leaving this spoiler free, but my only critique is the camera controls. wonderful character creator and characters, lots of diversity of choices to the point you may get decision paralysis at multiple parts of the game. there is so much to pick, that is all very engaging. you are completely invested into your single experience. a game this special only comes along every 5 to 10 years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"worst role playing game ever. the game has poor combat, terrible party features. the story is slow and repetitive. i honestly think they butchered the dungeons and dragons franchise. the only. good thing about this game is that it has no micro transactions. if i was a board member of wizards of the coast i would furious that this game got made and i would be hesitant to have another video game based on dnd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,wow is all i can say. 55 hours in and this game is simply amazing. if you buy it you wont regret it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"a game releasing in 2023 with no season pas, no live service hook to desperately grab as much of your money as possible is very refreshing hot on the heels of the disaster that is diablo 4... an unfinished product that has the gall to try and keep taking your money while the game languishes in a broken state for what the devs promised is at least half a year. meanwhile, bg3 is fun, full of content to explore and enjoy. the combat is a big improvement over dviniy os 2, and the 5th edition dd rules fit right in and enhance everything you are doing. coop is a delight as it always is in a larian game, you can accidently clown over your friends or purposely.. and they can do the same to hilarious effect. the game is complete, and though not without bugs, you can tell the plan was to release the best product they could. there's a reason why many studios announced ahead of the bg3 release that you shouldn't expect the game to be a new standard, and that their games are simple incapable of being as good as this. they are terrified of consumers expecting them to release finished and working products for a single price without pressuring you to spend hundreds of dollars to get the full experience. you should thogh. buy more bg3s and elden rings. buy less diablo 4s. do that, and we can expect more quality games like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"been playing since the start of early access and it was already among my favorite games back then, now with the full release it might just be the greatest game i've ever played. it's my dream game in almost every regard, i love the characters, the music, the world, the choices, the combat, the abilities, everything. easiest 1010 i've ever given."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"probably the best ever representation of tabletop rpgs on pcs. incredible piece of work, full with detail. you really have to experience this game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"next to perfect! sure, there are some bugs and flaws but it incredible deep and it's so much fun to explore the world and make decisions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"an absolute once in a generation crpg. polished, fantastic voice acting, animation, environmental art, faithful to dd game systems as much as possible, and what a story! and it's big! huge amount of content, and none of it dlc or microtransaction based. you buy the game, you get the full game. huge amount of love, early access feedback and quality has been poured into this game, and it shows. game of the year, easily."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"a rare game nowadays. no battle pass, no microtransactions or shady practices. just a good and complete game. amazing production and gameplay. game of the year for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this game just made my weekend vanish. not even done with chapter 1 yet. goty for me.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"a legendary hall of famer sequel to a legendary game. if only action rpg appeals you just head your way, otherwise it's best turn based rpg of the decade by far sorry pillar of eternity or divinity . for you who don't know, bg 1 and 2 are considered as the best heroic fantasy turn by turn rpg made by bioware at tha time. fallout i and ii was the best in postapocalyptic settings for the same category. been playing in early access for while, and now the final game has shipped. in a nutshell pros  turn based tactical rpg with all the best features of that genre,  environnement interaction is top notch fights are much more vertical that can be expected,  they stayed true to the table top rpg add and lore  graphical add eye candy and artstyle.  lots and i say lots of rpg dialogue with choices, implications and consequences.  all your npc can die and has more or less an impact on the story.  i felt like the whole beast and fiends creatures were in the game.  rolling the dice is so satisfying, if the game could use connected dices i would buy them.  group management is very good inventory, roster management...  multiplayer like in your good old table top game.  music are epic and in the best of the genres.  campaign length is really nice and not overstuffed by filler fetch quests that   super replayability i have restarted during the early access, and the prologue was rather different, based on npc that died or not.. cons  cameras management could be better.  a little bit laggish on my intel i12 12900k  rtx4090 but not frame rate issue just a overall feel.  still some very minor graphical glitches  ia is kinda meh...  abandon hope of social interactions irl once your  into for about 100 hours  kinda tough where you're low level and if you have lost experience playing with level 1 characters for a while on add.  ux is not fully intuitive at first but once you get the hang of it, that's pretty fluid this game is a monster in all categories and is currently my game of the year. it definitely has that generationdefining feel."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"rating can change in time. 40h of early acces  20h after launch. all i played is act 1. a lot on multiple classes. so far feels good. there is some bug here and there, sometimes navigating characters feel clunky like d4 horse espetialy when you try to loot while moving and miss the object by even 0.01mm and some of them are small. but the 3 most important things are its fun, it has soul and its not trying to manipalate you."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,the best rpg of all time for sure. incredible work done by larian games. 1010 no doubt
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"jedna z najlepszych gier w jakie kiedykolwiek graem. mega graficzka, muzyczka i fabuka."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,masterpiece. finally a product that feels like it was made with passion and not a blank check.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this game is close to perfect. a vestige of the old days, where fun was a priority higher than some corporate metric like retention. story seems good with replayability and depth. sure, wotc has sprinkled some esg seeds here and there yet larian knows how a real story is told, respectful to all parties and without uncalled for flare. this is not a product of our time, not a new iteration, but a classic in all meanings of the word. combat is as fluid as a turnbased dnd game could be, encounters are well balanced and entertaining with lots of opportunities for an alternative approach. a lot of small improvements have been made so turns don't take as long as in older similar games. the selection of classes is also superb with modding support so you can add or change anything you want. that's a rare thing those days. now i do have some small gripes with the game, like ever horny party members similar to recent bioware games. the camera could use some preset buttons and i can't care less about the version of the game. but these are all small superficial things, i mention them out of habit, it's rare for me to leave such a positive review. if you like a good story, tactical combat or both this game is worth your money. just buy it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,usually i don't like turn based games but im really enjoying this one so far.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"finally knocked off the witcher 3, the last of us 1 and 2, spiderman, and bodies zelda tears of the kingdom. two of the greatest games ever made are rpgs, march the beat of their own drummer, and represent everything good about gaming with maximum quality and no microtransactions!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"baldur's gate 1 and 2 defined my teenage gamer years. i'm so very glad the series has found a worthy developer to carry on the legacy of those older games  and really, to exceed them in many ways. as far as i'm concerned this is as close to a perfect crpg as we're ever likely to see. i hope this provides a foundation for a renaissance of digital forgotten realms content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,they know what gamers want. my  out during cut scenes and a lot of sexy time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i won't post spoilers, so i'll keep this at a very high level. this is the best turn based rpg i have ever played. the graphics for this type of game are fantastic, the music is great sometimes i just wanted to listen to the music, voice acting very well done, the animations of the npcs are great, character creation is one of the best out there, world is very large, some of the best side quests in any game, everything feels interconnected, you care about the characters, so much choice and options, endless replay value, it's like divinity original sin on steroids, sometimes i feel like there is some artificial intelligence baked in to the game development because what they accomplished is unreal. its not all roses, there are several bugs, some slow downs, but nothing super significant, all of which will be patched in time. this is pretty much expected in a game like this. if small bugs bother you, then just wait a couple of months before starting but i don't think thats necessary. you don't need a knowledge of the previous games to play and if you were a dd fan when you are young or now, you'll be in rpg heaven."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"developers just like they did with elden ring are jealous of the success of this massive incredible game. they say its an anomaly and not a new standard. lets get it right boys, its a new standard in crpg and rpg in general. incredible game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"absolute godsend of a real roleplaying game. amazing stories, characters, locations, insane amount of choices that affect and change situations entirely. incredible amount of diversity on how you can approach situations and combat. every npc has personality to them. you can really tell the developers put their heart and soul into this project. such a breath of fresh air after playing final fantasy 16 which was a total let down. it's so incredibly rare to get a game of this quality and love. game of the decade for me personnaly... hands down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"jogo magnfico, eu como uma pessoa que no tem intimidade nenhuma com jogos de turno e com estilo de gameplay, no esperava nada desse jogo, no entanto me ganhou completamente com a gameplay, jogabilidade, grficos excepcionais, histria esplendida que te prende e te faz jogar mais e mais, com leque de dialgos abrangente, misses secundrias interessantes, uma boa variao de itens, armaduras e bem otimizados diferentes de outros game. enfim, nota 10!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,um dos melhores seno o melhor rpg's da histria. sensao semelhante a jogar um verdadeiro rpg de mesa. fantstico. one of the best if not the best rpg's in history. feeling similar to playing a real tabletop rpg. fantastic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"here is why bg3 sadly is a bad game  worst camera handling ever in a 3d rpg! tedious, imprecise, time consuming navigation on pc can't speak for controllersteam deck. larian either has no game systems designer or a really bad one.  a ui that is miles behind the uis of e.g. solasta or dragon age origins. icons and text are way too small. tooltips on abilities and spells lack important information. a spellbook that is an embarassment. the item sort function only works in one inventory menu, not in others, and there are no item filters. the list continues... when you think bethesda does bad uis, try bg3. abysmal, haha!  bad performance on my relatively fast laptop gf 3070, 32 gb, intel 13700. the music stutters and there seem to be some serious issues with the memoryheapmanagement code which result in stuttering when assets are loadingswapping.  unfaithfull implementation of 5e rules.  99 of chestbarreldead body loot is irrelevant.  landscape and dungeon graphics are oversaturated and except for some characters of really bad quality. having heard the iconic soundtracks of bg1 and 2, bg3 features one of the most unmemorable sountracks of all rpgs i have ever played, and these go back to ultima 4.  the gameplay is tedious and mostly boring, the load times 1 min on a 2tb 970 evo ssd.  turn based combat is a bad choice for bg3. anybody try to design a battle like the watcher's keep last sigil or the twisted rune one in turn based mode? happy failing!   crashes. i had 2 in the first 20 minutes in the character creation. bg3 is neither a spiritual successor of bg2 nor a good rpg. it features typical larian  gameplay with irrelevant and flat characters, zero tension and the absence of any atmosphere. typical larian style color grading makes for a walt disney compatible world full of woke boringness. sadly swen vinke and his team didn't have the slightest idea what made bg1 and bg2 great games. they just don't get the grasp of the concept of baldur's gate. what a disappointment!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,thank you larian studios for taking the time to develop this game. you're doing what blizzturd used to do before activision took them over. took 1 week off from work to play this game so far i'm loving every moment of the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"one of the best games i've ever played in my life. i thought larian could not do better than in dos ii, but they surely did. it's not just like playing bgiii, but living it, as so great is the immersion and game reaction to your choicesplay style."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,this game is a unique experience and must play! it keeps surprising me with stuff and places and dialogues!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"honestly one of the worst games i have ever played, and i don't even care that it is an original sin 2 clone and has nothing in common with baldur's gate. the game is very depraved, the dialogue is reddit tier awful, and the combat is boring and slow. never again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"jogo maravilhoso uma obra de arte em historia, enredo e universo cada detalhe incrvel para mim o jogo do ano"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"game is excellent. haven't played ea and jumped straight to the released content and i am mindblowed by quality of visuals, story and sound engineering. goty yeah!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,best crpg of all time. dos2 was a great stepping stone so that larian could reach new heights with baldur's gate 3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,i've been playing now since launch and around 20 odd hrs in ea. all i can say is they have delivered!! it's epic and could be if it continues as it has begun the best game i have ever played!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,the best crpg ever made!! i do not understand why there are negative feedback complaining about the game when it is her fault for not informing yourself before buying it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"im so  into this game and story telling, that for a fact i dont know whats real life and whats rpg anymore... maybe i need to talk to someone xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"best rpg not only for this year, its best game of century. if you like great story in games and many choosing options this is your game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this is a great game to lose yourself in for hours. is it perfect, no. it has some bugs, it has some issues, but if you love dd and crpgs, it is well worth the price tag."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the game may not deserve 10, but i had to throw one point in order to at least somehow balance the special young people who put 0."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"first time in my life... it's... perfect! c scout from team fortress 2 absolutly fantastic game! thank you, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"a table rpg translated into the virtual world. the immersion and story is the highlight of the game, apart from the fantastic armor and weapons."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"only spent a tens of hours on it, but wow this is insane. si many possibilities, so many times where the game truly blew my mind letting me saying  really this can happen ?  for sure the goty to me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"really loving it. i've never been able to get into dd before, but this game has done it. i'm hooked. and the conversations remind me of mass effect 2 with that very high level of care, delivering emotional moments like few games can."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i've played many crpg, but i haven't seen this level yet. everything is great in it the combat system, which was taken over from dungeons and dragons, fascinating and exciting plot, interesting companions with unusual storylines. larian, you are the best!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,i love this game. i played early acces for 25 hours. and now i have already spend next to 50 hours in the first part. i am a good boy in rl so i love stealing and doing bad things in bg3. the narrative is awsome. malady's voice from divnity 2 makes me feel warm and at home in this game. larian i love you for making this game. goed gedaaaan
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,really the best rpg game in the last 2 decades. larian and swen vincke deserve all the praise. nuff said..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the perfect game doesn't exi... 1010 goty. huge improvements from the ea, kudos larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,the best rpg i have ever played in my life. there is so much heart and soul in this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"incredible amount of quality packed content within a normal full priced game, that just loves to please the crowd. everythings screams passion. everything screams masterpiece, you dont need to like the combat, but you have to aknowledge its depth. just amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"my definitive vote for goty, larian managed to deliver the best rpg i've played since divinity original for 60 euro when most aaa games today are 70 bucks and incomplete. cant rate it a 10 given the bugs, clunky camera control but if you can look behind those negatives the positives are endless, beatiful character development and choices that arent limited as most rpg's are. spoilers when man can pullup unto the deaven village in the underdark and slaughter the entire clan as the akatsuki, damn that was intresting, even in act 2 there is this moment in the undderpass where you could slaughter an entire village, this choice between genoicide, peace, indifferent there is an path for almost everything. havent gotten into act 3 given i'm playing tactician mode first playthrough. we're talking about a masterpiece here where you can brutally mutilate or kill your companions or romancesex them... the paths are seemingly infinite and i'll be having ton of fun with the game and its future playthroughs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this game is perfect, a true dd video game experience, i advise everyone to play this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,its a fine game but the only thing in common with baldur's gate 1 and 2 is the name. they should have called it divinity forgotten realms and even then it's feels more like a michael bay movie than a dnd campaign. i could go on and on about what makes it not a bg games but its painfully obvious to anyone who played the first two games and their expansion packs. if you want an over the top dnd campaign which feels more planescape than forgotten realms this is the game for you.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"simplesmente uma obra prima dos jogos, estou ainda no arco 1, mas o que esse jogo j me mostrou prova o quo bom ele . larian sabe como trabalhar e tambem ama seu trabalho, isso faz toda a diferena."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the most fun and wonderful game, the story possibilities are unimaginable, very optimized, and amazing graphics, playing with friends was an amazing experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,i actually not into that type of turn based games. it's definitely game of the year 2023  story  voice acting  world  mechanics  possibilities you have to test it. it's worth each penny
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"no i don't want yet another pointless launcher, i don't want an account with you, and i don't want you harvesting my data without permission with the default being set to yes for telemetry. just the game i paid for thanks. nothing else. ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"my favorite, and no doubt surely one of the greatest video games of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"a really good game, i like it a lot, easily the best crpg of the decade, i'm not kidding, try it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,one of the games of the decade. beautiful presentation and meticulous attention to detail all around. a testament to what a studio can accomplish when understanding the source material and what the community wants. so much love and passion has been poured into this game. it's simply fantastic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the best crpg so far, good characters and quests. game of the year. bethesda, ubisoft and obsidian learn how to create rpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"game of the decade. blizzard should learn from this game how to make real quality product, not  clickers with pay to win system."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"410 to balance out the hype. just like the last big gaming releases backed by social media marketing, the release of baldur's gate 3 has again pointed to the roots of marketing hypes and public relations propaganda. people become devotees up in arms against anyone who stands in the way of its gloriousness, its holyness, its singularity. goty, goty, goty !!!, consumed and forgotten one after the other. it's sad to see how the name of baldur's gate is used for an entirely different game that is also a part of all this frenetic and agitated hollowness that is shaping the current gaming industry as well as groupthink mentality. in this context, the actual game and its content have become pretty much irrelevant. bg3 is a professional industryproduct. but it has almost nothing in common with the original 2 games. so what's the difference between bg 3 and the original two games which stayed in the memories of a whole generation of gamers?  bg 12 a personal journey with mysterious locations, epic tales, and legendary treasures to uncover. you start as a nobody that slowly gets involved in grander schemes while growing in power until your party fights the very gods that tried to exploit you. pacing is great.  bg 3 a sequence of beautiful but arbitrary set pieces with random junk loot scattered around. the story starts with a bombastic climax as your lvl 1 party is already breaking out  flying prison made out of tentacles.  bg 12 at its time an innovative and very fun combat system, real time with pause, that translated the dd rules to the computer medium and kept the narrative flowing while still providing a lot of tactical maneuverability because you could pause the action at any time.  bg 3 common and generally slow turnbased system adapted from divinity original sin where archdemons wait in line like orderly citizens.  bg 12 charming and endearing characters with a wide range of personalities. jon irenicus as an iconic villain.  bg 3 in essence and in contrast to the supposed uniqueness, the companions of bg3 act very trendy. the style is hip, the substance is square. a nod to mainstream fiction which is full of edgy antiheroes.  bg 1  2 witty and nuanced high fantasy, reflections on the human condition and the thirst for power.  bg 3 complete checklist of aggravatingly shallow identity politics, that fails to reflect that fiction can be more than just superficial representation without becoming reactionary. a disservice to truely progressive politics because of the heavyhanded moralizing involved.  bg 12 a gift by crazily talented people that wanted to share their passion.  bg 3 a fancy and stylized product based on a famous brand, made by industry experts.  bg 12 ran on an average computer, just as divinity original sin 2 which provided the engine for bg3.  bg3 time to upgrade! overpriced graphic cards have long enough been waiting for such an opportunity. after all these years, baldur's gate 3 doesn't change direction by building on its predecessors strengths, it rather escalates a sad trend by trying to assimilate the identity and brand of good old games while omitting most of the original's defining content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"best rpg game played im my life, true love devs works on this game, i recomnend you to play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"baldur's gate 3 is a visual treat, packing in all the dungeons  dragons classes we love. it feels like an upgraded divinity 2, with choices and encounters that can go a zillion different ways. seriously, if you're into dd or just looking for a wild ride, this is your game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i've played the early access for about 25 hours, and already have 20 hours in the 1.0 release. i will update the score when i've experienced more of the story, but so far this has to be one of the best rpg i've ever played. player choices that matter, graphics that are surprisingly subtly fantastic smoke, lighting effects, etc, customization like we've rarely seen before, exploration, voice acting  mocap is s tier. no micro transactions, no real dlc or ingame shop. you pay full price, you get a full game. i have yet to try multiplayer waiting on some parts for a bud's pc, but from what i've seen and read, it's a blast and i can't wait."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"amazing game! love everything, character creation, dnd system, combat, the level of immersion  in one word amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"o jogo  muito bom, a histria e as possibilidades parecem ser infinitas, ainda mais quando vc curte fazer rp de dd, tenho certeza que vou perder muitas horas nesse game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,this game is phenomenal. i find it odd people are criticizing the side characters in a game where you literally create your own story. the game runs at 60 fps on my rog ally as well so maybe the people complaining should upgrade their 970s from 2014.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,masterpiece! no rpg game has made me feel this good other then dragon age origins and witcher the wild hunt! larian studios has been making a game that you can immerse yourself in for years to come! this is how an rpg should be done!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this game is a big f... you to activision blizzard and co. no battle pass, no microtransactions, free access to deluxe editions content for early access users. in terms of content, gameplay, storytelling and dealing with its customers, the game and the company behind it sets standards. thank you larian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,this is the game that all rpg fans have been waiting for. new standart for game indusry. 1010 larian for the win! activision and ubisoft  big l.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,.        . . !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"simply incredible, this game is far beyond the scope and magnitude that any other game even tries to come close to. simply put, this could be the greatest game ive ever had the privilege to play in the entirety of my life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i played about 50 hours in early access and currently playing it in two parallel sessions alone and with my friend in online coop. and it's so fun! amazing attention to details, lighting, storytelling and its flexibility. i feel a huge love from larian in every aspect."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"eu odiava jogos de turno, a eu joguei baldur's gate 3, esse jogo foge de qualquer estereotipo de jogo, vc tem aventura, vc tem decises, vc tem combos, vc tem explorao, tudo pq o jogo te joga e te deixa livre pra decidir o que ir fazer em seguida, estou completamente imerso nessa historia maravilhosa."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"literalmente o melhor jogo que j joguei na vida,  a liberdade que um rpg de mesa tem mas transportado para um jogo eletrnico, a gama de decises e coisas que voc pode fazer  infinita e cada jogador vai ter uma experincia nica, maravilhado com esse jogo e a dedicao da larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the best rpg of the decade, bar none. can't wait for gale to fix my dark urge now lol."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"wonderful game! i am so happy that there are studios out there like larian and fromsoft still out there. this is what integrity, passion, talent, pride, and hardwork looks like. this team at larian seems unreal, when you look at what is out there. they should be proud of what they have accomplished."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,larian studios has meticulously done it again. not just making the easy choice so far in 2023 for goty. but possibly of the last 20 years. a new standard has been made for rpgs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"50 hours of playtime so far and it's already enough to be goty. the game is complete, which is rare nowadays. laran wanted to give to the players the game they deserve. and they did, perfect game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"such a feeling in playing this masterpiece had given me only elden ring, larian studios like from software, they never disappoint."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"amazing. although, i'm not a huge fan of turn based games this has so much to offer that it doesn't even matter. story, character building, class design, world, everything. incredibly immersive. 1010 game without a doubt."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"it lacks some elements that made the previous baldur's gate 2 great but makes up for it with the elements that made divinity great so... there is a monstrous work of quantity of content and quality in the writing, atmosphere and possibilities. the divinity gameplay repurposed for dd still works great. pro great customization  story, writing and atmosphere solid good gameplay limitless choices and possibilities great artdirection and music con  elements that made baldurgate unique are missing respect free and available at any moment kills a little the difficulty and weight of certain choices regarding your character my vote is 9.6 must play for who love the gdr genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"not a bad game, but a bad sequel. if the game were called divinity 3, i would rate it nine. if it was called dd original sin, it would get a decent eight. more about the differences to dd later. unfortunately, the game is called baldur's gate 3. i don't mind the turnbased combat system. my main criticism is that the game overall just doesn't feel like playing a bg game in the forgotten realms. sadly, the developers have also failed in creating iconic companions. all companions i've met so far are so unlikeable that i'd prefer to wander the sword coast which, by the way, looks like we're in california alone. besides, the npcs are so exaggerated that you feel like you're playing a level 12 party that has been leveldrained back to level 1. appearance, history, ambitions and abilities just don't match. in addition, there are numerous design decisions that dilute the dd system for no reason, for example in character creation. there are so many game sequels out there that at least somehow attempt to capture the flair of their predecessors. sudden strike 4, fallout 34 and recently jagged alliance 3 have been able to reproduce the feel of their prequels. in bg3, you get the feeling that the designers hardly cared about the originals. all in all, baldur's gate 3 feels like the little brother that tries to outrank its older siblings with cocky behavior and fails in direct comparison."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,long awaiting. played it since 2020 and it been even better now. lets meet in baldurs gate.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i don't usually write reviews, but man, this game deserves it. the new rpg standard for freedom and storytelling. if you love getting a complete game without micro transactions, xp boosts and other disgusting modern day gaming money grabbers, you have to support this game and the studio behind it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"played the game in ea. just the shere amput of choices you can make to progress is insane. no mather what choice you pick you can fail a quest you just get a difrent outcome, witch is gona bring allot of replay value to the game. the game is well deserved to be in ranks with witcher 3 and skyrim!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"as someone whos been playing crpgs since late 90s i can safely say this is one of the most impressive games ive ever touched, probably going to take my top 2 after vtmb bloodlines"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,best rpg of all time. larian did a great work hope it will continue like this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,this game is bg2  dao  dos2 all combined into one epic masterpiece. i believe we have a goty on our hands.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this is probably the closest you can get to create a perfect gaming environment for me. great story, fantastic game mechanics, and endless possibilities thanks to mods. i really hope the whole industry will take notice."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the game is a musthave for all dnd and rpg fans. it roars i'm dungeons and dragons! with all its might. i've never been more immersive in farun and didn't need 4 friends to sit at the table with me. the set of rules behind the game is a mixture of dnd 5e and onednd  which i think is very good for a video game. it's accessible and likely to appeal to a lot of people. no microtransactions, gigantic story, extremely diverse characters, thousands of ways to tackle the story and really good visuals. the animations of the characters alone are not at the highest level. otherwise, i have nothing to complain about after almost 50 hours of play. top! note contrary to what many people say, it is possible to remove party members from your own game. simply press esc during a multiplayer game, select the session item and remove the party members there. it's super easy. i have done so several times now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,as a fan of bg1 i like this one very much  i can higly recommend the game to anyone
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i'm almost 40 years old, a gamer since my childhood. i'm a huge rpg fan and i've played through every major release out there. i'm bringing it out so you can understand that when i call baldur's gate iii a masterpiece and the single best rpg in decades, i'm dead serious about it. the game has literally everything engaging story, interesting characters, great combat, superb voice acting and sound design, beautiful graphics and a music that will get into your head like an illithid tadpole. larian studios has made some great games in the past, but baldur's gate iii had no reason to be that good. you may call it an anomaly, you can say it's the new gold standard for the industry and you won't be wrong, but point is, i'm not even sure if we are ever going to get anything remotely as excellent."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"one of the very few quality games of 2023. no microtransactions, no battlespass, no awful multiplayer for brainless tiktok  forthnite fanboys. just pure old school fun a game with incredible storytelling and thousands of choices in a spectacular game worth every penny if you are a crpg fan and a scope that's only rivaled by very few other games, if any nothing short of a revelation in these dark days of gaming."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"truly impressive freedom, i just wish it ran better on older hardware as graphicaly it dosn't seem like it should be so demanding."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the amount of details in this game sets a new standard for rpg games. so far 1010, no doubt about it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this is quite simply a masterpiece, and it is more than the sum of its parts. a shining example of what can happen when developers with a genuine love and passion for the setting and game world put in their all and reach for the stars, and manage to pull it off. this game is an amazing achievement, and it deserves the positive reviews and accolades, as it is sure to be a new benchmark or standard. well done larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this is the best game i played for the last year. high level of quality, unbelievable variables of roleplay. this game is real rpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,baldur gate 3 is the platinum standard for making rpg. true rich experience which offers huge amount of content  replay value years to explore. larian have literally made an anomaly rpg which will make other developers jealous how they did it. it's an phenomenon experience  if you are rpg player you should not miss out this experience in your life time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"didn't think i'd say this, but i found a better game than divinity original sin 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"wizard of the coast had the good idea to give this licence to larian, i was expecting a lot during the ea and i'm not disappointed at all, this what i could wait for a baldur's gate game. the turn based system is great even if it makes some things easier and i find it more tactical than the half real time of old bg. a great game with no doubt at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"juego obligado para cualquier amante del universo de dd, hasta el momento solo llevo 20 horas, pero dentro del gnero ha sido de las mejores experiencias que he tenido, si te gustan los rpg por turnos, dale una oportunidad"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"not only the best game of the year, but one of the top games in history. freedom, nice story, great companions, beautiful graphics, good performance even in mid laptop, and even better than dos 2 battles. thanks larian guys."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"larian, a great and excellent studio, competent and creative. after years of experiences with the divinity series, larian returns with one of the best games of recent years. congratulations to the developers and everyone involved in the project, for their hard work and dedication, delivering a rich, immersive and fun game. proud of larian for listening to feedback and always improving their product by listening to the community  let this set an example in the gaming industry."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"rarely do i post a review after five hours play. i remember well the previous two titles even though i never played much of them in their day. i was sceptical about bg3 due to turn based more strategic combat. i was hooked the moment i started playing. this is a one of a kind video game with so much detail and love poured into its design. everything is crammed with detail and choice. visually it's sound, audio is sublime, gameplay is excellent and the pure freedom at every turn is mind blowing. this is rare for me to write and be knocked back by a game in modern times...over 40 years in gaming and bg3 has restored faith that a dev team still makes real games with heart and soul. never played dd games but know of it. that's irrelevant as it's an incredible gaming experience regardless of your choice of interests."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"best game i've played in a long time. great graphics, strategic and deep gameplay, sublime story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,this is a definition of 1010 game. i missed the original baldur's gate. time to catch up. thanks larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,i didnt think it was possible for them to make a baldurs gate as good or even better than bg2. but here we are 23 years later and bg3 deserves the praise of being one of the best rpgs ever
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the best game made to date. i recommend everyone to give it a try, even if you are not familiar with the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"updated i am now on my second playthrough, in a coop campaign with friendsfamily. the game is even more fun when playing together with people you likelove. i am a dungeon master running a campaign in 5e, and i swear this is as close as you can get to actually playing dd with a competent and fun dungeon master. i'm not sure why people are trying to review bomb this game? i guess some are starfield fans a game that i also own, that i find enjoyable when it is heavily modded, otherwise i'm having a hard time standing it in it's base game, it is so shallow compared to bg3. i am a dd playerdm, and a veteran of old school computer rpgs planescape, bg12, nwn1, kotor, dao etc, and i fully endorse this game. don't let the haters disuade you from getting this game, most of them seem to be suffering from mental troubles to be frank, and if you check the accounts most of them are newly made and the only game reviewed is bg3. i dislike these mental midgets, they rolled a 1 when they left their mothers wombs. original review i am a dungeon master in 5e, and have been playing tabletop since 3e. one of my all time greats is bg2, and i also love neverwinter nights, planescape torment, and bg1 and also dragon age origins. this game is immense, very well crafted. a lot of the dialogue is intelligent, and full of humor just like many older rpgs. i was afraid that there would not be another rpg like this, for many years, or perhaps ever. the witcher 3 was also great, i love that game, and this is just as good but now i'm playing as a drow bard called turnip jansen, instead of the eminent geralt of rivia. as a dungeon master, and an avid pc player of computer rpg, i can say without a doubt, this is as close you will get to the true experience of dnd with an experienced and dedicated dm, as you can get in a single player experience. this game has an insane replay potential. if you are remotly interested in rpg, you should do youself a favor and get this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,one of the best games i have played recently. i have had an excellent time playing this game my one complaint is the camera controls at certain times i've had to battle the camera angles and control of it. other than that this game is a masterpiece. other then needing a few bug fixes which should be fixed in no time excellent game 910
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,great game. as close as a pc game can get to tabletop 5e. i hope they keep making more 5e games. to give me something to play between dnd sessions.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the rpg i was was waiting for such a long time. everythig larian do is masterpiece, so as dos 1  2, this bg3 don't lie about this talented studio. i've don't finish the game yet, but i can already say that it's my goty, no doubt about it !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"for me, the main problem is that the game is incredibly slow, as most of the time is just walking and talking. literally 25 min combat and then 2 hours of walking and talking. i'm not a diablo fan, far from it, but there is just sooooo much sleepinducing content in this game. i just uninstalled it after 13 hours of play cause it was just....boring! i appreciate the devs taking risks in adding nudity and love scenes. god knows everything is so fing safe these days that it's so predictable and lame. btw, female characters with beards and ? cringe! i don't hate it or anything, i just think it's cringe, but i guess every company has to pay that esg tribute and show that they're willing to play ball with the political fad currently in power."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,bg3 is a game with many improvements over the early access version and many different outcomes for a single choice. interesting combat and interactions keep you glued to your computer.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the only thing this game could do better, would be to allow a 5th coop player. but that's how the internet goes these days, 4 is all we get anywhere. this is a game by developers who want you to  enjoy playing their game.  enjoy finding loot while playing their game.  level at a reasonably fun and enjoyable rate while playing their game. buldars gate 3 is not interested in slowing your gameplay loop down artificially so you have to play more in order to achieve any of the above"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"after 45 hours of early access and 20 hours on launch version this game is blowing me away. if you like rpgs you will love this boundary pushing offering from larian studios. a labour of love, a genuine work of art. if your not a fan of crpgs then it maybe less attractive to you but it still could be worth trying, you may get into it. industry wise it represents something more full game, no microtransactions, no season pass, no bs and so far constantly delighting and surprising me by over delivering."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,after dos2 larian studios is improved their work. you can see that in bg3. it is the best rpg in the world right now. you may have trouble to adjust combat but after you get use to combat mechanics you will have a lot of fun in this awesome game. story telling 1010 combat 910 cinematics 9.510 dialogue 1010 you can talk almost everyone and sometimes you may find secret details about story. to sum up you should play this game it is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this game is amazingly fun, as well as smart. the gameay can be challenging, without feeling like the rng is solely to blame, and makes victories feel earned. the rules of the pen and paper rpg are translated beautifully, and the environment feels as though you really have total freedom, even in a nonoprn world game. the characters are compelling and the story choices and consequences are varies. you could ask for more, but only because there is the reality that this game needed to release at some point. what it does, it does masterfully."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,larian and from software are the only two studios that i trust. excelent work.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"to date, i'm convinced it's one of the best games i've played in more than a decade. imo, this should be goty 2023, perhaps 20242030 as well xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i made an account just to review this. it's brilliant, just buy if you are at all interested in rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"sem sombra de duvidas o melhor rpg do ano e um dos melhores da decada, larian pegou a formula que usou com o dos 2 e elevou a outro nivel, definitivamente um must play pra qualquer f do genero."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i love this game, cant stop playing! the music and atmosphere is amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"usually i don't write reviews, i just created my account and this is going to be my first review. i used to be a hater of turned based combat games, i remember trying ff in playstation 1 and i just hate it, since then turned based combat games never interested me, until....i tried divinity original sin 1, oh boy...i was hooked, addicted, in  because of larian i'm a huge fan of turned base combat games, and i played many others and enjoyed them a lot. baldur's gate 3 is no difference, actually it  is a masterpiece! i'm still in act i discovering tones of things and learning about my companions better. even a random npc's have something interesting to share! every time i step away from the game i start thinking about the story, what is next? why this is happening? who is behind this? where i should go next? you know the storytelling is damn good when you think about it when your pc is off. i don't want to make this review long. thank you larian for the hard work, i'm really in love with this game! goty to me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"was hopeful that a game that was 120 gb to download wouldn't have as many broken cut scenes... i'm like at a 50 success rate of making it through a cutscene where any of my party doesn't just clip through and ruin the whole experience. gameplay and everything else is great, but if i have to watch a movie, it should be complete. i'll revisit the game after a few updates and patches. fantastic game otherwise, play it if you think there's a smidge of hope you'll enjoy it cause you will."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"the game has some really wonderful aspects, but before buying really watch some streams to see if the turn based xcom style combat is for you. i think the thing that really brings the game down is the world navigation is flat out terrible. it's so hard to navigate that it makes an already slow type of genre feel even slower when you have to deal with all the navigation issues. that's not a patchable thing either and it's like other larian games. i think it's worth playing if you have hundreds of hours to explore the good stuff and overlook the janky aspects of the game. the character performances and models are top notch. i've found myself at times loving it and then i just face palm when a game in 2023 doesn't have a smart save feature. punishing players for forgetting to hit f5 before combat says volumes about the types of stuff you have to look past."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is an absolute masterclass. designed by quite possibly the most passionate and community sensitive development team i have seen for a long long time. larian have segmented their legacy as one of the greatest and most trustworthy developers of the modern day era. they are more like passionate gamers that know how to code. they listen, communicate and embrace their community in ways i wish other development studios would do. sadly the corporate machine has crashed through the gaming landscape in recent times driving the soul and gamer driven ethos to near extinction in favour of corporate greed and lining the purse strings of the already wealthy. to me the most important thing larian have achieved here is not just making an absolutely phenomenal game, but they have restored my faith that maybe the future landscape of gaming is not completely lost. even if you don't like crpg's, get behind this group of amazing developers, lead by an amazing leadership team. show other companies that is ok to make games that don't try to squeeze every single drip of blood from the community in favour of making games driven by passion. made by gamers for gamers. the way it should be. 1010 don't miss it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,best rpg of the decade. i never seen any game like this before. game of the year 2023
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i find it funny that the only bad reviews this game has is people that don't get the gameplay. this game is a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. a love letter to the community from larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i'm on act 1 but already planning the next playthrough... best rpg ever made. soooo good.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,absolutely wonderful rpg of the highest caliber. sets a new bar for the genre.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"timo jogo, incrvel uma empresa de pequeno porte faz o que empresas gigantes no consegue, parabens"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"absolutely a masterpiece. incredible gameplay, very dynamic, perfect multiplayer balancing, great customization, and simply, made with love. 1010 goty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,one of the best rpgs i ever played. larian is a new bioware.thanks for an amasing games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"baldur's gate 3 is one of those games that manages to get close to the great crpgs of yesteryear like arcanum, dragon age origins and obviously baldur's gate 1 and 2. its story is interesting, its graphics are pretty good, it's playable in coop and it's narratively faithful enough to its predecessors to think it deserves every hour of gameplay. it could definitely be my goty this year."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i've been waiting for her for 2 years, and i registered here to tell everyone. it is a masterpiece"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"loving the game so far, i played during early access as well and they have made a lot of improvements. i highly recommend it. the only nit picks i can say are there are a few visual bugs from time to time, but have not had anything large or anything that affected gameplay. i'm talking very minor, like your character is angled a little wrong in a cutscenes so they clip through a pod they're supposed to be in for the 2 seconds before the pod opens. gameplay is fun and polished, if you like dd you should give this game a shot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"baldur's gate 3 is a masterpiece that blends breathtaking visuals, captivating storytelling, and seamless gameplay. as a dnd enthusiast and firefighter, i give it a glowing 1010. highly recommended for rpg fans"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is without a doubt one of the best games that i have ever played. there is so much content to go through in this game that you could likely do 4 to 5 plays through it and still find new things to do. the combat is turn based, which is polarizing to some people, however it is the quintessential dungeons and dragons experience put into a video game. larian studios could not have done better with the mechanics of the game, as they are literally a video game version of the most popular tabletop game ever made. the turn based combat is among the best of any turn based game that i have ever played. the environments that the combat takes place in are also very diverse and well crafted with a very good usage of vertical space that many turn based games leave out. the attention to detail in this game is incredible, with in game books all having different looks and shapes to them, even though it would have not mattered to lost players to have them all be the same. the story is extremely engaging, and your choices throughout the game make an incredible impact on events that take place. your choices, or even lack thereof, can make the difference between many things that can have quite considerable impacts on your gameplay."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i was never interested in isometric or top down rpgs, i never played dnd in my life. i actually always despised that camera angle. and i love this game especially we can zoom in like in a 3rd person game. the possibilities the game give you are insane. the game is super detailed and well thought through"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"with over 50 hours in early access and more than 15 hours two days after full release, i believe baldur's gate 3 to be the best crpg to date. the level of detail, smoothness and quality of the gameplay is beyond words, it is near perfect for the genre. you can expect a few bugs and glitches till the next patches arrive, but nothing really bothersome. story wise it is well done and very interesting. the only thing that really frustrated me in the game is the inventary system... larian really needs to come up with something better than what they current have. but don't be afraid to give it a shot, it is time well spend!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the game is an improvement on dos2 which was excellent. it feels like dd on the computer. biggest thing that is lacking is more body types for the character creation.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"one of the best rpgs ever made. story, graphics, characters..everything is just so good"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,",    !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"everything promised and more. incredible depth, reactivity and visuals. animation and cinematography is next level!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"might be the best game i've ever played. truly a masterpiece coming from a developer with a deep love for the ip and the genre. the bugs and minor gripes i have aren't even worth mentioning because it is clear larian is listening and will fix them. if you buy one game this month, year, decade, generation, or lifetime, let it be baldur's gate 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,bg3 is one of the best and maybe the best crpg ever made. i've beein playing the game since early access and now game turned into a gem. must play for everyone who loves and appreciates rpg.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i fkin love this game. everything works and i can spend 200 in one go! just stop to reading this reviews and go buy for a copy for you!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"somehow larian has topped dos2....which i thought would be impossible. a special game, more like 9.5 due to some bugs, but 10 is close enough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this game is one of the most amazing rpgs ever created. larion has cemented their selves as a legendary studio after this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i don't care the score, thanks for larian, you build a dnd world and i enjoy it, thats enough"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"excellent rpg, very captivating, i want to play without seeing the time pass, i haven't had any bugs so far. playing with all graphics maxed out with an rtx 3070"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the only people giving this a 0 are people who literally want this to be like diablo 4. this is a 1010 game. also not sure why some people are saying this is an amazing game and then giving it a 0 rating.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"so far, my experience has been very positive. this is a beautiful, lovingly crafted game. i'm still in the first act which i also played during early access only had yesterday evening to play so far. pc gamers, this is the 2023 title that's must truly made for us. some quick points and bug experience report 1. very welloptimized. 4k60 which i fixed, max settings and the game doesn't even blink nvidia rtx4080 graphics card, i9 13900kf cpu, ssd. doesn't even come close to maxing out gpu use. 2. 1.0 is surprisingly bugfree. 3. lots of interactable npcs and other content added in act i 4. story, character development, and writing, are all superb, all blowing away even previous larian titles. 5. i find toggling between multiple choice wheels when using controller to be immersion breaking. i'm very much convinced that this game is best played with keyboard. 6. nothing more than minor bugs and inconveniences. the biggest one i observed is that i think the economy may be a little broken to the player's advantage. i made a couple of purchases that i don't think i was properly charged gold for, or, at least, the right amount of gold. also, a minor inconvenience at the launcher. the launcher defaults to dx11, forcing one to remember to change the setting to vulkan the more sophisticated graphics api option each time, at launch."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is the best game ever made, with such indepth contents and complexity. of course there are a some bugs, but totoally undestandable and will be fixed asap."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,a real dd game.this is how every gaming company should make games.they listenthis is such a piece of art!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"baldurs gate 3 is nothing less than an absolute masterpiece. from the superb dd 5e mechanics implementation, to the fine graphics and superlative voice acting, to the rich and deep narrative, it is in my opinion one of the best crpgs ever made and certainly the best of this decade! i really enjoyed early access but i am so looking forward to many hours playing the full game. congratulations to everyone at larian studios on releasing a fantastic game!  and thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,one of the greatest rpg in my opinion. amazing story and companions. i've been waiting for this game for a long time and i'm happy with the result. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"what a beautifully crafted game. its easy to see right away that a lot of heart and care has gone into this game, something sorely lacking in most games today."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,an absolute masterpiece for fans of the genre and a sign that there's still hope for modern games. i only hope there won't be too much negativity due to people writing unnecessary reviews cause they're not used to crpg's as already quite a few exist here p
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"a point and click game boring gameplay decent story the graphics are good the voice acting is okay and they put the cutscenes in third person instead of them popping up on the screen which is cool. this review is not to bash the game at all, but to give it the things that people seem to be missing about this game definitely the most overrated game this year but this will differ from opinion to opinion some people have different issues from their own experiences just like mine as well as the missing issues from tears of the kingdom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"an absolute masterpiece. i played the original baldurs gate game when it was released, then its sequel, and now more than 20 years later, bg3! it exceeds all my expectations. a classic that will stand next to pathfinder wrath of the righteous."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"20 hours in, this is easily my goty already. i noped out of ea about 1 hour in as i knew it would be my  this, this is just next level. characters, writing, combat, world building and adventure....everything i wanted for my 22 year wait. 1010. goty 2023."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"after 6 hours of gaming baldur's gate 3 after launch i actually shed a tear because i was so happy about how good the game is. i thought i would hate turn based combat vs. real time with pause, but it really is fine, although a bit tough to get the hang of. i highly recommend this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,what a masterpiece. perfect rpg. made me join metacrlico just to give it a 10.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"unreal quality. i've spent 35h in early access and was worried i'd get bored before i redo this part  nope, just blasted through it in 25 hours... again. it's unreal how full of quality content this game is. might be my game of the decade. i never thought that a game this calm and slow when it comes to pacing of action might become one of my all time favorites."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"after two great divinity original sin games, larian put all that it learnt in practice, added great cinematic elements on top of it and filled it with tons of content. this is possibly my game of the year and one of the best rpgs to ever have been released. also no monetization, no fomo, just you and your game. enjoy, pals."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"60 dollars for a microtransactionfree, battle passfree, subscriptionfree, nonlive service game in the year of our lord 2023... wild."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"when you play this game you wouldn't believe you're in 2023, where the gaming industry became a  show. an independent company makes a game with so much attention to detail and soul that is beyond anything you'd think is possible. great graphics great gameplay amazing fully animated and voiced dialogues and cutscenes. story so far  you in and if it continues with this momentum will most definitely stop you from getting any sleep. 1010 audio design and music. thousands of choices and customization options for your character and party. what else can you ask for ?! if not being a niche genre i'd say this game is gonna be goty no competition, which i believe it still can do with how much people who never played crpgs are getting into it just because of this game. tldr  best rpg of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,one of the bestest games i ever played. good story
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this game a critical sucess. it's unbelievable what laruan studios achieved here and i am glad to have supported this game in early access!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"seriously please give larian the praise they deserve. this is one hell . the amount of branching paths is mindblowing. i really don't know how the devs pulled this off. the ways you can approach every encounter is just insane! i cannot praise this game enough. please try it for yourself! the voice acting, dialogue choices, and real role playing are perfect. this is a 100 hour game you will want to replay over and over to try different classes, races, and choices. larian just proved, again, they are the best game developers going right now... by far.. just wow. i cannot put into words how good this game is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this is an absolute masterpiece. one of the best if not the best rpg's in a decade. this is truly a one of a kind gem that absolutely has to be experienced.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"im really trying to like this game but the turn based combat is just so clunky the gameplay experience is not enjoyable. also with the overwhelming amount of choices i keep wanting to know what would happen if i pick the other choices and end up reloading save files a lot, so its taking me forever to make any progress in the game. idk i guess ill keep trying to progress. hoping the combat will click at some point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i love this game so much. besides minor bugs and technical issues here and there it far and exceeded all my expectations.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this game is an easy 10 as far as user scores go. you have so much freedom in regards to how you want to play and how you want to interact with the world. the combat is my favorite kind of combat for rpgs, which is tactical and turnbased. if you're playing with friends and are next to each other on the turn order, you can move at the same time, which has led to some fun shenanigans. the writing is amazing, the dialogue is great, the characters are cool. i dig it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"now i can die peacefully, i wont never play anything with this level of perfection in rpgs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"all the best parts of your favorite classic crpgs in a new shiny box. honestly, probably the best crpg the world has seen yet, and the first to become a mainstream game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"60 dollars for a microtransaction free, battle pass free, subscription free, nonlive service game in the year of our lord 2023. . . wild."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"so far the best game of this year and only thing close is zelda, this game is big really big and everything feels great, the characters, the animals everything just fits really well and makes one of the best rpgs i have ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"reatividade, escolhas com significado e consequncia... esse jogo  o melhor rpg de todos, simples assim."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"despus de dragn age orgen nunca pens q crearan una obra maestra,el juego es muy completo muy difcil de superar,recomendado 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,a game that actually works!? isnt infested with chinese market tactics?! a a full game??? woaaa. this company has gone far and beyond delivering us an actual masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"best rpg of 2023 and maybe of history. the story, gameplay, class, animations, conmversations and lore in general is the best that i played long time ago. i think really this will be the 2023 goty at least until starfield released. a game that all rpg lovers must play without exepction."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"best rpg released in decades. the early access was great on it's own, and the full launch has surpassed my already high hopes. both the rpg and combat elements are amazing for an rpg in this era, and the devs are already hard at work fixing release bugs. monks are a little wonky, probably because they weren't in early access and had no player feedback, but hopefully they'll address some of the issues and general feedback on them in the next month or two."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,best rpg game ever! i am suprised that this kind of game would be so great.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is best rpg game ever! just try to play it and take best expirience! thx, swen and your best team! make more games to show another developers how they must make games! optimisation also fantastic! i can't choose 1510, change for this game metacritic!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"baldur's gate 3 is a true evolution to divinity original sin 2 while also porting over dungeons  dragons 5e mechanics to nearly everything you do. this is the only game i've played that actually feels like dungeons  dragons aside from disco elysium, though that had no combat mechanics. baldur's gate 3 is finally out of early access and fully released, and it is a masterpiece of roleplaying. it is a game that lets you create your own story and adventure in a vast and rich world, full of choices, consequences, and possibilities. you can play as one of the premade characters or create your own from scratch, choosing from a variety of races, classes, backgrounds, and skills. you can recruit up to three companions to join your party, each with their own personality, goals, and secrets. you can explore the sword coast and beyond, encountering friends and foes, allies and enemies, mysteries and dangers. baldur's gate 3 is not just a faithful adaptation of the tabletop game, but also a stunning visual and audio spectacle. the graphics are gorgeous, the animations are fluid, and the environments are detailed. the voice acting is superb, the music is epic, and the sound effect design is wellmade for the kind of game it is. the game also runs smoothly on pc, despite being a huge and complex game. overall, baldur's gate 3 is an impressive achievement that deserves praise and recognition. it is one of the best rpgs ever made, and one of the closest to emulating the experience of tabletop dd. it will likely go down as one of the greatest rpgs of all time, if it hasn't already, but especially so once the workshop modding support is added to enhance replayability. all future rpgs will be compared to this game as they used to be compared to skyrim and the witcher 3. it is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, days, or even weeks, and even months or years later you'll find new things you haven't seen before on a previous playthrough keeping you engaged and wanting to come back for more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i remember playing baldur's gate 1, which came on 5 cds and 2 additional ones for the expansion. i played it a lot with a friend from school. it was exceptional game as well as as bg2. at that time i thought then even if bg3 will be ever released it will not match it's predecessors... but it exceeded them! well done to whole larian studies!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this game is truly magical. i had already spent 100 hours in early access and i was worried that i would get bored by the time i reached the new content. however, that was far from the truth. this is the best rpg i have played in a long time. it brings dragon age origins, the old baldur gates game, and divinity original sin 2 in a beautiful hug. can't wait to play this game over and over again! you can also feel the love that larian has put into this game and the result is just beautiful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the best dd game out there and it's not even close. you can literally do anything you would've been able to do in an actual tabletop dd setup. a true masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,u guys wanna know what rpg is? play this game. then you can compare it to other shells with rpg in a title.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"game is, ok, nothing beyond it, too expensive, graphics ok, good history, but without action. probably not my type of game, but, is not good as people are talking..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"one of a kind, the best rpg i've ever played. i can tell i'll spend many years replaying it and never see the same thing twice"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"instant crpg masterpiece with decisions that matter no generic content, everything thoughfully handcrafted no ingame payed content from a team that love what they do  you can feel it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this game is amazing and restores my faith in modern video games developers. i hope more aspire to be like larian.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"fantastic game, might become my all time favorite game. has everything you could want. good action, great story and characters"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"baldurs gate 3 is a game that lets you create your own story in the world of dungeons  dragons. you can choose from a variety of races, classes, backgrounds, and abilities to customize your character, and then embark on an epic adventure with up to three other players or companions. you can explore a vast and beautiful world full of secrets, dangers, and opportunities, and interact with hundreds of characters and creatures. you can also shape the world and the story with your choices and actions, as well as your dice rolls. the game is very immersive and engaging, as it gives you a lot of freedom and agency to play the way you want. you can use stealth, diplomacy, combat, magic, or even persuasion to overcome the challenges you face. you can also use the environment and the objects around you to your advantage, such as setting traps, throwing barrels, or pushing enemies off cliffs. the game also has a lot of humor and charm, as it allows you to do some silly or creative things, such as talking to animals, transforming into other creatures, or casting spells that have unexpected effects. the game is also very faithful and accurate to the rules and mechanics of dungeons  dragons, which is both a strength and a weakness. on one hand, it makes the game very authentic and realistic, as it simulates the tabletop experience in a digital format. it also makes the game very challenging and complex, as it requires a lot of strategy and luck to succeed in some situations. on the other hand, it also makes the game very restrictive and frustrating at times, as it limits your options and abilities based on your class, level, spell slots, armor class, etc. it also makes the game very dependent on rng random number generator, which can make some outcomes feel unfair or unsatisfying. overall, baldurs gate 3 is a game that i would recommend to anyone who loves roleplaying games or dungeons  dragons. it is a game that offers a lot of fun and excitement, as well as depth and replayability. it is a game that is still in development, but already shows a lot of promise and potential. it is a game that deserves your attention and support."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,beter than any game i have played in years. it takes the crpg genre to an entirely new level. there is a reason the rest of the industry fears this game and has been calling it an aberration and telling customers not to expect anything as good as this ever lol.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this is a terrific game you dudes. give praise when it is due!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,uma verdadeira obra de arte. criado com carinho nos mnimos detalhes. tendo um universo de escolhas e todas elas com um peso particular.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,game of the year.   .        aaa.        bg3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,great game so far. seams like i can spend 100 hours in this game. i will update the review once i finish it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this game has been long await and is delivering a great experience worthy of the baldur's gate name. the story and narrative are very well told and for the style of game the graphics are amazing. however it is not perfect. the devs took a lot of liberties with the dnd rules, even flat out ignoring many. they spent a lot of time bragging about character creation, but the system is actually fairly lame and instead of making it more robust they felt the need to add gentelia to the game. this is a great game and worthy of your play time if you like crpgs. it is easily one of the best crpgs on the market right now. however it does not deserve a 1010 or even a 9 with so many ways they threw out the essence  that was supposed to be about the dnd experience. maybe a little less time designing a slong system and work effort in keeping to the dnd ruleset."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"we are facing the best rpg of the decade, it has so many options that at first it seems that it can overwhelm but they managed to do it so well that at no time did i feel confused with its mechanics"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"a spellbinding and enchanting entry in to the widely acclaimed baldur's gate series. 23 years after bg2, larian has managed to make a game that built on the original rpg elements, while bringing forth high quality graphics, character depth, an imaginative narrative, and player choice to the forefront. an instant classic that has raised the bar for all past and future crpg games."
