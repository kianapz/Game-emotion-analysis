RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,great game after a few years of updates! i really like the amount of builds you can do in this game and weapon variety. story and side quest are also great! spoiler i finally avenged rebecca spoiler
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"it was not what they promised. it was complete shit on release. now, it is not even good. it is great. i love it. definitely one of the best games of all time. do not play without phantom liberty"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i've played through this game a few times over and each time i get more connected to this world. with games you'd think once you figured out the mechanics you'd start minmaxxing and skipping dialogue you've already heard but not with cyberpunk. i started paying more attention to quests. then i started doing what my character would do not just what i thought would get me the best outcome. five playthroughs later i find my self reading every data shard, checking every terminal, and blasting all the songs. i'm not gonna explain what this game and the cyperpunk genre means to me because i can't. just know you'll love this game no matter what... but if you take your time, if you really take it all in and open your soul to it there's a deep catharsis to be found in this world that doesn't care"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"story is very good on the base game but in the phantom liberty it becomes great. i played the game when it first released on ps4, i can say it was the worst experience then but now i played it on update 2.22 and its one of the great game i can say at least on pc it is running like its a tech demo. i am playing with rt and its a treat to my eyes on night, in day time you will not notice it much but in nigh its a totally different story. if you are not getting fps try fsr 3.1 frame gen mod its works great if you have locked 60 fps then with this mod you can get around 120 fps with rt. i have around 150 screenshot taken because of how good it looks. get the game with the dlc guys its a must. hoping there would be sequel to this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"1010 game  amazing story  great gameplay for a shooter  gorgeous graphics and great optimisation. path tracing is playable with a 4070 at 1080pdlss. 4560 fps in most areas. with mods that reduce bounces, could go even higher with minimal fidelity loss  city and level design is one big eye candy. only drawback is no optional third person, but the immersion in first person is top tier. played this game since 1.3, so seeing the problematic child finally grow up to be a star was almost tear jerking."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"i got the base game along with phantom liberty dlc, and the length of the game was extensive. the quests just don't stop coming. this game has 13 alternate endings, mind you. many choices. graphics are great. no more bugs like at the launch of the game. many memorable characters. enough memorable quests. game makes you to invest in it. but the gameplay is chill and relaxing. it is a technical achievement and also a great rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"bought it first time way back when it launched, it ran crappily even at potato graphics so i refunded. fast forward to the game's patch 2.21, bought on sale. i can now play the game without frustration. i wish the draw distance and lighting in vanilla was better though these can somewhat be adjusted to liking via mods. fun large map lots of things to do. find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. are you the cool stealthy ninja? or are you rambo? or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? or go cyberpsycho? plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. storywise  no spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. nothing forced. pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. wish there were some followups to see the consequences of some choices ala witcher 3. wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well. voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. keanu is breathtaking as well. as of feb 2025 this game is 910"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"excuse me, waiter? yes, please tell the chef that, while we may have disagreed initially, now that its cooked for four more years this dish is perfect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i'm telling yall, this is already better then gta 6. i mean roackstar probably isn't going to change the gameplay formula, its gonna be another cover, auto aim and shoot then drive around and do the same thing 100 times. cyberpunk actually has a fleshed out game play system with tons of routes to choose from and with proper rpg elements so it has a lot of replay value versus gta."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is a game that somehow went from being one of the most disappointing launches ever to one of the best openworld rpgs you can play right now. after years of patches, updates, and the phantom liberty expansion, the game finally lives up to most of its potential. the world of night city is insane  its dense, vibrant, and feels alive in a way most open worlds dont. the city design, characters, and atmosphere are easily some of the best in gaming. every street, alley, and skyscraper feels handcrafted with insane detail. the story is dark, emotional, and filled with moments that actually stick with you. keanu reeves as johnny silverhand somehow works perfectly, and phantom liberty only adds more depth, new characters, and one of the best expansions ive ever played. combat is fast, brutal, and fully customizable. you can run around hacking peoples brains, go fullon guns blazing, or build yourself like a cyberpsycho tank. the rpg systems finally feel like they matter, and the skill trees let you really experiment with different playstyles. that being said, the game still has its issues. some bugs still exist, ai can be dumb, and the open world sometimes feels like its missing that extra bit of life when you step away from the main quests. but the amount of improvement since launch is insane, and the current version of cyberpunk 2077 is actually worth playing. 910  a flawed masterpiece that finally delivers on the hype. if you skipped it at launch, nows the time to dive into night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i genuinely love and enjoy this game! i refused to pick it up when it first came out, due to all the bugs and visual glitches. however, 5 years later, for the spring sale i finally picked it up. the game has gotten way better since it's initial release, and i'm genuinely super involved in the story so far. it's a fun game that has a great story, great graphics and raytracing even for today's standards. yes there's still some bugs and glitches here and there, but it's very few and far between. when i do see any visual glitchesbugs at this point, i just chalk it up to my character's optics malfunctioning and laugh it off, since they aren't detrimental to the game. all in all, it's fun. so fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"released in an unholy state, gave up. played it after they foxed most of it around 1.0 something with a low end pc i5 6600k, gtx 1060 6gb did not care, the story was great and the game was definently playable. now i have a moderately decent pc 7700x, 4070tisuper and i have gotten to appreciate the details of this game. every nook and cranny of the map is filled with its own personality, parts i thought were just nothing had their own gigs, and their own small story lines.. 1010 would reccomend to everyone"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"way better than at launch, super interactive and leaves no corner of the city without something to do"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i know the game came out messy, but it's really worth giving this game a chance today. it is an amazing game in everything from graphics to the story.so many different, and intresting characters that u get to meet all over night city. promise u will have a great time with the game today"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"good gameplay, good story, good characters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"phenomenal game. yes, the story can be hard to follow. yes, the morality system why knock people out?, the stealth gameplay why hide bodies?, the character customisation why can't i look like jackie, susie q, or maelstrom lol, the romance, trauma team, street cred people should be afraid of me etc. were all halfbaked and clearly the mox were going to be more important in the original scope and plans. but it shows how good the game is when all of this doesn't really matter or affect my view on it. the gameplay is incredible. truly amazing stuff. there is a triple combo that really allows for unique playstyles. 1 cyberware 2 classtype skill trees 3 weapon type skills on my first run i was a borgedout nomad netrunnertank of a man, wielding nothing but a chargeshotgun with two barrels and a heart of hatred. the gameplay was on the highest difficulty but i still felt like robocop. blasting the shit outta gonks close range and blowing the brainchips up of fools across the map with my quickhacks. on my second run i was a doublejumping, quickdashing mantisblade streetkid woman that specialised in throwing knives, sniper rifles, pistols, and chopping fools up with my mantis blades. i had no ability to hack, and relied on a berserk booster for melee. this was an entirely different style of gameplay and is truly incredible the devs have built a system where it works and flows as naturally as it does. if i do a third run i'll play as a smartgun, riflefocused corpo. the open world is amazing, absolutely beautiful and with tonnes of detail. it truly defends its right to be open world with the ncpd scanner and gigsjobs. it's a shame it doesn't have as much interactable establishments in any meaningful way like eg. the yakuza games but still far better than 90 of open world games out there. i'd say as far as the map goes it is actually the best i have ever played. no far cry, days gone, mad max, yakuza, gta, sleeping dogs or whatever really gets close. this is something special. the story is great, it's a decent foundation that is launched to its peak by the performances of its voiceactors. this also applies to phantom liberty. the characters are well written and it punches where it needs to. it doesn't forget the punk of cyberpunk even if the morals the story sortof forces in your face are a bit dubious at best. overall, this game is definitely worth picking up. especially considering you can get it at 50 off quite frequently. make sure to get the one with phantom liberty as imho that expansion has an ending that is absolute cinema. so yes, tldr goated story goated open world design goated side content goated gameplay goated soundtrack mid character customisation cmon man this is cyberpunk world, why do i gotta be normal skinny manskinny woman? mid in some specific gameplay details eg. stealth is still fun, but could be better soul crushing axed content. bruh, monowire hacking, mantis blade wall running, a moonbase etc. would be so cool definitely made the right choice if you waited a few years to buy it after the nightmare launch. shame it didn't stay in full dev for a few years longer and pop out that extra content and polish."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"incredible story, deep rpg elements, and a worldcity that is truly living, breathing, and that takes on a role in the story all its own. cyberpunk is a phenomenal rpg and a pinnacle of storytelling."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"probably one of the best games i've played in my life, both dlc and main stories are amazing, every character in this game is very well done and everyone has a different personality that makes the game feel way more diversified and makes you feel connected and emphatize for them, all missions are different and fun, even the secondary ones despite the problems the game had when it launched, it was really worth it to wait for the patches, i highly recommend it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"h3this game has potential. h3 the launch was not great and considering how long it was in development for, all the delays and excuses, this game was not ready for release. cdpr has, and hopefully at the end of this, will still have a brilliant reputation but i think games are being pushed too far in regards to overhyping, advertising unrealistic gameplayteasers and just generally releasing so broken. i testers need to reevaluate their targets and remember that not everyone runs a highspec pc or has the latest console, so all platforms of all kinds should hold tests. i url httpsyoutu.be2slki3x4mci url now, to the game bu pros ub  great storyline, voice acting isn't the best.  some sidequests are really intriguing and can throw you from happy, to sad or leaving you confused but for good reason.  interactivity is okay, but there is enough to do in night city.  choices are thoughtprovoking though not overly too sure how they have an ultimate knockon effect towards the endgame.  night city is beautiful and fast travelling doesn't seem needed, i can drive around the city and still be in awe even if i had driven down it so many times before.  the game immersion, aside from bugs, is okay, not brilliant but enough with how the story goes.  combat is as good as you'd expect although not rdr2 level. bu cons ub  promises of bustling city, but it's minimal people doing the exact same routine unless it involves them in a quest  cars randomly spawn upside down on the pavement and disappears or explodes, or cars spawn merged with other cars causing a complete eyesore and tear in immersion  character customisation, we were promised it would be the best but i think i can name quite a few games off the bat that did it better.  cybernetics, supposed to be the pinical in night city, but only offers bare minimum usage. all you need is a legendary weapon and things are just like hot knife through butter. was expecting much more with cybernetic... bu dlc phantom liberty ub the new golden standard for dlc. i felt like i was in a james bond movie. the cast of characters are all extraordinary and well acted. during the middle of the dlc i felt like i was in the high stakes poker game from casino royale absolutely brilliant quest. dog town is the best district in night city by far and is packed to the brim with new gigs, dungeons with dangerous bosses, new vehicle's and dozens of weapons and hundreds of new clothing items. this dlc easily offer's 30 plus hours of new content, and is a masterpiece!!!! but its playable, it's a good game... just could have done so much more with the time they had."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"h2a happy ending? for folks like us? wrong city, wrong people...h2 i was lucky enough to wait until the game was stable and polished before purchasing this title, despite waiting for it for years since announcement. i don't regret this, because so many people seem to have a sour taste over the game if they tried it at launch, despite all of the improvements and fixes cdpr have done since 2020. cyberpunk is like nothing i've played before, it's truly immersive. i laughed, gotten attached, got angry, felt betrayed, cried until i was a dried raisin, had my heart ripped out of my chest... and although i am definitely an emotional person, there hasn't been many games that truly got this reaction out of me. even characters you only meet in the prologue and barely have screentime youknowwho  i found myself praying that cdpr would make a dlc of the 6 months we only get to see in clips. side npc characters were meticulously crafted to make you doubt intentions, confused about who to trust, unsure about what to choose  all clearly intentional when looking back at the story cyberpunk tells. i played this game for approximately 300 hours 2 playthroughs before purchasing the phantom liberty dlc  i was hesitant because of the price, at the time i had gotten cyberpunk on sale for less than the dlc price so it seemed absurd to me to pay the same price i did the game  but within just a few quests i could understand why, and i never regretted it. be foreworn  i would not recommend this game if you are not in the best state of mind. each ending can be seen as bittersweet at best, each ending made me cry like a baby while the credits rolled because the writing is absolutely flawless. unfortunately, part of me was hoping for a better ending with the dlc  but surprise, the additional ending you can get from the dlc is just... the worst? it ripped my heart in two to make the decision, to hear the final dialogue with j.s, and all the following moments. the game left me feeling empty, in the best way. the writing, visuals, development, easter eggs, music, and female v voice acting holy cow, it is night and day playing female versus male v, no shade to male v voice actor, but everybody should experience female v at least once in my opinion  this game brought me back from my gaming hibernation, now sitting at nearly 700 hours i finally uninstalled the game and moved on to another, but i am now on a desperate hunt to find a game that can fill the void this one left, find a game that can be comparable to this one. if you're hesitating, just go for it  the game is often on sale, get it when its 30 and i don't think you'll ever regret it. even if it's just to drive around night city, or race the streets, there's a bit of something for all type of players that are generally attracted to rpg games. bgameplayb  boring  rock paper scissors  fun  hmm..........  entertaining  ace  godlike bdifficultyb  my grandma could play it  easy  normal  hard  a challenge to be reckoned bgraphicsb  ms paint  bad  meh  normal  very good  an original artistic direction  beautiful  masterpiece bstoryb  this game has no story  some lore  it's there for people who want it  well written  leading to more indepth researchesthoughts  a model to get inspired by blengthb  0 no story  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond bmusicb  just filling noisesno music  trivial and uneventful  good andor fitting the game's artistic dispositions  memorable  transcending whispers of a forgotten world binterestb  i would rather watch paint dry  hard to enjoy  repetitive andor uninspired  a good moment  sticking out of the pack  you will remember it long after breplayabilityb  a onetime experience  only for achievements  if you wait a few monthsyears or with mods  definitely  infinitely replayable or almost"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"the structure of cyberpunk 2077 feels quite different from many rpgs i've played, including the witcher 3 wild hunt. while most games are designed like a tree, with a central story branching out into various paths, cyberpunk 2077 resembles more of a sprawling bush. you dont have to progress very far in the main quest before you encounter a dozen or more side activities, all vying for your attention. what's more, many of these opportunities are just a phone call away. in this futuristic world, quest givers often reach out to you directly, so you don't even need to go looking for them. this changes the usual sense of growth that rpgs offer, as the variety of options opens up quickly before leveling off for much of the game. still, theres so much to explore and discover, with plenty of hidden content you need to actively seek out, that i didnt mind swapping that traditional sense of progression for the abundance of choices offered."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,absolutely brilliant game the creates incredible immersion coupled with a fantastic storyline. night city and its surrounds all have unique feeling zones. combat and movement is sharp and expressive. customising your character to minute detail really makes you feel like you have ownership and an investment in your own story. a

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"only have 3 hours in and was able to add some mods to make the game a little more immersive like the computer tablet anywhere... very handy. so far i am really enjoying the game and like the exploration side of it, i am still trying to get the feel of it with targeting and driving, but liking the game so far... though i had preordered it before it came out, i am thankful that i waited for several patches before playing, i've not run into any bugs, that that is a plus in my book!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"one of the best gaming experiences i've ever lived. night city consumes you, it makes you care for its people, its past and future, and your place in it. keanu reeves is embodying one of the best roles in his career, engaging with him is super fun. the rest of the cast stand their ground too, esp the protagonists and the dlc characters are believable to say the least. you can approach this game as a role playing experience or a guns blazing shooter or a stealthy pacifist or... you get it. you can play the usual firstperson shooter or develop complex synergies in your own unique build. you can customize your appearance infinitely, discover crazy rides, play a bunch of unique arcade mini games, discover subplots within subplots and never stop exploring. this game has been stabilized since its despicable launch and right now looks and plays terrific. i can't imagine a realistic cyberpunk universe looking better than this. if you own a high end pc, just go for it if only to witness its gorgeous lighting and reflections. the occasional bug is there but nothing game breaking and in the long run won't matter. not to mention the development team is still updating the game, adding and fixing stuff 4 years later and keeping the community active with new lore and photo contests or other gimmicks for hardcore fans. a huge bonus is that the dlc is one of the best released a compelling narrative with lots of different options, a higher character level ceiling with a ton of new upgrades in weapons and cyberware and a whole bunch of new sidequests, gigs, vehicles and areas to explore. both the main game and the dlc can be replayed over and over and approached in different storyrelated choices or playstyles and feel refreshing and rewarding like a new experience. oh, and the soundtrack is nuts. the game has been accused of being just a gta clone with futuristic gear, but in reality its art style and sound design support the game's aesthetic perfectly to set it apart not only from gta but also from the other genre defining titles like deus ex, exploring similar themes with a whole different approach. there is so much to love here, there will definitely be something for you. don't forget to grab the free bonus contect while at it the original soundtrack included."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i can't believe i have waited this long to play this game. amazing characters and story. after finishing the game felt this weird void in me. this was the first time i have actually bonded with the characters and actually felt sadness when i lost some of them. it was magical like the feeling of watching lotr for the first time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and i have to saythis game is now one of my alltime favorites. cd projekt red put in the work, and it really shows. if you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a mustplay. night city is insane. the level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels livedinits everything i wanted from a cyberpunk world. the neon lights, the shady alleyways, the hightech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. its easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in. the main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. playing as v, trying to navigate the mess of night city while dealing with johnny silverhand keanu reeves absolutely nailed the role makes for an unforgettable experience. the game doesnt hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you. but what really makes the game special are the side characters. panam, judy, river, kerrythey all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. the writing is just toptier, and i found myself really invested in the characters and their stories. the phantom liberty dlc takes everything great about cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. new missions, new characters idris elbas character solomon reed is my favourite, and new gear make this expansion worth every second. the espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. if you already love the game, phantom liberty is a nobrainer. combat is a blast. gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. hacking is one of my favorite partsbeing able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. you can play this game however you wantsneaky netrunner, meleefocused street samurai, gunsblazing mercenaryits all viable, and its all fun. cyberware adds even more variety. you can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with mantis blades. the skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding. building your version of v is one of the best parts. whether its how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, theres a ton of freedom to play how you want. the choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique. the music in this game is just perfect. whether youre walking through the streets, driving through the badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. the voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive. visually, this game is stunning. with ray tracing and all the graphical updates, night city looks breathtaking. performancewise, its night and day compared to launchsmooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. if youre playing on a decent pc or a nextgen console, youre in for a visual treat. cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best rpgs ive ever played. the story, the world, the characters, the combatit all comes together beautifully now. cd projekt red really turned things around, and if you love scifi, cyberpunk settings, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,story rich and it is definitely one of the best open world games i've ever played with great and stunning secondary quests. side jobs surprisingly do not get repetitive over the time. also do not forget to play phantom liberty dlc.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"valeu a pena esperar para jogar! atualmente, o jogo est em um timo momento, bem otimizado e com diversas melhorias grficas e na jogabilidade. apesar da cd projekt ter decepcionado na prvenda, acredito que hoje eles conseguiram deixar o jogo redondinho. para mim, tornouse um dos melhores jogos que j joguei. me fez refletir, me diverti com inmeras interaes com personagens bem construdos, e a narrativa  simplesmente de tirar o flego, com reviravoltas incrveis e de muito bom gosto. alm disso, como apaixonado por arte, fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto. o nico ponto fraco, na minha opinio,  o balanceamento dos inimigos. joguei no hard e senti que eles so muito fracos, enquanto os chefes da campanha so absurdamente mais fortes que os cyberpsicopatas. no entanto, sei que existem mods que ajudam a equilibrar esse aspecto. peguei ele na promoo por 79,00r e pra mim valeu, fiz 2 finais diferentes e ainda tem muita coisa para explorar e me divertir."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game quickly climbed into my top 5 games of all time. cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games i have ever played, the graphics with pt and music are fantastic and the world building is something else. it's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. i can feel the unique culture from within night city, the different groupsgangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of cyberpunk the game bugs have significantly decreased and story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the phantom liberty expansion, levels. the characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side keanu reeves? not to mention idris elba. really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunninghacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours. character customisation is just a delight and i enjoyed creating my different people. sickness all around, i have so much more to say, but this was it for now. 100 recommend. i am glad to have joined this journey and i look forward to what comes next."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,one of the best games ever! i've loved it before the big update and i love it even more now d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"played this game when it first came out and it was so hard to get into with all the bugs, but this game is actually incredible and amazing now. cd projekt red really earned every bit of respect they could ever need from me for fixing this and making it everything we all wanted when it first came out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"i played this game on launch on the ps4 and 100 the game then, and despite how bad that was i still thoroughly enjoyed the story and the atmosphere. nowadays after rework and patch this game is fantastic story, music, atmosphere everything you could ever want out of a single player open world rpg. the mods after you have played vanilla bleeds life right back into it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"choooom, one of the best solo campaigns out there. expansive maps, immersive stories, impressive range of side jobs, gigs and additional quests. top 3 games of all time for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"cyberpunk 2077 is like a dystopian fever dream where you play as a mercenary named v, whos basically a walking ikea catalog of cyberware and poor life choices. the game is set in night city, a place so grim it makes blade runner look like a disney vacation. its a world where corporations rule, everyone has a tragic backstory, and your best friend is a gun that occasionally talks to you. the story is a rollercoaster of emotionsmostly despair, with a side of existential dread. youll laugh, youll cry, and youll question why you thought stealing a priceless relic from a megacorp was a good idea. johnny silverhand played by keanu reeves, whos basically playing himself but angrier is your digital ghost roommate, and hes either the best or worst part of the game, depending on how much you enjoy being called a gonk every five minutes. pros night city is stunning when its not glitching into the void. the soundtrack slaps harder than a cyberpsycho on a rampage. judy alvarez exists. thats it. thats the pro. cons bugs. so many bugs. i once saw a car phase through a building and honestly, it felt loreaccurate. the ai is about as smart as a toaster. cops will literally spawn behind you, yell stop right there, and then forget you exist. youll spend more time customizing your character than actually seeing them thanks, firstperson view. in conclusion, cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but its our mess. its like dating someone toxic but hotyou know its bad for you, but you cant look away. 710, would get cyberpsychosis again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"i don't think i've been more absorbed within the storytelling of a video game before. i've laughed, and cried while connecting with the diverse roster of characters, the immersion is surreal. feeling these types of emotions from a video game plants themselves deep into your heart. everything just hits the right places nice and deep, phantom liberty adds onto that making this easily one of the best video games of all time. cyberpunk 2077 is truly an unforgettable experience. i my playtime is on console, don't mind the 8hrs here. i"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"1010 the most alive i've felt playing a game since the original release of skyrim. i know they messed this game up on release, but it is now a legend status masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"the game is absolutely awesome! i have not been this hooked up to a video game for long time. i cant believe i held up so long to get it because of how this game was review bombed. it must have been over 2 years in my wishlist. only shows how fans can be unfair sometimes. let's start with cons  occasional bug and crash to desktop happened maybe 23 times that the game flatlined. you can sometimes encounter wrecks of cars on the road which are not actual obstacles and cannot be interacted with, you can just drive through them like they were not there. from time to time you will see a flying object, levitating npc or a car in really strange position.  ai is superb dumb  police is the dumbest  even if you have 5 stars at being wanted they will forget about you in a minute or two if they cant see you. even if you are just around a pillar and can see 5 policemen looking for you and slowly approaching your position then all of a sudden timer beeps, the stars start to flash for a few seconds and bang you are not wanted anymore. you go out of the pillar and policemen do not recognise you anymore even tho you just butchered a few dozens or hundreds? of their colleagues. i wish this could be addressed as it breaks immersion and is just straight out idiotic. or when you enter the mission they stop chasing you. not only police is stupid, all the enemies if they lose sight of you for a minute or something they lose interest or just stand there waiting to be smoked.  you get too op. i get that you are supposed to be a night city legend but the highest difficulty level should be more challenging especially a little bit later when you get more cyberware and good weapons. for now game is only challenging on higher difficulties for the first few hours. maybe until level 10 or 15. from level 40 you barely die and can just storm through 20 or 30 opponents. only very occasionally you will die.  no flying machines that can be interacted with of piloted is a little disappointing in futuristic game like this. there should be flying cars or helicopters that could be piloted. pros  story is amazing  most of the side quests are great and engaging. even the repetitive quests like kill or steal are great because every time they are in different setting building etc and the gunplay never gets boring  gunplay is just great. feels right maybe except for technical weapons which are not very fun. also melee weapons seems to be underpowered to compare them to shotgun for example  npcs are amazing so many memorable characters.  voice acting is spot on  choices are good however there should be more  romance option is thre and it is exciting  graphics is top notch  cars and driving feels great. every car can be driven from 1st person perspective and every car has unique design with wheel radio and all interiors. how amazing is that?  v  the protagonist is a cool interesting guy you can chose your starting position too  johnny silverhand played by keanu reeves. how cool is this!  beautiful and alive city with so many people in and cars. so many unique districts  a lot of places where you can fight with lowlives just for fun without needing any quest  such a great music and variety. so many different radio stations  you get a mobile phone! and can call or text other npc! cool  leveling system is good and rewarding.  quests are plentiful  almost no copy and paste buildings, cellars or locations. everything feels unique so much love was put into this game it is amazing. for me 910  i dont mind an occasional bug but if they worked on poor ai and ai realism then it would be strong 9.510 for me. if they added extreme difficulty level with more challenge it would have been 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"this is the first pc game i've played in over 23 years. i have to say that i'm not disappointed at all! i'm loving this game! the graphics are amazing, the game play is a lot of fun too! has kind of a gta vibe with much better story telling and way better character development. i'm having a blast!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"i've always liked this game, even with the extremely buggy launch. the world building is so incredible you rarely see something this well crafted. there are parts of the city that look so lived it i can imagine what it would be like to live there. story sucks major ass though and i ended up taking the secret ending and not playing for several years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,if you still haven't given this game a try just because it had a buggy start.. then you're missing out!! the game is fixed and the dlc is breathtaking. worth the money.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,only took like 3 years after i bought it and 3 pc upgrades later for me to be able to run it but cdpr finally came around and made one of the best looking and playing games there is. truly a next gen title and worth picking up and playing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"played this game on og ps4 with all the bugs and wonky mechanics. i still had fun playing then and now its just amazing. to see this game go from a wonky mess to being a benchmark to test the highest of high end pcs is something that nobody expected. the atmosphere, the characters, music, and gameplay all slap. cyberpunk is right up there with witcher and has a ton of potential cant wait to see what is coming next!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"do yourself a favor, play this game. since i've installed a hundred of free mods ranging from gameplay, movements, mostly visual fixs and upgrades, this game is stunnnnnnning. thank you my beloved 4090, heating my place the whole winter!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"cyberpunk 2077 took me multiple tries and probably 15 full hours to get into  but once i was into it, wow. this game has everything you could want from an open world rpg and it is simply stunning to look at on top of everything else."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"i didn't have many expectations when i initially bought it but the multiple patches over the years turned a huge mess of a game into something so special that i ended up sinking 100h of playtime and finishing all the achievements in no time. totally understand people's skepticism about whether or not it's worth giving it a try since i come from the same place as them but as of right now i can safely say the amount of gameplay, variety of things to do and overall quality it's definitely worth checking out. considering main game and dlc took me together roughly 130h to finish, i'd argue it's worth buying even outside of discounts since we now live in a times where aaa titles barely make it past 4050h of total playtime and ask for twice as much in total price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"the game is great, it's hard to find any bugs from the release, in 4 years the developers made the game from rags to riches. the game shows what life would look like if corporations took over the world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"hands down one of the best modern rpgs. if you're even thinking of getting it just do it. i would highly recommend getting it with the phantom liberty dlc as imo it greatly enhances the base game with a unique area, awesome items and mini bosses and a gripping and devastating story . it's cliche to say that cdpr have redeemed themselves from the godawful launch but its true, this game is a phenomenal technical and literary triumph. my 160hrs breezed by with still more i could've done. i also had the joy of playing this entirely on my steam deck where it definitely did not look as good as it could've on a pc it was still really beautiful if you're willing to play with settings. the performance still suffers noticeably often. mostly in dogtown and in other highly dense areas. saying this, with my settings i regularly got a stable 60fps. loading could sometimes take a few minutes. however, all these tradeoffs did not put me off the game at all for the sheer fact that i could play cyberpunk 2077 on the trainbusworkcouch. if you have a steam deck it is an ugly joy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i really love this game. the world is massive, full of interactions, and the missions are truly memorable. the gameplay is satisfying, and its easily one of my top 5 games i've ever played. one of the things i really appreciate is how decisions actually impact the world, which is something not many games do today. however, the one thing i absolutely hate is the endings  there are around 5, and while you complete them, they dont really impact the game afterward, which feels underwhelming. the phantom liberty dlc, on the other hand, is an absolute masterpiece. its how this game shouldve been from the start. every activity is interesting, the contracts and missions are very wellwritten, and the attention to detail is amazing. i love it so much, honestly, i think it's better than the base game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"if you played the game now, you would never know how much of a buggy mess it was back when it released. good that it was fixed, bad that it happened in the first place. that aside, the combat is great, the music is decent enough, story is nothing to write home about, it has some emotional moments and cool setpieces, but thats it overall i'd say its a solid 710. not necessarily worth the full price, but on a nice discount? would definitely recommend"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,jackie is the best character and nothing bad could ever happen to him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i'm a fan of emotional games. oh, how bad i felt in 2020 when i chose the ending where i help hanako. it's surprising that, even though antidepressants dull my emotional experiences, i still feel that sorrow when v dies, and viktor talks to him with a caring voice. the game has changed drastically over the past four years  i would call it the game of the decade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"makes me feel that perfect sense of nostalgia for a thing i've never experienced. has a story that takes as many playthroughs as you want for it all to really makes sense, with more meaning being understood and appreciated every single time. my offline hours nearly double my visible ones, this game forces you to witness and understand terrible dread and horror, and honestly you'll say thank you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as night city itself glamorous and rotten to the core. the city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. the missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. there are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing seriously, the game kept throwing panam's crotch into my face no matter how much i tried to keep our relationship professional. there are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games. there are more issues but i'm too lazy to write them down. i hope you get the idea. i was about to click the thumb down. then i went through the point of no return and after that took some time to think back on the journey. i'll be honest. i really enjoyed the payoff. and looking back, i very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. time will tell how i'll remember this game. is it worth being annoyed for 60 hours before a grand finale and an occasion to look at the state of aaa games? your mileage may vary. considering the games i enjoy, i would be a hypocrite if i gave this game a thumb down. cyberpunk 2077 is awful. and it's one of the best open world games i ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"highly recommend, great story line, multiple endings, relationships and more. i really wish there was more tbh. i played this on ps5 and wanted to see how it ran on my pc so i bought it again. the graphics are amazing. there are multiple endings and your choices affect the outcome. not for kids, so parents be warned there if full on nudity in the game. wish i could find more games like this. cannot get enough of this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i really wanted to like this game, but i guess it's just not for me. the character customization is much better than any other game i've played, so i'll give it that. but the story was hard to get invested in, the gameplay is just okay enough to be entertaining but not as in depth as i'd like for the genre, it's way too easy to become op and stops being challenging around the 25 mark even if you set it to a higher difficulty... realistically, i'd give it a 6 out of 10. i hope anyone else that tries it likes it more than i did, and you likely will this game's gotta be marked overwhelmingly positive for a reason."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,one of the best games ever made and still the most visually impressive game you can play 5 years after launch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great story, fun mechanics, engaging characters. cd projeckt red makes the best story driven games out there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"bought the game years ago when it came out and actually had to return it given the poor performance. i recently picked it up again due to the recent positive reviews. what an excellent game. storywriting were captivating, graphics were incredible and the combatgameplay was fun an interesting. would recommend"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"don't get me wrong, the gameplay, the story, music, everything is awesome. howerver, there is some bugs that is completely ruining it for me. saved files dissapearing and crahes. few times several hours of play just disappears. i will still try to get through it but i wouldnt recommend it until it is fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"this might be the best story game i have ever played. i've only gotten one ending as of writing this but it was so well written that i don't want to try a different path and make this one feel less cannon even though i didn't find the ending satisfying. i can barely bring myself to keep playing from my last checkpoint because it would be a change in the events of my game and feel off, i might try tomorrow. the gameplay is amazing, traveling feels great, the city feels massive and the combat and stealth are amazing as well. the voice acting and music are movielevel too, just like the writing. one aspect of the game that shocked me is that the breathtaking graphics ran on my laptop with 0 crashes, great loading times, and the only glitches being a few boxes jumping in a shelve when something touched them every few hours. this is easily the most freefeeling game i've ever played with all the different weapons and cyberware and i feel like almost anyone could enjoy it because of all the ways to play the game. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested and can easily say it is a 1010 game, and despite not paying for it because i got it though family sharing, i can say without a doubt that it is worth every penny. i have incredible respect for the development team and everyone that helped to make this game as perfect as it is even with the rough release. i hope you found my review helpfull and decide to try this game if you have the chance. goodbye. update i bought myself a copy of the game along with the dlc partially to post this review because of how much i want this to convince more people to play this masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,peak peak peak. peak play this. every side gig and the whole story my only problem are the ''wait to be called'' quests.. and a little bit of bugs but its enjoyable.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"already played this on ps5 so i wanted to play it again on pc with mods to enhance my experience. i gotta say that this game is great and i love it but the amount of visual bugs almost made me stop playing already tried if it was a mods issue but it wasn't. having to optimise settings to fix them at the cost of lower performance and other shit is very annoying and i'm always crossing my fingers that it will run and look fine everytime i load in the game bruh. other than that crap, it's a great game with a great story, amazing graphics when it works, and memerable characters. 910 for me if only they actually fixed everything ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,this game has amazing story characters and gameplay. theres a bunch of side quest to do with interesting lore
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best games of all time. as a guy who has sunk at least 2 years into morrowind, this is the closest i've come to playing something as amazing and free."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"an absolute mess upon launch i still had fun though, played about 80 hrs then stopped for awhile, came back after the 2.0 update and finished my playthrough they got rid of some features i liked but they fixed most of the problems i had previously encountered. i am quite annoyed with the price of the dlc considering the state the game was in at launch and its 80 cad pricetag. overall this was an excellent game visually and story wise with great replayability, it has become one of my top 5 favourite games of the last 10 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i love it. it's a bit on rails sometimes when you start a story related quests. i think they could have done a bit more to make these parts more interactive instead of jumping from conversation to conversation. that said the story could easily make a blockbuster film. you can easily take a break from the story and just enjoy the city. i completed the main campaign, then started modding it, modded in and started a new game before attempting the dlc. added a ton of immersion, quality of life mods and just stuff to bring the world alive. so far i've had no conflicts with 64 mods, all just drag and drop to game folder. then i started the a new game and haven't put it down. i'm honestly shocked at how easily moddable the game is and just the sheer scope of some of the mods. they are seamless as well, like they should have been there all along. overall very satisfied. money well spent."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,the saddest i have been in recent memory was finishing this game and uninstalling it. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"don't play it on very hard and you won't have a frustrating experience i can't in good conscience recommend that decision for your first playthrough.. unless you find the frustrating part of dying over and over again fun, of course! basically, what i mean is, every one becomes your worst enemy, you either get 1shot, 2shot, or 3shot, no exceptions, don't matter how much armor you have, it doesn't exist, it's a joke and you better stock up on healing items and be prepared to run in circles or hide like a little bitch behind cover for a while when you're begging god almighty to recharge your healing items for your next inevitable use. the game is nice, there's a lot to do, and the characters are interesting to interact with, keep in mind that you'll be playing as someone else, you are not roleplaying as yourself, you are roleplaying as v. if you find that uncool for any reason you should look for something different to play.. i'd recommend fallout new vegas or the outer worlds not biased at all, totally, don't check out my profile to confirm.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"amazing game, i recommend it for who like playing games with alot of ability's of controlling the character, and thos who like to experience new things completely freely, special combats, betting fights, mission fights, combat with various types of weapons, high ability to develop and upgrade skills before entering a fight and even during combat the ability to modify skills and use them to suit the situation you are in combat, a great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,great game! i didnt really enjoy it the first time around but after updates this game runs pretty well on my set up also the edge runners anime really helped me get into it tbh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"having played this game since launch day on the xbox one, xbox series x, and here on pc, i have a lot of things i can say about this game, but don't have the patience to type it all out here. the very horrible, false advertised and extremely buggy launch of cyberpunk still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. however with the improvements in performance, bug fixes, and major overhauls to almost everything in the years post launch, i'm now able to give this game credit where it was well overdue. there's still a lot that i wish can be done to this game, but it's an almost perfect product that i can recommend to anyone who not only enjoys a good story, but to anyone who enjoys open world and single player games similar to me. in short, cyberpunk has had a lot of ups and downs and still some very minor ones that can be ignored, but has made one hell of a comeback from the mess that was it's original release."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"came for the hype, stayed for the content. i am reaching a point where i just cannot 100 every games, and i am fed up by easy useless side quests in infinite open worlds. however, this game organises its content in a quite honest way, letting you know how far your are straying from the main quest when choosing a mission. doing the main and main characters' quests, it took me 35ish hours to finish it, with a satisfactory completion of that world, and state of my character. buy it !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best games i have ever played. some little things are bothering me but nothing that breaks the awesome storytelling and cool characters, also the awesome looks of the game. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"honestly, this game has been one of my favorites of all time since patch 1.6 fixed all the major bugs and cleaned up the ui and gigs. 2.0 is just icing on the cake for me, and a great example of a proper expansion vs. dlc. if you don't like the game at this point, then it's just not your kinda game, and that's cool. the actual major problems are long gone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"you can just walk around the entire map and still find a lot to enjoy. now that the bugs have been mostly fixed i can say it's a fantastic incredible game. the map and world building are absolutely beautiful and the mechanics and fights are very well done. i'm not a big fan of first person shooters but this game was an exception. also, all the quests are fun and don't get repetitive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,it was amazing at launch. its absolutely breath taking now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"just approaching the end of my first play through. started out sceptical of first person only, but gradually got used to it. would still prefer at least the option of third person, but we have what we have. i know this is a just a shooterlooter with motor vehicles, not a dating simulator nor base builder, but i would like to have seen a more expansive romance setup. besides the above minor quibble, cdpr have created a fantastic world with immersive stories, side quests and interesting characters, and i'm glad i took the plunge. also like the few hattips to witcher 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,i wish there a biochip that make me forget this game so i can experience this story once again

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"remember... the game is fixed.  idris elba it took some time, and they still deserve all the criticism in the world for releasing it in the state they did... but this game is really good. especially phantom liberty. it's almost not worth playing without it. but the world, the characters, the voice acting, the story is all some of the best i've ever experienced in a aaa game like this. i've been a fan of night city and cyberpunk for years before playing this, and to see the city and the characters i've only seen in my imagination so fully realised in a product like this is just so fulfilling. probably my favourite game of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"unforgettable experience. one of the master pieces that would be remembered and talked about in the decades to come in video game history. i sincerely appreciate the dedication to tell a great story and an immersive universe. for me, there is little i can ask for more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,810 i didnt like the ending for the main game also dog town one too for president it would be 910 otherwise just wish all the setup i did for the ending mattered i did the panam ending and i think its good just the whole part of 6 months to live this was kinda cheap felt like none of the hard work i did really mattered i know its left to interpritation weather v found another way to live after besides that it was sweet a bit short for me also the dog town dlc has highs and lows like 4 hours of padding is crazy also felt very unsatifying for the end i guess thats the point still dont like it but over all i liked it never want to go in dog town again though its awful to navigate ill give the dlc a 710 because it had great moments
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"love this game, but damn steam u really gotta fix the playtime, stuffs weird played for 67 hrs shows 3hrs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"wait until i have a child... i'm gonna still put this game to them to play, even in next 10 years. this game is 'g o a t'"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"very immersive, story is good so far, voice actors are quite good too and the characters are believable and feel like actual beings rather than lifeless npcs. v just feels a little off at times"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,gun play is good. the perks system is large and complex. overall easy to understand what skill trees do what and they have many overlapping perks to learn later in the game adding replayability to an already very interesting story and world. scifi isn't always just the imagining of the world in the future but an exaggerated reflection of today's world this game is very that. be prepared for a gritty and grim look at a world consumed by consumerism and obsessed with recognition.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i played this when it first came out and it was pretty much unplayable. i'm glad i waited for all the bugs to be ironed out. this is probably the most immersive and realistic city i've seen in a game. the hordes of people walking on sidewalks and crossing the street, cars stuck in traffic honking, the occasional psycho driving wrecklessly... it makes it feel like i'm walking around in an actual city. that being said, there are some issues i have with the game, but not enough to warrant a negative review. pros  combat is a lot of fun, and the quick hacks add a lot of depth  the story, characters, and writing are excellent  a ton of weapon and carmotorcycle variety  keanu reeves cons  the whole crime system is pretty bad. you can murder dozens of civilians with a ton of witnesses all around, then hide in an alley for a minute or two, and the cops forget all about you and you can go about your day.  there is no stealing. no breaking into stores after hours and stealing anything left on the shelves.  vendors are there 247. they never close their shop. they never sleep or eat or use the bathroom. this breaks immersion a little bit.  the quest markers are in kilometers, but your car's speed is in miles per hour... wtf?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,really love how open world this game is and the graphics of this game are outta of this world at the lowest graphics this game looks good and feels good wish they were more games like this that were actually good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i really enjoyed this gamw! although it was difficult to understand what was going on, after 3 playthroughs i understood not only the main story, but also the side missions, the dlc, and what certain choices can lead to the worst outcome. i still see myself playing this game even after multiple playthroughs, and dont think i would ever be an ashole to johnny, unless it became an achievement, which i hope never happens. i only wish they added more dlc as the story is really captivating, making me wish that they made more content for the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"cyberpunk 2077 is nothing short of incredible. from the sprawling neonlit streets of night city to the deeply immersive narrative, the game delivers an experience that's both visually stunning and emotionally gripping. the attention to detail is remarkable, with every corner of the world feeling alive and full of possibility. the characters are complex, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat, offering multiple paths and outcomes that make every decision feel significant. it's a thrilling, oneofakind adventure that sets a new standard for openworld rpgs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"910, loved it, can't find another game that gave me the same feel right now and it's driving me mad. i skipped when it released, waited til now, so glad. a few minor technical hiccups in 80 hours of play. i'll be going back to night city someday."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,it's literally peak. imagine fallout but in a relatively good ending of humanity.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"choom, go klep this game! cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, in both gameplay and storytelling. full stop. it's a damn shame that it was released in such a sad state in 2020. the updates have turned it from a barely running piece of corpotrashware into something truly phenomenal. cdpr deserves their flowers for keeping working on this game, opposed to most companies who just klep the money and delta. story, choice, quests cdpr made very nuanced characters, difficult and meaningful story choices, and great quests. i've had to pause on numerous occasions to just... sit with the weight of some of my decisions. there is no way to make everyone happy. the world of night city is a world where you will make enemies, you will have to make the hard choices, and you will have to be a heartless bastard to survive. silverhand, takemura, misty, jackie m'fing welles, judy, panam, kerry and so many more organic, well fleshed out characters populate this world. in fact, i enjoyed them so much, i found myself saddened by how short some of their questlines were, especially in the case of river ward, some of the fixers, and eurodyne. combat my combat loop, even at level 34, was already relatively complex, which i enjoy from my games. i'm a dual lover of tacshooters think escape from tarkov, squad, and stalker and expansive, rich open world rpg titles dragon age, elder scrolls, kingdom come deliverance and this almost seamlessly melds the action one expects from those same shooters and the combat effects one expects from those rpg titles. gunplay is good, not great, but i have a higher standard for that particular element than most. one note i have for alot of rpg lovers is something that helped me immensely your cyberdeck is just a spell book, and quick hacks are just spells. ram is mana. wish reviewers drew that comparison more often. very poignant agitprop, mirroring the world we live in now to an uncomfortable degree. i wish some of the mechanics were better utilized, but outside of that and other minor foibles such as short storylines for some characters it's damn near perfect. i can't wait to start a new playthrough and go through the dlc. 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i have bought this game on xbox and steam, and i am qualified to say that this game is even funner on pc! i definately reccomend it to all gamers, whether you like rpg's to fps, this game has everything you would want with mods and customization. i also suggest watching the edgerunners show on netflix."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"this review is going to be very biased because honestly, cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time. to me, this game is perfect. the story is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. this is the type of the game i wish i could replay for the first time. there are so many missions that make you feel real emotion for the characters and difficult decisions that make you question your own morals. the customization is great, plenty of clothing options, cars, weapons and body augmentations, but what i think really makes the game's customization shine, is how versatile you can make your characters abilities. if you wanna be a hacker that is in and out of a job without a trace, you can. if you want to go berserk, run in guns blazing and ignore damage you can. if you want to zip around, slowing down time, slice enemies into pieces and bury throwing knives into their faces, you can. you can also be any combination of those, and more. i was not apart of the original hype to cyberpunk that turned out to be a huge failure at first. i played this game after the 1.2 patch a while back. i was in love with the game then and with each new update i've only fell more in love with the game. the update and release of phantom liberty has only made the game better and better. i'm not going to beat a dead horse, if you want a singleplayer game that will be an experience that will stick with you forever you won't regret buying this. i know not everyone will agree, but this is the first game i have ever considered a 1010 game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,the story is so fun and there is so many paths that you can go down and i like how the choices you make along the way will affect your game is the future.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"saying this game had a glow up is the worlds biggest understatement. this games story alone warrants buying it, and the gameplay adds another cherry on top. couldn't recommend it more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best openworld environments i have seen in a videogame. it is immersive and stunning, but the world is very adult especially right off the bat. all in all, an amazing experience if you enjoy scifi tech, dystopian futuristic cities like new york with neon, and a world that feels truly lived in, then this is a mustplay. the technology requirements can be quite harsh though."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"the unfinished launch put me off buying this game for years until someone recommended it to me  for 20 it's deffo a good deal. mods are easy to install. runs pretty smoothly even on a mid tier pc. it's like a mix of fallout 4, witcher 3, gta5  watch dogs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,very rich story line and awesome game play!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,game is so fun i been on it for hours i went to sleep woke up then took a shower and ate then went back to playing even without the dlc the game is so much fun and really makes you feel like your their and people make vr mods for it that just makes the game 4x better
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,compelling world with a lot of complexity that lets you build a unique character in every run. very fun entry into the world!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,one of the best games i have ever played i did not encounter any technical problems the story was beautiful and the graphics were beyond imagination
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"so far i like it many things to do and learn insane graphics nice music to, driving is weird and personal i don't like talking i skip all dialogs.i recommend it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"excellent game world, characters and storyside missions. after a rocky first year it was well worth the wait for the game that finally emerged"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,gameplay is awesome graphics are awesome play this game bru
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"one of the best open world story games i have ever played in my life. i have finished all of the endings, almost finished all side quests. amazing game had so much fun playing would heavily recommend 9.510"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,not since i was a child did a video game have such an effect on me when completed. the sense of a void unable to be filled after completion of this game is very unpleasant.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,very good game i can finally fry the brain of every person that mildly annoysd me in public 1010 i love poland
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the romance options add a cool touch, and the story, along with side missions, kept me hooked. character customization is great, and combat is super fun, whether its hacking or gunfights. i do wish the sword combat had more variety in animations, as they can feel a bit repetitive. that said, the combat overall is dynamic, and switching between different playstyleswhether it's ranged, stealth, or meleekeeps things fresh. i really enjoy the game's atmosphere, especially the mix of neon lights and dark alleywaystheres a gritty, yet vibrant energy that brings the city to life. i just hope npcs and objects have more reactions or better physics to make the world feel even more alive. i really hope more games like this come out in the future. id definitely spend some eddies on more experiences like this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"after buying a graphics card for this game, my bank account is zero zero zero oh no."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"love the game! i love all the details and playing it on geforce now on my steamdeck is absolutely amazing! i'm just going around reading all the little chips with stories on it, gives you a much better idea of the world in the game and how things have changed from the norm we're used to now. the controls are a bit awkward when you're driving but otherwise amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i refused to buy this game on launch because i knew it would be overhyped, and it was. since then, the game pulled itself out of it's own hell and became one of the best rpgs i have ever played. 65 stars"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the gameplay and the sheer number of ways to tackle missions are just insane. the characters feel real, the writing is toptier, and the world is so immersiveit just feels right. every choice matters, and whether you go in guns blazing, sneak around, or hacking, it all feels incredibly satisfying. and with the phantom liberty expansion, its 10 times bettermore story, more depth, and even more reasons to keep playing. one of my favourite games ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,rough start on release but the devs pulled through what an amazing  immersive game. one of my all time favorites.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,absolutely amazing game play and story line
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,awesome game even on low graphics lol if your thinking about getting it i would say its pretty worth it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"probably the easiest game of the year candidate if released in current state. never had high expectations  given ruined reputation of cd projekt red and 'meme' status gained from all the launch controversies. i'm glad i gave it a chance eventually, i've had too much fun for someone that isn't even interested in scifi at all. shame, that it was released a couple of years too early, alas...  try it , 100 worth the full price now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"absolutely fantastic game. this game exhibits a variety of options for you to take on night city. be it weapons, cars, story choices, and of course your cyberware. all these decisions help decide how you will complete your journey. i have not even mentioned the story and how you will become a legend in this city of dreams. this game most certainly deserves a play through, if not multiple playthroughs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"awesome game, great graphics, great gameplay, and keanu reeves.. what more do you need  seriously though, it was a really fun play through, with a massive open world that is pretty darn nice to look at. you have plenty of places to explore, lots and lots of side missions and a ridiculous number of weapons to play with. the crafting and upgrading system was overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you find that it's really what the whole game is built around and becomes the driving force of the game. it was cool to have keanu play a main role and i liked the combination of racingdriving, fps, storyquesting and decision making. go ahead and buy it, you'll have fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"only played the game after phantom liberty so cant talk on how bad the game use to be, that being said, the game is overall fun. the story to begin with felt enjoyable up till the end of the game start. from there it felt like a mixed bag with certain quest lines feeling like the greatest of any fps i have played and others felt like a slog to get through. phantom liberty on the other hand felt different and was by far the best part of the game with a good variety in how missions can unfold. on top of the main story, side missions were fun and were never too long to keep you interested same goes for the optional gigs and the ncpd call out locations. they make for an overall enjoyable experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"played it during launch on ps4, i'm happy to say that the things the game was lacking were added in later updates! i'm glad that they kept on working on the game instead of dropping it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"what a game. the story is beautiful, the world is a work of art, the soundtrack is immaculate. i'm definitely gonna be thinking about it for a while. give it a go, eh?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,its so sad i cant even open the game without it crashing not sure if its my pc or the game itself but i know i can play destiny with all the dlc's just fine with makes it even worse can't even refund it now either hope they fix it soon
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,this game need to be marinated for 5 years until is good. nice cooked cdpr
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"graphics   this game has it's own world and the graphics make it immersive enough to get lost in it. character design   memorable characters that will make you love them, hate them and even fck them. playability   defensively very accessible to any gamer who decides to pick it up. has a few things that need getting used to with the controls but very accessible after a few hours. story   very rich story telling, i mean that is what cd project red does, they deliver stories in a form of a videogame. memorable to the core and made me come back over and over again. sound   one of the best in this genre of gaming. good gun sound and car sound. amazing music that will make you want to stay in the rain and cry and say it's just the rain. also, grimes heart longevity   it's as big as it gets for a single player game. not much to do besides side quests after the main story is complete. a dlc came after which gave more life to it but that's all you get. i would say about 90 hours of unmitigated fun. after that is just completion and exploration. ingame purchases   none, as there are no micro transactions. only thing you would should spend on is the dlc once the main game is completed. competitiveness   i mean, there's no multiplayer, so there's nothing you can compete for. unless you wan't to speed run the game. similar games  mass effect trilogy story telling deus ex for the similar vibes atomic heart shootingpowersstory and characters cloudpunk cyberpunk city vibes ghostrunner 12 cyber vibes mirror's edge for the dystopian world the ascent cyber vibes, loot and shoot this game...just chefs kiss i give this game 9 chooms outta 10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the great story , the great game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the quintessential dystopian cyberpunk experience! enjoyable and fully functional combat mechanics, with a full range of melee and ranged weapons. neuromancer fans will appreciate the body upgrades and net hacks. open world exploration on foot or in vehicles cars, bikes trucks realistic conversations and language use, interesting and engaging main storyline with plenty of side quests. the list goes on, and you don't need a list  just play, and immerse yourself in this highly detailed and comprehensive experience, the best i have played in a long time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,great story. missions can be played like you want. i bought this game at launch and it was unplayable buggy mess but right now it is in good state. there are still some bugs i experienced but most of them were just funny bugs. to new players i highly recommend doing all side missions as they are as great as main story. this game was just great experience overall.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"fucking fantastic, its an improvement on the fallout esque style game, if this idea was taken further that would be awesome, i hope they bring more parkour movement in the next game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"this may be peak, all of it, put like 30 hours in the past 3 days, i really needed to finish it, wonderful game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"after all the updates, i really enjoyed this game. not perfect, but a great game to play and enjoy. i had fun but probably wouldn't play it through again. got a decent pc and monitor? get the game on sale, great experience!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"good action, story, environment. not looking at all the hype and initial letdown, etc, this is objectively an impressive game in it's scope, worldbuilding, and fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"graphics are insane, the atmosphere was beautiful. the plot could be a little better, especially since it felt rushed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"talk about the comeback kid, the story was always present in this game the delivery was just rough at the start. coming back to play this game now for the third full playthrough i've done, this game is a masterclass of storytelling and immersion. one of the best performances from keanu reeves ive ever seen, enough to bring a tear to my eye. also the dlc goes crazy and makes you hate yourself. wires and chainssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"as someone who didn't play it until way after launch, all i can say is that this is one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"holy shit the game's awesome now that they've made all these major patches and reworks into the game. had be engrossed and immersed from beginning to end. what a tragic, messed up world cyberpunk's is. fun, but ultimately tragic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is such a unique game, not only due to it's absurdly complex universe, that's got it's own historic events, wars and whatnot, that's also vast to the point where one could spend hours talking nonstop and still not get to the first half, it's also unique due to it's interactive world that's got so many stories to tell, night city is a living thing, with it's social issues, falling economy, corruption, the list goes on. although there remain all those problems, gangs on pretty much every street, little to no nature, etc, the city still has so much beauty to show with it's immense buildings, that look so futuristic yet so aged, giving the player this extremely dystopia to experience. as far as the story goes, the main missions are quite few, but the game counts on making you want to complete every single side mission and quest, because you will find yourself enjoying it perhaps even more than the main missions themselves, that's on account of how immersive the whole cyberpunk experience feels, getting to the point where you will feel part of it somehow, in a way that the side missions work together with the main storyline to make an absolute banger, with impeccable storytelling, and the dlc is a perfect addition to those feelings, with extra content, a brand new region, new characters, new equipment and all. however, we must not forget the disastrous game launch, with a far more empty open world, poorly designed police, overall dumb npcs, lack of polish and the enormous number of bugs. but, cd project red did not give up on delivering the game they wanted out, managing to get the game almost perfect at version 2.0, and adding things we didn't even know we needed with phantom liberty, and as i speak, the game still doesn't fail on releasing new updates with new creative additions, bug fixes and quality of life changes, getting this game to it's absolute peak. the graphics on this are a whole experience by themselves except for the food, making you want to screenshot every corner, every detail, every view, and every street thats got some colorfull led that was purposely placed to make the raytracing technology really stand out. you may find a different type of difficulty while playing this game because the hardest part doesn't tend to be the combat or anything similar, but due to how much freedom you are given with the way you do things, you will see yourself constantly struggling to decide what is the right choice, every dialog gives you dozens of possibilities, every mission allows you to get to the objective through your own ways, that sometimes will be limited by the way you build your v to be, a netrunner, a slick shooter, an absolute maniac that can kill dozens in seconds, all depends on your choices on where to apply your skill points and on which cybernetics you'll be using. all that gives you enough different paths to make so that you may replay the entire game in many totally different ways that will offer a whole new experience everytime. if you are looking for an immersive experience, with outstanding storytelling that may or may not bring tears to your eyes and a complex universe to dive into, cyberpunk 2077 might be one of your best picks, the game is, as i've mentioned, at it's absolute peak, deserving attention from anyone that's never given it a chance or from anyone who played at launch and disliked it. 1010, absolute masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i'm so glad i finally got to play this. it's been in the back of my mind for years now, but i just hadn't gotten around to it. 20 something hours in and i'm still loving every second. it reminds me of an unholy child of botw and borderlands, and i love it so so so much. cannot recommend it enough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"ill give the game props for what it does well. combat, story, and characters are all really good. i love how cute panam is as a girlfriend for the player. jackie is a really cool and plenty of the other characters you meet along the way. adam smasher has got to be one of the hardestcoolest looking boss i've seen out side of the soul series. the only thing i wish this game did was take an extra week or so and get the small details... like the food on the table looking like a painted on puddle, and really badly rendered french fries. its such a small detail but when youre playing the side missions and you sit down to eat and glance at the food, it just takes me out of the game and i laugh a little. not all of the food is like this, alot of the foods on a stick im gonna guess look the way they are supposed too, but good luck finding anything that would make you say id try that in the open world. out of my love for the edge runner series, and how good the combat feels, i would recommend this to most, so long as they have a good enough computer. the multiple endings are really cool and making different characters for different builds is a nice way of getting reimmersed when you choose a different start. i would give this game a solid 910. it just needed an extra minute in the oven to get the little things. or even an update would probably fix it, im not a tech guy but my character is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,the only story game ever besides far cry 5 that made me replay it multiple times 1010 would nut again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"great game, me go fast, throw knoife at skull, make good crack sound, me recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"played it on console, really enjoyed it. got it on pc. it's a good time. i have yet to play phantom liberty but i'm really looking forward to it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,great graphics and story line. some glitches here and there but all in all great game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"the simu feel of nc in edgerunners, and then playing the game, both feels right, the graphics and interaction of the characters is one of the main reasons why i keep playing this game and probably will continue to do so, the sandevistan is probably the main reason"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"don't get me wrong, this game is still a buggy piece of shit but i'm having so much fun that i've already got my money's worth and i'm barely into the story at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,a beautiful but buggy game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"incredibly good game. most livedin city environment i have ever seen. absolutely beautiful visuals and intriguing story. also a metric ton of side missions and events. took me about 160 hours to 100, would still play more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"took me a while to get into it at the start, but as i'm playing through and levelling up it is getting more enjoyable and easier"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i bought this game far after release, on sale, and i gotta say, totally worth it. playing cyberpunk a couple years after release feels great. i managed to not get any spoilers and did a blind playthrough that lasted just under 100 hours. i heard the complaints on release, but i was met with few bugs, a couple weird visuals, and no gamebreaking bugs. thoroughly impressed with the story and choices for a variable narrativemultiple endings, and the skill tree and cyberware allows you to play in very unique ways. the world looked great but obviously pushed my build to the limit, a 3080ti was struggling with max graphics, so i settled for maximum raytracing and played at about 50fps the whole time. i played almost exclusively in first person even while driving for a more immersive experience, and i would strongly recommend exclusively driving motorcycles so you can beat traffic and take in the breathtaking world. if you're seeing this in 2025 onwards, definitely give it a go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,what more is there to say that hasn't already been said? easily one of the best games ever made. must play.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,a little confusing at first but its fun.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a very content rich game that has a lot of playstyles and options to traverse. i wish there were a lot more cosmetic options, particularly with prosthetics, but i really enjoy the quests and gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"amazing labor of love. had interesting choices, fun gameplay, and a great story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"one of the best game with great environment design. i still jump back into it sometimes to be a part of night city, a beautiful dystopia."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,highly recommend. very immersive. lots of content. combat is great. driving is great. never fast travel. always drive. first person always. type 66 avenger. katana. smart tracking shotgun. silverhand's pistol. good times.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"immersive game play in an enormous world. fun elements of exploration, racing cars, gunfights, interesting characters, surprising encounters, humorous moments and a very good story. obviously it's dark, but i was surprised how very very rated r the whole world is. you just can't escape the nudity, drugs, violence, etc. it's almost everywhere. picking up the game a few years after release means i don't have any way of comparing it to launch, but the game today is worth buying, and the phantom liberty content is awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,amazing game the first imrpession is the ugliness of npcs in this game. if 2077 beauty standard is low deep in the hole like in this game then i'm glad that i wont make it to 2077
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"where do i begin, well the launch of the game was a huge oil spill. that is true, however in phantom liberty and onward, cyberpunk 2077 has not only broke the ground, but it's really made a name for itself. i would say that in the last decade cyberpunk is in the running for the top 10 games out there. the environment details in this master crafted world by cdpr is absolutely, 'breathtaking' and i could not ask for a better game to immerse several hundred more hours into."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i got this game day 1 on ps4 when it first released, and then returned it after 2 hours cause of how it was buggy. now, after all the optimizations, and bug fixes all these years later, i can safely say that this game has an amazing story not just in its main campaign but the side gigs and jobs that hit you in the gut, and make you wonder, what is the morally correct choice? that's the sort of rich story standard cyberpunk 2077 is at the moment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,there is a depth to this game that surprises me. it feels like every part of the whole experience work together very well. the story is interesting and gives characters room to be characters. with game play it feels like you can do whatever style suits you. this is perhaps my new favorite open world sandbox game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,fun main story line doesn't last long but tons of side quests
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"yes, this game was absolute booty crumbs when it came out. but now after years of multiple fixes and updates and an amazing 1010 dlc, i can safely say this has been a game that i have been looking forward to getting on pc after playing through it on console. mods, here i come!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"great game with an amazing storyline, very immersive and no longer riddled with bugs, highly recommend!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,fun and immersive gameplay complimented by stunning visuals. cyberpunk 2077 is a great rpg for those who enjoy a game with a futuristic steam punk setting
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"overall great game, tons of content, fantastic dlc, hooked me from the beginning till the end."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"while still fraught with bugs, the game nonetheless accomplishes what it sets out to do"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,i can say that i am really enjoying the experience! night city is such an enthralling place with a stellar atmosphere. i just started playing the game in 2025 ik where have i been living! under a rock?? but i already see why so many people have fallen in love with this game. open world is my vibe and i didn't know what to expect but wow has this game made me feel good. you really get connected with the characters. game feels like it's real.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i wanted to play it for many years but could not due to a lack of hardware, the experience has been very worthwhile so far. characters are interesting, environment is awesome, combat feels decent, my only gripe is that i wish there was more customization for things like vehicles or v's apartment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,i hope they make a second cyberpunk. awesome game and a true redemption story them fixing the game. stunning graphics and runs really well these days. i did my first run through on a gtx 1080 and it was smooth as butter
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"ok this is great gaming experience. rough at the edges but one of the greatest rpgs out there 2025 marriage of gta v style living world but much more living and modern rpgs storytelling best ive seen  every important dialog is directed and if you read fast the conversations feel natural like in the movie. some elements are not in game important details but are nice to have like whole car buying arc and there is no proper armor.. come on cd project.. you have hideo kojima came hidden in the prologue but you don't have metal gear style armor in the game.. shame...  combat is shooter like and might be less interesting to a classic rpg fan but is not that difficult and most of it can be avoided stealthy ninja is a valid route for most of the game on the minus side not many romancing options, i get main characters have long romance storylines but there are only 4 one night stands and 4 sexworkers 2 each gender. this is not main part of the game but in the depraved night city is not enough... crafting looks like an afterthought, only ever crafted ammo. main minuses there are 2 main implants that changes and enhance the game sandevistan slowing time in combat super cool, well executed and cyberdeck that let you hac opponents and furniture 2 great atmospheric options but you cant use both at the same time... bad design in a game that is single player story. balance is for online shooters... second thing is that in most conversations choice is illusory, you can or have to go through every option third minus is that game spawns same models for random city dwellers at random and it can result in 2 identical hot dog vendors standing super close to each other sometimes breaking city immersion. highly recommend i am surprised how good this game is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i had to drop it at launch due to its wellknowned bad launch, and picked it up again after a few years of good patches. i have to say it was a great decision. i liked the story, good characters, and personally, the best part is its excelent gameplay. felt like a kid when fighting with my build around throwing knives, katana, mantis blades, and the sandevistan, specially against the final boss. i had a blast feeling like a ninja, such a good portrait of high speed, good movility and time manipulation. despite still running into some minor bugs, i still absolutely recommend playing it and getting immersed in all the posible builds and storyline outcomes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,the game i use to play it on my ps4 when it first released. it was really lag and a mess but i really liked the open world the lore and the combat. fast forward a year or 2 i got a pc and thought to replay this game on steam. comparativly the game has improved alot from the first time i played it and now. it is a must have if u like gta 5 or games like that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"this is 5th time i played this game, and i very much enjoy it. the story is decent, but the dlc story? amazing. the combat is diverse and great. i really like a netrunner build as i can hack my enemies while i shoot at them which essentially two attacks at once. the acting is great, and you really get invested into the main characters. as for the mc, i think both voice actors are phenomenal, but i lean towards the female v. i think the voice actor does a better job. overall, this is a wonderful game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"i am very lucky to be able to play this after they fixed their horrific launch. there are still bugs, but these are nowhere near enough to be annoying at all. the graphics and setting are absolutely amazing, with the lighting being my favorite part. my only gripe is how the mission system seems to violently encourage you to go straight into a new mission, despite it not being required. if it had something like the rdr way of missions, where you go to a location to start the mission, it would be a 10, but it stands at an 810 for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is simply fantastic....however my only complaint is it crashes a lot and i am not sure why. i have tweaked the settings to even lower quality but still has issues with the game crashing. other than that i have no complaints.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"a visceral firstperson experience like no other. a deepdive into the actionpackeddramatic whatifs of hightech, lowlife balanced with immersive game play. the design of night city and surrounding areas made me want to explore this game for years, despite the sometimes heartwrenching stories and sequences one may come across during game play and general exploration. the various factions, styles, cultures, and color were incredibly detailed and it was obvious that the team put their soul into this game. i can't wait to see what cdpr and mike smith have planned for the future of this digital series."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"might be one of the best, if not the best, games i've ever played. the story is engaging, the actors do a phenomenal job, the world is immersive and so is the combat especially if you take your time with it and experiment, really get to know the game and the way its pacing works. i'm 26 and haven't had this much fun playing a game in years if ever. the only thing missing, which might be a big ask considering tech limitations, would be npc interactions. i'd at least love it if we were able to have 3 options like in red dead  i think it was something like greet, dismiss or intimidate? idk, forgot. anyway, you can press f to get a response, but honestly this will be something that you'll be able to mod yourself, especially with ai integration into video games. anyway, highly recommend. you can sink hours into this. 910. once you understand the games flow, it forces you into a very satisying flowstate, zone, focus, whatever you wanna call it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"um jogo unico demais com o melhor fator replay que j vi, zerei e instantaneamente iniciei um new game para zerar de novo com outra classe. peak game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"so good chooms , this is the best story game for me.i never played a story game this much before, make me upgraded my gpu for this game. talking about buggy things, i think its hilarious."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great game play with twits and turns with every choice you make. makes you feel like every choice matters in your play through. so many options and ways to play. this is my 5th time playing and i am just as hooked as the first time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"started playing shortly before the release of phantom liberty, so i only experienced a wonderful game from start to finish. can totally recommend it. awesome story, gameplay and visuals. if it only launched in the state as it is in now... the only thing missing for me is the ng option. currently only possible by modding the game and even then it's not a fully immersive experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is an absolute masterpiece. after all the updates and dlcs, this game has evolved into one of the most immersive rpg experiences ever made. night city feels alive, with its neondrenched streets, deep lore, and jawdropping visuals. the story? phenomenal. the characters? unforgettable. from the moment you step into vs shoes, youre hooked. the voice acting, the emotional depth, and the sheer freedom of choice make every playthrough unique. and with phantom liberty, the game reaches a whole new level of intensity. the combat is slick, the hacking mechanics are toptier, and the worldbuilding is unmatched. whether you're a stealthy netrunner or a gunsblazing cyberwarrior, theres something for every playstyle. cd projekt red took a rocky launch and turned it into one of the best rpgs of all time. if you havent played cyberpunk 2077 yet, youre seriously missing out.  1010  a mustplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is the game i personally enjoy it had an rocky start but overtime it got really good the story is great and the way the game looks is just amazing the only thing that i wish the game had is a new game  because i beat the game 3 times without the dlc and im running out of stuff to do so i got the dlc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this is one the greatest games ever made. it is a e testament to what is possible in a video game and art as a whole. once you play it you will never be able to see any open world game the same way ever again.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,for me i think that cyberpunk is a really good game but sometime it might be buggy. personally for me i think that the game is really good but it some cool feature like bd i really wish that i could watch it without adding mod or doing mission or side quests. but overall i give it like a 9.210 it could have been a 10 out of 10 but like i said it lack some feature. hope this review help
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is really fun especially for people that like story games
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,love the game but i have no clue if its good vanila since im runnig a modpack but still a great game also let this review be a testement to why pirating is good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"wow! i'm so impressed with how this game started out as a giant failure and was diligently turned into a fantastic game. the dedication behind it is undeniable. it has its flaws and all, but i'm enjoying this so much. thanks for all the work! would recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great graphics and a good story mode so far i'm on my first play through
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"this is one of the greatest games i have ever played. straight up, i do not care how bad it was at launch, it is peak."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is a breathtaking openworld rpg that has truly evolved into something special. the world of night city is alive with incredible detail, vibrant characters, and a story that keeps you hooked from start to finish. the immersive gameplay, deep character customization, and thrilling combat make it a blast to play. the updates and improvements over time have really elevated the experience, and the narrative is one of the best in modern rpgs. if you love futuristic, storydriven games with rich exploration and action, cyberpunk 2077 is a mustplay!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"have a decent rig to run with good quality, the game play is great sometimes the dialogue can be drawn out like a monologue. great graphics and great features to a first person shooter."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"been here since this was a bug infested tragedy of a game, watched as it developed over the years i know it says i only have 14 hours on here, most of my time is on xbox. it's really awesome to see that cyberpunk edgerunners got integrated with the game with hidden easter eggs and in game weapons and cosmetics. this game was a nightmare to play just a few years ago, but now i believe it's blown far past expectations, especially with mods but i'm not going through that rabbit hole of dependency mods tldr good game, better than before spongebob caveman sound"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"masterfully recovered experience from cd projekt red. gives a simple, yet morally deep plot taking place in the morally bankrupt, corporateruled night city, wherein you play as a self insert, starting from nothing. as you progress, you go from powerless, with combat being lifeordeath scenarios, to a tank, power housing your way through combat engagements in seconds. beautifully done, and fun to play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,one of the best games i've ever played. even without phantom liberty still a very fun game to play and the story is amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"one of the best open world storytelling games on the market. the story and characters are rock solid, with plenty of high and low emotional moments coupled with those nail biting stressful encounters night city offers. the writing makes most of this possible, especially in the phantom liberty dlc. but the world feels real, lived in, and has nearly an endless amount of lore for you to dive into. while giving you more than enough freedom with your character builds and weapon choices, the cyberware and hacking also being a very welcome and unique edition to the game's combat system. the visuals and environments are also top tier, with neon lit cityscape galore, to derelict slums and industrial parks. nothing to complain about with this one, other than how long it took for them to iron out some of the bugs and glitches. 9.510"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"really great game, one of the best of all time! i've played through the game 2x on console and now have a beefy computer to see all the eye candy at max to play for my 3rd time, and definitely one of the best looking games of all time. cd project red has cleaned up a mess of a launch they had originally with this game, to make it one of the best of all time! so much to explore, and so many ways to play. one of the few games that i've played more than once or even twice now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great game! dlc and maintenance significantly improved the game from day one. would highly recommend.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"not usually a fan of most open world games, as i feel they lack mechanical depth, which is usually my favorite aspect in most games. however, this is a game you can't dislike barring launch obviously, i made the wise decision of buying it on sale after all the main patches had released the main story still feels kinda rushed, but phantom liberty is an absolute masterclass of storytelling, worldbuilding, and atmosphere, through and through. if you're even considering getting this game, wait for a sale and get the ultimate edition, you won't regret it. as for actual criticims, the biggest gripe i have with the game is its missed potential. even after the patches, anyone who's played the game once even without keeping up with its development cycle can tell it was meant for a lot more. the map can feel flat in some places despite being the most gorgeous open world i've seen in a video game, the latter half of the story has the vibe of ok let's get this shit over with already, and any semblance of balance is immediately annihilated the second you discover spoiler sandevistan  any fucking sword that has stats directly correlating to sandevistan spoiler, but this is an rpg, op builds are expected and the game still offers a wide range of options that are more than viable. i'd rather address what i didn't like as it is much less than what i did like. and outside of what i discussed? the game's a must play, especially if you have a higher end gpu and want to crank that shit to overdrive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"one of the best games i've played. i bought it on ps when it first came out and i never understood the bad reviews. i decided to purchase this again while it was on sale with phantom liberty and it's just as good, if not better than i remember it to be. as of this review, i have not got to the dlc yet so i cannot comment on that. i would recommend the base game on it's own."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,true pc fps no mouse acceleration rpg open world nice graphics balanced gameplay nice story
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"it's a great game, but it is still riddled with bugs. they've had more than enough time to sort out crashes and hangs. it shouldn't be in the game at this point."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,good game. tons of things to do and weapons galore. nothing like taking the head off an cyber freak at 2am
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i knew going in i would at least enjoy the aesthetic of this game being a huge fan of everything this game is based off of. but instead i got a story that made me think hard about the choices i had to make and how it would affect the relations of those around me. i grew to love most of the characters and got to fully enjoy their arcs. not since fallout new vegas has an rpg of this caliber really pulled me in and not let me go. i'm currently writing this after finishing my 1st play through and i already have plans for the next after a hiatus to digest everything this game threw at me what you waiting for? you got a city to burn.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,cyberpunk 2077 is the best game i've ever played the story is amazing gameplay is how you want it to be you want to go guns blazing? go ahead. want to make some gonk shoot himself? you can do that. i can only imagen how breathtaking it looks with a better pc than i have im saving up just to play this on better graphics. ive never played a better and more fun game in my whole life the only thing negitive i can say is i dont have more dates with sweet sweet judy  and multiplayer would be amazing but ik thats not happening lol 1010 buy this game or we are not chooms
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,its really fun. might mind the over use of monolougue not good but if you skip through most of it and do the quests youll get ot the fun stuff. make sure you save every onch ina while to
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,amazing game. has so much content and the open world and story are great.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"you know, i don't think i should say something. you just need to try it out yourself, it's definitely gonna be worth your time and effort. cyberpunk 2077 have both great and breathcatching plot and interesting gameplay, so you'll not get bored. so see ya in night city!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,amazing story and amazing game. i highly recommend this especially if its on sale.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,very fun game with an extremely engaging combat system and story. many side quests lead into long and expansive storylines that add to the dystopia of night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,awesome game and despite my concerns about the first person pov this game did it so well that i adore it! fantastic story and really charming characters! i highly recommend it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"didn't buy at launch and i'm thrilled missed all the major bugs. one of my favourite games of all time, more than worth the full price. a mustbuy when on sale frequently on sale. beautiful game, amazing story lines, funny sidequests and great combat and customization. not to mention, the dlc is excellent! 1110"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i've never been so obsessed to such a dystopian worldbuilding game up to a point where i have bought both the game and dlc on xbox and ps5. it has so much replayability that without mods i have placed 200 hours on both my consoles combined. and now with mods, its total chaos. if you watched edge runners and hesitant to buy the game due to the initial response release, don't worry. its far from that and no one will disagree that this game has truly done a 180. this game for sure has sparked my deep interest into dystopian genre and i appreciate it for that. this game is one of those games that everyone must give a try at least through one run. spoilers when you face adam smasher and given the choice to let him live or kill him. for rebecca, just end his life. he will also end up killing someone else close to you depending on what path you choose to continue with."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"very good game... little buggy, but good... story is perfect and gameplay is very uniqe and interesting..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"game is good after all, but endings leaves a different opinion, mosty due community correct opinion !ending spoilers! spoiler with dlc there are 5 endings, and by the community opinion because game directly says, and it is dlc one where v have a normal probably the only one ending where v will have a long live, althought in few others v survives but only for 6 months. in my opinion, it is kinda bs, because v survives in 35 endings, because v dies if johnny takes hisher body ending, and ending where you take help from corpo because you have option to live 6 months or accept deal of selling your soul to corpo spoiler spoiler so, imo, v survives and have long live in every other ending because v gets rid of the johhny relic, so it stops damaging vs brains. because 6 months are given only if you accept corpo path due removing relic. and the worst ending of having long live is in dlc ending, due problems with artifical brain. but in every ending where alt helps v, and johhny leaves v alone, shehe survives. spoiler"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,still a buggy mess from time to time but still my favorite game of all time. deffo recommend it to anyone looking for a neon light adventure in a huge city with lots of little secrets and great storytelling.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,game mechanics might be overwhelming at first but as you progress and understand the game becomes more and more stunning and beautiful. absolutely loving it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,so far great visuals great story great bugs great glitches great missclicking the grenade and having to hide from the police for 10 minutes 1010 game

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"as an alchemist and coder, i'm captivated by cyberpunk 2077's immersive fusion of technology and humanity. the game's dystopian world is a complex crucible of corporate intrigue, social upheaval, and personal transformation, where the boundaries between flesh and machine are constantly blurred. with its deep character customisation, intricate hacking mechanics, and immersive narrative, cyberpunk 2077 is a digital elixir that will transmute your gaming experience forever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,pretty fun. still a little buggy than other games but its not too terrible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,solid good game well optimize even my 7 year old pc can still play it at ultra but you should've warned me that character create session will be nude my nephew is next to me god damn it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"absolutely loved this game, gameplay is great and the story is incredible. if they launched the game like this at that time. it would've won goty. i've completed this game 8 times on epic now 9th run on steam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,have played 58 hrs at the time of this review. the overall world is a fantastic place to roam and interaction with certain characters can be funny to emotional. love the story telling and develop of it's main character along with the main side characters.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"amazing and visually awesome game. amazing storytelling, and there are so many small details. highly recommend 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,imagine falloutskyrim except instead of cool dragon breathing or v.a.t.s. abilities you're an awesome cyborg in a dystopian future dog eat dog world. beware who you trust.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"simply put, this is the greatest game ive ever played. no matter how bad it was and i know how bad it was because i was a victim of the preordering of the game, all of it can be dammned because the way this game came back is unbelievable. the game play is fun and interactive in all the right ways, the world is so immersive ive spent hundreds of hours just driving around and fighting and of course the story, the emotion it holds and the absolute cinematic of it all makes this game the greatest game ive ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i've already completed cyberpunk twice on xbox series x one release, but had to give it another playthrough on pc with all the ray tracing bells and whistles and it was well worth it. having mod support on pc is a game changer to. one of my favorite games of all time and would give it a 9.5 out of 10. only reason i take a half a point off is only due to the state of the game at launch. if you never played cyberpunk and your reading this wondering if you should pick it up you have already wasted to much time..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,story is amazing and graphics help it push the story even better. some people may call it linear but this is a great game that'll give you hours of entertainment!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"amazing game, great music, great atmosphere, great gameplay, great story. only minor complaint is that main story is a bit short."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i never realized how much i liked this game. even after purchasing it and playing it for a few hundred hours on my xbox i knew i wasn't done with it. had to buy it again on steam and the dlc. cyberpunk 2077 is becoming my favorite game. even with all the bigotry in my head.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i love the leveling of this game an dhow in depth you can go into with the build and the story is second to none
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i have played this on ps5 and seam and this is a great game and super fun too bad it was crap when i origionally bought it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,honestly i cant say anything bad about this game. its storytelling is just incredible and the characters are so great. even throught the rough launch it has redeemed itself. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"fun game, enjoyable and really cool. i absolutely love the aesthetic of cyberpunk and have been craving for more of the genre. i highly recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"really enjoyed the original launch, even with all the bugs. as they ironed them out, it just got better. about to play the expansion, but i'd rate this game positively even without it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,fun game interesting story good controls good graphics lots of customization
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"started in 2024. not really encountered any bugs, and its a very good game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"cyberpunk 2077 is a visually stunning game with incredible detail. very immersive and realistic environments in night city. gameplay is smooth and good story line. i love combat, updating weapons and v. best rpg game in my opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"decent game, good storyline, bugs seems to be worked out mostly. im happy with it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,great game insane graphics. you have to have a lot patience because their is a lot of dialogue but it helps develop a great story.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"after 200 hours all the way from release day where things have greatly changed for the better i have to say the product is 1010. there's still some funny bugs that will happen during gameplay but the story is great, characters are interesting, and extra details you can do now make it worth the purchase even at full price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,good game. easy enough so pick 'very hard' difficulty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i love the vibe of this game but i did spotted a few glitchesbug while playing. i did not go out of my way to find these bugs by the way, it's just there while i'm playing story mode. the bug isn't anything major like npcs body are stuck together. overall amazing experience so far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,one of the greatest comeback in videogames history!! i already completed this game twice. absolutely obsessed with character designs and visuals. silverhand steals the show! and the gun mechanisms are really amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i love and adore this game. i waited for a long while to buy this game since i wasn't sure i'd like the gameplay until one day i decided to go for it and holy. i do not regret it at all. this game is truly so beautiful and wonderful, it's so immersive and the characters you interact with have so much life. would recommend 100."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,i remember playing it on launch day with an xbox one. had lots of bugs back then and still had fun as it was still a fun game despite that. years later i now finished the game running path tracing on my 5080. i love every bit of this game. its polished and looks impeccable
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"it's been a few years, it's now well patched and runs smooth. you'll still need something midrange or higher from the last 3 years but you won't need a beast. don't enable the fake frames, it's not necessary and makes it feel wrong."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i never thought that i would genuinely enjoy this game as much as i do. i remember all the bad things people had to say about cyberpunk when it first came out, specifically how rough the ps4 release version was. i almost didn't give it chance because of all the bad things i heard, and i'm happy to say that cd projekt red has surpassed my expectations and more. this game has me hook, line, and sinker. the story drove me to tears once i reached the end, it was genuinely emotionally devastating i still haven't recovered. the city feels so alive, the characters are likeable and have so much depth to them, the combat is the most fun i've had in an open world game before, and there's so much content that it's not even possible to do everything in one playthrough. this is one of my biggest game recommendations. if you ever had doubts, give it a chance."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"it's the kind of game you need when you need immersion. an escape. for me, it was exactly what i needed. played the vanilla loved it. now playing the tweaked versionbladerunner guilty mods and all few years on. it's a fantastic game. made with love. i'm glad cdpr toughed through it. it can be very overwhelming at the start. but not too much that you give up. lot of thought put into the mechanics and it shows. great effects. great audio story starts fun turns great at the end. maybe too on the nose?... the vanilla is great it's worth it. 810 pineapples."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i really enjoyed the game, the fact that the devs still cared and continued fixing the game is really nice. the combat is really awesome and fun, when the edgerunner perk kicks in you feel invincible! the sandevistan its at another level. the katanas and fist are really fun, and the stealth too, there are a lot of ways of doing the same mission and that gives you a really nice feeling. there are a few details that i would love to change about somethings and mechanic tho non lethal does not make any difference in almost all of the main story and sidequests and its quite sad, it makes it pointless. also, when you put k.o. an npc, it doesnt recover or wake up, making it hard to know if they are alive or just unconscious some missions doesnt have alternatives like with evelyn that she well, yk. and even thought you can complete sidequest in different ways, in the theres a point in the story where i personally felt like the devs just said something like mmm lets go straight to the end, after you talk with hanako it feels rushed. the cyberware capacity system is really weird because at some point in the game the shards just doesn't appear, i know it would be broken to make it more easy to get but, take note that a lot of players use a mod for the cyberwareshards! it needs a fix. personally, i really really enjoyed the game, i wish it was longer or well, i hope we get more of the game in the future, like with phantom liberty"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"an incredible game. it's darker than i usually like but i'm glad i gave it a chance. there are still occasional crashes for me and you'll need a good gpu. you'll be drawn in. night city feels alive and looks beautiful, even when it's ugly on purpose."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"enjoyed the game overall. beautiful expansive world but almost seems too big sometimes. i hate missing out on stuff but feel the need to fast travel so much to get things done  just don't have the time to stop and take it all in. the story and cut scenes were great with memorable characters you care about. the ui felt crowded and the crafting and modding didn't hit well for me, seemed a little bit of an after thought. i played on normal difficulty and it was never a challenge, could of stood for a bit more creativity in the fights, especially boss battles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"this game is so much fun so far , the graphics are insane , the storyline 5 hours in so far is about a 810 if im being honest , and the different implants im planning to get in my body is lowkey crazy like im trying to get a sandevistan which will take me a bit but overall this game is awesome!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this is an excellent aaa game. if you have avoided it because of the rocky launch do yourself a favor and buy this and the expansion now. you are going to love it. i personally think the most fun is to sneak around and complete missions without being seen or killing anyone. great stealth mechanics and the quests often reward you with extras for playing that way. one last thing, panam 4 life 3!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,i was very hyped to play this game really after playing witcher 3. however i didn't have a pc to play it so now is the time i play it for the first time. i heard there were so much bugs and glitches in the game at the release. but there is nothing like that now. game is very good. enjoyable. really like the vibe and stories of the night city.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"hard to give a review without spoiling anything... it's basically a combination of gta5  metal gear solid the older one from ps2. what is unique to this game is the environmentcity. it's incredibly well designed and full of details. very impressive environment, can't stress this enough. lots of ways to develop your character, almost difficult to understand at times. it's definitely complicated and while it can be neat, it's almost too much. also you can't max out every stat, so you should focus on certain things you want. my character ended up being good at everything and i may want to do it again to see if the game play is different. tons of weapons and fighting styles. story line and characters are really good for a game. i highly recommend buying both the main game and dlc phantom liberty if it's on sale. the dlc alone is substantial contentwise. kinda wished there wasn't so much emphasis on the clothing and customization since your character is 1st person anyways, rarely do you see yourself. i'm running this with a rtx 4070ti super and it looks great. getting great frames with 5700x cpu. there are some times where the game crashes, usually during super fast paced engagements like driving cars fast through the streets. if you like gta, red dead redemption, and old metal gear games you should really like this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game is truly amazing and i dont care who disagrees.when i play this game, it feels like im living a life. the city, the characters, its amazing, truly. play this game, what are you doing if you not playing this. trust me, please trust me, and download this game.you wont regret it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i have every achievement in this game, and it was an enjoyable process to get to here. i only do this for games that i truly, and genuinely enjoy  which is also rare. what a brilliant game, despite its flaws  cyberpunk is an immersive and fun rpg. play the game with phantom liberty, it is an essential desert after the main course."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"night city is stunning, the characters are deep and the story hits hard. side quests are top tier sometimes even better than the main plot of many other games. the atmosphere pulls you in and the world feels alive. yeah there are some minor bugs but nothing deal breaking. if you love rpgs this one is a must play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"love the setting, love the characters, like the story, just wish it wasn't still so glitchy four years after its release and the dlc two years after its release."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game needs no introduction, the characters, stories and humor all work together into this masterpiece of a gem. loved how this game went from a rough launch to being one of the best games ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i love this game. props to the devs. it runs pretty well on my lowend laptop, and has just gotten better and more stable over the updates. can't wait to play it even more when i upgrade to a better system."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"completed this game on console originally, put my controller down, scrapped money together and built my first ever pc just to play it all over again with mods. cb2077 has great game mechanics, is story rich, amazing visuals that sucks you in. for those that are wondering they have fixed all the bugs and glitches that people reported on launch but if your game is ''flatlining'' there will be a fix on yt it sometimes has to do with outdated mods and you have to view the integrity of your files which again is online. i highly recommend getting the game with phantom liberty. 1010 game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"after the 2.0 updates and the additional dlc, cyberpunk 2077 is one of my favorite games of all time within my top 5. it had a rough start, but with cyberpunk edgerunners reviving the community, and cd projeckt red continuing to support the game, it made a fantastic comeback. it's not very often that a game leads me into other forms of media. i've looked into additional books, comics, articles, etc. just to get a bit more of the world that was created. that is the power of what can happen if you make a great game, and i look forward to the next installment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"the greatest comeback a story game has ever made !! can't wait for more cd project red games. people there had metal in their heads, waged war from a distance, using things similar to mega scopes, and there were no horses everyone had their own flying ship instead. geralt ciri stop fooling around ciri told you wouldn't believe me, we should have stayed there"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"its very enjoyable if you like gritty sci fi, very much like a dark future where excess and overindulgence plague society. i found the main campaign to be a bit short but very enjoyable, side missions are great for fleshing out more of the world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"reviewing at 3 hours because for multiple reasons, bought it again on steam after losing access to gog. i have owned and played this game on xbox 360, ps4, gog, and now steam. i adore this game, and am always going to hold onto my 1.03 saves, for the nostalgia of glitchy bugginess. now, it's considered by some to be a masterpiece in some respects, myself included. buy it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game surprised me. i've never been a huge fan of shooters, and this is the first one that ever hooked me and really the only one that has to this level. of course, there are guns, but there's so much more. multiple rich storylines, many characters to follow throughout their journey, especially as they stand by your side throughout yours. a ton of fun, engaging mechanics, with a satisfying sense of progression. given that i'm saying this four and a bit years after release, this is probably obvious by now, but man. banger game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,its a fun game that has amazing graphics if you have the gpu to handle it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i recommend this because it's the only half decent scifi skyrim game available. and no, starfield doesn't rate even to this level. so, pros are straightforward  it's skyrim but cyberpunk. now for the cons. tons of bugs even years later. mission to stealth kill a boss. i get to the room, choose dialog option, it leads to combat. reload a save from outside the room and now the game refuses to offer the dialog option even though i was clean up to the save. i distract the boss via a terminal, he walks over to it back to me. i enter the room and he instantly rubber bands back to his original location  just flies backwards 20 feet  and then alerts and i fail the stealth part. even when the game works normally stealth playstyle is totally fucked. people just randomly turn on a dime and it forces a save and play approach which kills the fun. very hard mode makes most builds and playstyles completely untenable. actually here, you're best bet is stealth takedowns from behind with heavy use of savescumming. not fun. but if you like the idea of a stealth playstyle, maybe you'll focus on snipers. guess what, the only one you can run stealth is underpowered and won't kill anything above normal in one shot. so you'll actually do better sniping at long range with a silenced pistol than a sniper rifle. ludicrous. if you try to stealth attack with a katana you'll just injure them and alert everyone. but with your bare hands you instakill. again, totally absurd. tons of poor interface issues. like even on keyboard a lot of things bind to the same thing. so you'll finish a police scanner encounter and you have to wait like 15 seconds for the text of a journal drop to be available via a pop up. you need to wait, and trigger it then, or it's a pita to go through the journal interface. but then you got xp at the same time and that triggers your fixer calling you with some shit, which interferes. or you want to pick an item up but no matter where you hover the mouse you can't get it  but you can pick up this other thing 5 feet to the left. or the radio in your apartment and car that randomly reset every time you leave  as if some asshole keeps breaking into your apartment and turning it back on. there's a drop attack you can do, but if you don't land it right it'll screw up and then everyone is alerted so it's pretty unusable. you can use throwing knives but only one. then it magically reappears like you're the god of war. if you have more knives you can't use those  you have to wait for magic knife. like most recent games it has a hamfisted woke storyline shoved in in the form of a trans revenge murder side quest. still didn't spare cdpr from woke backlash anyway, but given their recent csuite exec wide eye stare youtube preaching fealty it's only going to get worse in their future games. at least it's not as bad as fc6 where someone gets murdered for the crime of misgendering. all of the endings are total ass. i get that it's a dystopian future but they really screw over the protagonist and, by extension, the friends that you choose to ultimately die for you, die for nothing. unless you read the spoilers to unlock the secret solo ending and even then you get a shit ending. or use the phantom liberty new ending option and.. yeah that's still super shitty but at least you don't get your friends killed. the newly added sandevistan builds are cool but then you can't disable cameras with the deck which makes the soft requirement to stealth half the quests impossible. so it's an end game build option and there is no end game. save all the cyberpsychos until late game with a cloak equipped. save the beat on the brats for end game and get gorilla arms. both of these get offered to you right at the start and just aren't set up for that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,i rate this game 2nd place story and gameplaywise for me in that depratment nothing can beat the red dead games. but huge props to the devs for making this masterpiece and bringing us one of best animes of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"honestly, the first game in a long time that makes me want to replay it over and over again. it not being repetitive and unpredictable is what makes this game fun for me. there will always be cons in games and without being bias i think with that being said the cons that the game has now, are not as game breaking as they used to be. overall, i do recommend this to other players who are looking for something more free and immersive. the story is jam packed and compelling. game is very much enjoyable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"amazing graphics, great gameplay"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"i bought this game when the ultimate edition was released but i only began to play it in earnest as of version 2.21 in 2025. i, like everyone else, had heard the negative things about it at launch. i can safely say none of that applies, now. this is a fun game. even as someone who doesn't play firstperson games and rarely enjoys shooters, i find the story, characters, and overall atmosphere of this game to be engaging. i highly recommend, and bonus if you are a fan of the cyberpunk genre, because the game definitely delivers the vibe."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,one of the games where i actually just picked the closest quest and just started completing everything. not a big fan of story mode style games but this one was pretty good. 100 would recommend. i've done two alternate endings and will probably do a few more.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"best game i've ever played, incredible graphics, great story, fun gunplay and runs well. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"a bit too much talk for my taste early, but it picks up quick and is very well made. quite an enjoyable game,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"the game on release was utter dog shit, but as the years past and the constant updates to fix the game it molded this game as amazing. the story path i went on was outstanding, the dialogue was great, and the combat was also clean. i highly recommend for anyone to get this game and experience it themselves even if it was already spoiled to them. this game also proves that consumers shouldn't rush the game devs to release games early and wait until the game is actually finished to play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"pros the graphics, characters, effects and battle dynamics are excellent. the variety of weapons is enough. the characters are each like the real thing and taste more like a movie than a game. it's like an experience. this game makes you count down the days to do the next part. it's nice to have a roleplaying game and direct it to different ends, but it takes a while to fully learn the game. you may want to play the game constantly because there are many kills and ways to play. cons vehicle and motorcycle driving physics are bad. it turns too much and can go crooked. npcs are so stupid because he jumps in front of the car, dies, and as if that wasn't enough, the cops show up next to him 5 seconds later. if you're not a good player, keep the difficulty level down because they don't die. bugs still persist in the game, although not as much as before. it is quite possible to see 12 pieces every time you play. it's like rendering late and having the vehicles spawn in an instant. overall just buy and play it. it's really worth it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"best game i've ever played. the graphics are immersive, the story is compelling and the gameplay it self is very enjoyable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,played and completed this game when it was at the buggy 1.0 and i loved it then and love it all the more in its polished glory. the developers really know how to make a world feel lived in and in turn immerse the player into the mindset that makes them want to scrape and crawl to the finish.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,graphics are amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"love this game so much. i like open world games and being able to basically become max level before the first mission. so thats what i did, i dont like playing games and only getting the cool stuff and abilities towards the end or having them unlocked through newgame, no i want to be top dog right out the pound. multiple endings is also a good choice to have, probably only going to play it once but its dope to play it and see how i compared to my friends and what not 9.9910"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,saur good i had to acquire through legitimate means to support the devs. played during the rocky launch  was still phenom. vas and writers really went absolutely insane  more than made up for the bugs at the time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"game keren. dulu waktu pertama keluar saya ingat banyak sekali bugnya. salut untuk developer game ini cd projekt red, bisa merubah game ini dari unplayable menjadi luar biasa seperti ini. meski butuh waktu 4 tahun. buat teman2 di indonesia, harus coba game ini sekali seumur hidup."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"i love this game so much. might be my favorite game ever, except that i played it first on ps4 pro the day it came out and remember what that was like. even then though it still had one of the greatest worlds and stories i had ever experienced. the pain of realizing i couldn't do basic things like customize cars or scale legendary weapons into the late game i remember dumping thousands of materials into silverhand's pistol only for it to still be weaker than an epic revolver was eased with free patches. the game now is a masterpiece. loses points for having a final mission that is eternally in your quest log. ala fallout new vegas 910"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"this is more than just a good looking game and a next gen technology show off. this is life. i don't want to finish this game, let hanako wait in amber forever. please add new story dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"910. the story was amazing and hooked me in every time i loaded it up, not experienced that feeling since half lifeportal series and gta v when it first came out. so glad they polished it and worked the severe bugs out! been on my wish list since it came on steam. just finished the main story right before i wrote this and i want more! will get the phantom liberty dlc!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,super fun and addicting. lots of builds and replayablity
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"truly one of the best games i've ever played. the world building and setting are absolutely top tier accompanying a narrative with tough thought provoking choices and meaningful consequences. before cyberpunk i'd never had the pleasure of exploring a world so immaculately detailed and well thought out as night city. in addition to an unrivaled setting, the game play is a deep well of build variety and moment to moment choice to tackle each challenge however you the as the player see fit. this is a must play by any and all standards."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"still has some minor bugs, but overall this game is a great experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"no matter how the game started out, right now it is a masterpiece! the story especially is top tier!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,still a bit buggy but incredible game holds up
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"while the launch was rocky, the wait and redemption was worth the wait. this is by far one of the greatest modern rpg's ever made. overall i'd give this a 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"just best game i've ever played. play with mods that improve immersion, don't fast travel anywhere and take time to do side quests. you won't be disappointed. also phantom liberty is great, get it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"very fun with story that grabbed me personally. but if your wanting to mod. just be careful though. it can either be a painful brain dance, or simple."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,great game. haven't met any bugs so far. think the patch really helped out the game. the expansion seems great too.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"cyberpunk has been the most enjoyable game i have ever played. the story is amazing and immersive, the game does not force you on a certain path and i feel like the game builds upon much of what makes the witcher 3, fallout 4 and even mass effect games fun. resulting in an experience which i don't believe to be matched by anything else. also the dlc is amazing. that being said, there are things which could have been done better.  inventory management and crafting system can take time getting used to.  many of the character builds which could be fun to play on are not obvious and trying them out requires commitment which can't be reversed.  the open nature of the game means you are likely to miss out on logbooks, quests and alternative endings. all of which could help you understand the world better and get more out of the game.  cyberpunk is also at least somewhat more gpu intensive that it has to be due to poorly implemented taa anti aliasing and upscaling. these are issues with many modern games and i can only hope that cdpr and the industry in general moves away from this direction in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"great story, great combat, great gameplay.. hell yeah i recommend this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,the graphics and the immersion really blew me away. the dlc could be it's own game. put 52 hours into the game and still have so much more to do.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,just finished my 100 playthrough of the game. absolutely without a doubt a 1010 game. up there with my favorite games of all time. did a playthrough back when the game released and i'm happy to say the game is 110 better now. highly recommend this fantastic game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,in this more or less final version the game is really great whether it be that you get lost in sidequests or follow the detailed main story line getting to know night city in and out.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"i bought this game back in december of 2022. i remember having a meh attitude towards the whole game. the intro as a nomad, fixing your current car at the time, trying to become a known legend in night city, i was not drawn in immediately. meeting jackie for the first time and doing the shootout with him smuggling an iguana, that was as far as i gotten back then. for a little over two years i did not pick up this game. i saw memes and bugs online and it made me more disinterested as time went on. a friend of mine recommended that i give cyberpunk 2077 another shot after i told him i have beaten god of war. when i tell you that i am currently addicted to this game, words can not describe the euphoria i have experienced lately. i have not had this much fun since red dead redemption 2 came out back in 2018. the story telling and atmosphere is up there with some of the best rpgs i have ever played. it is not perfect, but since cd projekt red has teased possibly a few more updates, there is no complaint from me here. my entire play through so far, i have experienced one crash it involved doing several quick hacks against enemies and exploding a vehicle beside me. there have been npc's on the streets of night city that would float above the ground when sitting. i experienced a bug once where my car would just drive in loops around my character, impeding my chances of getting in. of all the hours i have put in, those have been minor inconveniences compared to stuff i experienced in 2022. it took me about two hours to reach night city and that is where things started picking up. the more you play and explore, you find yourself having a better understanding on how to play and interact with the game cyber ware, crafting, upgrading guns, receiving free cool cars through missions, exploring areas, and finding unique items or guns skippy. following through the main story or doing a side missions are well written and captivating. from a gonk of a launch, to a truly special game. if you were skeptical of trying the game regarding it's history, now is the time to give it another chance."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"it didn't fully meet my expectations, but it offered an aboveaverage open world, enjoyable side quests, and a decent storyline, making for an overall fun experience. however, inconsistencies, bugs, and performance issues hindered my enjoyment. 710  a good game. i'm playing again after the new update and some issues seem to have been resolved"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"beautiful game with very high replay ability, there is some minor visual bug and some quest is still bugged but nothing too major, highly recommended 810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"played when the game had originally dropped in 2020, and despite the bugs and glitches i had a blast and was invested in such a memorable story and setting. now, having played it a 2nd time after all the updates and fixes, as well as the dlc, i can say this game has solidified itself as a true classic amongst the titans of the gaming industry. and absolute mustplay, the ending still brings a tear to my eye."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"in this game, you can shoot people, and run them over. also your character can have some very cool aesthetic features. i don't know what the plot is about, but, 1010 game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"you know, i remember seeing gameplay of this game when it first came out. i endlessly ragged on this game for just about everything from bugs to gameplay to what appeared at the time to be a shallow world. right now, i'm playing through all my games in a desperate no backlog challenge attempt, so that doesn't leave me much time to pursue side objectives in most of these games. however, i couldn't help myself here. i actually became quite immersed in everything this game had to offer. the combat was fun as hell and made me feel like a badass. i genuinely started to care for the characters and the results of my actions on the world around me. if i was near a side objective, i did it. if it was for a character i enjoyed, i did it. all this to say that i was genuinely impressed, and whatever insults i offered this game on launch, i take it back and instead offer my suggestion to absolutely try this game out. the ending was phenomenal and truly respects the character development and choices made along the way. i didn't even have phantom liberty and was quite satisfied. worth the time, and i'll likely come back in the end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"there are few moments that as a gamer you'd know a game is just more than a game, and this is one of those experiences. you'll be certainly in for something more than what you're expecting. gameplay various routes to build your character for combat and interaction with the world. each life route also provides a good insight to the world. the world is immersive and big to explore, my hours are low because i already spent longer hours on a different platform, but throughout over 600 hours of playing in total, never once the game play was tiresome. story as i said each life path gives a decent insight to the world, but when you start it does a perfect job of roleplaying if you only select the related dialogue options for you path. story is so immersive and character developments and storytelling is so perfect, that even after playing each ending, you'd still feel the certain highs as you did playing the first time. dlc adds a good chunk to both gameplay and story, while you can be fine just playing the base game, it's certainly worth the price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"buggy but some glitches make ya laugh,all though preem game fun weapons and good story"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"great game, character, narrative and setting. game has some glitches, but nothing near bethesda level. fun all around and a good campaign. wish we had more stellar first person narratives nowadays."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"just finished my first ending after finishing all the gigs and most side jobs. the game has a lot of moments where it's really good thought provoking and hype. but it's so rough around the edges mostly because of inconsistentcey with decision making and the consequences of being inconsistent. the couple endings i've seen so far end on the climax without enough of a real conclusion in my opinion. this isn't helped by the fact time spent with characters is too limited to become invested in any of them properly. all the side job and gig characters endings feel too abrupt and as if the team had to finish them to finish the product in time for a deadline instead of tell a full story. also dialogue is stiff and sound just kinda dumb in some scenes. except johnny because he's with you the whole game and does develop and change over time with v depending on how you act which is what i would have liked more from other characters. johnny's character, development and conclusion is by far my favourite part of the game. unfortunately the whole game feels like it's just better to wait for the sequel which will improve upon all the many minor issues with this game which hold it back from being one of the greats. especially as it's still littered with major bugs even on the 2.2 patch. the games main strengths are it's immersive, atmospheric and is backed by an awesome fitting soundtrack but it most importantly is very fun especially the combat so it's still worth playing for sure if you're interested. 7.510"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"i played the cyberpunk 2077 ps4 day one release version, by many considered to be the worst version of the game. about 23rds of the way through the slog i gave up. the game just wasn't worth playing, and i was hardly the only one who felt this way. many updates later it finally reached a state where many people have now come around to it. though the game is far more enjoyable then it was on release and i would recommend it, i personally feel like it still has some fundamental issues that run deeper than bugs and combat. 2077 only superficially resembles the original ttrpg. while elements like slang give dialog a great level of authenticity, many core pillars of cyberpunk are absent from this digital version of night city. while i'm sad to see fun elements like posergangs gangs who get plastic surgery to look like celebrities go, i believe that there are two core features that are instrumental to the cyberpunk experience that 2077 is lacking h2 1. role playing h2 cyberpunk is first and foremost a role playing game. night city is merely a thematic backdrop for characters created by passionate players to explore choices, themes, and stories. 2077's protagonist, v, is a supremely written character but that is exactly the issue. v is a prewritten character like geralt in the witcher, and is fundamentally closer to fallout 4's natenora than any ttrpg player character. though v is given depth in writing, the player is given no depth of choice. nowhere is this clearer than in the player's interactions with the character of johnny silverhand. if the player blindly aligns themselves with silverhand's ideals or completely opposes them, his character makes sense. however, if the player handles johnny's many remarks with the nuance they deserve his character quickly becomes confusing. nuance makes johnny come off as a tryhard contrarian, someone who bases their entire personality on always being different both from other people and from other's expectations. this feels like incredible character depth... until you realize the game doesn't allow you to acknowledge it in any way. this wasn't masterful writing, it's an accident. it's the game's limited reactivity laid bare. johnny isn't someone who hides his real feeling away behind layers upon layers of irony, sarcasm, and contrarianism, he's just a complete and utter jackass read hero who keeps talking about his cock every chance he gets. the only real question the game poses on johnny, the second most important character in this storydriven rpg, is whether you think his actions were justified. the entire game is like this. simple binary choices. sometimes you get to use your skills in dialog for some extra money or to bypass a combat section, but rarely do you get to define who v is as a character because that has already been determined for you. h2 2. humanitypunk h2 humanity is a core theme in cyberpunk to the point it even has an associated stat. in the ttrpg it is directly related to your character's empathy. installing cyberware bionic implants risks insanity, and only highly empathetic characters can reap the benefits of multiple cybernetic enhancements without losing their humanity. this core concept is completely absent from v as a character. npcs get a handful of military implants and go psycho but v can replace their entire body with machine parts and suffer no consequences. the reason humanity is so important to cyberpunk's identity is because it's dystopian transhumanist setting is all about stories centered on humanity's continued perseverance. it's about human emotion, tragedy, relationships, fighting for your beliefs, burning out rather than fading away. it's punk. nowhere is this more clear than in the game's anime series, cyberpunk edgerunner. it is no accident that edgerunners completely revitalized interest in the game. it embodies all the great thematic qualities inherent to cyberpunk qualities that 2077 only flirts with. humanity as it is understood in the ttrpg is at the forefront of the series, and it makes for one of the most exciting, unique, and heart wrenching anime of the past decade. this quality is a doubleedged sword it exposed how lacking 2077 was in comparison. the game feels directionless, meandering. it only hints at themes instead of going all out. it has wellwritten characters, but they are just there to make up for the human struggles that v lacks. none of it is punk, it's just cyber. despite my criticisms i do feel cyberpunk 2077 is a game worth playing. the combat system is vastly improved over the original release and now allows for 3 core playstyles. the gunplay itself is soso, but everything surrounding it like movement, special abilties, hacks, and slow motion make it engaging. stats and the skill tree now actually feel meaningful, though this is largely limited to combat. the characters that you interact with are authentically written and acted, even if they aren't very punk. i like that they left some room in night city for more human experiences. an example of this would be how a side character runs a new age spiritualism shop and will read you tarot. that seems out of place in a cybernetic future, but that's exactly what makes it feel authentic and human. what i especially like is that v's romance options are genderspecific but that the game still lets you embarrass yourself by flirting with someone who is not interested. characters feel more real when they aren't just prizes to be won as part of the player's wish fulfillment. at the end of the day cyberpunk 2077 is a semicompetent open world action game in a setting loosely inspired by the cyberpunk ttrpg. it lacks choices and thematic depthconsistency, but generally creates an engaging experience through combat gameplay and writing. if you like slightly generic open world games that constantly dripfeed you dopamine by having you travel towards a marker and then shooting a couple guys there, this game is for you. h3 the game isn't punk, and that's the most punk thing about it. h3 b nitpicky rant bit b here's some smaller things that shouldn't really matter but they annoyed me so now i'm gonna annoy you  ingame radio is godawful. i know cdpr commissioned a bunch of songs for the game. i think they should get their money back. still cry everytime i wanna stay at your house comes on though.  cameos. i like kojima and his classic kojimbo rambling and thought jesse cox did a great job voicing his character. that said, grimes' delivery was so impressively bad that i can still feel the secondhand embarrassment. but hey, at least she's consistent in her talent.  cdpr spent so much time developing all these gangs and their identities only to use them as disposable fodder.  there's technically a lot of clothing but most of it is reskins of the same few items. there's way more pieces of clothing in the game than what you can get but cdpr doesn't want us to be drippy so all we got is this mediocre wardrobe.  city feels kinda artificial in a bad way. witcher 3's towns all felt pretty lively but in 2077 i often find myself thinking about how unnatural things look and feel.  couldn't romance aurore cassel from the dlc. i know i previously said wish fulfillment is bad but in this specific case i retract that statement because it suits me.  tiered loot is lazy and mostly based on the level you are.  can't change the skin on a gun, which is silly. also don't know what skin an attachment has until you equip it.  speaking of skins, the game has a feature where you can copy a car's skin, but this only works on very specific vehicles for arbitrary reasons.  there's ripperdocs other than viktor he's my ride or die  this entire section was honestly just an excuse to talk about the grimes thing, i'm still surprised that made it into the game.  cars in a game like this don't need realistic physics simulations, just make them fun to drive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"cd projekt red kinda redeemed themselves with the update and dlc. but the final product still feel a lot less like what they promised in the trailer. hopefully orion won't have the same issue. for me, the gameplay is great and feel smooth, i can have variation in combat and doesn't feel bored. the main story is an 810 and the side quest is the usual cd projekt red side quest, mostly nice, leaning into our morality in it's decision. but can't help to feel a bit underwhelmed compared to the witcher 3. so, don't expect the same quality from both games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"wow. just wow. i've put in around 300 hours into this game 5050 split here and on console. i've experience 3 of the 6 different endings, and of the 3 i've seen, they are so worth it. cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece throughnthrough. i'll break it up into sections, and i promise not to spoil anything that's not in the trailers or stuff like that, but this game has been out for so long and has had its' fair share of press over the years. v i have never been so immersed into a character....ever. v truly is whoever you want them to be. their origin, their journey, their finale. i played male v first, then female v. both are done to perfection. they have little differences that change everything about them, yet they are the same character. male v is just sick of everyone's bs all the time, and female v has this sound of hopeful spirit in her voice. it's fair to say you'll spend a lot time with v and you will have a preference. i mean to say that they are not identical in their mannerisms, tones and if you ever see comparison videos of the two in cut scenes, you'll tell! i have to give a massive shout out to gavin drea male v and cherami leigh female v as well as cdpr. you killed it! especially with lockdown and gavin recording in london and cherami in los angeles. you will love v, no matter what. trust me. never fade away the story is superb! again, no spoilers. you all know that keanu reeves makes a appearance in this game and my god...i'll get to him next. story is so rich and full of meaningful characters and i mean besides the occasional 20 min side mission  everyone stands out. the game is split into 3 acts all of which have very identifiable characteristics. i wont get into the nitty gritty but i will say that the pacing is great! unless you are 100ing it then it takes forever but that's my doing. you will cry, you will laugh, you will cringe and you will have one helleva time. wake the f up, samurai keanu f reeves. easily steals the show whenever he is there and trust me, he's there! he plays a rocker boy called johnny silverhand and...yeah, breathtaking. so stellar and by the later half of this run i would skip most dialogue unless it was him. he's like jack sparrow meets gordon ramsey. johnny and v mesh perfectly together and truly form a symbiotic relationship together. not in a weird way but a kickass way. for male v he is like the most loyal brother you could wish for and for female v is like the annoying younger brother who has some valuable pointers but she just wants to go by her day. the city of dreams there is no better world design than night city. none. it is so goddamn gorgeous. if you can run it with raytracing it's 1000 times better. the neon lights and truly bladerunner vibes never gets old. i've caught myself wasting hours just driving around the city at night looking at the massive ads everywhere illuminating the night sky. truly unbelievable. the outskirts of night city feel like outskirts in all the right ways as it's integral to one or two of the many story lines. it's not bland with nothing to do, though night city is so addicting. all the areas have such distinct characteristics and you will always know where you are just by the environment. the world though they promised more is still crazy. the people you meet become so connected to night city and it's many districts that you'll see them as one in the same thing. i can't say enough about this and how incredible a job they did by making a truly believable city with our societal, economic and political ways. phantom liberty this is the dlc for the game again no spoilers except one and it can provide an alternate ending for v. you meet more memorable people and another celebrity idris elba, face more strong narrative choices and it truly bumps the game's experience up a notch. when i played the game on xbox, obviously this wasn't made yet and i loved the game. but when this came out, it brought a massive update known as 2.0. which literally turned this game into cyberpunk 2077 2.0. the progression, the customisation, the upgrades, the games performance....it became what it was set out to be back in 2020. all of this stuff is free to everyone besides the dlc section but yeah damn, phantom liberty is so worth it as it like cdpr's witcher 3 is long. it added about 25 more hours to the game as my latest run was at 70 hrs. waiting for a sale is never a bad idea but if you can buy it at full price, do it. you will not regret it. for 100ing oh boy, this game took me...well you can see. over 100hrs to beat. it wasn't hard but it was a grind. i chose to do all the side missions and phantom liberty as soon as they popped up which made the game run so damn long lol. it was worth it to me as i love this game. it does have 23 achievements that aren't tied to just playing the game. what i mean is like throw a grenade, hack someone and do this blah blah blah all at once which you would never do naturally. look up the achievements once you've finished the game as they are easy to miss. you're breathtaking! overall this is worth every penny and is truly a monumental story. the game had major problems at the start, as you may all know. but i believed in this games success and i am so happy that it worked out. this is the no mans sky of single player games. truly a remarkable recovery and a breathtaking experience. one last thing about this game. it's a warning. that is it's biggest strength. if we don't change our ways, we will have night city night city is los angeles, fyi. the corruption, the complete economic disarray. the whole kit and caboodle. it's actually polarising, and yet shockingly familiar to our world. just something i've found interesting. i know i wrote a thesis on this lol but to me this game deserves it. see you in the major leagues! love you, bye!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"amazing story, very engaging. i didn't understand the hype at first but now its all i think about while at work!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"overall, i really enjoyed this game. story was interesting, characters were engaging, combat was varied and exciting. glad i waited until i upgraded my hardware and for cdpr to work out the kinks. phantom liberty was awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"overwhelmingly yes! this game  rocks and scratches that itch for a true action rpg experience. ironically i'm not a big fps guy anymore but the moment to moment gun play and systems are done so well. i keep finding myself year after year coming back to this game. the community is great, the developers never gave up on their baby and it is truly a masterclass of art, direction and themes. on high end systems, everyone knows that this is a must buy. great way to benchmark your rig and get some pretty great flicks off of photo mode. this is a comfort game to me that i'm sure years from now i'll be happy to either boot back up or look happily upon it. also, tons of mods that just are chef's kiss cosmetic, gameplay, engine tweaking, and some pretty elaborate devmod menus i wait patiently for the witcher 4 and hope that the next release follows the labor of love treatment cyberpunk got. thank you cdpr for a phenomenal experience over the past 4 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"genuinely one of the best games out there. this game is a high i've been chasing since its release, and i'm sorely disappointed that there wont be more content released. i can remember just about every side quest, every unique weapon, every cybernetic, etc. the game is incredible and easily one of the most fun open world games ive ever played. i have had hours of fun just fighting enemies, especially maxtac. if you want a unique, fun, first person sandbox game that doesn't waste your time and has mechanics that rival the most intense movement shooters and the best of stealth games, this is it. i only wish we could have had a second dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"game is amazing! great story, great gameplay and world. t he world. is alive and interesting. from small gigs that give cash to robbing arasaka you are free to do pretty much anything. if you are thinking of buying it.. do it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"after 5 years of patching and a gpu upgrade, i can finally recommend this game. it feels like a mix between gta 5  deus ex games"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"amazing game, gorgeous graphics and great story line. revolutionary game especially for the genre it's probably the goat. 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"played this first on ps5 for over 900 hours. this game offers such a rich and immersive world to explore and i can't seem to stop, so i bought it for pc as well d plus the photo mode that recently got even more updated makes me even more obsessed! but i wish there were more normal poses without getting mods to do this.  3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"it's funny how with each year the subplots from the game get more and more relatable to the real world, the graphics better and the mod support wider."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"playing cyberpunk 2077 over four years after release is a completely different experience than when it launched. the myriads of game breaking bugs and underbaked or entirely nonexistent promised features have all been resolved, and now it has become one of the most visually immersive and detailed video games on the market. nothing quite compares to night city it is truly the games strongest aspect as you will find yourself constantly drawn into the unique aesthetic and vibe of the city. playing with path tracing elevates this to the next level, as it completely transforms the game. when it comes to graphics, cyberpunk is best in class. the main story is pretty good. the characters you meet mostly have a personality and the story kept me interested the whole way through. combat was also good, with great variety in weapon type and satisfying feedback. vehicles and driving were also another highlight, with a wide variety of cars that were easily obtainable and all being fun to drive. the soundtrack is also excellent. the game is far from perfect though. the biggest issue i have is the illusion of choice the game has. the choices you make prior to the point of no return have virtually no impact on the ending you receive, or the outcome of certain quests. the game draws you in with unique lifepaths nomad, corpo, street kid, but these offer nothing but random dialogue options that exist as nothing but flavour text. its particularly disappointing because it is advertised as a defining choice that will shape your playthrough, which it simply does not. i also found the game incredibly easy. i was disappointed that there wasnt much of a challenge that forced me to optimise my build to tackle certain missions or bosses. it felt like a waste of such a unique combat system. some side quests are also incredibly dull, and the sheer amount of them combined with the various gigs and simple combat missions scattered throughout the city felt as if they were simply a means to increase the games length. crafting is also completely meaningless, and the skill trees are vast and complex, yet mild in their actual impact  but these are only minor gripes. what resolves all the above is the phantom liberty dlc. it is hands down the best dlc i have ever played in a game. the narrative and characters are immersive and engaging, and the environment of dogtown is stunning. it is truly the summation of the strongest aspects of cyberpunk. unfortunately, this elevation from the base game in almost every aspect works against itself as the dlc which is played out roughly halfway through the game feels tonally different and almost out of place because of how good it is. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is excellent. playing for the first time in 2025 feels exactly like the cyberpunk that was originally promised all those years ago. it has been refined over the years and is finally in a place that cements it as one of the action rpg greats. cyberpunk 2077 810 phantom liberty 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i've finally giving cyberpunk a try. 100 hours in, i've immersed in night city, peeling it's onion layers one by one. i love the amount of details cdpr put in their world building. each gigs have deeper lore in them that you can find in other gigs or encounters. it's been a while since i jump into a lore rabbithole like this game has. in my opinion, this game could expand more of it's features so that some of them wouldn't feel halfbaked andor put there just for the sake of it. so that the game can be even more immersive, since that's what cdpr are going for with first person view."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"after all the fixes this game will blow you away. the way every character your introduced to has an impact, an impression on your play through whether they live or die, it builds up such a fleshed out world. it also has you weigh heavily in on decisions nothing feels like the truly right choice only a path you could take, its so insane its to the point youll spends minutes even just on one dialogue option wondering if what your doing is really what you want for yourself or the other characters and how it could affect you down the line. the only complaint i could come up with in terms of gameplay is the combat system, it isnt perfect but makes up with it by the sheer amount of customization without making you feel lost. if the game is on sale youd be an absolute gonk not to at least try it out"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i saw corps strip farmers of water ... and eventually of land. saw them transform night city into a machine fueled by people's crushed spirits, broken dreams and emptied pockets. corps've long controlled our lives, taken lots... and now they're after our souls! v, i've declared war not because capitalism's a thorn in my side or outta nostalgia for an america gone by. this war's a people's war against a system that's spiralled outta our control. it's a war against the fuckin' forces of entropy, understand? do whatever it takes to stop 'em, defeat 'em, gut 'em. if i gotta kill, i'll kill. if i need your body, i'll fuckin' take it! fuckin' hell ... you still don't see it. but you will one day. johnny silverhand, cyberpunk 2077"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"cyberpunk 2077 has been a fun experience so far, but ive lost count of how many times it has crashed on me. there have been moments where i genuinely thought a bug was part of a missiononly to log in the next day and realize, nope, it was just a glitch. the story itself is great, but the constant crashing and bugs make it overwhelming at times. i had someone tell me they didnt like gta v, but honestly, cyberpunk 2077 feels like the same kind of game, just set in a different time period. actually, id say gta v's graphics might even be better. cd projekt red is nowhere near rockstar in terms of polish, but i do give them credit for trying. the game is definitely enjoyable, despite its flaws. that said, one thing that bugs me besides the literal bugs is how sexuality is integrated into the game. i mean, throwing in a random dildo or some nudity? whatever, thats not a big deal. but when my character ends up in a onenight stand without me wanting to take it that far, it just feels unnecessary. although if it were keanu reeves johnny silverhand? well, that might be a different story!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"for folks like us? wrong city, wrong people. literally no game like this nor will there ever be again probably. once you finish a playthrough, you're just gonna start it up again. no other game can replicate the feeling of a more lived in world with these amazing characters. 2077 910 pl 1510 game is even better with mods!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"the main story line is good, keeps you playing. i would say that most everyday battles in the streets and the side quests are not too difficult, i have set to a lower difficulty. the boss battles are much more difficult and you will need a good level progression and cyberware to do well and defeat the enemies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,one of the best games i have played. 1010 on par if not better than rdr2 but can be confusing for first playthrough. see you in the major leagues jackie
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i played through the full game on stadia, day 1 now i am replaying it again after the version 2 updates. i love this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,still best updated version and trying best not to complete to quickly savor every moment of play...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"this game just hits different. i really enjoy how visually capturing and immersive it is, i hope they release more dlc or release a sequal or second one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"rough launch but the devs pulled it back for sure. insane story and the gameplay is also hella fun, be warned though, don't expect a happy story lol. good luck choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"pros the characters, voice acting, visuals, diverse world, tons of content missions, lore, random npc dialogue, etc cons combat can get pretty repetitive and the npcs are very predictable but maybe it's because i'm playing on normal, just sneakily crouching and head shooting everyone, the world feels like the devs had a lot of unfinished plans for it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"runs surprisingly well on my 6 year old laptop. any issues i encountered often didn't retract from the fun, and i thoroughly enjoyed the story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,cyberpunk story is the best story game i've played in a while if u cut the gameplay it wll be another great movie. and i reccommend to buy dlc too it will take place between act 2 or 3 of the main game and the dlc story is really good too it gave us james bond vibe. great game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"ignoring launch, it is a beautiful game set in the most immersive city i've ever played. i beat it on console and played a little bit of the new updates, so i'll give my opinion. very, very good story. even a little unnervingly prophetic. a future we can avoid, but not one devoid of hope, just very full of the worst of humanity. every character is well done and polished. every build has a decently fun gameplay loop that differs in certain key ways. i think my only problem with the game is that it is actively killing my system while i try to play it on certain settings, like it's definitely pretty bad when nearly five years after release people are still using your game as the benchmark. and don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely pushing the limits of graphical fidelity and is a testament to how far we've come, but lord this game needs a data center to run well enough. and they aren't even using the redengine for their next project, so it's like all that to just switch over to unreal engine? come on man. don't know if this is nearly the same cd projekt red as the one that made the witcher iii these days, but for what it's worth, this game ended up alright. they will not have a second chance to save a broken launch in this environment. my wallet can only take so many bad hits before i say i should just work on my backlog."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"this game is absolutely incredible.... like, where do i begin, no spoilers doe p"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"this game has had my attention from the day i got it, it's just so much fun. i love the depth of which you can customize your character and how much freedom the game gives you from the second you get outta the prologue."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"great game! so much to do, lots of variety and fun! many different ways to play, and worth multiple play throughs. driving machanics are good, better than gta. fighting mechanics are great, you can go stealth, melay, techy, or machine gun. totally worth it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"cyberpunk 2077 might very well be the worst release of a aaa video game in my lived experience. i spent a great deal of time since 2020 looking at cdpr's latest openworld rpg as indicative of its loss of moral fiber and integrity and its endless desire for capital as a nowpublicallytraded company. it wasn't until fall of 2024 that my older brother spoke out about his love for this title, and i decided to return to it on sale for 30. i have an endless list of complaints for this game. i feel that cdpr has made a great deal of sacrifices in making this an openworld experience instead of a more tailormade, linear game. in general, i find that openworld video games fail to meet my meagre expectations, and cyberpunk 2077 is no exception on this front. the world is very static and unreactive, the consequences and choices to be made outside of quests are so negligible they will never impact your gameplay. the sidequest content in cyperpunk 2077 is awful and by and large it only exists to grant resources for those interested in grinding. the rpgprogression system is terrible, and its reworks have done very little to improve upon its initial, unplayable state. despite all of these complaints, the main storyline and quests of cyberpunk 2077 are incredibly memorable, impactful, and thoughtprovoking. if this game existed only as the series of main quests provided, it would be a generally better experience. and despite the sacrifices made to make this game openworld, the parts that survived are absolutely worth your time. without any desire to spoil the experience, i recommend cyberpunk 2077 for the sale price of 30, and believe you will have a great time playing it for that price. i do not recommend this title at 60, but it has a long history of deep discountstry and buy it during the summer or winter sales."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"if you are thinking about buying this game, buy this game it is amazing and far better than at launch with such a vibrant and lively world. the show can not do it enough justice"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,the graphics are so awesome. great story and keeps you interested.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"this game is insanely hard to put down once you pick it up. i've done a run for all 3 of the life paths. in my second run corpo, i did every gig and ncpd job, have tried all the cool cyberware and still want to play more and more. super addicting story, characters, dlc, etc. it's simply peak. 100010 would highly recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"at first i was iffy about playing this game because when it first became popular with lets players it was a glitchy unplayable mess. after some years i came back and i decided to give the game real chance. and after playing i can say i love this game! the story is great, the futuristic aesthetic is amazing, and i love the subtle world building. my only complaints are the lack of love interest and the car driving mechanics. i feel like im driving like the toys for toy story 2, every turn felt so sensitive but its not that bad when riding a motorcycle. back to the love interest, im surprised theres only 2 options for either female and male v. i dont mind giving the love interest their own sexual orientations but if youre going to do so the options should be plentiful for each gender. and they should also change the dialogue with the different vs, why is panam flirting with my female v when she doesnt even want her fr. if they werent going to change the dialogue they shouldnt have added restrictions and made it so either v had a chance. idk these are small gripes that dont take away from the gameplay or story. i still believe cyberpunk is an amazing game and that people should give it a chance!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,truly a masterpiece in its current form after all these years and terrible release. this game is so story rich and the replayability is off the charts. it will have you wanting to playthrough all the different endings. even the side characters and their quest lines are in depth and will have you questioning your morality as you make decisions that impact not only their life but v's.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"what an incredible experience. just finished my first playthrough. did absolutely everything i could and ended up with 107 hours. i had some interest in the game initially but never played or bought it due to the massive flop it was at launch. later, i heard it was fixed and amazing and it was always on my backburner of games to play, but i just never got around to it. im super glad i finally did. pretty much everything about it was amazing. i did feel a bit overwhelmed early on but other than that, it was smooth sailing. i think i only had one crash during my 107 hours. there were a few very minor bugs like my car spawns in the sky and falls down to the road, but nothing that really was of any concern. im sad that my time in nightcity has came to an end. im already considering another play through. do a totally different build and pick different options this time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"deep and unique, lots to learn, do and explore. not easy, even on easy, until you figure out all the mechanics."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"this game has one of the best story lines of any game i have ever played. combined with engaging and entertaining gameplay, and a rich environment to explore. this will remain one of my all time favourite games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"after few years of patching this game, after 2.0 patch, there is no other game with such juicy, immersive gameplay and first of all  atmosphere pouring out of the screen. i practically don't use fast travel system, because i drive slowly trough the nigh city in my 911, silverhand is chilling with me. looking up, i see a city designed in chaotic beauty  office buildings, monumental blocks, avs, viaducts, cables. looking down, i see punks, or maybe nomads, or maybe rich people consumed by consumerism, it depends of district. it's nice to slow down sometimes and to inhale the air of this city. gameplay and difficulty level is something you need to try. no excuses. it depends of you if you want to be a shadow, or a tank, but i think trying to be yourself is the best option  you can't eat a cake and have a cake. if you know cdprojekt, you have to know, that the narration and story are at the highest level. details, easter eggs, original stories, genitals. they redeemed their sins after a failed debut and now you have one of the greatest aaa games in history."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"fantastic game with an amazing story, just wish some of the important features weren't locked behind very specific dialogue options. it is in general very fun to interact with the characters and drive around like a madman though."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"despite the rough launch everyone seems to talk about, purchasing the game now is definitely worth it. i love the story, game play, graphics and everything. the skill tree makes possible to have an infinite amount of play styles to complete the game. want to do it stealthily? you can do that. want to go in guns blazing? you can do that. want to be a movement demon? you. can. do. that. if you're thinking of buying it, just go for it. and if you like it? get the dlc as well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"very immersive gameplay. the character builds are nice. good music, beautiful city and land, driving is fun and relaxing and quests are interesting and fun! well done cd project red."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"overall  a good game. solid storytelling, nice characters, okayish battle system and character progression. some annoying bugs here and there, glitches and visual artifacts. anyway all of this cannot really take what it really is  a good game. unfortunately not great or excellent but good enough to leave its mark in games history."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"this game has been in my library for a long time. i came from the days of the cyberpunk pen and paper rollplaying game and this game scratches that nostalgia itch for sure. on the surface, the game has amazing graphics, gunplay, story, and overall feel. 1010 game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"cyberpunk is the modern skyrim, it offers nothing a title of its caliber shouldn't have as a modern release. you go around and kill hundreds of people for no reason except to level up and find stuff to sell for money and special weapons and equipment. if you like to murder hobo this is the game for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"one of the best story telling, action, romance games i ever played. big open world map with many missions to do even when you're done with the main story. lots of content. the map night city is probably one of my favorites of the game. you can just sit there an enjoy how beautiful the scenery is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"today is the best day to play cyberpunk! it is in a better shape then ever. play it for story and will get very good experience. night city is an ugly, vulgar, sadistic man eating monster. this game has superb side stories, which extend the main story and give it more impact. a solid play through takes 4060 hours without the addon. you should check mods for this game. you can add wild stuff to game  if you only want to mess around, then gta or just cause is a better pick."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,greatest game in the world. i would have never have known if it wasnt for edgerunners. when i first played the game i was a nomad who glitched into walls and couldnt move past anything. but after edgerunners released so did one of the best updates every that initially fixed it all. its like the cuffed of restraint finally got broken and you could breath the toxic fresh air of night city for the first time. have played thru this game multiple times . a few on my playstation and some on my rog ally with mods. i most likely will play again and again because this game just has that much content. 1010 worth every penny
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great graphics and a captivating storyline. plenty of side quests to keep you busy. finished the game in about 75 hours, well worth the purchase in my opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"love almost everything about this game, i really enjoy driving to the missions instead of fast traveling every chance i get,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"one of the most immersive, storyrich and best games out there, it is no wonder that this game sits at the top 5 games i've ever played. preem stuff choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great game, and the replay value is high. so many things to do and the fact that they're still pushing out updates for it makes it worth the money"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"the cyberpunk story is very engaging, and i would recommend playing it while also completing all the side quests, as they add more depth to the overall experience. gameplaywise, its great, but some builds are definitely better than others. that being said, i dont fully understand the lock system that only allows you to reset your build a couple of times. for me, it doesnt make much sense, as the more you play, the better you get at recognizing the build you want to stick with, or you might just want to try something different. driving in the game is a bit lackluster most cars handle poorly, with the exception of the more sporty ones, which drive much better. since i played way after launch, the only bugs i encountered were minor visual glitches or some npcs acting weird, but nothing that would break the game. the graphics are probably some of the best out there, and with new technologies like dlss and amd fsr, you can probably run the game on a midrange pc configuration. just keep in mind that ray tracing and path tracing are very demanding and are not essential for great visuals. youll still enjoy the game without them. all things considered, i would definitely recommend playing cyberpunk, especially if you really enjoy futuristic scifi themes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,great story line and amazing graphics.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,great game great story great character writing great graphics and great scenes
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"910 big improvements since the release game ,when i preorded the games and mods do wonders to this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"peak story. cyberpunk 2077 pulls you right into night city with its compelling stories, memorable characters, and the cinematic approach it uses for cutscenes. by the end, you'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of your character and those around you, all struggling to find their own version of a happy ending in a world stripped of hope. johnny silverhand a happy ending? for folks like us? wrong city, wrong people."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great game, love the graphics, mods are a great option!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"a few minor bugs, but a really good single player fighting  shooting game. reminds me of far cry in the open world sort of sense, but more borderlands with the guns  the rpg of skyrim  fallout. even before i downloading some qol mods mainly fixing car driving lol it was a blast. i may be glazing a bit, but i'm 1. glad i waited so long to try it and 2. glad it got the polish it deserved. i did kind a rush through one storyline and i was surprised by that, luckily it warns you, so i saved before i proceeded. theres a lot to do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,solid game 3
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,it is a very good story but the ending could have been better.....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"still the best world buildingatmosphere in 2025. i can't believe it's been so long. city of dreams, city of nightmares. this game was and is an epiphany that changed my life. what is legacy, and why do we mortal humans strive for it so, on this pale blue dot, adrift in the void? cyberpunk 2077 and phantom liberty answer all of those questions, imo, and more, with wonder, panache and writing that delivers like a freight train through the soul at times. 1010, just great, even after such a rocky launch at the height of the pandemic. see you on the flipside, chooms!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"amazing game, great story line. recommended 100"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,the best story i have ever played im about to start my 3rd run.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great game. story is pretty good. combat can get repetitive once you see enough of it, but mods keep making the game fresh. my only wish is that there was more to the world. seems it could be more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"i actually enjoyed myself with this game, the bugs and load times were annoying there and now, the gameplay is good but made better with some modding, i think the main draw in was the world and it's characters, this maybe the very 1st game at least for me where our own main created character is really interesting, many feelings and many moods, but what a ride to the end that was."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"very fun post all the bugs, some occasional crashes but honestly it runs extremely well. i have enjoyed the variety of game play styles you can do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i love this game so much. i played it years ago when it first came out and even though it was pretty much unfinished and buggy. i still enjoyed the story and the characters so much. of course now years later its so so much better. and experiencing this story and its depth all over again is just as good of an experience. the story chefs kiss the characters so good. highly recommend if you want a deep, somewhat emotional story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i can't really describe how much i adore this game... hundreds of hours in night city and all of that felt like barely any time at all. i don't think i'll ever forget this game, it's something beautiful, something that will never fade"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"this game sucked at the release, but it has gotten so much better"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,very very good game. rich beautiful world. 1010 companion anime.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"this is by far the most impactful, beautiful, and well made game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. the story made me weep, the game play had me still thinking about it months after finishing because of its excelling complexity and breadth. the underlying exploration of corporate hellscapes, unfettered capitalism, and the nature of the soul was not only deeply moving but a breath of fresh air in our massively propagandized world. every new discovery was a pleasure and i cannot thank the developers enough for delivering this labor of absolute love to the world, i can feel it every time i plat. every story in night city is a tragedy, but that is never really the end, and that has never been the point."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"on release the game was awful, a few years later and its easily one of my favourites. i try to make a new character 12 times a year. very fun and an amazing story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"i can't believe i put over 50 hours into this game and am now recommending it. this game was announced in 2013 and a gameplay demo was shown back in 2018 that had me so hyped. unfortunately, we all know how that story went and the cyberpunk we were left with is still surprising, really good. sure i can see a lot of depth and granularity missing compared to those earlier demonstrations. but i think cyberpunk 2077 is a great foundation to be built on for the sequel. hopefully just next time they can land the delivery without overpromising."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"played the full game, plus dlc, and almost all endings.  starting from the streets. if you heard things about this game having issues, know that in my experience, there are very few bugs and they were just funny, it is very polished, and very much feels like a finished game. this game is one of my favourites. it looks stunning, the combat i chose was a ninja, which was fast and fluid if not a bit op, focusing on speed, stealth and blade abilities. i could become invisible, slow down time, then jump and slash large groups of enemies rapidly before they knew what hit them. the story was decent, but with how many missions there are and how broken up it is, it is easy to forget what the last thing that happened was. it is possible to play through a path of missions without breaking them up, but it isn't natural because they often require a passage of time between them, which can only be skipped by going to an apartment to sleep that time away. i definately recommend this game to people, but know that this isn't a game with many choices like i thought it was going to be. saying no to a mission just means that mission will be sitting waiting for you to change your mind. almost all decisions of importance are at the end. it is a lot like most aaa games, but it has some brilliant characters and blade combat that made every moment worthwhile.  story spoiler  spoiler one story and set of characters did really stand out for me though  judy and evelyn. the writing and voice acting was sublime, i really cared about evelyn and was heartbroken by her story. but judy is so perfectly my type it threw me, i've never experienced a connection like that in a game, it was very interesting! i worked so hard to get an ending where she would be with me, and nearly thought i had made a mistake, then i saw her waiting and i was so happy! thank you for providing me with a nice sendoff. spoiler ps i very nearly missed my perfect ending because i didn't go to my apartment to sleep. so make sure to sleep!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"a game i was initially so hyped for, just for that excitement to be ruined on launch. 5 years later i'm back and it is everything i wanted and more. it really is the most immersive video game i have ever played. dlss4, rtx hdr, hardcoreqolno hud mods. it is next level. bravo cdpr and the modding community. bravo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"this game is amazing, so much fun to play with just the right amount of challenge. sure it still has a few bugs but in time those will be fixed too. 10 out of 10 definitely recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"one of my favorite games of all time. the immense vibes in this game are absolutely unmatched and is exactly what cyberpunkdystopian fanatics want. the soundtrack is one of the best ever created that enhances the immersive visuals and style that is present along the whole journey. every corner of the map is an artistic masterpiece that will leave you thinking about this game for the rest of your life. another big w about this game is the many different combat styles you can specialize in, making it possible to heavily customize your play style ranging from a gun specialist to an katana wielding killing machine to a netrunner that can hack its way through any situation. oh and...a huge w for including elements from the amazing cyberpunk edgerunners anime. i love to see the appreciation that the game shows by including the ost and various items from the show. everything about this world is top tier entertainment!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"despite the early bugs and set backs, this game rocks, and the endings are meaningful i suspect i will be playing mods on this game for sometime to come."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"tldr game is great with less bugs than a standard bethesda game, if that's all you wanna know then you can stop reading. now where do i even start? the main story is quite short, but it's written in a way where it nudges you toward questlines that are filled with characters and stories that have the ability to make you feel, feel disgust, feel sadness, feel remorse for the choices you make along the way, but more importantly, make you feel connected and attached to the world and the characters in it. night city is a world of it's own filled with struggling families, psychotic gangs and corporations that want to bleed you drier than the saharan desert, but there are also people who wan't the world to change, and they're willing to act for it too if they can just get a little push from a friendly merc along the way. after completing the game the first time i felt a bit melancholic but also hopeful for v's future, then i played through the other endings and felt sad, this was not because the endings were written badly but rather because in night city you're lucky to even live to see another day. and last but not least, my thoughts after playing through phantom liberty and all it's endings are best summarized by a saying from the far cry series sometimes its best to leave well enough alone. preem game chooms, had a blast and i'll miss night city. maybe i'll come back some day but for now it's time for goodbyes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"now that it has settled down, this is a pretty fun game. not terribly hard and the inventory management is a bit confusing. story seem great. i can sit down for an hour here and there which i like. i'll finish it eventually."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"great game, like a futuristic gta and a great story behind it, especially with the spinoff series, as well as all the iconic items."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,the game is huge and very well developed. there is so much details that are unique. this game is even better than gta.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"amazing graphics, amazing gameplay, very immersive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,very good game fixed lots of the bugs
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,it's a work of art after all the updates. if you want to have feelings in a video game this is the one.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"it is a beautiful game, the visuals are stunning. the story line options for the most part are great, your life path that you chose at the beginning really only affects the first 20 minutes of your game play. though can affect some dialogue options. if you are considering getting the game it is most certainly worth it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"one of if not the most immersive and engrossing rpg experiences i've had. world building, music, level design, and especially gameplay all have so much passion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"really beautiful game visually, thematically, narratively, and technically. it's extremely polished now, and feels amazing to play. the sheer scope of this game's world and the amount of usually dangerous nooks  crannies v can get lost in can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's absolutely worth it to take the time and really explore the map rather than just drive from place to place never really taking anything in. the combat system has surprising depth! i was particularly impressed by the stealth mechanics, but there are so many different approaches you can take. it's just so satisfying experiencing the progression of a build and feeling v becoming more and more of a terrifying presence with each gig. the story and characters though are where this game really shines. v's desperate struggle to survive in such a hostile, bleak world is a deeply profound and relatable one. the more you experience it, the more you will begin to understand why the people that v encounters, even the filthiest scumbags and bastards, operate in the way that they do. and yes, phantom liberty is an extraordinary expansion that really explores this dynamic and tests both you and v's limits in regards to it, making it a definitive part of the cyberpunk 2077 experience. night city is a monster that wants to eat both you and v alive, but you'll both find reasons to stick around no matter what. for me, it was the thrilling combat, the provocative storytelling, and the cast of characters of varying degrees of moral bankruptcy. one of my new favorite games of all time. now's as good a time as any to finally dive in, or back in if you tried to play at release and decided to let this one sit on the back burner until it was more stable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"a game redemption story, worthy of a recommendation. a no man sky like story for cdpr, enjoying the game so far. looking forward to finishing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"i didn't play this game on launch, so this is an unbiased review about how the game is now. insane amount of content in this game. this is a polished, highend rpg. it's not particularly choicedriven in the dialogue, but it's a joy to immerse yourself in. the cyberware is cool but i would have loved them to go further. the power fantasy feels stifled. i have fortified ankles and can do super jumps and tank rockets to the face, but i die if i fall more than about ten metres  that takes me out of the experience every time. moving into the next game i would love for them to go further in the power fantasy and cyberware aspect. let me leap higher, run faster, pick up and throw cars at the very high end of things  the kind of things you'd see in edgerunners, or prototype. the story is great and i think threads a pretty great line between the story it's trying to tell, and the choices the player is allowed to make. this is definitely more of a linear story that you can affect, but when you have characters like johnny silverhand so deeply involved in your own story, it's really carried. the npcs and their believable personalities really make the game. it's lucky that the missions are such high quality and that there are so many of them, because the sandbox part of the game is actually pretty barebones. i mean, the city is spectacular and hugely detailed, but streetlevel npcs aren't really driven by much. there aren't really any systems that allow for any kind of emergent gameplay. you have the gta stars system, you can fight maxtac, that's pretty cool. you can buy cars, steal cars ... that's about it. you can't rob stores, there aren't really any 'activities' out in the world that aren't tied directly to missions. crafting is there, and it does its job without becoming tedious, which i appreciate. i will say that of the missions, there is a nice mix between longer involved missions, and shorter tasks like eliminating cyberpsychos or responding to ncpd crimes. the generous amount of the latter really makes up for the lack of other open world content. the story missions are great but some of them take actual hours to complete, and it'd be great if there were more of a heads up about which missions those were. phantom liberty teases a new area, but doesn't tell you that the introductory mission is about 4 hours of linear content during which time you're locked in. would be great if i knew what i was getting into. cdpr clearly focused more on the bespoke content, and since there's so much of it, i can't fault them at all. next game i would love to see more systemsdriven and emergent stuff, and better cyberware ... but if the game is simply more of the same, i'll still be happy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,one of the best games i have ever played  with mods this game is so dominating.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,all time redemption story only maybe topped by no man's sky. one of my most played games in the last five years mostly on ps5 and the 2.0 update made it even better in every facet.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"if you like to feel immersed, you wanna feel like a bad ass and feel the dynamic story around you? in a world where your choices, engagement, and upbringing of your character plays a tangible roll on the games story telling? play this game i'm gonna keep it a stack its easily one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"i feel fat, fuck megacorps, rockerboys will never die. probably one of my favorite games of all time, great characters, amazing dlc, and a very good story. the amount of critical decision making in this game makes it feel genuine and does what a ton of roleplay games fail at im talking about you fallout 4. which is making the player actually like the characters, nothing in this game feels empty when it comes to the characters, i found myself really enjoying character dialog with nearly every character in the game, i felt like the choices i made actually mattered, like they had actual impact. and not only that, but the use of a protagonist that is essentially a blankslate allows for a plethora of headcannons and playstyles. overall cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, and what all roleplaying games should strive to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"just buy it. excellent characters, worldbuilding, story, gameplay, graphics... honestly nothing to hate other than the fact that it ends. great replayability too there's plenty of choices to make as you go through the story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"i cannot say this enough  this is the single best gaming experience i have ever had. without spoiling anything, let me just say this this game feels lonely. lonely in the sense that you are in a sea of people, and you do not matter. and you are saying this as one of the most powerful, influential mercs in night city. you can only imagine how the average person in nc feels. and it's entirely immersive  the city waits for nobody, especially not a corporate hellscape like night city. you either keep up, or you're swallowed up by the tide. throughout the game, you are consistently reminded of that by the worldbuilding. i don't have much else to say, this is just one of those games that you just have to experience yourself one review, or even a thousand reviews isn't going to cut it. the voice acting is among the best i've seen in any game so much so that a friend of mine thought that i was watching an anime. graphics are a nobrainer among the best as well, and after many years, finally optimized. can't wait for cyberpunk orion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"superb game. lots of the initial release date issues resolved. graphics  superb gameplay  superb story  superb lots of playability, and keanu is in it. what more do ya want?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,so much better now its been updated since release great game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"genuinely one of the best games i've ever played. and that's not a meme. the game is massive, and the world is huge in both complexity and world building, going through the backstory and the shards detailing the world post datakrash is amazing, and the complexity of the characters you meet and hear about in terms of legends amazes me the gameplay loop is incredibly enjoyable, with varied ways of handling a problem, personally this latest run i've been playing as a net runner, and i've had so much fun i haven't put the game down. it was buggy at launch, it still has its hiccups, but it's absolutely feature rich, bugs are relatively minor and i've not had anything game breaking at all. i cannot recommend this game enough, it is a journey, i have laughed, cried  sat in anger at this game and it's world. it's an emotional rollercoaster under the guise of an action rpg. a perverse mirror in which consumerism and technology reign supreme. a stark warning and gratuitous parody. i love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,this game is fun though if you have enough money instead buy gta and if you dont like gta and you like this more buy the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"epic gameplay, huge world. the bugs are still there but it's worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,looks stunning and feels awesome to play when your build starts to take off but god damn there are way too many interactable cutscene and dialogue sections frontloaded into the main story.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,cdpr put in a lot of effort to make this game what it is now. give it a play and you won't be disappointed.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"i waited a long time to play cyberpunk because i heard how bad the bugs and crashes were when it was first released, totally different game, superb storyline amazing graphics so fun to play"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"unfortunately as it usually happens open world games, main story is incredible forced farce trying to gaslight player instantly from moment when prologue ends and actual game opens up. it's best to take main story as lies told by unreliable narration by completely ignoring or go against what ever it pushes, when ever possible. meanwhile side quest and important characters met throughout playthru on journey are far more interesting as usual. making wonder was it really worth it ruin original story that was being made pre 2018 with massive change that got us mess that was released unfinished 2020 and then patched for years. too many cooks in the kitchen. on side note ironically this runs far better on linux mint than it did ever on windows 10 without crashing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"finally playing this game after all these years  2.0 was released a year ago and just now i'm 31 hours in my first real playthrough i love the game, the skill tree, the missions, the story. this game deserves a second chance even tho the launch was an absolute disaster. consider the dlc even tho i haven't played it yet but have heard it is an absolute banger edit just finished phantom liberty and it was really good  great story again, good endings, great visuals. my favorite game of all time with the witcher 3 wild hunt. give it a try it is 100 worth the money"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"game is buggy, at times aggravating, been known to rewrite rules and drove me insane at times and i'm still playing it writing quality all over the place, mod support shaky, updates are often disappointing by introducing new bugs rather then fixing old ones and i'm still playing it the game has the interest in story development to appeal to fans of fonv and capacity for action that will appeal to serious sam fans without forcing either down your throat, and that's why i'll probably keep playing this imperfect kluge of a game for quite a while yet. and recommend it to others"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,game graphics is very good and realistic
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"one of the best rpg gaming experiences i've had in a long time. glad i waited for the cooks to get done first. plus, the modding community is putting out some bangers. also helped me tone down the smut. recommended. the bosses can get spongey i'm doing first playthrough on hard difficulty with health bars hidden, but that's just a minor complaint."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"this game is a masterpiece. wow. i didn't play until 2025 because of the issues at launch, and the story is incredible. this is the most invested i've been in story choices since new vegas 15 years ago."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"the goat! the story is engaging  featuring great characters and choices. the gameplay is very good  allows you to shape your playstyle based on the implants and skills you choose. the graphics are stunning  night city is very detailed and immersive. the game can also be modded to add even more gameplay elements, improve textures, add cars, clothes etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"el juego aun puede mejorar, me gustaria mayores interacciones con los npc, pero la historia es una obra de arte, me perdi totalmente al jugarlo y eso que aun me falta el dlc y misiones secundarias."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"one of the best games i have ever played. amazing storyline that will have you at the edge of your seat throughout the game, and in tears at the end. 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,great story telling. lots of options. do the thing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"now that i finally have a system that can play this game i see what all the hype is about. i'm playing on a 4070 based laptop and the performance is far better than i was expecting, over 100 fps with most settings at high or better and ray tracing but not path tracing turned on. the game looks amazing, the characters are interesting and well written, the quests have surprisingly good variety and complexity, the mechanics and itemization give you endless possibilities for the type of build you want to play especiallly since you can respec perks for free. there are still a few obvious bugs that i'm surprised they haven't fixed yet like your hud disappearing for no reason sometimes save and reload fixes it, but overall it's very solid after all the patches they've released now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,top 3 rpg of all time. 1010. i don't give this rating lightly. you are missing out on a beautiful experience if you haven't played yet.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,this is one of the best open world and mmo rpg games i have played and the game play has so much to do and you legit cant do it in one playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"great story, incredible worldbuilding and immersion. tons of gameplay styles to choose from and story avenues to make each playthrough unique and fun. one of my personal favorite settings and games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"i remember booting this game up at launch, seeing how buggy and unoptimized it was, and promptly uninstalling before leaving it to collect dust in my library. now in 2025, i decided to revisit this game, and man was i so glad i did. the game runs smoothly and the experience is unlike anything else i've ever played. the level of detail and options you can choose from are incredible. the city feels so alive, and the combat is satisfying. in 2025, cyberpunk lives up to the hype it generated prelaunch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"oh que celuil va tre difficile. je suis trs partag entre mettre un non recommand trs svre  cause du fait que, mme plusieurs annes et de multiples patchs aprs la sortie, le jeu ne tient toujours pas ses promesses d'origine et mettre un recommand enthousiaste parce que je me suis quand mme bien clat pendant plus de 100 heures et que je compte bien y rejouer  un moment. j'imagine qu'il est plus honnte d'valuer le jeu qui existe pour ce qu'il est plutt que le jeu qui n'existe pas pour ce qu'il aurait pu tre. du coup... cyberpunk 2077 est un rpg trs orient action  la premire personne dans lequel vous incarnez v, le ou la, mais je vais tout faire au masculin  dfaut d'avoir du neutre mercenaire le plus malchanceux de night city, et pourtant y'en a de la concurrence. suite  une mission beaucoup trop ambitieuse pendant laquelle il n'a vraiment pas de bol, v va se retrouver avec dans la tte une copie 11 du rockerterroristeanarchisteegomaniac johnny silverhand, menant a une collaboration force des plus houleuses face aux megacorps d'un futur dystopique pas si lointain. gros kiff. je vais passer assez rapidement sur le gameplay parce que mme s'il est cool et dynamique, ce n'est  mon sens pas la force principale du jeu. cyberpunk 2077 tant un vrai rpg pur et dur, y'a des levels, des stats, des arbres de talents lis  ces stats et une progression verticale des plus vertigineuse qui va faire passer v de victime du quartier  machine de guerre immortelle capable d'annihiler des bataillons entiers de soldats d'lite en quelques secondes  peine. cette progression est renforce par la possibilit d'upgrade le personnage avec du cyberware offrant des avantages varis, du double saut  la capacit de ralentir le temps pendant quelques secondes en passant par les lames planques dans les avantsbras ou encore la possibilit de rsister  un coup fatal en regagnant de la vie  la place. les possibilits de builds sont nombreuses, les playstyles varis, et que vous soyez du genre  vouloir tout exploser au machinegun,  vous la jouer full weeb en courant partout avec un katana ou encore  embrasser le dlire netrunner  fond pour faire un perso totalement bas sur le hacking, vous trouverez votre compte et le jeu fait vraiment en sorte que tous les styles soient funs  jouer. l dessus, c'est vraiment russi. on dplorera possiblement que le jeu ne va pas assez loin dans certains dlires pourtant trs prsents dans le ttrpg et oui, cyberpunk est avant tout un jeu de rle papier comme les body mods compltement absurde ou encore la possibilit de devenir full borg. en mme temps, le jeu aurait pu aller plus loin est un peu la critique principale que j'aurais  lui faire, sur quasiment tous les aspects. ca suffit pour le gameplay, passons  ce qui selon moi est blab principale force du jeu, la raison pour laquelle j'y ai pass plus de 100 heures et que je vais y revenir, ce qui m'a fait acheter le jeu en premier lieu l'ambiance et la promesse d'criture. witcher 3 m'avait dj mis une grosse claque avec novigrad, que je considre encore aujourd'hui une des villes les plus russies dans un jeu vido. c'tait grand, a faisait vrai, mon immersion tait totale. night city, c'est a, en mieux si on exclu les npcs qui font des allersretours sur les passages pitons parce que leur routine dure 7 secondes. un aspect que je recherche particulirement dans les rpgs, c'est leur capacit  m'immerger dans un univers qui est radicalement diffrent du mien. c'est bien simple, aucun jeu n'a aussi bien russi que cyberpunk sur ce point l. que ce soient l'ambiance visuelle, l'identit forte des diffrents quartiers, les slangs omniprsents crs spcifiquement pour le jeu, les pubs beaucoup trop fortes partout dans les rues, les dingueries qui arrivent au pif et donnent lieu  des qutes secondaires impromptues, tout participe  une immersion permanente et donne au jeu une cohrence et une identit propre. on est propuls dans cet univers si proche et pourtant si loign du ntre, tout parat si familier mais est pourtant si diffrent. je ne pourrais jamais insister assez sur la prouesse accomplie en terme de worldbuilding. jamais je n'avais aussi rapidement accept un univers. d'habitude je me dis oh c'est marrantsympacurieux comme manire de faire en voyant une utilisation inhabituelle de magie ou une technologie fictive, je remarque la manire dont les crateurs ont intgr au quotidien les lments uniques de leur monde. ici je n'ai pas remarqu, j'ai adopt. les technologies fictives m'ont sembl naturelles, et ce n'est qu'aprs coup, aprs avoir arrt de jouer, que j'y ai pens plus activement. l ou le jeu aurait pu aller plus lointm, c'est sur le plan moral. j'aurais aim tre plus dpays et tre mis en face d'un spectre moral beaucoup plus gris o toutes les nuances finissent par se mlanger. night city est cens tre cet enfer dystopique dans lequel personne ne peut rester blanc. tout le monde devrait avoir des squelettes dans le placard, et j'ai trop eu l'impression de croiser des npcs sur la morale desquels moi, depuis le confort de ma chaise et mon emploi stable, pouvais m'aligner. pour suivre dans cette ligne de pense, j'ai globalement trouv le jeu trop propre. alors oui y'a un peu de gore, y'a un peu de nsfw, mais a reste vachement en surface. encore une fois, night city est cens pousser le dlire de la dbauche et de la corruption  fond, et tout est bien trop sage. j'aurais aim, quitte  ce que ce soit une option qu'on puisse activerdsactiver selon les sensibilits, que l'aspect capitalisme dbrid sans retenu qui en fait toujours trop soit plus prsent. en 2020 et quelque on peut pas me vendre un yaourt ou un parfum sans que la moiti des gens prsents dans la pub soient  poil, alors pourquoi le futur sombre o amazon et nestl dirigent le monde fait preuve de plus de retenue? un jeu appel cyberpunk devrait plus me bousculer et plus oser. vous vous souvenez de la scne du petit batard dans witcher 3? je m'attendais  ressentir ce niveau d'inconfort beaucoup plus frquemment dans cyberpunk 2077. surtout avec le tuto qui, pour le coup, fait vraiment le taf et fait une promesse en terme d'ambiance et d'atmosphre qui n'est malheureusement pas assez tenue. globalement, mon ressenti de cyberpunk 2077 est que c'est un bon jeu, qui aurait pu tre tellement mieux. ce qui est dans le jeu est bon, l'criture est bonne, les dialogues sont bons, les personnages sont bons, le gameplay est bon, mais ce qui n'est pas dans le jeu me manque tellement que j'ai du mal  pleinement apprcier ce qui y est. les gens ne voient pas les dtails, ils remarquent l'absence de dtail shun geek est une phrase qui m'est reste en tte depuis que je l'ai entendue. a ce niveau d'ambition et de production, ce sont vraiment les dtails qui font la diffrence entre un bon jeu et un excellent jeu. et ce sont les dtails qui manquent  cyberpunk. ce sont les choses inutiles et donc indispensables. les choses dont les jeux comme red dead redemption 2 sont absolument truffs et qui tmoignent d'un soin apport que je ne retrouve tout simplement pas ici."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"es verdad cyberpunk 2077 no es el juego que nos prometieron, cuando se anunci pens que sera un revolucionario juego, en todos los aspectos, algo nunca antes visto , un antes y un despues , pero la realidad , es que un juego con unas mecnicas ya vistas, y que juegos como gta 5 que se lanz mucho antes que cyberpunk, contiene ms detalles en su mundo abierto , que en el mundo abierto de cyberpunk 2077, pero entonces qu es lo que hace tan especial cyberpunk para haberse convertido en un juego tan aclamado? , la respuesta es, por su historia , los cd projekt saben contar historias , saben de personajes, las misiones son tan interesantes , que no sabes si es una principal o secundaria, te invitan a realizarla todas, no te obligan, y te hacen vivir una interesante y genial historia , en una ciudad que grficamente se ve genial, por eso recomiendo este juego , por su historia , su game play esta muy bien, pero su fuerte es su historia , recomendado 8.5 10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"played during launch on a xbox series x, and enjoyed even with the bugs, but the current level of polish of this game is insane!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"got this game since its launch, so glad to see the game is in a fun and playable state. gunplay feels smooth, melee fun, driving is good too tho i probably shouldn't have a license. the story i got lost in it for hours and it makes me want to replay it over and over. highly recommend cyberpunk, game is hella nova."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"this game had a rough start, but its development was way harder than anyone could have imagined. after all this time, i finally got to experience it, and i completely connected with it. one thing that really stood out to me was how your decisions and chosen abilities affect how people react to you and how the world changes around you. this level of immersion makes night city feel truly alive and dynamic. with the latest updates and phantom liberty, the game has not only redeemed itself but has become one of the best rpg experiences out there. enemy ai has improved, combat feels better, and choices have even more impact on the story.  stunning graphics and rtx lighting make the cyberpunk world feel real.  deep and memorable characters and storytelling especially johnny silverhand, played by keanu reeves!.  the music and atmosphere are incredibly immersive, especially when driving through night city. bottom line dont miss this! if you havent played it yet, now is the best time!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"h3 iconic game h3 the game is an example of how modern games should be great story, gameplay, and visuals. it took me a few hours to get comfortable, but it was all worth it. i enjoyed every minute played. even side quests are wellthoughtthrough, hence deep and interesting. leave alone the main story and the dlc, which are simply spectacular. technically, the game is ready it looks great, no bugs. if you haven't played this masterpiece of the gaming industry, you definitely should. recommended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"this game is an experience !!! had a rocky start at first but couple of patches in and the game becomes a whole other beast. the breathtaking but a shit hole of a city awaits with a amazing story that would leave you dead inside. trust me when i say, once you immerse yourself into it, night city with all of it's beauty and flaws would feel like you are right at home. highly recommend you pick this up along with one of the best expansions you could ever play. so grab your iron and take the fight to corpos choom !!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"after a few years, this is really good game now. story has no 'woke' bs and does not pull any punches, action packed and visually stunning if you have the hardware to run it that is,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"okay, yes, it lives up to the hype. what an amazing and immersive game! i actually hated it the first night of playing i'm not a fan of fpfps, but once i got used to the controls, mechanics, and specifics of the game, i fell deeply in love. the story is amazing, do not give up before you get through act 1, i hear way too many people doing that! about 10 hours in i knew this was going to be in my top 3 games of all time. beautiful masterpiece...so much fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"uh this is pretty good. graphics are pretty. the city is immersive. it has enough variety to bite into and feel like you got your money's worth. honestly it doesn't get much better for gaming in 2025, with how terrible 98 of games are these days."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"this game is the most redeemed game since launch. at first a huge fuck up, and now it's fixed and even better than ever after phantom liberty. fun story and characters and mostly very good gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"1010 story, gameplay and graphics"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,i have been really fond of the game overall. it's very fun and compelling. it has a great story and a variety of playstyles to specialise into and a fairly detailed open world to explore.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"absolutely amazing sandboxworld. i have installed every mod i can to make combat interesting in this game. i have not found a way to make combat enjoyingchallenging. i dont find video games to have interesting story, maybe the best i can think of is a souls game, but that is because they are vague and force you to imagine your own story. the worldgraphics carried this game for me for 30 hrs. if you like witcher3rdr2 i assume you would like this game. for me i'm putting it down before coming to the conclusion because the story doesn't interest me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"good things to those who wait. the release was shameful but i just played for the first time as week ago and yea, def recomend. its not thee craziest, best, mot perfect game ever. but its very good and the first game i've really felt immersed in, which isn't something i usually play for but really enjoyed here. i constantly find myself just driving around in first person going with traffic just thinking as if this is real life. i will say though i don't think they should have moved on to a sequel i think they could have added more and smoothed out this game. but i guess take what you learned and move forward?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"first played the game on release. played again after patch 2.2 with the dlc, and honestly very surprised by the improvements and bug fixes. it feels much more refined now, with all the gameplay mechanics working, and only few crashes during the final phantom liberty mission. overall, very satisfied and will definitely recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"the game has made a complete 180 degree change from its original launch. granted, i first tried to play on a ps4 and now have a modern gaming computer but the game runs so much better. the experience is way more immersive. if you haven't played since launch you have to give it another try."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,amazing gameplay and graphics
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,cyberpeak 2077 dialogue peak phantom liberty peak main story kinda mid. graphics pretty good! overall quiet life or blaze of glory?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"as an older man now, sticking to a game after playing a couple of hours and wanting to come back to it is rare. not the case with this game. it's soooo good and after i'm done playing it, it's stays on my mind. cyberpunk is a mature game and also a very fun game. the story so far is great and i can't wait to keep playing it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"cyberpunk has definitely climbed its way up to being one of my alltime favorite games! i really enjoy how ttrpgs are coming to life in video games these days, and the graphics in this one really enhance the whole experience. plus, im a huge fan of openworld games! if you love a captivating story full of twists and turns, along with plenty of action and adventure, id highly recommend giving it a try!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"way better after all the updates. missed a some of the old perks, but with enough levels and cyberware, you feel like a badass"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"cyberpunk had a terrible launch, full of problems and bugs, disappointing fans of cd projekt red. however, playing it a year after release showed significant improvement, though it was still just average. the game truly transformed with the 2.0 patch and dlc, earning the redemption it deserved. playing it again after these updates revealed cyberpunk as the incredible game it should have been from the start, with the dlc's story standing out as exceptional. i will likely play it again, as it's an experience worth revisiting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"only game to ever make me absolutely sob at the ending, beautiful game and story and characters and the gameplay is so good too. cannot recommend hard enough"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,from what i hear the game was in a pretty ruff state on launch. but i can say that the game runs pretty well now in my opinion. there are a few minor bugs but nothing to stop you from enjoying the game and it's story. would recommend anyone looking for something sink their time into check this game out.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"i can proudly say that this game has come a long way. still might have a few bugs here and there but i still just find them entertaining. played through the game on pc and on ps5 multiple times and i get to enjoy the experience every time. if you haven't tried this game yet i highly recommend it. also, in my opinion the phantom liberty is even better than the base game story! yes i have this game modded up on pc lol but i'm still enjoying it years later after it launched. only regret is that i didnt review it sooner!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"great story. not your traditional fps but it has it's merits. i like it because i like the genre. much lore is not like the rpg but it is some what believable. one thing, saburo arasaka would be very old in 2077. in 2020 he was over 100 yrs old, so you do the math. good story line for johnny silverhand keanu reeves. again, he died in the nuke blast at arasaka tower but it was good the story turned him into a construct in v. all in all i like it just disagree with the lore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"really good story, world, and characters. a little to easy, starts to feel like a bullet sponge game near the end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,god i love this game. has to be one of the most best games out there. really made me cry a bit at some parts. just play the game for yourself and see.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"only game i've played where every ending feels like losing a friend. 'there are no happy endings in night city, not for people like us.' also looks amazing and sidequests never feel too repetitive and certainly never grindy. great game, will play again and again"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,one of best futuristic game ever i see and excellent story. i deffo come back to this game in few months or years.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i played 277 hours. the dlc, main story, combat, immersion and modding completes this game. cyberpunk to me is like jon jones to dana white. like romeo and juliet. like panam and male v. like judy and female v. this game completes me as i complete it. that sounded gay as fuck not gonna lie"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"very good story, but way too short, i recomend to new players to focus all side content before main story if u want some real fun... game contain few glitches here and there but its acceptable... final grade 7.510 imo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"cyberpunk 2077  a mustplay masterpiece cyberpunk 2077 is an unforgettable experience that delivers on its promise of a stunning open world, deep storytelling, and engaging gameplay. night city feels alive, filled with detail, personality, and endless possibilities. vs journey, intertwined with johnny silverhand keanu reeves, offers a gripping narrative with meaningful choices and some of the best side quests in gaming. the gameplay is dynamic, offering multiple playstyleswhether through combat, stealth, or hackingwhile customization and cyberware upgrades enhance immersion. despite a rocky launch, cd projekt reds updates and phantom liberty expansion have transformed the game into a polished, mustplay rpg. final verdict 9.510  an incredible scifi adventure worth experiencing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,after many patch and updates this game become once of the great game and also having excellent ps5 controller support .highly recommended.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"character movement, sound design, and camera effects are excellent. the ambiance is enough body horror and technobabble to keep me coming back every few weeks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,every fifth word out of my own and every npc's mouth is some nonsense night city slang and i have no idea what's going on
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,my favorite thing is running into a bug and wondering if it's a part of the game because it matches the scene.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,despite the rough start of the cyberpunk launch they've completely changed the game into a once in a lifetime experience i highly recommend this game to anybody.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"with the help of mods, this game is finally at a point where i don't feel extraordinarily disappointed let down. back in 2020 i ended my play through with out finishing as i was so underwhelmed and over promised. with mods enabled this game is finally becoming the scifi blade runner style open world game i wanted."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"cyberpunk 2077 is a game that does exactly what i expect from bethesda games, except now, it doesn't have any of the jank. the combat is a breath of fresh air, it's fun to go into a enemy encounter and test out a variety of playstyles, you could hack and electricute enemies, you could have a mantis blade arm build to rip and tear them, you could pretend like it is doom eternal and go and fight guns a blazing, the sound effects are pretty killer i can't even lie, and the graphics are probably the best graphics i've seen in a videogame, and it's still relatively optimized, when i played this game with my rx 5700xt, i averaged around 60 fps at medium with some high settings, but with my 3080, i easily get around 110, keep in mind, the resolution is 1080p. dlss and fsr are here, but they aren't required to run this game at an acceptable frame rate cough cough monster hunter wilds cough cough. the story is also really good, and has that signature intriguing cdpr flavour that will keep you on the edge of your seat, until the credits end, and the world building is stellar enough to keep you playing the game for extended periods of time, overall, it's a great experience, but i would recommend waiting for discounts as this game is nearly 5 years old."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"amazing story, fun side quest, and if you are coming to play this game after watching the cyberpunk edgerunners anime i recommend doing the over the hedge quest to get david martinez's jacket."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"the game offers a wide variety of playstyles, allowing you to progress however you see fit. whether as a stealthy assassin, a ruthless berserker, a master hacker, or something in between. the story is captivating and immersive, keeping you hooked from start to finish. the dlc follow the same pattern neither too long nor too short, delivering a satisfying experience. in short, if you love the cyberpunk universe and want to develop your character while leaping from rooftop to rooftop in a thrilling narrative, this game is perfect for you. but lets be real the sexual content is quite limited it could have been more extensive. also, female character models are a bit flat, but hey, mods let you upgrade with some silicone implant if thats your thing.  oh, and the soundtrack? absolutely phenomenal."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"long time faithful. yes, it was extremely buggy on launch, but it's worlds above what it used to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"when this game first came out, i was incredibly disappointed. i wanted to love it so badly because of the incredible story and atmosphere that i still forced myself to get every achievement in the game despite it constantly crash and bugging out. and now, after over 300 hours, i played the entire game from start to finish all over again and it was a completely different experience. the bugs are gone, the game never crashes, and it runs as smooth as silk. i honestly think that it is the greatest fps rpg on the market right now. if you've ever wanted to give cyberpunk a try, now is the best time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"despite the orginal public ragewhich turned me away at first this game has been polished really nicely since. i will admit i was a bit cautious walking in at first but the game, graphics, and audio really suprised me. i will not lie when i say that this game has actually been remade anew. worth every cent."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"2077 is playable and fun at base, but mods make it genuinely great. and there are mod managers. so it's easy. my recommendation are rebalances. 2077s content is both plentiful and great, so you don't need mods for those, although they tend to be excellent. 810 without mods, with em 1010. but, well, i made some of those, so bias d he' mod support is great. thanks cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,amazing game after they pretty much reworked the entire thing this game went from shit to perfect. the game in vanilla is perfect and with mods it can be enhanced to be even better.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"great game, enjoyed it before the 2.0 update, and after finally getting to it since the big update, this game is even better. 100 worth a buy!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"played this on ps4 on release and it definitely had its issues. replayed on ps5, and it was better. now played it all through twice on pc. it was always worth it to me, even with the issues, but with the current updates and the insane pc graphics i cannot recommend the game enough. the storytelling is stier, gameplay is great, world is immersive. i'll definitely be playing it through again at some point."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"the game is just great! i have encountered a couple of bugs, but nothing game braking mostly just funny. i would also recommend watching the tv series edgerunners, for introduction to night city or just to get more context."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,great game play! exceptional replay ability.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"hands down one of the best rpgs i've ever played, now that i've finished it i wanna play again, the story is rich and captivating, the characters are all wellwritten, each and every one is distinct, my man viktor vektor payed him back my debt as soon as i had all the eddies, johnny silverhand turned out to be a great fella in spite of the rough beginning. gameplay wise i think it's hella fun thanks to all the modifications you can do to your body, and thanks to mods you can add even more variety. talking about gameplay the stealth mechanic is broken you can crouch in front of the enemy and it will last a good 8 sec before you get noticed, even so i still preferred to kill them. sometime the ai might be dumb or act subpar to what you might expect but it did not bother me. everything ran well, crashed once but it's fine, played the whole thing with rt maxed and it looked incredible. all in all it's a solid 1010 in my books."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,played this at release and it was horrible but damn it came such a long way. really intriguing story as well.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"one of the best games i have ever played. choices you make are important. they changes the story and the outcome. the world is vibrant, rich and interesting to explore. some small side quest can reveal a deep touching story or let you find an extraordinary stuff weapon, improvements, etc. all of this creates quite an immersive experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,was reluctant to play it at first but once the balls rolling its hard to put it down. 1010 would def recommend its one of the best story's i have played in a long time and had me hooked and holding my breath till the end..
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,wow this game was amazing from both a visual aspect to the story. the best rpg i've played and i've been playing for a long time. also in my entire play through the game only crashed one time and the performance was flawless on pc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,honestly i enjoy the sidegigs more then i do the actual main story
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,the game is still amazing. i never even experienced the game breaking issues people were complaining about but especially after all the updates and fixes the game is worth getting. better make sure your pc is good enough to run it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"it has some bugs and flaws, but it's still a great openworld rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"amazing story, amazing gameplay, funny ah bugs sometimes. i like this game a lot, always have!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,probably one of the best games i have ever player incredible story incredible graphics simply amazing how every bigger side quest can result in different ending. game has super immersive story that has you clinging till the end fact that you can to a degree choose how you end is amazing. now comes bad parts game is as you would expect super high pc demands but if you can cover them it is amazing not as bad as start but with that great story it is worth it . i have played this game from day 1 and still come back to it from time to time to check it and always have good time. one of those games that are worth every minute spent in it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"if you've been avoiding this for it's legendarily poor launch, you should give it a chance. patch 2.0 made the game playable and genuinely a gem. the world is incredibly immersive! phantom liberty dlc is also fantastic and could have been a game on it's own! good luck, have fun choom"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"the early stages of the game did not give me hope, but i decided to try even before the major recent updates! it was the best choice of my life when it comes to gaming, the pre 2.0 version was already a wonderful experience and the 2.0 version made the game feel like a complete and well rounded game. absolute beauty of a game and an absolutely beautiful experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"has a few flaws but its a really good game, would recommend! phantom liberty is a great dlc as well must play adds a whole new area to the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"a true work of art. the graphics are insane, and can be made even better with an almost unlimited amount of mods."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,variety and customization. interesting characters. in general just a good game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"the game is super immersive, the mechanics are well done and add a lot of fun to just driving around, exploring the open world. cyberpunk deserves all the praise, easily one of the best games out there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"wow this has come a long way from when it launched, recently played through it and completed all the side jobs, gigs, and ncpd scanner events, what a cool experience  i need to pick up phantom liberty at some point to experience that campaign too, but the main game is kind of incredible, everything feels very well crafted and i thoroughly enjoyed my time in night city"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"this game is amazing. i am writing this directly after finishing the main story and just... god. this game is worth every single penny. this game made me laugh, cry, get angry, feel attached to characters like i've known them for years, and so much more. they've really worked past most if not all of the major bugs at this point, and at no point during my play through did i experience any gamebreaking bugs besides one instance where pathfinding a.i. kind of fucked up. anyways, i highly, and i mean highly, recommend this game to anyone on the fence about it, so please, do yourself a favor, and have a preem ride in night city, choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"years after its release and with continued support from cd projekt red, cyberpunk 2077 remains a combination of impressive and deeply disappointing. we were promised something more, and we had reason to believe cdp could deliver it. indepth hacking, the freedom to play as any type of character, the ability to mold your own career as a runner to suit your play style and story taste. the truth is that even with 100 mods made by a dedicated community, it still doesn't live up to what cdp made us expect. it's still a great game. it has an engaging story, first of all. and some parts of the story can have radically different outcomes based on how you choose to deal with dialogue and how you complete the jobs. but the promise of emergent storytelling in the open world is not lived up to. sure, there are a lot of cool details to be found around the world, conversations you can eavesdrop on, etc. but there is a huge missed opportunity of giving more personality to the gangs, involving yourself in their politics, having factions fighting each other in other than scripted events, having reputation systems with various factions and fixers, and so on. instead you get street cred, a single stat that unlocks basically everything, and that you can max really quickly because everything you do awards it and you can't lose it. my recommendation for playing this game unmodded is to focus on the main story. even the very hard difficulty will quickly become ridiculously easy possibly with the exception of a few annoying scripted sequences if you pick good perks and cyberware, so don't expect a tactical challenge. the other option is to start modding, and if you've been there before, you know what kind of headaches you're going to have if you want to get it right. you can fix the main glaring flaws fairly quickly using nexusmods and their mod organiser vortex, but if you want to start combining mods more carefully, the safest way is still manually installing them, which is a pain. particularly because steam's ridiculous policy to force you to update your games well, the games they are kind enough to let you borrow, meaning you can't roll back to a functioning game version. and this is why i am going to move to gog for any games they have in the future. i enjoy the hell out of the story, and with the right mods cyberpunk can become a shadow of what we dared to hope for when we listened to cdpr promote it all those years ago. thumbs up, but if there's ever a sequel, i hope they have learned a lot and either don't oversell it, or actually spend all the time and resources required to make the game of our dreams. also, please aquire the shadowrun license! d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,its a great game that looks visually amazing like genuinely top tier visuals and the gun play feels top notch and if you are able to get the dlc i would highly reccomend it cause so far it is absolutely amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"incredible game, in my top 3, and it's definitely not 3, its just a shame that the main story is so short. great environment, great story, 1010. more than worth the buy, especially if it is on sale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"i was lucky enough to not have been interested in this game at release, so while i was aware of the state of the game at that time, i wasn't a victim to it. this is one of the best games of ever made. every character is threedimensional and the decision to showcase sliceoflife type of missions with them was a great choice. by the end of it, you voluntarily chase side quests just to see storylines come to a close. i haven't played phantom liberty yet but i'll be damned if i don't. play this game. it's worth 60 and then some."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"great game, great graphics, great gun play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"a masterpiece that keeps getting better! cyberpunk 2077 is hands down my favorite game of all time. the world of night city is amazing, with wonderful depth, excellent stories, and an ambiance that makes it feel alive. the rpg elements are rich, with various playstyles, impactful choices, and some of the bestwritten quests in gaming. the charactersjohnny silverhand, panam, and judy especiallyare iconic, and the story had me hooked from beginning to end. the game has only gotten better since its release, with updates and expansions like phantom liberty enriching it, improving ai, and polishing mechanics. whether you enjoy fastpaced combat, hacking, or just walking around the lively streets, there is never a shortage of things to do. if you're a fan of openworld rpgs, you need to play cyberpunk 2077. it's not just a game, it's an experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"a rocky cycle for cyberpunk 2077 but it managed to crawl out the hole it dug itself at launch with meaning updates and cross media material like the edgerunners anime. while its rpg mechanics arent necessarily the deepest, it excels when it comes to world immersion, story, gameplay etc. ive sunk a stupid amount of time into this game beat it 4 times across platforms and if a game can manage to get you to keep coming back the its a success that very few games ever achieve. cant wait for the next game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"next gen graphics, next gen engine, next gen development. heart felt story, with alot of great gameplay and mechanics. started off rough and everyone was quick to shit on it. now that it was polished everyone hopped on its dick. love this game and highly recommend it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"absolutely love this game. the graphics, the story. can drive around for hours just in the open world. best game i've played in a long time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"it had a rough start but you know the quality is there unlike today's modern gaming, they just had small and short hiccup due to mismanagement and etc. its like rdr2, it will grow on you after play it for awhile, and unlike rdr2, you will keep coming back to play this game, from the first basic start, to 3rd game start and so on with mods, then you learnt that nsfw mods exist and you just gotta play it all over again and experience the game with bigger quality. so far there's no other game like cyberpunk before, now and future, yet. so its basically makes you comes back to reexperience the moments with jackie, the night city escapade, and all the things that could had been, in a far dystopian, cyberpunkish futuristic saga game. you can get out of night city but you can never get the night city out of you, and thats the wise words for street rats up to the corpos. happy dystopian chooms!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"obviously we all know that cyberpunk 2077 started off at rocky start. over time, cd projekt red put forth great effort and released a ton of updatesbug fixes that drastically improved performance and created a masterpiece. if this game had been released in the state it's currently in, i have no doubt it would go in the imaginary video game hall of fame. i played this game on and off for years, but never completed a full playthrough. i figured it deserved a solid chance, so i put in the effort to achieve 100 completion for cyberspunk 2077 and i wasn't disappointed at all. the stories are action packed and emotional, i caught myself tearing up a few times, and caught completely off guard at other times. the combat was so fun and exhilarating, the build variety is immense and customization. if you had hesitations about this game when it first came out, i'd give it another chance because the current state of this game is quite amazing 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,not much else to say that hasn't already been said. the game is a lot of fun and modding is so easy now that you can significantly change the gameplay. a few mods loaded and all the enemies are upgraded from ai to their abilities and your 12 tapping instead of the standard rpg style shooter. the game is great on its own and even better with the modders around
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,the characters had me hooked! their love and agony. hopes and fears. absolutely has me hooked.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"this game is now what it was always meant to be. strongly recommend it and its dlc, which is even better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"probably the most immersive game i've ever experienced. the detail is incredible. i especially enjoy how the soundtrack variety is curated and varied, making the songs feel like real songs you would hear in a futuristic setting. the game play is fun and you don't need to be a master at fps to play, and the wide selection of difficulty settings makes it quite approachable for many audiences. i enjoyed the story, but wish it was longer. it felt too brief."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"after playing this game for over 100 hours, the mechanical components of my laptop with 8gb of ram have molten and turned into a homogeneous paste. the heat from the device itself has left a burn on my table. i despite the lag on lowest graphics, i continue to play and im close to finishing the main story. i definitely recommend this game for anyone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"as a huge fan of the bladerunner universe, this game was heaven. to truly experience the art cd projekt red has but into night city, you would need a beefy graphics card. but with path tracing turned on the and settings cranked to max, driving through a rainy night in the night city listening to the radio is an experience unlike anything else in gaming. i played the game when it first came out it was buggy, but not unplayable if you had a decently speced out pc. playing it again in 2025 with the phantom liberty dlc is a whole new experience. the devs have definitely spent a lot of time and energy achieving what they set out for with this game. the combat is immersive, the story gripping and suspenseful, the world building is on a whole another level, and don't get me started on the music. this game is almost perfect, i'm going to be sad when i finish all the side missions knowing there's no more future content coming out for it. almost 2 playthroughs and 200 hours later, i can confidently say this game is a worth it at any price. it is one of the best video games every made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"i got into this game after edgerunners came out. i didn't know what to expect since i'm not a fps type of player and iv never played a game like this one before. a big fan of the cyberpunk genre for years and blade runner is my favorite movie and man, this game hits all the highs to make this story line as unforgetable as that one. highly recommend it to anyone who loves the cyberpunk genre."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"a master piece, unstable at times and requires some nice hardware to play, but it's worth it. a amazing dystopian setting, good comedy, good casting, good visuals, good story with many endings, etc etc. if you have some money to spare, pick up cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,it may have had a rocky start but it is now simply one of the best games of all time and easily in my personal top 3. its looks amazing and has a story that will surprise you with how much it makes you feel. it has immaculate vibes and great game play. it has me super excited for the wicher 4.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"its fun. i liked playing it. the characters are well written and the environment is well designed. its very good at making you feel cool and badass. gunplay feels really good, same with melee combat, not really driving, i think driving feels really bad. the actual story is mediocre and its creativity is kind of bad. there are a lot of cool concepts the game talks about but then kind of drops past the main story braindances., cyberware is kind of boring and so are the people who wear them, kind of like the cyberware in the ttrpg. cyberware is really interesting for me because it allows people to look less human either for aesthetic or utilitarian purposes and it creates conversations about it, a lot of the people you see who have cyberware just look like normal people with metal, even some of maelstroms members are just normal guys with metal limbs and their whole thing is being modified beyond humanity. the game doesnt really offer you any philosophical concepts to think about outside of stuff like is killing people yn or burn bright or stay dim which it drops after the first act. idk i think red dropped the ball on a lot of the nongame aspects of this, its more punk rebelling for the sake of rebelling than cyber and the ttrpg shipped alongside this is kind of bad too. its a good game though. i'm sure project orion will be better. its worth your money, i just dont think its the definitive cyberpunk experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,cyberpunk has come a long way since launch. i pre ordered it and then cancelled when i saw all of the bugs and instability that it had in 2020. coming back to it and getting all the achievements i had a great time playing through the main story and phantom liberty. i became attached to some of the characters and found the whole experience to be quite immersive at times. the unique combat abilities and vast amounts of weaponry really make killing enemies fun and engaging! you have many different builds to choose from to fit your playstyle. i will not spoil anything but i will say that you are in for many surprises at the end game. on the flipside i did encounter some bugs that softlocked me at times and found myself at 6070 frames in crowded areas on medium settings with a 3090 card. all in all i definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a decent story and a ton of gameplay. you have tons to do when you beat the game as well. you definitely get your moneys worth! cheers to project red for listening to the community and for putting in the effort to make the game enjoyable and playable. overall i rate cyberpunk at 45! graphics 1 2 3 4 excellent just power hungry 5 story 1 2 3 4tugged at my heartstrings at times! 5 gameplaymechanics 1 2 3 4combat was smooth and excitingnothings felt clunky. slightly awkward at times though 5 i hope this review helps persuade you to play this great game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"loved this game. the cyberpunk aesthetic is spot ongrim, dirty, and drenched in neon. the story doesnt hold back, and thats what makes it so good. it feels real and doesn't fuck around which makes it full of moments that stick with you. and the dlc? absolutely fucking incredible."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"one of the best games ive ever played, fantastic shooter rpg worth every moment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,i especially enjoyed the option to complete most content nonviolently!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"great writing, music, voice acting, combat feels great and offers a lot of variety."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"this game is basically perfect, the storyline is great the characters great, i am so incredibly sad it had a bad launch and it made me not wanting to buy the game but after seeing the more recent reviews on the game being positive, i finally bought it, well worth the money."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"don't let the low play time fool you. i have somewhere around 100 hours logged into this game on my ps5, both the base game and the phantom liberty expansion. was the game a mess at launch? yes. is the game absolutely phenomenal now? yes. run, don't walk to night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"with the dlc and the most recent updates for the game, i feel that it is fully complete and mostly bugfree. as a person who paid full price for the game, i feel that i have received more enjoyment from this cdpr game than i did from most of the other games they produced. it's a blast to play through multiple times and on every difficulty."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"good game, comeback story of the century"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,amazing game. amazing story. amazing game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"unrecognisable as the game that released in 2020, the base game is amazing and i would be happy recommending it to anyone. the dlc however is in a league of its own and is one of the best things ive ever played"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"awesome game, at the start i was approaching it with lots of doubts but the more i played the more i sank more hours into the game. 1010 would recommend to play at least once but the game has a lot of replayabilty value"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"outstanding, simply outstanding. i rarely play rpg's and gave this a dabble once v1.6 was released i.e. when it became stable. then it was excellent, since then it's become outstanding, to me at least. 793hrs play time, on my 4 full playthroughs, tried every starting path. now on my 5th playthrough with a 'new game' hacked save which lets me restart but with my v from the last playthrough, on very hard, and boyoboy, new game entirely. getting oneshotted, a lot, with a nearly max'd v on 'the rescue' was quite entertaining!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"man, i played on a pretty bad pc when it first came out. it forced me to use the lowest of low settings. i understand there were alot of issues for people but i didn't run into many because i made the game the equivalent of a potato. this made me not want to play past the 10 hour point even though i enjoyed myself. many years and updates later i got to experience the game well past when i stopped on my garbage pc. this game is a must play for people into rpgs wanting to scratch that rpg itch most games nowadays dont give us."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"still some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking, very enjoyable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"very immersive game play. and like other games i've enjoyed, cyberpunk made me care about the characters in the game. that's something that even the best graphics and gimmicks can't do. for me anyway."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,cyberpunk 2077 has pulled a no man's sky and since release has improved and added to the game significantly. today it's a great immersive rpg with some of the best graphics in gaming currently. highly recommend if you're at all interested in the cyberpunk genre.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"an incredible experience. the game feels alive, well writen characters, good pace and progression, extremely fun gameplay and combat. there are only a few downsides to the game, like noncompetent skill progression, as some of the skills feels not to be as good as they should be, making you store skill points up to the point you reach higher levels. even so, this work of art will be a mark in video game history, with a fantastic plot and a story capable of making you cry."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"the game with the worst launch but best final product. this is a game using the gta formula to the greatest effect. cyberpunk 2077 is a game with possibly the worst start of any game, ever. it has risen from the ashes of its disastrous start like a phoenix with an amazing story, fantastic characters, incredible graphics, awesome worldbuilding,  exciting gameplay, cyberpunk 2077 is probably the best thing to ever bottleneck my pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"great game, excellent on all fronts really. action, exploration, story, graphics, music, customization it's all here."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,most fun i've had with an rpg in a while. some bugs here and there but overall an s tier game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,good game. have 80 hours including xbox save. great story dlc is fire.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"fun story, even though some of the jobs feel repetitive they are still fun to just go around with the abilities and do your thing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"fantastic game, saw that it could be good at launch but waited a few years to buy in order to wait for bugs to be ironed out. game obviously shouldn't have been released in that state but it's whatever. v's journey is captivating, the gameplay shooting mechanics, dialogue, setting is great, and you get plenty of johnny silverhand goodness. never fade away"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"this game on release was absolutely terrible, but after waiting a long time i tried it again. an amazing storyline with an incredible cast of characters. i cried a shit ton at the end as well as the beginning if you know you know. the combat felt great but really wasnt anything special. it was a looter shooter and thats exactly what it felt like. which wasnt a bad thing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i originally played the game at release. i enjoyed it then, even with all the bugs and issues. but i just enjoyed it. i am currently playing it again and with all the updates this game is incredible. it is so much fun. there are things obviously i wish they had or added. but since release this game made a complete 180. want to keep playing, start new builds with new combinations. this was how it should have been at release, and this just makes me excited for their next iteration, since they learned what they now need to do when making the next cyberpunk game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"can't believe i didn't write a review for this game sooner, but i also haven't completed this game sooner. long story short, it's come a long way since launch, and it, along with the dlc phantom liberty are extremely atmospheric. it's a really fun game, with great lore, gorgeous graphics, and a lot of replayability! spoiler i just wish the endings were not as grim p spoiler but anyways, i thoroughly enjoyed it and i highly recommend it! just... beware of being sucked in and becoming addicted lol, 'cause i was over here doing literally everything in the game, reloading saves, replaying stories, etc. but that's a good thing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"very good story telling, some bugs but still playable"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"probably one of the few games that is open exploration that i enjoy immensely. the story of the main questlines are okay, a few of them are extremely gimmicky but i'd much rather just go in guns blazing for sake of the fact its quicker and easier than just having to stealth around all the bloody time. i mostly just enjoy doing the side quests, bumping into random events, and doing the ncpd assaults. it is simply insane just how much money and experience you can get doing thatand by the time i finished only two districts in night city, i was already max street cred. the game has a strong emphasis on 'play how you want to play' and doesn't really punish you that heavily. yes, the game has a wanted system that functions almost identically to the one in gta v but its actually leagues above and beyond in terms of quality compared to that one. how? let's observe how it functions in gta v firstin gta v when you get wanted levels, cops instantly know where you are and home in on you like missiles, they will actively hunt you down and even go into side alleys, above and below ground level, and will even use flying copters to track you down until the cops find you and kill you. the likelihood of getting away from the cops in gta v is very minimal unless you have every street memorized or having hiding spots planned ahead of time. in cyberpunk 2077, the cops are lazy. if you literally just stay away from the roads, hide behind buildings or on rooftops or stay underground the cops will literally get bored of trying to find you and go do something else. the cops in this game, as wellalso unlike in gta vare extremely weak. you can blaze through most ncpd units without much effort. then they send in armored units which can be a bit tougher, but are manageable. but if you are truly determined to turn night city into a warzone you will have to contend with something that puts even the military in gta v to utter shamemaxtac. maxtac are essentially minibosses that come in squadrons of 4 after you reach 5 wanted stars and continue to become a pain in the city's butt. depending on your own level, the difficulty, your gear and your setup you can either mow them down easily keep in mind they are literal bloody hit point sinks or they will blow you away within seconds. but if you manage to kill them, you do get a rare chance of obtaining some of their maxtac gear, from what i understand. all in all, this game by cdprojektred is probably one of my most enjoyed experiences in the entirety of my time playing any computer game and even when i play the game overlymuch and burn myself out and come back later? i can get right back into the groove of things because of one of the best character systems i have ever seen in a video game. the character attributes and perks system. in this game, you have attributes which help you do most any kind of thing. same with perks, with assist with all manner of thingboth combat and noncombat. want to be a bulldozer and just plow through everything with nothing but a baseball bat, and being so armored that nothing can take you down? check. want to be that stealthy cyberninja that is able to throw daggers that can instantly down unalerted enemies, or use a silenced pistol in order to blow off the head of some gangster? check. want to be the most powerful cyberhacker netrunner who is capable of detonating the car of a bunch of gangsters chasing after you? check. and that's not allyou are able to completely refund every attribute and perk, for free, in order to try out a different build later so there is no way to screw up your game by having invested into the wrong, crappy build. i rarely feel this way about games lately, but to me? this game gets a bloody 10 out of 10. perfect in every bloody way. this is how you design a good game, triple a publishers and developers. take bloody notes!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"amazing story, engaging gameplay and a lot of possible play styles that influence certain game mechanics."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"unless youve been living under a rock for the last few years you know how chaotic the release for this game was. now i can confidently say that all thats in the past. my first playthrough a few months after release had me underwhelmed and i just stopped midway through the game. but i recently played the witcher 3 and enjoyed it enough so that i wanted to give cyberpunk a second chance, and boy was i in for a good trip ! most if not all bugs have been fixed, the balance and overall systems have been redone for the best and now the game is a real treat to play. much like the witcher 3s blood and wine dlc, phantom liberty is a must, better than the base game in some ways and it offers the best missions, so make sure to get it along the base game. the best time to play it  i find  is right before going to the point of no return. additionally here are a few tips that made my playthrough more enjoyable   cars are mostly fixed but motorcycles feel and drive much better, i went for the yaiba kusagani ct3x as soon as i could afford it and stuck with it for the remainder of my playthrough. night city is clearly the jewel of this game and probably the best city ever made for a video game, so dont use fast travel and dont skip rides as often as you can youd be missing out on a lot of gorgeous places to just drive through. you can disable the annoying rpg hitpoints that spill out of enemies when you hit them, to get a more traditional fps feel. doing so doesnt hinder you at any point and bosses still have a health bar. the game looks and feels much better that way imo. do all the gigs and side missions, they are nice. phantom liberty has the best gigs and side missions so get it !  graphics   you forget what reality is  beautiful  good  decent  bad  dont look too long at it  msdos  gameplay   very good  good  it's just gameplay  mehh  watch paint dry instead  just don't  audio   eargasm  very good  good  not too bad  bad  i'm now deaf  audience   kids  teens  adults  grandma  pc requirements   check if you can run paint  potato  decent  fast  rich boi  ask nasa if they have a spare computer  game size   floppy disk  old fashioned  workable  big  will eat 10 of your 1tb hard drive  you will want an entire hard drive to hold it  you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data  difficulty   just press 'w'  easy  easy to learn  hard to master  significant brain usage  difficult  dark souls  grind   nothing to grind  only if u care about leaderboardsranks  isn't necessary to progress  average grind level  too much grind  you'll need a second life for grinding  story   no story  some lore  average  good  lovely  it'll replace your life  game time   long enough for a cup of coffee  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond  price   it's free!  worth the price  if it's on sale  if u have some spare money left  not recommended  you could also just burn your money  bugs   never heard of  minor bugs  can get annoying  ark survival evolved  the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs  ?  10   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"cant stress enough how much this game is the best game i played everything you do matters every choice will make you miss some part of story or experience said story, every little detail amazes me even in the world you will find random stories unrelated to any quest that will break your heart or leave you amazed just impressive however strongly suggest you play with the dlc as the polish and world building it gives seems necessary"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i grant this game 910 shards this game is nova! this game is so great i had to buy it for 80 euro's after pirating it. first off i had pirated this game as i was skeptical with its launch since i was waiting on this game for years. after getting close to the end i saw how great th9is game was after phantom liberty released and i bought it simply bringing over my savefile. the story is really fun and great, characters have actual personality, music that truly matches the universe , fun weapon play, diffrent playstyles with no locked in classes. do i need to say more? no? because i am going to say more the dlc enchances the game from about an 810 to a 910 it is simply that good with new locations in a large dangerous chunck off night city with sidequests and new variations off old things like criminal activity. the main game can feel shrt compared to other games yet the amount off voiced and rewarding sidequests its really great to walk around the world and do those. checklist review  audience   beginners  casual gamers  normal gamers game is not that hard  expert gamers  graphics   bad  alright  good  beautiful aesthetic and graphics are good so, beautiful voice acting  bad  alright  good  music   bad  alright  good  beautiful  fantastic v sinem more is stuck in my head  difficulty   easy  average  hard to a degree if you pump up the difficulty  unfair bugs   bugs destroy the game  lots of bugs  few bugs yes haha cyberpunk buggy funny but no after the 2.0 update i have not had big issues  you can use them for speedrun  nothing encountered personally  story   there is none  bad  alright  good  fantastic quite emotional  gameplay   frustrating  sleepy  boring  fun  challenging  fast paced fps if you choose to be fast that is  lots off side questing  game time  length   really short 0  3 hours for now but with infinite mode and a few updates it could gain a ton off playtime  short 4  8 hours  few hours 10  20 hours  long 4060 hours main game is shot but the sidequest are what enchances the game a ton  very long 60100 hours  extremely long 100 hours price  quality   full price please buy the full game to support these devs they really did the best they could  wait for sale  don't buy  refund it if you can"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,amazing gameplay crazy graphics can customize v to have a giant cock 1010 recommended
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,really fun mechanics and a story that made me emotional. always loved flying around with a samurai sword.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,what an insanely good improvement since the buggy release initially. worth a play!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"very fun game, make sure that you have decent specs on your pc it can be a tad demanding to run. it can also be a bit buggy but nothing close to how it was on launch its much better now. i've crashed twice but other than that has been perfect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i have well over 100 hours on the game and on the way to doing all of the phantom liberty endings. i must say i'm a big fan of the dlc so far and the game has given me a motivation to try and collect most if not all achievements in both the base game and dlc. speaking out like most people, i do wish the romantic options had more depth. especially when going on dates or hanging out. it would be nice to have more cute interactions with panam or judy. hell give me a dlc where i go on a virtual date with johnny. definitely an improvement since release, highly replayable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,i like the story good detail and just a good game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,good game but the last 20 of the story to reach end game feel poor made it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"the older it gets, the better it tastes. few bugs here and there but none the less, a game with an amazing story! a game to play for weeks , you ll never get bored with it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"fun game, release was a bit rocky but it is an average cdpr release i enjoyed this game though."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,the story line and graphics are great. phantom liberty likewise is a good addition.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"it's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. i've completed all the endings, gained all the achievements, but i still get pulled back into playing this well crafted world. playing this game is an otherworldly experience, one i wish i could experience new again. night city is like a beautiful rose with thorns in every corner, with the permanent choices you have to make. i have never played a game with such immersive characters with exceptional voice acting, and an amazing story. additionally, phantom liberty feels like a whole new game alone, the craftsmanship is incredible and i was amazed that this game could get any better. this is my favourite game of all time, and definitely the best story game i have ever played, and i can't wait for any future games cd projekt red release. i couldn't recommend this game enough, it is a work of art. but remember, there's no happy endings in night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,terrible at launch but made a full recovery and is now easily one of my favorite games of the last decade
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"one of the bestif not the best stories i've ever played. lots of secret stuff to discover, collectibles, bunch of different builds for different playstyles. gameplay is satisfying. graphics are nice. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i false started with this game probably 3 times and i finally built myself a pretty end end rig and decided to give it another go and it is fast becoming one of my favorite games of all time. love it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"really lucky to experience this masterpiece after all of those updates  improvements,, still considering to buy the dlc tho"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"its great, its beautiful and has a great story, i'm really enjoying this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"a great game to immerse yourself in, a capturing storyline and cinematics."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"i loooveeed this game until i got to the endings. i feel they are a bit lackluster and half of them are open ende. you are left wondering what actually happens  they are essentially the same ending you just take a different path to reach them. other than that, the game is immersive and there's a lot of content and storylines if you like doing side missions. the combat is not dull either."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"what a long strange trip it has been. when this game came out it was a buggy, awful mess. i have never been more dissapointed in a game. how that has changed... after years of constant love from cd projekt red . cyberpunk has redeemed itself to be one of the greatest games of the decade. it has joined the witcher 3 in my list top 10 favourite games in all time. redemption is hard, but they have redeemed themselves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"this game is a journey. great supporting cast of characters with their own plotlines that you end up caring about. great gameplay, great story. it's everything i wanted. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,fun game ngl. bit pricey  repetitive gameplay. but can't give it a negative review purely for that.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,honeslty one of the best rpg's with the best no cut scene tranistions. huge world captivating story and characters.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"first pc game i downloaded and played. a pretty mellow game to learn to use mk, story is pretty good and you have options on outcomes, etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,1010 game great way to pass the time on a daily it gets even better when you add mods.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"okay. first off  90 of the bugs are features. the other 10, for me, were 1 ctd, 1 inability to pass ingame time without reloading, one inability to hang up the ingame phone without first reloading. all the other bugs enhanced my exprerience. story, aces. soundtrack, silly good. characters, engrossing. my only gripe is that the game is too big. at 266 hours for 57 achievements, the grind is painful. legit, if you're an achievement whore like me, avoid. but for the rest of you, get out there, and stare at panam's ass with the rest of us cyberpunk loving degenerates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"after all the updates and dlc, best time to get in or back into cyberpunk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"there is a reason why the game has an overwhelmingly positive review recently. buy it at full price, buy it on sale. it doesn't matter. you will get a gaming experience that's on par with skyrim and baldur's gates 3. story 1010 gameplay 910 soundtrack 910 graphics 2010 cool factor 10010 gyat!!! 10010 replay factor 1010 some negatives vehicles control takes some getting use to. a bit buggy. still requires a quantum computer to experience the visual at its fullest. overall the devs really polished this game. and added even more features. cd projekt red redeemed itself. hopefully they don't release wither 4 like they did this game. anyone who waited to experience this game years after its release made the right decision."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"this game doesn't rise to the quality standards of the witcher iii, but cdpr fixed it up a good bit since launch, and the world of cyberpunk practically sells itself. i highly recommend picking up phantom liberty as well, since that really elevates the experience. just don't expect a happy endingthose don't exist in this kind of setting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"an amazing game, 810 story, 910 graphics 810 gameplay. only problem is that it keeps crashing constantly on certain missions, soft locking me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"disclaimer played this after the 2.0 patch and with the phantom liberty dlc active. if you like rpgs and guns, this game is for you. cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best openworld rpgs ever made, thanks to its immersive storyline, deep character development, and refined gameplay mechanics. the skill tree and cyberware system allow for diverse and dynamic builds, whether you prefer a stealthy netrunner hacking enemies from the shadows, a bruteforce cybernetic brawler, or a gunslinger with pinpoint accuracy. combat feels smooth and responsive, with a good ai for both enemies and npcs, making engagements rewarding. the ui is good but not the best in class and most consumables are an after thought in most situations. also, the vehicle combat is good but not great, as it can feel a bit awkward at times depending on vehicle type. the phantom liberty expansion delivers a fantastic main story and a wealth of side content, all wrapped in an espionagedriven narrative. personally, i found its storyline even better than the base game's main story. one things for surethe dlc is well worth the extra money, as it alone adds 2030 hours of content with a proper playthrough. is it better than the witcher 3? id say it reaches about 90 of that masterpiece in its current state. however, its still not a problemfree experience. while the game runs significantly better than at launch from what i've read, i still encountered occasional issues, especially towards the endgame. npc pathing can be awkward, frame rate drops occur in certain areas, and i experienced two random crashes in my 100hour playthrough. that said, if youve been hesitant to jump in, now is the best time to experience cyberpunk 2077 as it was meant to be played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,very fun to play and submerse yourself in the bowels of a city to find beauty and chaos. 9 out of 10
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"this game used to be beyond trash, but thanks to patches, its worth playing today. the story is cool, with characters like johnny silverhand and v. the city looks amazing, and the combat is fun. definitely try it out when you get the chance"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,amazing story line. background setup and environment are top class
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,a very good game with an emotionally deep storyline. the endings are heartbreaking. performance was great on a 5950x and 4090. no crashes and i only noticed a few very minor bugs. 9.510 contender for greatest game of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"played it on my old laptop, on my desktop and now on my new laptop replayed it screwed up mission with rogue, finished the the game, then replayed it again, and it's a blast"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"gives you everything you could want in an rpg. basically only knock is being locked out of certain storylines without replaying messing up dialogue choices impacting future questsendings for example. makes sense from a realism standpoint, but not an enjoyable experience for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"damn yeah i'm replaying it even after finishing the story. cd never disappointed me in case of story's. i love witcher and cyberpunk 2077's, and yeah, i'm damn sure i'll complete all endings, as of current times, i've completed 2 of them, rogue one and notakemura oneain't gonna spoil why there is no takemura cuz' i didn't pay much attention while the mission and yeah...the it happened. and it's so freakin' fun game, dude. i mean, open world, gta vibe, fun, menace mode in you comes out and shit what not, dude! if you haven't played this damn masterpiece, then have a shower of shit you lil' nword! just remeber to have a beefy pc and the main story line is around 25 hours with a few main side biz'. see ya around, chica!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"amazing game. a beautiful, horrible dystopian world, with excellent writing. 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"a truly wonderful storytelling game. despite the occasional bugs and glitches, it's still visually stunning with amazing gameplay and characters. a lot of content got cut, but it's still very full of things to do and explore! highly recommend, even if it had an abysmal launch"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"cyberpunk 2077 went from being a game i thought i would never play to one of my top 3 favorites. a friend convinced me to finally give it a try, and i'm glad i did. it took me a while to really get to know the lore and the world, but the combat was fun pretty much from the beginning. i focused my build around only using blades both katanas and throwing knives and by the end i felt so powerful. i fell in love with the characters and ended up doing pretty much everything there is to do in my first playthrough, and even after 200 hours i wanted more. i just never got tired of night city. i loved the themes around loss, impending death, and anticapitalism. even after putting the game down i couldn't stop thinking about it. despite some remaining glitches, it is overwhelmingly a fun and compelling experience every time i boot it up. do yourself a favor and give it a try if you haven't already."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"it took me a minute to get the hang of the way the game worked. there's a good bit of different ways to play. but overall, i'm enjoying it so far. graphics are also very good in my opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"what can i say about this game, but the fact that it's a clear example of things standing the test of time. played it back in 2020, when it was buggy as hell, getting negative reviews, but, when you are motivated enough to fix your shit, then, you become like cyberpunk 2077. went through hell, and back is what this game is, the story is just truly exceptional, detroit become human like emotions, gameplay mechanics are exceptional, and the game truly deserves the spotlight it got. cdpr, instead of being greedy and taking the money were like  hell nah, we will improve the game and make it good, and that's what they did. the tie ins with edgerunners too  nostalgia and emotion inducing! have high hopes for cyberpunk orion now, and my favorite ending  don't fear the reaper. a satisfying conclusion to the game in every way, though yes, tough, but rewarding. got 122 hours now, and still, haven't had enough of it. cdpr, thank you, for fixing the game, cuz this is a masterpiece. a truly preem product."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"this is a game that requires multiple play through. just once will blow you away, the second and third times make you seriously consider funding cybernetic research on your own."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"this game is original, not repetitive like most video games, and challenging. its an amazing escape from the boring monotone lives that most of us including me generally live. i don't remember ever having this exact fantasy, but come on, haven't we all wanted a super cool celebrity as a best friend or family member. so so cool. thank you cd project red. my life has been so fulfilled since i started cyber punk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"i love everything about the game so far. the story is emotional, dialogue, fighting, skills and attributes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"best game i've ever played. has so much freedom for play styles and choices leading to different outcomes in the game, it doesn't hold your hand and tell you what to do rather lets you pick and chose which version of v you want to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,horrible launch but years later this is one of those games i just keep coming back to.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"best story, character build up. spain . mexico and the whole world culture in one game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"cyberpunk 2077 is one wild rideexactly the kind of chaotic, neondrenched adventure i live for. i jumped into night city expecting an immersive, futuristic playground, and honestly, it mostly delivered on that promise. the citys vibe is unreal slick visuals, a killer soundtrack, and characters who feel like theyve stepped right off the edge of society. every corner has its own story, and its hard not to get caught up in the sheer ambition of it all. that said, the game isnt without its quirks. just when i was vibing with the narrative, some glitch or performance hiccup would yank me back to reality. its like trying to enjoy a highenergy concert when someone keeps hitting the pause buttonannoying and a bit out of sync with the hype. still, these moments rarely detract from the overall experience they just add a layer of unpredictability to an already unpredictable world. at its core, cyberpunk 2077 is a bold experimenta game that dares to push boundaries even if it sometimes stumbles over its own ambition. if youre down for a ride thats as flawed as it is fascinating, then night city is calling your name. its messy, its imperfect, but damn, its an experience you wont forget."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"i own this on multiple systems, it had a hard start and has been through quite a few updates since. the game has come a long was and you may have a few glitches here and there with a little bit of suspension of disbelief you can pretend its part of v's experience with the chip haha the immersive element is there, easter eggs, the technical character building is there, the run and gun is there all depending how you play. the cyberpunk genre is wide and they check the boxes. netrunner? edgerunner? clean and silent? fast and messy? all availible. soundtrack is dope. fashionpunk. pure chrome choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"a truly incredible experience. although the game had a rocky release, its a very good story game with fun combat and cool weapons. the story is amazing, the references to cyberpunk edgerunners makes it very fun to find certain items. with fun driving, likable characters, fun combat system, this is a very good game that i'd highly recommend getting into. do not meet hanako at embers."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"cyberpunk '77 got seriously chromed up 'fter cdpr rolled all them updates and it paid off. the tech, the music, the combat, the choombas ya make 'long the way in the world it makes for quite the unique experience, 'specially with dogtown openin' up it's doors tis like ... you make your own bd  yer the director, the actor 'n the writer. so what are you waiting for yer gonk! come visit us in nc, we'll show you where to find the best locust pepperoni pizza in the world !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"great story, loads of side quests and other fun things hidden around to do if you want to explore the city and not just speed run through the main quest line. clothing options seemed a little unnecessary but there's a lot of options there if that's what you like in a game. didn't get bored half way through and give up on finishing it like a lot of games these days."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"this game brought back that one feeling of not wanting to go to sleep like how skyrim did. awesome story line, mechanics, and graphics. give this game a go!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"saddestbest story i've played, nearly cried at every ending. good thing the anime is fun and lighthearted! 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"it still has some bugs, but the game is pretty inmersive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,beautiful game! deep story lines and awesome driving and action scenes. you have to get this game!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"how do you describe cyberpunk? a difficult question honestly. the game is designed off of it's ttrpg counterpart cyberpunk red, cyberpunk 2020, and cyberpunk 2013, written by mike pondsmith, cyberpunk is his brainchild. this game does a perfect job of displaying and evolving the story, narritive, and style these table top games go for. with the updates that have been brought fourth the game is fun, and engaging, wonderfully intriquite systems, rarely will you see a bug anymore. and the story, gameplay, and art direction is exquisite! for me it's a 9.9 out of 10. it lost the .1 due to it's rocky early days"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,this is one of my fav. games to play. i haven't beat it yet but im trying to. i don't see why they need nudity in video games though other than that this is a great game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,there's something magical about the atmosphere and the concept of cyberware. every main quest feels meaningful. highly reccomend if your computer can handle it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"the start was rough, with a lot of misinformation and unreachable promises. should cdpr's games be prepurchased after that? of course not, there's no need to prepurchase any game. but at the current state this game is great, great to the point of me not being sure i'll find another similar one for the next couple of years. if not a decade. so what's in the end, despite the rough start corps have won? of course they did!, johnny would say, did you forget where are you at? it's cyberpunk, kiddo. corps always win. but we have to fight no matter what. and he'd be right, that's precisely what we should do. join forces, spread the word, make sure this corp gets what it deserves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"if you dislike corporations, this game might put you on a watchlist, but it will be worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"good game, but on my system a lot of crashes initially, mostly when driving around. turned out to be a driver problem. after cleaning the nvidia drivers and installing them fresh again, the problems went away for 99."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"worth a playthrough in 2025, first experience was on ps4 and im much happier with current performance"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i love this game, the story is amazing and you can very easily get into your character. i wish the game was longer but its definitly not short. the only small downside is that once you got good cyberware and vehicles you like eddies becomes kinda useless. would recommend"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"cyberpunk2077 is my all time top 5 game. not only they have perfect the gameplay right now, but the story, mission and flexibility for you to play this game is just beyond almost all other games! not to mention it's breathtaking graphic, design on this massive night city map. you could easily lost yourself in this world for hours by just walking around. now is the time to join in! what is stopping you from playing one of the best game?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"it's not a perfect game but it's really good. it's one of the few games i look forward to playing instead of just playing to do something. as of writing this, i'm working on my second playthrough right after finishing my first. it's rare for me to start a new playthrough so soon which i think says something about how good i find the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"spent too many hours playing this game, amazing world and story and a very good rpg"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,this game has improved so much since the original launch. patch 2.21 makes it even better.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i love the character design, graphics and storyline. it's a dystopian futuristic work of art, my two favorite things."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,50
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"story is good, sometimes it's hit and miss but no matter. the game play is what made me play this game for 570 hours so far. i played only after 2.0 was released so i can't really judge the release version tho."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i like almost everything about this game and i hate that after spending more than 1100 hours in it, i still feel like it's not enough. i need more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"alright, so cyberpunk 2077 is basically the definition of a wild ride. youre in a futuristic dystopia with neon lights everywhere, hacking into stuff, and doing some crazy missions, all while being chased by shady corporations and a city full of weirdos. its like blade runner meets gta, but with way more glitches seriously, way more. the world is huge, and youll spend hours driving around, getting into random fights, or hacking into anything that moves. the story is solid, and the side quests are, well, a lot. you can get distracted by a million things and never actually get back to the main story. but honestly, who cares? the world is so cool, youll just get lost in it. the best part? the characters. theyre messed up, hilarious, and some of them will make you question your life choices. keanu reeves as johnny silverhand? pure legend. but the game is also not without its bugs, and sometimes youll see people floating midair or driving cars in reverse for no reason. its all part of the charm, right? in short, cyberpunk 2077 is chaotic, full of glitches, but super fun. its a cyberpunk dream with just a few nightmares thrown in. if you can handle the chaos, youll have a blast."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,a very great take on a cyberpunk future. this game had a rocky beginning but they fixed most of the bugs and the dlc was a very great decision.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"cyberpunk heaven. it's like deus ex human revolution on steroids. janky start but the version of cyberpunk that's out today will keep me replaying for years. that's great for a single player game. i'm still discovering new secrets, new way to complete quests, and new tidbits of lore in the world after 433 hours on steam, about 200 more on the xbox. 9.510. i really hope cdpr don't lose the ability to make good games like so many other studios and release a worthy sequel one day."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"we need more sex scene with panam, and make her more alive like come on, dates, more option to the dialogues... and the interactions. after the quest she's just there in nomad camp, soulless."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"really fun game, was not sure if i was going to be able to run this on a thirty seventy ti but she handles this like a champ and theres so many enjoyable things in the game really worth checking out and if you liked the ascent its another game like cyberpunk ages ahead of its time, so yes if you havent played go ahead and try if your running my gpu no need to adjust the setting just let her rip, and you could even do some modding you like. have a blessed day brethern ive gotta delta..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,one of the best games i have ever played the graphics and story is incredible. love how the side quests and gigs have an engaging story. the game is awesome i am done with everything the base game could offer including all the quests and divergent stories. finding easter eggs like bb and hideo kojima from death stranding another game i really like was awesome check out all the screenshots i have shared
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"it had a rough launch, but it was still playable and fun imo. i ended up stopping when i was trying to 100 it because of some quest bugs, but i was all but a couple districts done i believe. the game is in much better shape now, with tons to do and explore. i'm looking forward to finishing off my 100 quest completion and playing the dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"had issues at the start, took 5 years but i finally sat down and played it. game is good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,it's fantastic. just play it. press that buy button and enjoy the next 60 hours
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"this game is a true masterpiece. i have played for far more than the hours on my account, across all platforms. this is my skyrim."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,810 a fantastic must have game. one of the best. when i say it. mark my words this game is good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"if you're debating if you should buy this game or not, let me save you some time buy it. it's 100 worth it even at full price. do it. i promise you won't regret it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,the game can tug on the heart strings sometimes overall a pretty good experience encountered the odd glitch but id highly recommend the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i rarely finish games i start, but i finished the main story and all the side quests in like 3 days amazing game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"great game! got all the perks you'd expect, true open world future gaming experience, love making those eddies and just getting emerge in the city life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"this is one of the best open world fps game. the setting is crazy good, the gameplay is basic but hella fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i preordered this game and liked it a lot despite the teleporting police, terrible bugs, and bad armor system. i never finished it on pc for some reason, i guess i got bored. i picked this up last year for xbox and was incredibly impressed how far it came and how well optimized it was on my 4k tv. i couldnt put it down and completed it with all the side quests, etc. it was good then became amazing. great story and characters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"one of the best video games to date. you are doing yourself a disfavor if you've never touched this game. i originally played this on launch day in 2020 and on xbox one, so not a great introduction to the game. it was a mess a launch, but the game still had its core intact a great narrative with interesting characters and an amazing world with cool lore. this was enough to make me love it, but i knew it needed some work. as cdpr continued work on cyberpunk 2077 since launch, it's gotten even better. this went from a game where i only cared about the main story to a game where i eagerly 100'd it as the game got better with each update. if you like rpgs, the cyberpunk genre, philosophical writing, or a great looking game, cyberpunk 2077 is a musthave and a mustplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,the story and the different character personalities are so well written in the base story and somehow got even better in the phantom liberty dlc that you felt like they were written by psychologists. the combat is fun with lots of different playstyles and the gameplay mechanicsquality of life updates have come a long way since launch. its story and world lore has something that everyone can enjoy with a lot of replayability. this game is extremely worth it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"383 hours, since day one. great game. only gotten better with age. a must play for any sci fi nerd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"the comeback is real! avoided this like plague because its state at launch. but now as most of the bugs have been ironed out, this is one of the best openworld rpgs i have ever player."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,2nd playthrough after launch they removed a lot of annoying bugs like the music one but there are still funny bugs in the main story quests. that all aside great gaem 910 air dashing is sick now and they fixed crafting in skilltree.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"when i played the game at launch on ps4 it was unplayable, now it's a master piece ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible game that is able to immerse players into its world like no other game. the city of night city is so realistic and full of life, that it feels like a living, breathing entity. the game is able to capture the very essence of cyberpunk and transport players to a world of technology, crime, and dark alleys. the gameplay mechanics are also incredibly immersive, giving players a sense of control and agency within the world. every character, every interaction, and every object feels like it is part of a bigger whole. cyberpunk 2077's immersion is second to none. the only thing were the braindance replays they were just annoying in my opinion. overall 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"this game was a hell of an experience. not only was i immersed in the story of v, but i often found myself lost in the world for hours, 100 recommend for anyone!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,game good. good game. the game is good. the game is a good game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"while i have been enjoying the 2.0 version of the game, i am hitting an snag with phantom liberty. the dlc achievements are bugged and not working, and i do not feel like restarting a whole new game just to make them. having tried all current recommendations for fixes, as lots of people have this same problem,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"check it, choom this neondrenched, 80sfueled future freakshow is an absolute riot. youve got gnarly combat rigged with insane augments, a sprawling city that oozes style, and a killer soundtrack that makes you wanna break something. the story rips open your skull and messes with your headshowing off a messedup, corporateruled tomorrow thats way too real. but guess what? im totally down to rage through those mean streets, cause this savage ride is just too punk to pass up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"when cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it was a game full of potential that struggled under the weight of expectations. now, after years of updates and the incredible phantom liberty dlc, it has become one of the most immersive and rewarding rpg experiences ive ever played. what really hooked me was the different endings. every choice felt significant, and after finishing the game once, i couldn't resist jumping back in to see how things would play out with different decisions. each ending added new layers to the story and characters, making night city feel more alive than ever. then came phantom liberty, which wasnt just a simple expansionit was a fullblown upgrade to the game. the new district, dogtown, was packed with intrigue, new mechanics, and some of the best storytelling in the game. idris elbas performance as solomon reed added so much depth, and the spythriller narrative felt distinct from the base game while still fitting perfectly into the world of cyberpunk 2077. and the crazy part? i havent even scratched the surface of mods yet. the community has been pumping out incredible content that enhances visuals, adds gameplay tweaks, and even introduces new quests. with modding, my time in night city is far from over. if you were hesitant about cyberpunk 2077 at launch, now is the time to dive in. between multiple endings, the phantom liberty dlc, and the endless possibilities of modding, this game keeps pulling me back inand i dont see myself stopping anytime soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"immersive, amazing world building, great story and character, fun. the kind of game that leaves you hollow kind of feeling after you finish"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"one of the best rpgs i've ever played. disastrous launch soured this game's reputation but the 2.0  edgerunners update as well as phantom liberty dlc really turned it around and made all the clunkiness into an awesome and streamlined experience. lots of compelling storylines, voice acting, fun combat and customizability"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"the game play is fun, open world is breath taking, story is engaging. i would highly recommend playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,graphics top quality nice story one issue is with some missions is boring
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,great game. with the new updates and mods this game really pops. just plain fun.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,what a massive difference from the first time i played on console. 4k with ray tracing has me looking at night city for hours. definitely a game worth picking up. it's in my top 10 games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"a little more story heavy than i like, but very fun open world rpg with lots of customizations. replayability is very high."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"this game is great. everyone heard about the bad launch but i just started playing and it runs great despite my laptop not meeting the minimum requirements playing lowest settings. an interesting world rich in detail, that feels like there's some satire and messaging without being preachy at all. fun gameplay and many approaches to missions. stealth is limited at first but the more you level and unlock the more fun and versatile it gets. there's a lot of cool music but i wish i could listen to the radio during missions. the music is also way mastered way too densely, in a way that ear fatigue sets in fast. i'd also like more customization for the cars. having the custom paintjob vanish whenever you exit the vehicle is stupid. it reminds me of older, ambitious games like far cry 3. highly recommend this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,the story in this game is amazing. the graphics are amazing. everything about this game is amazing. it has came a long way since the launch and i'm proud of it for turning into one of the best story games of this generation. johnny silverhand the goat btw.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,alot of content and great stories and great graphics
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i like it however the music absolutely sucks and drive me nuts  they should include an option to choose your own music themes or upload soundtracks also in the menu invenstory the static frequency bavkground noise they chose is terrible! sounds like som psyop frequency crap that is just so annoying to listen to, it's noise! not a cool effect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"cyberpunk is one of my favorite games of all time and honestly has affected my life in so many ways. its definitely one of those games that gets you thinking about the future of technology and what is possible. its even inspired my own personal studies and interests professionally. lets dive in i know the game had a rocky launch, but where the game is at now is incredible. even before all of the bug fixes, i really never came across anything too game breaking so no complaints there. currently, i think the game is pretty optimized for the amount of data that needs to be loaded in and what is generated in the game. the game is one of the most beautiful games you will ever play. an immersive futuristic city with advancing technology every place you look. add in an incredible musical score and youve got something profound. regarding the story, i have to say its one of the best ive played through. i found it pretty cool that there are many different ways to play the game which alter relationships with characters as well as the endings. it really makes you feel like you are the one responsible for your decisions which ive never really experienced in gaming before. there are soo many things to do outside of the main story too, but honestly even if you just played the main missions you couldnt go wrong. the mechanics and customization have been perfected. i love love love the new system and how to spend attributes. really glad they put some thought into making it even better than it was before. the dlc is super good. very fast paced and exhilarating with fun new characters and lore that ties into the main game. definitely recommend buying and playing through at your own pace before completing the main story. i really dont have an area of the game that i didnt like. that said however, i still wish they would have added some form of coop. can only imagine how fun this would have been been playing with a friend of mine. at the end of the day 1010 in my book."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i actually returned this game on launch day but decided to give it another shot after seeing multiple youtube videos explaining how good it is now. holy shit, night city is a work of art, i can't think of any other game with an openworld this immersive and visually impressive. videos don't do this game justice, it's enormous, like driving around a real city. this is the type of game where you could drive by an entire beach side slum packed with detail and never even engage with it. the world designers for this are quite literally the best in the world. the story is also top class. only thing i can say is that very hard difficulty isn't very hard, but a simple mod to double damage turned the game into dark souls which i am happy with. not really the point of the game, but i find it more fun if i have to perform perfectly to not die."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"yeah yeah, we all know how this game started out. but now, it's actually pretty fun. must have if you like dystopian scifi rpgs with heavy shooter mechanics and branching mission arcs. still a few different bugs here and there mostly minor stuff, but occasionally the game still crashes, or you get stuck somewhere, but still less buggy than skyrim i guess, so it's fine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"night city sip you up and spit u out. i wish it was nicer sometimes, so sad, butt very fun game, is enjoymen t. i thought johnny was manly and smell like piss.. recmend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"this game is simply... amazing!!! the story of this game is one, if not the best story i've ever played. the shooting and fighting mechanics are really satisfying. really easy to lose sleep to this game. plus amazing mods after you finish your first play through. i've probably played this game around 4 times and i enjoy it every time. the only issue i have with this game is i cant play it again for the first time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"despite the pricing, this game is worth every cent spent. i wish i had bought ultimate edition immediately because the game is just that fun. this game is a tough game, and there are no happy endings in night city. but thats why its so effective. this game will change your life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"beyond the painfully obvious corpo bad message that is inherent to punk media, something i really like about this game is that it humanizes the people in it. so many of the things wrong with nc aren't some society... message, it's not people bad like fallout 4 likes to push, people do a lot of the bad things in nc because they've been pushed past their breaking point. also, if it looks choppy no matter how high your framerate and 1s are or how good your frametime is... try launcherskip"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,still glitchy but no where near the mess at launch ill probably try the dlc expansion loved the game wish there was more to it with customization but combat is nice with a decent amount of ways to play that feel like the game has actually changed. from a heavy hitting armored psycho to a stealthy blade weilding bullet blocking ninja.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"fiiiine. it's a really fun game. especially in the state it's in now. just the base game eats up hours like it's nothing. as far as action and story go, the missions are tons of fun. only real critique is i wish you can do more things in the city like own a club and do more naughty things. or have path exclusive quests like establishing a nomad clan, street gang or become a high ranking corpo. hopefully that kind of stuff shows up in the sequel."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game was good. it had its ups and downs. i got it in the sale lately, and enjoyed it so much i got phantom liberty midway through the story. after 4 years of updates or so, i was thinking there would be very few bugs left. this is not the case. car summoning especially frequently breaks, often your cars will spawn 20 feet in the air or land upside down or any of a number of things. there are a great variety of minor bugs, but that didn't distract me from the important thing there are no game breaking bugs. aside from adam smasher getting stuck in the air for 45 seconds or so which was much appreciated no bugs especially annoyed me or felt like they were ruining key parts of the game.  the reason this game is so good, to me, is two reasons the sheer amount of content and the writing. the map itself comes in at a close 3rd, but the first two really stood out to me. maybe it's because i played once human lately, with its unvoiced, cheap side quests, but how thought out each and every side quest was, how each had a professional level of voice acting and graphics and cutscenes, really kept me immersed throughout this long, long, playthrough. and i hardly got everything done. this in conjunction with the writing itself. especially in phantom liberty, your choices matter. the game makes it known when you're making a key decision and the consequences of your actions can be wildly different. i missed hours of gameplay and content because i made certain decisions that steered me away. maybe i just haven't played enough storydriven games but the long timelines branching and their effects later on impressed me in a world where there is already so much to do. further on, the writing was just good. romances felt realistic, characters felt real, and every other side quest had a moral dilemma to make you question yourself and the very way you think about things. i didn't select the right dialogue for the secret ending, so i lost about 15 hours of progress going back, but this game was a solid 910."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,the fucking nutz  awesome graphics and beautiful gameplay!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"game is at the pinnacle of emersion, standing with the greats like skyrim. the combat is great, the story has some intense moments, and the sandbox aspects are great too. ton of awesome things to say about it, worth every penny."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"awesome gameplay, story, graphics. all meshed wondefully. could use some minor fixes but, overall, amazing!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"still occasional bugs but nothing that affect the gameplay too much. there is so much to do! alot of customization, beautiful scenery, can spend half a decade just taking pictures in this game xd recommend! very much worth it if you like good looking games with alot to do!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,has the same engaging story mechanism of witcher 3. it's like playing a novel.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"read reviews from when this game first came outpeople complaining about how unplayably buggy it was, etc. like most games i'm interested in i got on the train after the devs worked those out and the complainers weeded themselves out for the most part. there isn't a very long list of cyberpunk games to compare this tothere's shadowrun, the 1980s neuromancer adaptation, and a few indie titles...the open world format of this game is what makes it for me along with the imo pretty generous range of options for character specialization within a storybased rpg where you play a specific character within that story. combat and other elements are fun once you get an idea which perks you want to go with and build off them and well integrated into the rest of the game. i'm enjoying this game, maybe you will too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game, specially with the dlc, is amazing. always fun and amazing graphics and open world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game has been through the wringer since its release, and ill be honesti was skeptical going in. but after spending a good chunk of time in night city, i can say its a mixed bag of brilliance and frustration. its not the flawless masterpiece some were hoping for, but its also not the dumpster fire some made it out to be. heres the deal the good first off, night city is stunning. the worldbuilding is incredible, and the city feels alive in a way few open worlds do. the neon lights, the towering skyscrapers, the grimy back alleysits all dripping with atmosphere. walking or driving through the city at night is an experience in itself, especially with the soundtrack blasting. speaking of which, the music is fantastic. from synthwave bangers to gritty rap tracks, the soundtrack nails the cyberpunk vibe. the story is another highlight. without spoiling anything, the main questline is gripping, and there are some genuinely emotional moments that hit hard. keanu reeves as johnny silverhand? yeah, hes awesome. the side quests are where the game really shines, though. some of them are so wellwritten and layered that they feel like they could be their own games. characters like judy, panam, and river are memorable, and their stories add a lot of depth to the world. combat is fun, too. whether youre going in guns blazing, hacking enemies from afar, or slicing them up with a katana, theres a lot of flexibility in how you approach fights. the rpg elements, like upgrading your cyberware and customizing your build, add a nice layer of strategy. the bad now, lets address the elephant in the room the bugs. yes, theyre still there. i didnt experience anything gamebreaking, but there were plenty of glitchesfloating objects, npcs tposing, weird physics, and the occasional crash. its not as bad as it was at launch, but its still frustrating, especially in a game thats been out for this long. the ai is another weak point. enemy ai is pretty basic, and the police system feels halfbaked. if you commit a crime, cops just spawn out of nowhere, and theres no real chase or pursuit mechanic. its disappointing, especially in a game thats supposed to be about immersion. the driving mechanics are also hitormiss. some vehicles handle well, while others feel like youre driving on ice. and while the world looks amazing, it doesnt always feel as interactive as it should. there are a lot of coollooking places you cant actually explore, which is a bummer. the ugly but not dealbreaking the games performance can be hitormiss, even on decent hardware. i had to tweak the settings a lot to get it running smoothly, and even then, there were moments of frame rate drops. if youre playing on an older system, you might struggle. also, the hype train did this game no favors. it was marketed as this groundbreaking, genredefining experience, and while its good, its not that. its a solid rpg with some fantastic moments, but it doesnt live up to the astronomical expectations set by its marketing. final thoughts cyberpunk 2077 is a game of extremes. when its good, its really goodlike, stay up until 3 am because youre hooked good. but when its bad, its hard to ignore the flaws. if you can look past the bugs and the occasional jank, theres a lot to love here. the world, the characters, and the stories are worth experiencing, especially if youre a fan of the cyberpunk genre. would i recommend it? yes, but with caveats. if youre on the fence, maybe wait for a sale or until cd projekt red releases more patches. its not perfect, but its a journey worth takingif youre willing to put up with its rough edges. rating 7.510 its flawed, but theres a diamond in the rough here. just dont expect it to change your life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,i had completely forgotten this game existed until i saw it in steam's christmas sale last year. easily one of the best gaming experiences i've ever had.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game is almost perfect. the story is engaging, the graphics and character customizations are beautiful, the replayability is great! you can follow the main story or you can go out and do your own thing for hundreds of hours. the easy mode is laid back and relaxing for a player like me that doesn't want to die all the time, however, my husband likes a challenge and enjoys the hard and hardcore modes for how complex combat is. there are npcs you can romance, but don't have to. they have thought of almost everything that makes a game perfect. the only thing missing is a coop option. if there was some way i could hang out in night city with my husband this game would be 1010, even with out that option i still give the game a 9.7510."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"best game i've played to date, can't get enough of night city. 10 playthroughs and still going. nomad v being my favorite cause of the tuned arch and panam's dialogues are better as nomad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,amazing game! i just get lost for hours wandering around and things  reluctant to move the main story ahead lol!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"one of the first games of the past very boring 5 years in gaming to give me such mixed feelings. cyberpunk is a lot like crack in that itll give you the greatest highs, and some really low lows. it reminds me of initial overwatch, except i wouldnt play it for as long though it has a lot of longevity. it dangles its best at you like a carrot on a stick and for every judy questline diving for fucking nothing you get the incredible heist cutscenes and the fantastic maelstrom job. for every boring ass river ward quest gunning down pngs in ghetto virtual boys with 14 year olds, you experience the literal best fucking open world in the history of forever. and its not even close. i dont care how much more practical every other one is, nc is so stunning that everything else wasnt a comparison. unfortunately, the game is foretold to be beyond a hecking rpg as always, but it doesnt scratch the same itch with new vegas where we missed the opportunity for true gang affiliation. in fact, i would just argue that cyberpunk is your fairly average rpg experience. but it is a very very good one. i will warn you now that when you boot this game up, yes, you will be sitting in fucking car rides with judy or steve or whoever the fuck listening to them as you gaze at the admittedly beautiful landscape of nc. it is exactly the same shit rockstar does butoh well, rpg does as rpg is. if you can stomach it, go ahead, otherwise after the initial 1520 hours youll be not wanting to do the side quests. now, bar those warnings, when this game does good, goddamn is it fucking good. the combat is fucking amazing, and, no joke, shifting from kerenzikovs, sandevistans, being the second coming of neo with a revolver and katana, deflecting bulletsbro. the combat is sex when you get your augments. this, alongside build potential with shottys, netrunning, sandys, berserk and the likes probably give the game a lot of the longevity people say its got. mechs are annoying. smart pistols were a mistake when the point of one of reflexes passives is to make you extraordinarily slippery when fast apart from that, and maybe how stupidly strong v gets at endgame to the point that you stop taking average encounters seriously, the combat is always a high point. secondly, the story is above the scop you get in a lot of games nowadays, and i found it pleasantly different and appealing. johnny silverhand was my favourite character and while the game fumbles the two a bit at the end depending on if you get the sun ending no one can deny that you, mulling with johnny, only for the two of you to go fuck it, no one else needs to die but us. lets just go in and if we die we die if we dont we won isnt badass. again, the scenes it does right, the scenes it knows it needs to do right are always the best. i just wish the coolest ending wasnt timegated to 4 choices in chippin in and literally waiting 5 fucking minutes. its music? 5050 ass and 5050 amazing. thats a recurring theme trust me guys, i really wanna stay at your house isnt worth grimes shit ass albums clogging up the fm. just use vexelstrom. 100 good. the cars? come on projekt red. you guys werent even trying to be futuristic bar like 4 cars maybe. the handling of the cool cars, like the car you get from sex on wheels or whatever, is also fucking ass. i was really disappointed there too since i was stuck on using the outlaw most of the game. with a second game, i genuinely think we can have something special. the hard parts that bethesda never gets right is there. story, gameplay, cinematics. all of the easy parts are whats left. more ways to spend money. more of what we have. iron it out. literally, all you have to do is that and i will be shitting out a 910 for free but cyberpunk rn, for a hardass gaming cynic like me, is a good 710. maybe even an 8. also all the girls are fuckugly and annoying bitches so this adds heightened realism to the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"just no pleasing some people. cyberpunk is a fantastic experience that i wish i dived into much sooner. i've had the game in my library for almost three years, getting caught up with multiplayer games like cs, ark and valorant i neglected many outstanding single player story driven games... do yourselves a favour and play this one, don't get bogged down by over hyped, unsatisfying multiplayer experiences and return to where it all started, some absolute beauties that are being overseen because of the current online culture."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,top 3 games of all time. such a beautiful story and world. i've never been more immersed in any other game i've ever played. please do yourself the favor of purchasing this amazing experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,great game now that it's been fully patched. bought it just before patch 2.0 came out and now it's a delight. best example of don't preorder but buy to play later.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"i love cyberpunk!!! i just got done with my 5th play through and i still adore the characters and story. the graphics are amazing. apart from the fact that i myself love the cyberpunk aesthetic, the world building of conglomerates ruling over the lower classes and the character dynamic of v and johnny's situation feel very unique and the sheer amount of side content is staggering. i have yet to play phantom liberty, but in the near future i will be enjoying this dlc. i wholeheartedly recommend this game to all rpg fans of any genre to enjoy this masterpiece that is cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"absolutely love this game! i am not normally one for singleplayer games of most kinds, but this game is enthralling. i love the vehicles and all of the voice actors are phenomenal. cannot recommend this enough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"sexy game with sexy graphics. got a crap pc and play with the lowest settings and even then i only get about 15 fps. still looks and feels amazing though. also, adam smasher got a body to die for."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,good character building options to align with personal playing style. great story that helps build an emotional connection to the characters and your desired ending. a very well thoughtout game with immense detail.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,amazing storyline with deep characters and character development
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"one of the best games i've ever played!! similar to gta in a way but just a step above, and the storyline is just brilliant!! highly recommended  i got my version for about 20 in a sale tho!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,got this after they fixed a lot of stuff and it went to half price. excellent game now. you can easily waste time just cruising through night city on your favorite set of wheels. highly recommend.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"graphics are incredible. gonna give your gpu something to chew on. story...depends on what you make it. gameplay, again...it is what you make it. 910 overall. enjoy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"it felt like i was becoming the engram of my own vlike id accidentally downloaded myself into night city, glitches and all. escaping into this chaotic, neonsoaked reality wasnt just about emotions it was like therapy but with more cyberware and significantly worse life choices. the connection i felt to the characters was so strong that i started questioning whether i was v or if v was me existential crisis, but make it cyberpunk. there were moments when i genuinely wanted to live in that worlduntil i remembered the gangs, corrupt corpos, and the fact that my apartment in night city is somehow messier than my real one. still, i felt their struggles, their joys, and occasionally their poor decisionmaking skills as if they were my own. cyberpunk 2077 has carved out a special place in my heartright next to the neural implant i didnt ask forwhere fantasy, reality, and a whole lot of bugs beautifully intertwine. also, shoutout to meredith stout for proving that corpo life can be exciting and for turning me into her personal joytoy. no regrets."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"through it's rocky start and subsequent series of updates and improvements, cyberpunk 2077 has always excelled in its environment, story, and characters. night city presents an impressive sense of scale while providing consistent visual patterns across different sections of the city. this keeps the player grounded to more localized settings, which helps keep the city to feel alive rather than hollow. the depictions of technological advancement in night city also place it in the sweet spot of being advanced beyond modern day without extending too far into the future i.e. the city has the tech but it also has the grunge. the game's story begins with the relic, a conceptually interesting idea, and is able to turn it into a compelling narrative. i think the story's best attribute is the balance between its focus on technological problems and human problems the need for scifi tech mumbojumbo is sufficiently met, but there's much more to it than just that. as expected, some characters clicked for me more than others but across the board, they all succeeded in feeling real with only some dramatic exaggerations that fit the game's tone. more than anything, johnny silverhand sells this game for me. as the inseparable companion of the game, you spend a lot of time with his character and see the relationship develop throughout the playthrough. at times he's my least favorite person and at other times he's my absolute favorite but nonetheless, he's consistent and compelling. the gameplay itself is sufficient for me, though boosted heavily by other attributes. build crafting has improved dramatically since launch, which has made secondary playthroughs more enjoyable, though i still find it difficult to lock in on builds that have a distinct feel. gun play isn't the game's best feature, although every weapon looks cool and has enough flair to make it feel satisfying in that regard. the main questline has a lot of well designed sequences, particularly at the beginning and the end. side quests and gigs vary in quality overall i would say that i enjoyed more quests than i disliked. as a fan of the genre, cyberpunk 2077 delivered what i personally wanted years ago and has since continued to improve. overall, i've had very good experiences with it and wish i could experience it again from scratch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"this game is very fun and lets you do pretty much anything you want. the game is quite hardware demanding but looks incredible. there are some bugs still left in the game, like some cars just disappearing into thin air and some people who are sitting but walking. though these aren't harmful to the gameplay and are just some fun things that might happen sometimes. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"simply stated, one of the best games out there, visually stunning and a cerebral experience, just never grows old"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"patch 2.0 was a muchneeded revamp of gear variance and character progression. as a piece of media it doesn't hit all the cyberpunk genre marks imo kinda wish it was just set in 2020 with more film noir and cassette futurism, but when i wanna drive fast and punch things with supercharged cyberarms it really scratches that itch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,one of the best games i have ever played. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,an amazing immersive open world game with twists and turns that will leave you guessing and wanting more. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"i think this game is awesome. it looks great, has a fun story, the missions are neat, the abilities and builds you can play are super fun and let you easily change talentsabilities so you can change as you learn and adapt. i really like the vibe of nightcity."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"a mustplay scifi rpg that keeps getting better cyberpunk 2077 is an incredibly immersive rpg set in the vibrant and dangerous world of night city. the atmosphere is stunning, with breathtaking visuals, a rich soundtrack, and a world that feels truly alive. whether you're exploring neonlit streets, hacking into systems, or engaging in intense combat, the game offers a deep and engaging experience. the story is one of its strongest aspects, featuring memorable characters and meaningful choices that shape your journey. v is a welldeveloped protagonist, and johnny silverhand played by keanu reeves adds a unique dynamic to the narrative. side quests are just as compelling as the main story, often leading to unexpected and emotional moments. gameplay is flexible, allowing for different playstyles, whether you prefer stealth, hacking, or allout gunfights. cyberware upgrades and rpg mechanics add depth, making each playthrough feel unique. driving through the city feels great, and combat is smooth and satisfying. while the game had a rough launch, cd projekt red has significantly improved it with patches and updates, making it a polished and rewarding experience. the phantom liberty expansion further enhances the game, adding new content and mechanics that make it worth revisiting. if you love immersive rpgs with deep storytelling, engaging gameplay, and a world that begs to be explored, cyberpunk 2077 is absolutely worth playing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,i can easily say that this game is perfect 1010. i did absolutely everything in the game and nothing was boring its gonna be a real shame to go back to other games for awhile. i played cyberpunk at launch and loved it then i finally got my pc and decided it was time to dive back into night city again and i want to thank myself for making that decision. cdpr you fucking did it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"solid adventure, beautiful environments, but boring sidetasks. still a fun experience"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"second playthrough of this game, played it on launch on xbox was rough but coming back with a fresh set of eyes, i forgot how good the base game story is good, forgot how much i loved the world and characters, the stories characters and world are so well crafted it's insane. one slight downside though, i've noticed random performance hitches that i can't quiet explain as my system is more than capable of running the game, outside of this though i highly recommend if you somehow haven't played it yet."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"funny but also emotional story, love it. gameplay is satisfying"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"amazing story and game play, love everything about this game. wait for next dlc"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,superb game. with photorealistic mods it's just another level. can't keep my hands off this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"one of the best comebacks in gaming history. released in an atrocious state, but is now a truly remarkable game. strong recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,best open world game i've played so far. that city is a masterpiece. i cannot get enough of nithy city.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"honestly, when this game came out it was terrible. but without giving up the devs released version 2.0 and practically remade the game into something worth exploring. i can still remember how well this game immerses you in the world, in the beginning you hear the word choom and you physically cringe and recoil to the sound of it but near the end of the game you can see yourself start to embrace the name and truly feel like you can understand living in night city. id try it out but only id wait for a sale 59.99  29.99 dlc is a crazy price"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"tried this game when it first came out and it was borderline impossible to enjoy. so, so glad this got patched up because it's genuinely one of the most immersive, and downright fun, video game experiences i've had in a loooooooong time. i'm really struggling to put it down  and i've barely even touched on the main campaign yet! everything from the combat, stealth, worldbuilding, city design and openworld mechanics are just excellent  and the character customisation  roleplay elements are the icing on the cake. not many games are able to master a symbiotic relationship between player and protagonist, but i can comfortably say that cyberpunk is one of 'em. high recommend to anyone  especially those who still haven't given this a chance since launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"truly one of the greatest rpg games ever made from the story to the combat to the cars, cyberpunk excels in every faucet of the gaming experience. the seemingly endless amount of things to do in the game  from quick, 30 second side quests to gut wrenching, vast storylines of unforgettable characters  makes night city feel truly alive, not just another city in a video game.in this game, especially in phantom liberty, decisions matter. the blend of the soulful writing and stellar acting brings this game to life, with every decision feeling as if it was made against a real person with real feelings. if you haven't seen any before you buy videos or gameplay of this masterpiece, don't. buy this game plus phantom liberty for one of  if not the  best story games ever made. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"this game is sick, very immersive and night city is extremely visually pleasing. the characters and story are some of the best iv seen in a video game. the game is packed with moments of dialogue where you advance the story through your decisions. combat is fun with multiple play style options. highly recommend!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"it's the only game i can escape into, and let's be honest we all do that when we play games, and this game is defo one of it, if not the best one of it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"despite the rough start, this game has become one of my all time favorites. the graphics are unbelievable and the gameplay is fast, fluid, and crisp. there are so many ways to customize v to fit your playstyle which keeps the game feeling fresh even after multiple playthroughs. not to mention all the additions made through the 2.0 update like the revamped police response, working monorail, cyberware limit overhaul, and the all new vehicle combat features. and to top it all off, the story is one that sticks with you long after the credits roll. i would highly recommend giving the game a try if you haven't already."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"this game is the greatest produced media of the 21st century. all great things have their flaws but this game truly reminds you of the biggest and smallest aspects of real life, nailing you straight in the gut with each twist and turn as you progress through the journey of a beautifully crafted lifetime. thank you so much for the game you have created, cant wait to see the next chapter"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"very good story, slightly buggy, and a lot of sex. great game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"fantastic game  the game picks it setting and runs with it beautifully, the characters have distinct personalities and the dialogue is fantastic for the most part. the dlc to go with it is great too, all in all really happy cdpr stuck with fixing and refining this game as its a masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"great game but far from perfect. story, characters and the overall night city vibes are amazing, as well as the combat feeling fresh. but their are some downsides. some quests feel repetitive and incomplete. no shortage of bugs and glitches and performance being rough at some parts. but all the negatives are easily overlooked with all the good things. 810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"loved it, great graphics, better story"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"imagine if this game was online and play with a friend , it would be fun to play but still even single player it's a real great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"good game. i suck at 1st person shooter, so, i play on normal or even easy to enjoy the world and story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"the game has the pleasing graphics if you are using ray tracing its much good, also the story line is very good, lots of activity  missions will keep you engage. the best part is which will really test your iq is when you are building your character in terms of key skills, perks  cyber ware requirement as these areas give you the final conclusion for how you are going to make your play style"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"there's been a lot of conversation surrounding how this is just a huge comeback after release, but as a longterm fan of the cyberpunk series, i genuinely couldn't have asked for a better first entry. this genuinely feels like the tabletop rpg, thrown into an fps rpg format. it ends up being a genuinely very unique, emotional experience. the worldbuilding is second to none. the story is one of the best i've experienced in a game before. the gunplay, and even the most grindy sections of games lose me a bit usually, but there's genuinely something different here. it sets a new bar for most rpgs out there. triple a polish aside, there's genuinely a lot to love here. every time i come in for another playthrough, i see myself planning 3 more. it's very rare to find a game you want to replay as much as this. toying with all the endings, skill trees, weapons, i could go on. a little buggy, but only ever in a way i find funny, and forgive completely, especially given the general quality of the game. ps, watch edgerunners before you play!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"immersive world with great graphics and fun combat. sometimes they give you the illusion of choice when the outcomes will be similar or the same, but that is the only downside to the game that i have experienced. any bugs ive come across have been rare and comical. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,i like that it is adult oriented and always something new to keep it interesting.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,amazing graphics and environment must try once.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,i can't recommend this game enough. i know it had a terrible launch but i think cdpr have more than made up for it. as of update 2.2 this game is nothing short of a master piece.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,you finish the game first and then make new run with new path and download some mods to make the game more fun than it was 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"1010 probuably has some of the best endings i have ever seenik there is multiple just saying one of if not the saddest game i've played amazing graphics amazing and lovable characters just absolute peak if you are debating if you wanna buy this or not you shouldn't be,the answer is yes"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"probably now, one of the best games ever made, hats off to cd projekt, they seriously sorted this one out. was kinda hoping for some more dlc, but have to content myself with what i have, if you've not played it, then what ya waiting for?..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"after all the bugs and fixes and more bugs and fixes...it really is one of the best games out there, especially if you just wanna get lost in a futuristic setting or if you're sort of new to rpgs and really want to push your skills and knowledge on how to level up your character to your specific likingplaystyle. solid 910 story and backstory both in game and irl on how it came from tabletop to video game and 7.310 on actual gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"started playing after 2.0 heard it was abysmal at launch, but in it's current state, it lives up to the hype some stuff doesn't make sense, like how enemies just don't notice their ally screaming his lungs out in the nearby corner the story itself is really captivating, especially the multichoice ending overall the game is flawed, but that's what's fun about it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"took me a quite a long time to properly get into, but in the end it has become one of my favorite gaming experiences. i read everywhere that phantom liberty is something you should definitely add to this game and i didn't take that very seriously until i eventually bought it too. it's true. get it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,very fun good story havent had any bugs so far some crashes but not alot to the point its annoying also fairly easy to mod
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"this game is so fucking amazing, literally peak. , i re 100 this game 2 times. such a beautiful game. i love this game. just play and enjoy this world. peak game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,i bought this game not even expecting to finish it because of all the shit i'd heard about it but i've actually fallen in love with night city. i never had to experience this in its launch state but as of now this is by far one of the single best games of all time and i love every moment of playing it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"only game i cant get tired of. great story and characters, diverse build choices, amazing setting, tons of lore. literally 1010 game 135 hours in like 2 weeks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,one of my most memorable gaming experiences ever. i recently moved to pc gaming and was able to play it on 1440p on ultra settings at 100 fps and wow. it was not only superb to look at but combat was so smooth. its one of those where you get lost in the game and realise you've been playing for 6 hours. the dlc had such a memorable story which i connected with more than the base game's story. a must play especially if you can pick it up on sale
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"cdpr really did turn the game around. the world feels alive, the gameplay is great, the new dlc is great. the bugs still exist but few and far between. i recommend the game to anyone who likes the cyberpunk genre, rpgs or the fallout series as they are very similar."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"fun period., at first it was blah but i kept it and held hope and they fixed it. its a great game now 910 honest review"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,the most amazing lifelike characters. more human and natural than any game i've played.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"well worth it, very stable and looks incredible even at medium settings quests sometimes have tedious moments e.g., scanning stuff, but that's par the course for open world games like this. so much fun otherwise, highly recommended if you like character driven games"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,it's oblivion with guns and cyberware 1110 you will be immersed you will get lost and sidetracked doing gigs and missions you will fall in love with panam you will get killed by maxtac
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"amazing game, yes there is still some minor bugs but nothing serious, enjoyable game, fall in love with the story and night city !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"great game, i really enjoy the scenery and story line."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a sprawling, ambitious rpg set in the vibrant and chaotic night city. despite its rocky launch, the game has evolved into a deeply immersive experience with a rich story, complex characters, and a world full of possibilities. the story of v, a mercenary navigating the dangers of night city, is gripping and emotional, with multiple endings that reflect your choices throughout the game. the characters, especially johnny silverhand played by keanu reeves, are memorable and add depth to the narrative. the gameplay offers a mix of shooting, hacking, and stealth, with a wide range of weapons, cyberware, and skills to customize your playstyle. the open world is visually stunning, with neonlit streets, towering skyscrapers, and a level of detail that makes night city feel alive. pros  stunning world design with deep lore  engaging story and memorable characters  improved performance and mechanics after updates cons  ai and openworld interactions still feel limited  some rpg elements could be deeper rating 9.610  a flawed but immersive rpg thats worth exploring for its story and world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"it's breathtaking, chooms! cdpr killed it with the updates. 1010. if you have been waiting to play this masterpiece because of bugs and performance issues, mostly all of them have been resolved with patch 2.0. it's a much better experience now in 2025 than in 20202023. 90100 hrs for 100 base game  dlc  all endings experienced from manual saves. crashed 2 times in 150 hours. 1 soft lock out of mission where npc didnt spawn to trigger dialogue and further the quest. police spawns are much improved from pre 2.0 patch updates. no issues hitting 60fps consistently with native 1080p ultra on rtx 3060 with no rt."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"cyberpunk is one of those games that just nails it's atmosphere of what could be a not so distant future. the game is almost more about the city than the main character, which has kept me coming back and replaying it for years. worth a try for anyone even if you aren't a fan of 'futuristic' games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,so much fun! the story is excellent and the game play feels good and fluid. i will say the driving is meh though but still enjoyable. the guns are not your standard guns you find in every shooter and are so fun to use. i think one of its most unique features is the quickhack system. the characters are fleshed out and feel like they belong in night city and the lore is so cool and meaningful. i also love how they incorporated cyberpunk edgerunners into the game and how its canon as well. in fact your character v does talk about david martinez in a dialogue option.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"got into this game 45 years later, after it finally got fixed, it blew me away. massive world that sucks you in, a lot more objectives than in a shtty ubisoft game, and main thing is , all objectives have stories and they are not some generated bullshit. each was crafted with thought. you have general quests, side quests, gigs, ncpd hustles and there are ton of them. i spent 180 hours for single playthrough to 100 it. the best aspect of it all is story. writing and cinematography is on another fing level , this game fing nails it and keeps you invested. script is fine af. 11 cyberpsychos out of 10, would do it again and will for sure"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"while this game had a bit of rough launch, it is still a great game and absolutely worth playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,this game had a really rough start and while i think we should remember that and try to hold devs more accountable for the products they put out by showing we don't want to buy incomplete and buggy games. that being said once 2.0 came out with phantom liberty it felt like what it was meant to be in the first place and i have to give a lot of praise for cdpr for following through and not leaving this as a soulless and lacking title. 2.0 really changed my perspective on the games that i play and how i want to experience them. cyberpunk became the first game i ever 100 and it made me want to experience everything else i can from the really solid games out there. even now after i have completed every quest and side quest i find myself wanting to come back every now and then and force myself to play a new style and see how different the combat feels. after all is said and done i would give this game a 1010 with how dynamic the combat can be and how deep the story is. i find myself getting really immersed in the world and sometimes forget to eat when i am playing. it is a great game and i highly recommend it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,a good purchase and worth the wait of the patches after the issues i have heard in the past.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"ive played it since day one, would still have recommended it back then. at least on pc, was always a great game in my book. as its is now it is by far an all time great for both fans of the genre or just rpgs in general. if you can get the bundle on sale its a must buy. jump in and enjoy the game as it is for one or two play throughs. then i say get into modding the game, as it will give the game a whole new level of depth in many cases."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"one of the best singleplayer games to have come out in this age of gaming. even in 2025 with it competing against ue5 and all it's realism, it performs at a solid 70fps on my legion 5 wryzen 5600h using high settings. the story and characters are the reason i keep coming back, but even with all the content available, it's still super fun to drift around and flatline streetrats after 70hrs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"h1 thoughts h1 cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible experience. the main story and side quests are well written, interesting, rewarding and impactful to the story as a whole. nightcity is a beautiful and immersive city with a lot of things to do, you can randomly just stumble on someone doing something interesting. its my favorite citymap of all time. this game has amazing side characters that are interesting. its hard to find another game like this. h1 pros h1 amazing story with great writing across the whole game great combat and immersive gameplay amazing soundtracks beautiful world with a lot going on phantom liberty is a must have dlc side missions feel rewarding and worthwhile to do h1 cons h1 i did not like the driving. i felt that the cars oversteer and have no traction.you can make it better with settings fixer gigs felt boring and repetitive after doing all of them. h1 score h1 b 10  10 b"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"i've bought this game 3 times. one when it released, one when phantom liberty released and lastly on steam to be able to play it using geforce now. i can confidently say this is my favorite game of all time, i find myself completely out of words with how good everything is. phantom liberty must be one of the best stories in any game ever, having such good voice actors and the way the dlc interacts with the main story without being a totally different story line is amazing. everyone should play this game on the highest possible settings as it's beautiful too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"love this game, it's the best game i've played in my existence including mario kart double dash."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"i absolutely adore this game. it had a rough start, but even on launch dayweek i only experienced one actual gamebreaking bug, where a quest enemy teleported beneath the concrete and was unkillable. reloaded, and went through the rest of the game worry free. it was clunky and awkward at a lot of times, but the story, the atmosphere, and the immersion i felt exploring night city were uncontested. came back quite some time later, and the game was a significantly better experience. mods made a delight out of trying new things in the game's world, and i would hop onto the game sometimes just to explore and cruise. it's been years, probably since my high school days, since i've enjoyed logging into a game just to fool around. this game brought that feeling back to me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"great game, great story, looks amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,somehow managed to start my first playthrough of the base game and dlc at the end of 2024 and holy moly this is peak rpg
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,one of the most indepth environments i have ever seen be built in a game. story is amazing along with the show. combat it not to bad and you can do some cool stuff with the cyberware. unfortunate this game had a terrible launch because it is a master piece now. ive played thorugh like 7 times on console and got it on pc for mods. honestly one the best story games that has came out this past decade.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,i don't usually play firstperson shooting rpg but i am glad i made an exception for cyberpunk 2077. it was an immersive and enjoyable experience. i look forward to its sequel.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"this games had its ups and downs but it headed in a great direction. i had my fun with it, now im on to phantom liberty!!!! see ya chooms!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"good game all around, especially since the new updates came out. find my self coming back every month or couple weeks just for the environment of the game and atmosphere."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"fun game play, interesting story and world, beautiful graphics especially the effects. i like the flexibility of playing styles"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"it's worth the money. sure some of the lingo is cheesy, my choom, but it's a hell of a journey and it's worth checking out. phantom liberty has a great story line and it's awesome. get some preem chrome and get to work. those corps aren't going to zero themselves. i hope they make another one of these, because my god it's good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"preordered it when it came out in 2020 for my xbox one x. played it on day 1  had all the problems everyone was experiencing. never played it again up until about 2 weeks ago when i bought it off steam. best decision ever, amazing game it runs phenomenal on my pc. very good story  very good gameplay. 1010 recommend. can not believe i waited this long."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"absolutely amazing graphics, amazing story. some parts even made me cry. such a thriller."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"story is very good and compelling. it is the one thing that carries the game. my major issues usually involve the lack of action. the gaps between gameplay and dialogue are too long. while the story is intriguing and enjoyable at times, the drought of action pushes this game down for me. i would much rather the game have meaningful dialogue that is engaging and sparse rather than constant 5 minutes straight of direct dialogue with little to no action following it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"a masterpiece. tried it at launch in 2020 which had tons of bugs at the time. didn't touch it again until this year and it is a masterpiece, feature complete, and no noticeable bugs in my 86 hrs so far, and i'm not even half way through the main story am a completionist. love it! 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"depression simulator. one of the game that truly deserve being called nextgen. a piece of modern philosophical art and an art piece in itself terms of graphics, themes and soundtrack. i preordered this game and even at its launch with all the bugs and broken missions in the game, it had managed me capture my attention with its themes, setting and soundtrack. props to cd project red, never was a witcher fan but you caught my eye with this one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"number 1 game for me. loved every second of it. if it burned you on initial release like it did me with glitches, its been more than long enough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"honestly, this game was a dumpster fire on release. since then, however, it is clear that a ton of work has been put into it, and i am fully prepared to recommend this game. the setting and narrative is probably the most unique out of any game i have ever played. the lore and details hidden around the world are super compelling. overall, the story felt great to play through. definitely recommend. overall, i would give the story a 1010, and the rest of the gameplay a solid 8.510."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,fun gameplay exiting story sooo good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,this has to be the best game i have ever played. no modern game rivals this one and i genuinely hope project orion comes out because i don't know what else to do but play cyberpunk 2077.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,entertaining story and gameplay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"cyberpeak2077. this game truly had one of the best comebacks ever, its an amazing story, its gameplay is amazing and diverse, and the characters are incredible. still has bugs but nowhere near what it was when it first came out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"i rly like this game wish there was more to do but yeah, if you havent playd it u should, story is niceu. when it got released it was so ass tho but they fix the game over the years and so if you still havent playind it, its not that bad with buggs and sorts"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"i enjoyed the deep story line, the extremely detailed graphics, and the way that decisions influence events later in the story. i felt extremely sorry for songbird during the dlc. i found the way you could fully customize your build from being a netrunner all the way to a brute forcer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,even when you skip through all the story. the gunplay and combat is quite satisfactory.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"bought this game originally on xbox on release date and i can safely say this game definitely has made a comeback over the years! i have just beaten the phantom liberty dlc and am thoroughly impressed by the plot and story of the dlc! i still have yet to beat the main story in itself and still have so many more questsjobs to do at the time of this review. if you're ever thinking about picking this game back up since its horrendous launch, i highly recommend you do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"along with phantom liberty don't play with out it and 2.2 patch, zero glitchesran flawlessly on ryzen 7 and 4060 great graphicsstorygameplay my opinion, i put it right up there with witcher3, rdr2 and mass effect 2 finished the game, will put it down for a bit, but cant wait for a second play highly recommended"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"a truly monumental attempt from the devs, flawed and shaky at times, but the mere ambitions and the fact they never gave up to polish the game and to even try to do something like that deserves all the credit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,great story great game play. pick it up.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"not just a game, but an experience. a neondrenched, hightech future where every corner of night city pulses with life, danger, and endless possibilities. from the first moment, i was hooked. the beauty of cyberpunk 2077 lies in its ability to completely immerse the player in a futuristic dystopia. its like jumping straight into a blade runner dream. the city breathes and talksits citizens, its grime, its towering skyscrapers, and its hidden alleyways all whisper stories if you listen closely enough. you could spend hours just exploring, finding new locations, random encounters, or stumbling upon side quests that could easily stand alone as fullblown games. cyberpunk 2077 rewards curiosity with treasure troves of hidden lore and easter eggs, making each corner feel like an adventure waiting to unfold. even after completing the main storyline, the world of night city continues to offer up new discoveries, hidden mysteries, and cheeky details thatll keep you hooked long after the credits roll. whether you're hacking into a security system, racing through the city, or just soaking in the chaos, this game feels like there's always more to do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"200 hours in with two playthroughs first one back in 2020 at launch, second one just now with phantom liberty on version 2.2. it's incredible how much better the game looks and plays right now with the modifications they did to so many aspects, from burying cars to leveling your character. this now feels like the game they wanted to release back in 2020 and i even had a lot of fun back then. it's still a bit glitchy and the simulation has it's limits, but story, characters and the world kept pulling me back in. ...and then there is phantom liberty, which is a very well written and greatly acted spythriller with one of the best final confrontations out there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"223 hours in this game. though about 130 was in the 2.0 update. this game post 2.0 can only be described as amazing. 100ing the achievements in this game became more of entertainment than a grind. the rpg aspects give you different ways to play in both melee and ranged. from usual katanas and fists to riflesrevolvers to just being a netrunner menace each ending has its own unique spin to the point where none of them feel specifically canon in my opinion. all of them were very well written with something... lost. i would 100 recommend this game to anyone that wants to enjoy a rpg fps with a story. so many different ways to play, act, and end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"cyberpunk. where does one even start? get past the funky npcs and you will...simply be swallowed into it's whole reality. you feel like you're living a different life, literally. lucky i got it with two days free of work because...as embarrassed as i am to say it. i spent 36 out of the 48 hours on this game! fuck! the dlc alone could win an award. the amount of diverse utility, perks, and how they actively make attributes envolved will tickle your pickle. you cannot play cyberpunk one time. you can't soon as i finished it. straight away onto my second play through. i haven't even gotten to the different endings, play styles, shit you don't even know about until your second, maybe third play through there's a hidden free fucking bugati. anyways, buy cyberpunk so we can get another dlc pls pls pls xd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,went from a decent to great game with room to grow and become even better!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,enjoy playing the game  enjoy seeing bugs 247  worth story and expantion
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"the game left early access after 3 years of testing, but you can't blame them, they did release the game 57 years early. also, i recommend playing cyberpunk from 1 to 2076 to understand the story of cyberpunk 2077. 1010 would kill adam smasher again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"h1 cyberpunk 2077  a masterclass in storytelling with endings that sting h1 b the endings where your choices carve legacy b cyberpunk 2077 isnt just a gameits a kaleidoscope of consequences. the endings here arent mere cutscenes theyre emotional gutpunches that linger long after the credits roll. without spoiling specifics, the finale forces you to weigh loyalty, survival, and humanity in ways that feel agonizingly real. whether you side with a snarky rockerboy, a disillusioned exec, or forge your own path, each conclusion is a narrative triumph. the epilogue, shaped by your bonds and decisions, isnt just an endingits a reckoning. some routes left me breathless, others heartbroken, but all felt earned. rarely has a game made me feel the weight of free will like this. b bonds that transcend the glittering neon b the true soul of night city lies in its characters. v isnt just a merc with a chip theyre a mirror reflecting the relationships you nurture. johnny silverhands arc is a rollercoaster of defiance and vulnerability, while allies like panam, rogue, and judy offer connections that feel achingly human amid the cybernetic chaos. conversations over beers at the afterlife or quiet moments in a dusty desert cabin arent just fillertheyre the glue that makes the climax hit so hard. betrayals hurt. sacrifices haunt. and the game doesnt shy from letting you ruin friendships or forge unbreakable bonds, often in the same playthrough. b a city reborn b post2.0, night city finally lives up to its potential. the combat is smoother, the streets feel alive, and the side gigs especially the stellar phantom liberty dlc add layers to the world and its inhabitants. glitches are rare, and the visual overhaul makes every neonsoaked alleyway a feast for the eyes. h3b final thoughts b cyberpunk 2077 isnt perfectload times and occasional jank remainbut its heart is pure gold. if you crave a story where endings matter and characters feel like friends or foes for life, dive in. just brace yourself this is a tale where love, loss, and the price of ambition collide in unforgettable ways. play it. then play it again. each run feels like a new story waiting to scar you. h3"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"cyberpunk 2077 a breathtaking dive into dystopia  cd projekt red has truly outdone themselves with cyberpunk 2077. this game is more than just a piece of entertainmentit's an artistic masterpiece. night city is alive, immersive, and buzzing with possibilities. the attention to detail is insane, from the neonsoaked streets to the jawdropping panoramas of this futuristic world. every npc feels like they have a story to tell, making night city one of the most authentic openworld environments i've ever seen. the narrative is a work of genius. vs story, combined with keanu reeves unforgettable performance as johnny silverhand, pulls you in emotionally and wont let go. the freedom in character builds and decisionmaking makes every playthrough uniquely yours, and the consequences of your choices often left me reflecting long after i turned off the screen. on top of all that, the games audio design, soundtrack, and visuals are an absolute feast for the senses. if you're a fan of epic rpgs and jawdropping worlds that redefine immersion, cyberpunk 2077 is a mustplay. there were some hiccups at launch, but the incredible updates since then have truly elevated the experience to the masterpiece it was destined to be. cyberpunk 2077 isnt just a gameits an unforgettable adventure. bravo, cdpr."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"phone call bug, really disgusting for a game that is 4 years old..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,the game is crashing before making it past the loading screen. all drivers are up to date. requested a refund.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"badly optimized, keeps crashing my entire pc on the loading screen and i have the latest drivers and lowest settings enabled on a high end pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"so i want to start this off by saying i was one of those people that thought this game was so broken and buggy at launch that it was not worth keeping and got a refund for the game. i told myself if it even got fixed and had a really good sale i would pick it back up. it never really seemed to go on a heavy enough discount for me to bother looking at it. then the dlc came out. i was actually offended that cd projekt red had the balls to release a paid dlc for this title. it seemed greedy and out of touch after they released such a broken game and how they treated their employees. well i finally broke down and bought the game and the dlc and. . . it's still one of the buggiest, unpolished, and broken game i've ever played. but man is the story and characters second to none against the witcher cast. when you talk to characters it feels organic. talk to them poorly and they may never start talking hostile towards you. tell someone a secret that you promised to never tell and they may cut you off and never talk to you again. these characters feel alive and unique. and it really makes everything else worth while. when a certain npc died i actually teared up. and later was able to attend his funeral. and further more you were able to call them on the phone and leave a voice mail because you desperately still wanted to talk to them. moments like these are all through the game and it's really a standard we should be expecting from aaa games. but, like i mentioned this game is unquestionably buggy and broken still after update 2.1. there were multiple times where a boss would just become invincible out of no where and i had to either die or load an earlier save and hope it didn't happen again. i've watched npcs fall through the ground, straight up disappear, or glitch out. there was a mission where a certain npc would spawn with a weapon blue print. i cleared the area of enemies and they were no where to be found. i watched a video a couple of times and they just never spawned. i loaded an older save and thankfully they spawned this time. but who knows how many times this might have happened and i didn't know it happened. on my first playthrough i went with a sneaky sniper type character that used quick hacks. the game really doesn't work as a stealth game. some scenarios and areas seem to be tailor made for it, while others are setup to be gun shoot outs and you really don't have a choice but to go in guns blazing. so it really takes you out of the game when that happens. but i did really enjoy quick hacks. but they are broken as heck and really do make you over powered once you start getting the higher level ones and unlock more ram. my second playthrough i going for a gorilla arms shotgun build so i'm hoping the combat is alot more fun the second time around. if i think it is i'll add to this review to confirm that. otherwise. . .assume i think combat is still dull and meh. i don't want to end this on a negative note, because i do enjoy this game. and another major reason for that is the lore and world building. if you take the time to learn the lore of this universe it gets so much more interesting. trauma team is bunch of gun weilding medics that only help people that have the money to afford them. maxtac is an elite group of police members that are former cyberpsychos going out to stop current cyberpsychpos. adam smasher is a man that has continuously upgraded himself to the point that he is roughly 6 human 94 robot. and i could go on and on. point being if you invest time into the world it is very flushed out. characters are not skin deep. and the world is very lore rich. . .and very messed up. and that captivates me. so tldr if you want the most unique and master level gameplay of all time. . .look else where. but if you want to get lost in a very story driven and well executed story then this is a must play. but only on sale. because this game is still buggy beyond belief."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"voice acting from either main character is pretty awful, writing in the dlc is atrocious. game's cool tho"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,2077 updates. replayable after 5 years.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"i love this game. got 16 hours in and got to wakako mission. spent another 76 hours leveling up my character and completing all gigs, side missions and ncpd scanner hustles. finally finished the story today and i have started my second playthrough. welovecyberpunk2077"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"it's a polished turd, essentially. good for a bit of fun, but don't expect anything special. the gunplay and movement are the best parts of the game for me, but that was about all that stood out. the story felt like a lot of wasted potential, especially when some missions are literally just go to place and talk to person. even the final mission of the game after the heist was drive a little, then watch a cutscene. there's so much downtime and npc jabbering in missions it feels like you're only playing for about half the game. thank god for the skip button. i wouldn't mind the constant talking back and forth if the dialogue choices were impactful or interesting see sneering imperialist, terrifying presence, etc, and if your character actually spoke words that matched up with the dialogue prompts. several times, i picked a dialogue option and my character said something that felt like a complete 180 from what i had intended. sometimes, the only two options were two different ways to say the same thing, and the player isn't actually given any choice at all. it's especially annoying at the start of the game, where you're allowed to choose between roleplaying as whiny bitch or crybaby. aren't i supposed to be a hardened criminal?? that part of it gets better by the end of the game, at least. i guess what i'm trying to say is that it feels more like an interactive movie than an rpg. the character of v is its own entity, and the player's just along for the ride. the last thing that's more of a nitpick was the relationship side of things. i remember playing gtaiv and being blown away with the fact that npcs actually got mad if you blew them off for bowling or whatever. 12 years later, and cyberpunk can't pull that off. the whole game just felt like a bit of a letdown. if you want a killer story or actually good dialogue choices, there are far older games that have done those things much better, and had less bugs to boot. the juice on this one is just baaaaarely worth the squeeze, so get it on sale if you can."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i had high expectations going into cyberpunk and boyohboy was it disappointing. i honestly couldn't wait for the game to end. there was so much dialogue that i found myself getting bored, i was just following characters from point a to point b then standing there for 5 minutes as they talked my ear off. it felt like there were very few decisions that actually mattered throughout the game, the action was disappointing, no fights were even close to challenging, just alot of grunts running around, and when i did get in a boss fight it was easy to dodge all their attacks and take them down quickly. i wanted to like this game so badly but every time i thought it was getting better it immediately took a turn for the worse. on a lighter note, i did run into some minor bugs throughout the game but nothing groundbreaking so it is nice to see that the devs fixed up alot of the tech issues that were present at launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"visually beautiful with game mechanics to suit different play styles, cyberpunk 2077 satisfies my openworld needs with a city full of activity. the main quest is disappointingly short, but the side quests support the story line, allowing for leveling and achievement along the way. hardboiled and dystopian, the setting is fitting for the times as we descend into corruption and oligarchy irl. game patches have added a lot since release. i'm grateful for the dlc and hope to see more soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"if we can compare it to something similar to likes of gta5 much better storyline, much better graphics, the environment and character development is also much better. minor downsides no multiplayer  this would have been insanely fun. sometimes you still see a weird bug or two but nothing terrible or game breaking."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i just finished this game, and i have a lot of thoughts. im going to start as spoilerfree as i can, and break it up into sections, each section getting more spoiler filled as this goes. that way, people who wish to complete the game themselves can stop where they want.  overall 910, among the best games ive played. the good if this game seeks to be an homage to cyberpunk genre, it succeeds with flying colors. the people who made this game read a lot of books, watched a lot of films and anime, and played a lot of tabletop and video games. the story and characters are compelling, and the amount of emotional investment this game drew out of me surprises me enough to feel the need to write about it. the bad i didnt play this game when it came out because it was unfinished and buggy as shit and very hard on hardware. a few years after release, i figured the gaming rig i built a little over a year ago shouldnt have much of a problem. played for a couple weeks on mid settings with air blowing out of my machine hotter than the air from my furnace vents. my cpu is liquid cooled and my gpu has a pair of giant fans on it, so the ssd positioned between the two with a simple heatsink on it became the weak link and cooked. some new hardware and a fresh windows install later i completed the game on low settings. the ugly the cyberpunk genre started in the early 1980s, with william gibsons neuromancer in 1984 usually being held as the first or the archetype. the problem is, a lot of the tropes of the genre are rooted in the stereotypes of the era, and i dont know if thats a thing it can grow out of. japanese characters are either wealthy corporate elites or cyborg ninjas talking about bushido. caribbean characters are all associated with either voodoo or rastafarianism. black and latino characters are mostly associated with gangs. still, despite this, this game and most works of the genre are very obviously prodiversity and anticapitalist. wrapped up with a consumerfriendly price tag. minor spoilers gameplay the simplest summery i can give of this game is vampire the masquerade bloodlines crossed with a grand theft auto game. if youve played mass effect, skyrim, or fallout this gameplay will feel pretty familiar. im a huge fan of vtmb, played through it numerous times. i get a strong urge to play through it on occasion, and this game really scratched that itch. the stealth gameplay aided by cyberware and hacking feels a lot like the stealth gameplay aided by vampire powers. so do the npcs, from the morally gray to the quirky to the tragic. so does the dark urban grime of the maps and textures. in fact, some parts of some locations almost feel like they were lifted right from that older game, as do some of the missions. which is fine by me, like i said, it scratched an itch. the gta side of the gameplay im less impressed with. never really got into those games, and the car side of this game feels like a lesser version of that. youll get offers to buy cars with silly price tags throughout the game, but youll be handed multiple much better vehicles from the storyline and side quests. a motorcycle or two you can get very early are better for moving through the city than any of the fancy cars you get. the quick travel mass transit system combined with running and jumping and climbing for some free athletics skill xp make the vehicles feel almost redundant and useless. how much better the motorcycles are than the cars combined with the parkourability of the terrain make me think bicycles and skateboards would be ideal for this game and are a missed opportunity. snow crash and virtual light give us plenty of precedent for cyberpunk skateboards and bikes. if this game was a bit less gta and a bit more tony hawk, itd be 1010, even with its other flaws. medium spoilers story the overall story parallels neuromancer hacker thief gets some fancy tech in their head that comes with a ticking time bomb and a complicated partnership with an a.i. do some jobs to fix the problem. cool cyber heist stories ensue. oh, and keanu reeves plays a dead rockstar that thinks hes a revolutionary. fun part, but i wont pretend its his finest work. a few times you can tell he was reading lines in an empty room in front of greenscreen with mocap stuff on, and no director willing to tell him to do it again but better. still, his presence alone is a huge callback to all the ways hes contributed to the genre. honestly, the side quests are more fun than the main story quests, especially after you get enough levels and gear to start to feel powerful. whether you want to play as a stealthy thief, a bulletproof gun for hire with a wide variety of guns, an inhumanly fast cyborg ninja with blades coming out of everywhere, or some mix of the above the power fantasy is achievable. there are also enough nonlethal options in the game that i assume a full pacifist playthrough is achievable and might be worth trying. the side quests really give you the most opportunity to flex that power and feel like a superhero. the main storyline quests get heavy and emotional. the story touches on poverty, addiction, depression, displaced peoples, and the exploitative sex industry. most of the characters you meet dont have happy endings, and sometimes the game feels more like an art piece on capitalism that makes you think and feel more than a fun video game that you want to relax and have fun with. nasty spoilers endings on my first playthrough, i played my characters as a selfinsert for most decisions. so almost entirely good game choices, but not pacifist. i chose the nomads assistance for the final conflict, got a bittersweet ending. chose myself over johnny. after crying over the ending, i loaded an earlier save and chose johnny over myself and got a different bittersweet ending that was a bit less sweet and a bit more bitter. i have playthrough started making mostly evil choices to see what those ending options are like. im also tempted to try to start again and trying to see if going pure pacifist is possible and impacts the ending options. or maybe ill just check wikis and forums and youtube to see what the actual possibilities are. theres a part of me that longs for a happy ending, but im afraid bittersweet is as good as it gets. its the nature of the genre. happy endings might not be possible in that stage of capitalist decay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"cyberpunk 2077  pra mim o maior exemplo de como algum nesse caso, uma equipe pode transformar um projeto apressado e pouco polido em uma experincia inovadora e algo que realmente vale a pena experimentar. eu acompanhei toda a situao do lanamento e fiquei triste porque todas as ideias, os temas, as nuances de uma histria como essa sempre estiveram ali desde o incio, mas foram concretizadas de forma porca e acabou ficando a sensao de que a cdpr queria comer uma colher maior que a boca. phantom liberty e o update que veio com a dlc consertaram praticamente todos esses problemas, e  nessa verso consertada que eu baseio minhas opinies, porque foi a que joguei. e sobre ela, eu no vejo como poderia ter sido melhor. a histria  extraordinariamente densa e eu to aqui escrevendo isso logo depois de ter terminado a minha primeira jogatina e j pensando em qual tipo de personagem eu vou criar da prxima vez que eu jogar  o que, devo admitir, vai demorar um pouco. o ponto  que faz duas semanas que eu no penso em nada que no seja cyberpunk, desde o jogo que eu t analisando aqui at o restante da histria apresentada pelo rpg de mesa.  um universo que eu imagino que  muito representado pelo jogo que ns temos agora, e eu t muito ansioso pra ver o que a cdpr t preparando pra gente numa possvel sequncia. tiveram uns bugs sim  claro mas todos eles foram hilrios e eu no consigo criticar o jogo por isso. no tem nada mais engraado que vc chamar sua picape e ela aparecer pulando na sua frente porque a fsica dos pneus no foram bem planejadas"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"a solid 910. it would be 1010, but the botched release and eh combat bring it down a point for me. the effort put into is really impressive, and with mods you can tailor it to be to your preference. encounters are thought out very well there's always multiple solutions. strictly speaking, you don't have to kill almost anyone since nonlethal options are available. plus, there's plenty of ways to role play. chrome tf up choom'. install the realistic damage mod for an adrenaline rushing, balls to the walls crazy shooter experience. wait for a sale, this game is too old to be 60 imo, but i get where the devs are coming from. games huge. also a great game for freaks of many kinds. i know what you are."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"b don't be a gonk and download this game choomba. b b detes b i loved every second i spent in night city, enough to accumulate 105 hours in 3 weeks, enough to 100 the game without ever regretting it. the game is nowhere near perfect. it's significantly less buggy than release, but still worse than most other aaa games of this sort. the acting from the characters is pretty jarring at times, especially johnny silverhand who delivers every single line with the exact same intonation i don't know if this was a deliberate choice, or a technical limitation of the mocap they used on reeves, but i do know that it sticks out like a sore thumb. the story wasn't preem by any means either, it has its highs and lows, and some parts feel very rushed where i think they could have given certain characters more time to develop, but that might just be me craving for more. because despite all of its flaws, i don't remember the last time i loved a singleplayer game this much. b in regards to phantom liberty pl b this is the only major expansion to cyberpunk it's been confirmed there won't be another coming, and it adds an additional main storyline to follow, a bunch of new side jobs and gigs, as well an entirely new section of the map called dogtown that you can explore within which most of the dlc takes place. they advertise the main story as a spy thriller but what that means basically is that there's a bunch of different characters with different views, and you have to decide who to trust. obviously with this comes a whole bunch of endings. in fact, the dlc has as many endings as the main game maybe even more depending on how you count them. however, i don't think it's the main story where pl shines, but the gigs and jobs that come with it. you can tell cdpr took everything they learned from making dozens of gigs and jobs for the main game, and applied it all into every gig and job in pl. the main fixer added in pl is mr. hands who always existed in the main game, but gets promoted to have a major role in the dlc, and every single gig by mr. hands feels like it could be 3 base game gigs in one. and don't even get me started on the side jobs given by him, all of them with different possible outcomes depending on your choices, all of which have actual longlasting consequences beyond just a holocall where someone tell you to go fuck yourself. honestly pl might be worth it just for mr. hands."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"sadly still very bug ridden, immense amounts of invisible walls and other limitations. weaknesses at scripting quests that often make no sense or react badly to your actions. general yank seems like betatesting was seriously lacking  at release and to this day. if you think you can remember to save frequently  as there will be yank killing you occasionally  you will have a blast tho. every other part of the game is incredible. music, visuals, fighting. shooting, athmosphere are unbelievably good. it is a work of art  an incredible shame they did not make it perfect with a little polish no pun here, move along."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"hah! this game is pathetically linear sensationalist rubbish. boring eye candy designed for overly excitable children and adults the same. mooom look at the shiny things!!! mooom come on, you're not looking mooom!!!! the story so far is an interactive movie where choices wont matter, shoot the people chasing or not? it doesn't matter, the cut scene will take them out. stealth or loud? doesn't matter, you'll be bottle necked into the same cut scene all the same. control of the game is taken away from you constantly, then returned at the point where you can press efw for a second so it can progress the cutscene, rarely actually free movement. when you do get free movement, it's generally wait for this person to talk and as we move 10 metres to the rally point. dialog? press the yellow option as blue is just filler text. the open world is fake, everything that should feel alive is closed and abandoned, shops empty. cops are two to three line of sight blocks away from losing your tail. and insanely reckless in a firefight, always getting themselves killed. civilians screech and run around then huddle in stupid groups waiting to get shot. worst game i've played in three decades. couldn't even get a refund, thankfully on sale, so not too bad of a loss."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"the secondbiggest comeback in gaming history. big expectations, countless promises, crunch, and, of course, a massive failure at launchsound familiar? but honestly, its crazy how alive the world of cyberpunk 2077 feels. bright neon lights, rainsoaked alleys, and the diverse districts of night cityits just stunning. the story is also held to a really high standard, with choices that actually matter to you as a player. my one issue? the combatespecially the guns. they feel kinda like borderlands weapons, but worse, sometimes just so unsatisfying. but hey, at the end of the day, its still the best cyberpunk game on the market. if youre a fan of the genre, go play it right now. or maybe you just watched the anime and went crazy over it, lmao."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"what. a. ride. i waited until i got every achievement to write this review, got a lot of closure doing it. i played cyberpunk 2077 when it was first released, i know it wasn't a smooth launch but i was still able to play the game enough to immerse myself in the future dystopian city where technological augmentations are widely used by a lot of people. i often chose to drive to every destination instead of fast travelling because i loved cruising the city in my rayfield caliburn. i revisited the game long after phantom liberty came out, and hopefully without giving away too much of a spoiler, i would say i saw the name phantom liberty, i didn't read it to understand there are still no happy every after endings in the game. but the whole journey is so well written, it had me fully invested to find the other endings. it was an emotional roller coaster, a young merc with high ambitions to fame and glory, ends up fighting tooth and nail everyday just to survive. well written characters and amazing plot, i really do recommend this to anyone who would love a great story in a chaotic, futuristic universe."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"still an insane buggy mess lacking polish. idk what game everyone else is playing but this is no mans sky still. everyone says it's fixed, it's not. so many little things that pull you out of the immersion, so many still missing features. it kind of feels like star citizen in terms of the level of polish atm. lots of pretty stuff but none of it works well without jank. i took a screenshot of keanu reeves and now my game literally cannot open after it crashed and i rebooted and reinstalled."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i was struggling with the rating for this game a bit. while i mostly enjoyed my stay in night and dog city, there was also some annoying points, even though i only started to play after patch 2.2. the world looks nice in cyberpunk 2077 and the voice actors are great, but the story is only solid average. so many side quest didn't fit well in the idea of v struggling to survive and finding a solution. quest like somewhat damaged were forcing you in a completely different mechanic, or sinnerman taking away your choice of story development by changing factors, how cars normally acts or how strong the cop is, so that your client has to die. the game also didn't respect much the time of the player with over exposure of story parts, hours of chat with few gameplay inbetween to just finish a quest. something i noticed while playing all the endings, was that only during those end cutscenes, i would finally see the v i created. this short moment gave me way more immersion than the hundred hours of ego perspective. a shame this was not used more. considering the pure cyberpunk experience, i think deus ex human revolution did it better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"its supposed to be good now and is in a playable state, but despite being an impressive visual achievement and interesting world, its let down by clunky controls, sluggishbuthitsyouhard combat and a railroad storyline which is still holding your hand 20hrs in. some issues with infinite cops and things appearingdisppearing still exist making it feel like its being drawn by ai. not recommended unless highly discounted because i'd be amazed if you played to the end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"this is a linear mess disguised as an rpg  open world made for a casual audience. i don't recommend it at all for those who are looking for a fnw type of experience, which was my expectation. it could be a whole hour of cinematic instead of gameplay, and nothing would change in my experience. i don't think what makes an enjoyable game is not having a choice in what you interact with. a story character just asked me to partner with him, and the only dialogue option i had was yeah, let's partner up. why do i have this option in my ui if i don't have any other choices? also was the case with every choice up to that point. this dumbdown narrative mentality is downright dull and insufficient for me to continue playing, and tells much about the design choices behind the whole thing, no matter what happens next."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,game crashed and deleted 5 hours of gameplay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i've tried playing this game 3 times now, but i just can't. too many cutscenes and too little gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"excellent game, excellent dlc, changed the gaming scene forever and ruined my vocabulary for good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,terrible. couldn't even boot the game up after trying everything in the book to solve it. kept getting the whoa! cyberpunk 2077 has flatlined nothing and the internet helped. terrible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"gun play mechanics were exellent, had gta 3 vibe with to short of story kinda boring makes you fall asleep alot good graphics pick female character"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"after all this time the game still has glitches. its also more like a choose your on adventure movie, rather than a game. you move the character to the next conversation and the story progresses, if you can follow all of it with the side quests. its too bad because whats there is beautiful. its just not interactive, so it becomes one big blur. the driving isn't tight. the shooting is meh when you do get to shoot. the cops are everywhere, so you cant do steal a car with out being chased. you dont feel like upgrading your character because its overwhelming and to be truthful, fruitless. there isn't enough combat to care, or see a difference. a good old gun will do the job, just shoot everyone. its also hard to figure out which weapons are better than others. they need to be simpler like boarder lands or diablo. there is just too much detail and not enough fun. i keep deleting it and reloading it, cause i want it to get better and be fun. it just isn't. and again, there are still a lot of glitches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"this game has a launcher. unforgivable, for the year 2025."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,the state of this game on launch after waiting since the original trailer pissed me off so much i lost confidence in the company as a whole and havent played since
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"feels like playing a very heavily modded game, on a bad computer"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"it crashed 3 times in less than 45 minutes, even updating drivers and lowering graphic settings"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,incredible world great story terrible ui horrible gunplay bad ai
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game was so good and fun and i loved the story! having johnny with me and slowly knowing more and liking him more was great. very sad about jackie's death, then seeing whats left of him in the soul killer thing, really had me thinking he was still there for a second until i realized it was just recordings of what he's said before. i loved each of the characters. crazy how the first few hours of the game with jackie influences you so much, he didn't have a lot of screen time yet you were always thinking of him throughout the game, because he was your one real friend. johnny was a dick for a good while until he accepted what was going to happen and started warming up to v. i'm about to replay it now!!! very great game! i recommend it for sure!!!! my first playthrough was with the streetkid past or what ever"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"this game is alot like donald trump. many love it and many hate it, started off a little rocky, no one thought it would ever happen, and when we finally got it wasn't all we were promised!!!  now, the thing we can all agree on is that 2.0 changed things and now we're living large with a fat anime and a legendary dlc possible third presidency? it's writing wrongs and pissing off the established gaming industry. best of all? it's a fuck you to woke devs. just like trump"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"too buggy to play. recuring reported issue of not being able to open the 1st door with hacking. company refuses to fix.  keybinding also bad, even indie devs can handle key binding. this is unaccepable in a aaa. would not be surprised if the keybinding is the issue the hack will no work.  also never tell the users they need to reinstall, remove all their mods, etc instead of fixing your bug. that is blaming the victim."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i just bough this in 2025 and i didn't like it much. to start, the characters try too hard to be cool, they don't feel real whatsoever, way too many cliches. second, it's still buggy as hell tposes, missing limbs, flying cacti, just a mess. i could maybe get over these two big flaws, but the last thing that completely took me out of the game is the montage. as much as i wasn't in love with v and the big mexican guy, i like that we start away from night city, a smuggling goes wrong, we bond and now we need to find a buyer for the iguana, find some money, a place to stay, all that nice stuff to get you immersed in night city. but no i am served with a buggy montage that instead of making me experience the creation of the bond between v and the other dude, it tells me we're good friends and we went trough some sketchy situations. wtf? the most amazing thing about arriving to a new place in real life or in fiction is that you get to evolve your perception from it being unfamiliar, all the way to be familiar. in cyberpunk 2077, night city and its characters become familiar for v but not for the player. we are told about things instead of experiencing them, we are told we are now familiar with night city and we're ready to pursue a much bigger quest that i have no interest and i'm not invested in pursuing. not for me"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"i do not enjoy this game. i think the combat is mid beyond repair and the only save and grace for this game is that it has a pretty good story. aside from that, almost everything else is so lackluster. weapons are not fun to use, ai sucks and every fight feels the same and uninvolved"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,i like the variety of choices and pathways available. real good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,better than release from what ive heard. fuck this game is good. made me a true master baiter when i baited all those men with female v tho
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i was permanently blocked bc i said this game doesn't have toggle aim sight down! do we need caps lock on the keyboard? yes, we need caps lock the same like we need aim sight down! where is a reason to use two buttons to shoot? why not three buttons or fourth to shoot? yes, press aim, next press the safety button, next shoot  wow so stupid!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"in my opinion, cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best openworld rpgs. gameplay 1010 graphics 1010 storyline 910 music 910 characters 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"unfortunately, this game lives in my brain. it's okay, i guess. i plan to put another 200 hours in it, maybe more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this is a solid game and i'm a bit disappointed in myself for not purchasing sooner. has a scifi gta vibe to it with better weapons in my opinion. solid graphics and scenery. very fun game with open world.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"game was shite on launch, was a very barebones and weak rpg that was a buggy unoptimised mess, with some of the open world systems in that felt like they were worse than even the gta games of 20 years ago... but as of phantom liberty has become one of the best modern rpgs in the genre imo. still not flawless, in the 2 playthroughs i have done since phantom liberties release i still got a fair share of annoying bugs for example, playing as an overclock netrunner, overclock was causing me to constantly decay hp and not regenerate ram forever once it ended unless i reloaded my save, also annoying issues where i could not call my vehicle or access my stash without reloading the gamesave, as well as alot of funnyharmless ones, vehicles clipping through the floor, cars getting sent flying randomly, upon calling my vehicle it spawned in the sky and dropped down, exploding on landing... , and performance can still be shaky and thats on atop end pc at times, but despite that has cemented itself as a great rpg with a super engaging story. it throws plenty of curveballs in terms of story and also the gameplay, the playthrough that made me want to write this review, i sided with reed at the end of the dlc for the first time, and was not prepared for that final mission turning into a horror game akin to alien isolationsoma at all... phantom liberty feels like a dlc from a different era, 15 years ago, when we still got good, content filled gameplay addons that had a ton of effort put into it as of writing this review, its on sale at 35 for the ultimate addition, and like the witcher 3 is an absolute steal at that price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"as a single guy who is 56 years old, i play this game every day. i'm on my third play through and i still find things i haven't seen before. there is so much to do, if you get tired of making night city a better place, you can race around the city , explore the cities, cause chaos , see how many waves of police and maxtac you can destroy. iv'e laughed so much playing this game. also had some sad times. if cdpr came out with a new game like this i would buy it. this is a great game. i do wish there was more interaction with the npc's just for more laughs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"my computer sounded like an airplane engine while playing, but it was very much worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,once you get into the mindset and relize your just playing gta but in the future it's 100 times more fun
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"best game iv'e ever played. yes, it had a rough start, but they brought it back and it deserves more atension as it is the most history rich and unique game i know."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,nothing to do with the gsme but i just laid a perfect log like a 1 in a 100 shit. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"i bought this after all the initial stuff died down, and when i tell you ive never gotten lost this much in a game i mean it. legit scared to play for risk of losing myself in this game again. started calling all my friends choom"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,3 days and 13 hours in. the game in 2025 lives up to the hype. very good story. action when you want it and the world is just huge and detailed. very lively. i am not a huge fps fan but enjoy games like falloutnv and this has a lot of elements like that one. no regrets buy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,updates made it very good nothing like release its amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"as per usual for cd projekt red games, slow at the start, but gets better the more you play it. yet another masterpiece under their belt."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,fun game and with a person creating a mod for cyberpunk for multiplayer called cybermp from what i could gather its suppose to be like fivem and redm so hopefully someone will create the interrior designs for the ncpd precincts.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"400 hours into game. still playing. great game now. recommends trying out mods as well, a tone to choose from."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"yo fun dude woo hoo....good everything,and glad i waited for this awesome game to be debugged,and modded up lets rock sad time, fun time,thank god theres no online the hackers would be all over it man."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,grreat gameplaz storz is amaying and fck zea it's great
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"as someone who liked this game on release i can say that it is the best entry into the cyberpunk genre that, i think, exists. the story is outstanding, visuals immaculate, and music incredible. please just play it if you haven't."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"contra la luna plays, unsheathes byakko, goes into overclock mode this game is fucking cinema"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"one of the most thought out, well put together games i've ever played in my life, preem af choomba. changed the game on fps  rpg genres. nothing will ever be the same. nova killer app."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"short review i have 400 hours in this game. got an adhd diagnosis after. judy is so perfect that men can't romance her. 2010 after consuming medication review with a concerning, wonderful 400 hours invested into cyberpunk 2077, i can attest to the game's incredible immersion despite its rather silly vehicle suspension yes, it has permanently altered my forza gameplay. the game critics were right night city is the game's greatest character. however, make no mistake, the talent idris elba and keanu reeves' bring to their castings create enthralling, human, and loveable antiheroes who reinforce cyberpunk 2077's ultimate goal to tell you a story, a persective.  gameplay plentiful, diverse sets of weaponry andor playstyles! machine gun, katana, neurons, or dildo! ninjalike, or the classic, allamerican aggression it's all up to you! cybernetic enhancements and implants are certainly impactful when deciding your weapon or playstyle of choice, and they can genuinely make the main story line either an absolute pain or breeze when attempting to achieve a certain ending or conclusion.  graphics seeing as the game's worldbuilding is incredibly well loved and received, having a card or pc that can handle great graphics only makes the game better. looks great, and makes playing in it even better.  mods and customization plenty of mods are available, relatively easy to install with a simple youtube video, and vanilla customization options from facial cybernetics, to the initial limited clothing collection, to the expanding car collection has dramatically improved with the 2.21 patch.  bugs and glitches recently, i find little to no bugs or glitches aside from an occassional side quest loading poorly or so. nothing that a save file reload can't fix.  storyline simply put, cyberpunk's dramatization of latestage capitalism implicitly reflects a growing disparity between the rich and poor. in a world where you are helpless to the circumstances you cannot control, you must navigate a world where everything feels arbitrary whilst recognizing that you have nothing to lose.  phantom liberty provides much more incredibly indepth side quests, and its own content is worth the depression and hundreds of hours you'll be pouring into it. if you'll be buying cyberpunk, i highly recommend purchasing the dlc! personally, i'd recommend playing the original storyline first, before going for another run from start to finish with phantom liberty just gives you the feel that everything just keeps gettin better! but if you're not as jobless, play the phantom liberty storyline alongside it. no spoilers! perhaps, you have lost a place, a person, a time, or a life. perhaps, you spend your nights dreaming of becoming a hero to someone you may question the inevitability of death, the futility of your actions, or your capacity to impact the world around you. perhaps, you would like to explore the extent in which you can care for someone, anyone even a stranger. well nows the chance to shoot a gun at it! as the beloved johnny silverhand says, worst thing you can do to a human  rip their identity out of 'em. that's all i know.. well, i can assure you if you look just right, you'll discover that you can never be invisible in night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"there is a ton of lore to wrap your head around right away, and the game seems deep and has a lot of to offer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,game has come along way. i've been here since the beginning. one of the best rpg's i've played in its now solid state.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"this is probably my favorite game of all time. how exactly cdpr crafted a world that lives and breathes as much as its characters is beyond me. night city is the ultimate american hellhole and serves as a grim warning of a world to come if corporations and corruption aren't reigned in. this is one of if not keanu reeves' best role, his endless war against arasaka and corporate exploitation is an idea that many people find relatable. 2077's characters and world waste no time in fully immersing the player in the dark future, the politics, relationships, and everyday life of mike pondsmith's dark future are fully realized and expressed through storytelling and worldbuilding. this is the only rpg i've played where i feel truly free within the confines of the game, free to decide and free to choose my own path. the characters feel as real as is possible for a video game, their stories are well crafted and bring the weight of your choice into account which brings weight to every dialogue choice. i have played this game at least seven times over and i'm still getting dialogue and quest paths that i've never experienced before. i've played many rpgsstorydriven games in my time, but none of them have kept me as enveloped and entranced as cyberpunk 2077. bravo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"a very immersive world, would suck you in and you forgot you've played it for 100 hours. story telling is superb."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"elite graphics elite gameplay, unique abilities and skill tree fun ass gam"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,it works now and is the best open world game ive ever played
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"a very beautiful game with a deep storyline that makes you think if you betray your principles, you lose yourself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,this game is fully immersive and beautiful. also it made me cry. 1010 in my book.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"rocky launch, but probably the most fun game i've played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"played it at launch on xbox, was very disappointed that the game wasn't ready. came back to try again and it's fabulous, so polished, city feels alive, fantastic. lots of fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"fun open world rpg set in a city setting, different than skyrim or fallout in a way. gameplay seems polished, and fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"drive like a maniac on coke through the streets of night city, while listening to some tunes on the radio. shoot, dismember and blow up gonks to your heart's content. it's good fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,from terrible launch to enjoyable game. good work cd project red. next time don't fuck up the launch. though its still embarrassing that i can see the same npc sometimes up to 6 times in the same scene....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,one of the most immersive games i have played. i would say had one of the greatest gaming comebacks ever
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"haven't written many reviews, but i feel compelled to write one here. why? this game is an absolute masterpiece. the quests are really fun and interesting, and the npc speech is extremely well written and voiced over. you really feel a connection with the characters, and become very invested in their stories. visually, it is easily one of the, if not the, greatest game ever made. it is simply peak visuals. night city feels electric and alive, with non stop action around every corner. the weapons and weapon mods are great fun, along with the character attributes and perks. with so many different ways to go about killing, it makes the combat really addictive. and mods this game can be heavily modded if you choose to. its really quite easy, it's the first game i ever played modded, and the possibilities are just endless. the game itself is already fantastic, and mods just add so much flavor. i bought this game last year after years of hearing about it and wondering... if you are the same, just buy it. 1010  i consider it possibly the greatest single player game ever made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,a game all developer's need to take a note down for the amazing come back this had. its a game everyone should play and experience!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"in a way i'm glad i dodged this game on release and played it after phantom liberty launched. i could just get lost in this city exploring every road, nook, and cranny. i love night city despite its dystopian vibe. i love the gameplay and how i kept on starting playthrough after playthrough using different builds, weapons, and story choices. i love the characters and their stories. i love cyberpunk 2077. my all time favorite game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"an amazing experience all the way through, i am never one to do all sidequests in a game but i'd be lying if i said i didn't with this one on two different playthroughs pre and post 2.2 the writing and world building are absolutely incredible and combined with very flushed out gameplay and progression systems i found myself seeking out every single bit of content i could squeeze out of this game. for those who are tired of the same clunky gameplay and lazy storytelling of modern western rpg studios looking at you bethesda and bioware you can absolutely scratch that itch to just get lost in a world with cd red. my one piece of advice i would give to new players is don't get too intimidated by the size of the world, don't worry about falling behind because you didn't do all the side quests from word go, just follow the story at your own pace and before long you will end up hooked scrambling just to find one more gig before it's time to enter the endgame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"truly one of the greats. this one will live with me forever. playing at time of the 2.2 release, with the phantom liberty dlc, and wow! i love playing stealth action, and the balance of this vs what you have to upgrade to get new and better stealth options is fantastic! played most of it with hacks and katanas. great, meaty multiple endings too. if there's one thing i'd put down the tiniest bit, it's the driving. just a little on the stickyslippy side for me, but i think that can be really fun for other players. love it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"gta but scifi, can just dick around and shoot people, or work on stories that are, in my opinion, one of the better ones in gaming."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,fire map weapons and story
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,i love love love love love love loveeeeeeeee cyberpunk this game changed my life its soooooooooo good i have well over 300 hours across steam and xbox i am johny silver hand. she cyber on my punk till i 2077 buy the game buy the dlc buy the merch become a legend choom

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"going towards 200h and i have a feeling i just started to play this game. there is so much going on that it cannot even be put in words to properly honor that. this game need to be explored and if you don't do that, you probably won't like it. if you are one of those lazy guys who are already frustrated with dialogues which are fundamental part of this game, then save your money here and buy yourself cs2 or lemmings instead! let's dive now into the nc life because i still need to find out how to get rid of that river guy. for now i left him hanging at the fence far away from the nc and went to spent time with judy. that river guy is so annoying, hahaha... ... i am playing this using gtx1070 and got 4060 fps on ultra without any ai stuff! if i use fsr xx then i go over 100 fps with a decent quality where you can notice that something is partly fishy if you really look and search for it. using only an intel i5 10400f cpu. 16gb ram. all that on a cheap 69 euro mainboard asrock"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"best open world game after they fixed the bugs  highly engaging game play, gripping narrative, breathtaking visuals, and richly detailed open world. teeming with stories, choices, and consequences that actually matter."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"truly a superb game in 2025, the dlc was amazing too! really makes you ask some interesting philosophical questions about major aspects of life, a game that can never fade away."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"good good game, very repayable as there are many paths to choose for your actions and tons of different play styles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"cyberpunk 2077 offre un'esperienza coinvolgente grazie a una trama ricca di colpi di scena e a personaggi ben caratterizzati. tuttavia, la guida dei veicoli a night city risulta meno soddisfacente rispetto ad altri titoli, come gta v, a causa di una fisica di guida che pu sembrare imprecisa."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"this game is amazing. i did not have this game at launch, so i cannot speak to how far it came, but i have probably played about 1.5 playthroughs in 270 hours and i have had a blast. these playthroughs were over the course of some significant updates, like 2.0 which changed the perk system, but the game has remained amazing and engaging. the gameplay is amazing in my opinion i love the attachment system for weapons, i like the guns themselves, i like the gunplay, the leveling is fun. i played on the hardest difficulty and actually found it frustratingly challenging at times, which may be appealing for some. the gameplay was fantastic, but what shined most is the story and the world. night city has got to be one of the best video game locations of all time. the aesthetic, the vibe, the different areas, it is truly just unmatched in any game. from heywood, to pacifica, to dogtown, to city center, this game has some insane locations that have such specific vibes and feels to them that i really feel like create a diverse and immersive world. the story is amazing, but not in the tradtional sense. if you only did the main quests, i think you could easily finish this game in like 30 hours, maybe even less. the most fun in this game came from the side questions. the reason i had so many hours in such little playthroughs is because i have done all of the sidequests and missions in the game, down to the ncpd scanner activities. some side missions were oneoff tasks, others were multipart questlines, some were comical, some hit you with some of the realest stuff i have seen in games. these sidequests are what really expand the world and make night city and its residents feel alive and immerse you into the world. the phantom liberty dlc is one of the best dlcs i have ever experienced in a video game, the story was amazing, the new characters were some of the best in the entire game instantly, the new weapons and factions were cool, etc. the game has its fair share of bugs, some of which, i will not lie, absolutely pull you out of the world and can mess with the experience. there were more than a few times that things did not go so smooth or cinematic because of the game's numerous bugs, even now, after all of the fixes. however, even this issue, i could kind of say makes for an experience similar to some bethesda games like skyrim, which is another one of my favorites ever. i say this to mean that the buggy nature can kind of add to game by creating a silly unpredictability to it for example, there were definitely a couple of times i got a smile out of cheesing a boss to death because of some wonky ai. in light of all of this, i would go as far to say that this was one of the best games ever. i would easily have this in my top 10, and think that this is a mustexperience game for anyone that truly likes rpg games, especially the falloutes vein of games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"cdpred always hits different, i'm glad they didn't give up on this game. gameplay's got a bit of far cry, witcher, and vermintide in it, atmosphere and music are great, characters are phenomenal. reminds me a bit of fallout new vegas. performance is a little jank but it still looks good. personally have to rank it pretty close to the witcher 3 as far as my favorite games go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"this is like the modern version of vtm bloodlines. immersive, filled with great writing and details, and still clearly unfinished. but the bugs don't matter, because the writing and the world are fantastic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"i tried to play this game when it was released in 2020. it was unplayable. it was broken in more ways than i can say. cd project red not only fixed it, it's now one of the greatest games ever. highly recommended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,game with dlc gotta be top 3 rpgs of all time. the game can feel linear at times but overall i loved it so much i played through it multiple times! i can definitely recommend.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"great story game, if you want something to sink numerous hours into go for this i bought it on sale thankfully, plenty of ending as well as lil choices throughout, smaller choices don't really change much but if u also are a fan or lore for your games this is one of the better story games iv played for a while 810 has it bugs  glitches still nothing major however im playing on a 4060 as well game looks amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"unbelievableim saying this now, but theres no way i wouldve said it back when cyberpunk 2077 first launched. those memes about all the bugs and crashes? yeah, i was one of the people who couldnt deal with it. i ragequit and left it for dead. but coming back to it now? 1010. im honestly blown away. the gunplay is smooth and satisfying, the story is incredibly rich, and the graphics are on a whole other level. its clear that years of work and countless patches turned this game into something truly special. cd projekt red really redeemed themselves, and im glad i gave it a second shot. if you dropped it like i did back then, trust meits worth diving back in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,very good immersive game ! the story and the characters are awesome
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"well let me start by telling you that i stopped enjoying gaming along with other things for a while now. reason for that being life and what most games are today, rushed and filled with micro transactions. this game while being repetitive gameplay with just another gig after gig but makes sense that v is trying to become the best of the best, has showed me what i missed. that being amazing stories with endings you don't get in mavel movies. man i love the endings especially phantom liberty's ending. when the credits rolled, followed by the sounds of yet another beautiful song played... they just don't miss with their dlcs. so if your not corrupted by money and know that single player games have their place and want a great story then yeahhh hop in and burn the city. what i would five to experience it for the first time again but as it is now and not when it released."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,beautiful story 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"cyberpunk 2077 is one of the greatest video games i have ever played. like i mentioned in my baldurs gate 3 review on backloggd, the main story is fairly simple, youve got a chip in your head, and your goal is to figure out how to remove it. but what truly makes this game incredible is the characters and the relationships you build with them. the voice acting is beyond words, absolutely phenomenal. every interaction feels real, every moment hits hard, and the way you slowly get to know each character makes the world feel alive, as a voice actor myself good voice acting is something i truly admire in video games. beyond the characters, one thing that made cyberpunk 2077 unforgettable for me was its world and atmosphere. its the kind of game that made me stop and just stare at its environments, the towering skyscrapers, the neonlit street lights in night city, every district has its own personality, and the level of detail is stunning. the music and ambient sound only add to the immersion, creating a world that feels both alive and beautiful. one of the things i loved most about cyberpunk 2077 was the suicide ending. its one of the most wellwritten suicide prevention messages ive ever seen in a game. instead of preaching or telling you its not worth it, it does something far more powerful, it shows the pain and devastation you left behind. its not about what happens to you, but what your loss does to those who cared about you. the scenes with judy and misty hit me the hardest. seeing the side characters go through the stages of grief was heartbreaking yet absolutely beautifully done viktor  denial judy  depression panam  anger misty  acceptance cd projekt red truly excels at building relationships and friendships in their games. the slow, natural way you connect with people makes everything feel deeply personal. ive played many games with heartbreaking moments and emotional endings, but nothing has ever hit me quite like this. cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, not just for its story, but for the world, music, atmosphere, and the emotions it evokes. i felt completely empty when i finished it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"coming from 10 years of only focusing on live service games destiny, division, warframe, etc., it's been incredibly refreshing diving into singleplayer game world, and this game bridged that gap for me. immediately drawn into the story and even more importantly, instantly connected with the world. if you want to play in a linear fashion, you certainly can, but you can also just throw yourself into the world and plunk away on side quests while slowly progressing the story. at no point has the game forced me into anything i didn't feel like doing at that very moment, and without sacrificing anything. the loot and build systems are very robust without feeling too overwhelming, imo. maybe this is just my own bias in lieu of coming over from the liveservice looter genre that's notorious for infusing fomo because it works, but this game was my gateway to a different way to consume games. almost 100 hrs in and i plan to put hundreds more in, while also diving into other solo games in my backlog been playing witcher 3 and absolutely loving it, guess i'm a cdpr fan at this point."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,its just so varied and scale is incredible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"cyberpunk 2077 alongside phantom liberty is kinda funny to talk about, because it's simultaneously a pretty great game and pretty bad game. before i really start going in, it's important to note that there's one big takeaway you should have from this if you end up buying cyberpunk 2077, do not skip out on phantom liberty. it makes the basegame better, and it is easily the best thing in the whole package. it's the basegame characters and story are great, but cyberpunk is an incredibly bland ubisoftesque open world game that would've been outdated in 2013, much more dated in 2020, and even moreso in 2025. cyberpunk succumbs to some of the worst trends of triplea gaming around, like small randomized percentage stat increases on items, at times terribly annoying or outright gamebreaking glitches and visual bugs yes, even still, a whole lot of meaningless decisionmaking between the actual important choices, and way too many quests that involve you having to wait ingame hours to progress in the name of realism. in practice, a whole lot of cyberpunk 2077 is slogging through somewhat uninteresting general gameplay until you can reach the thing that actually matters the story and its characters. and make no mistake, this game is really very well written. it is the only real reason this is a positive review, and my opinion is that the game is worth playing for its writing alone. in relation to story, the basegame does has some pacing issues and isn't always very good at really conveying its stakes convincingly. for a majority of the game's runtime, it feels more like a sliceoflife sim than a race against the clock. that said, it's characters are all interesting and make it work. keanu reeves as silverhand is a godsend, truly incredible work and an unforgettable presence. any scene with this character becomes better for his being in it, and he's in a whole hell of a lot of scenes. then, you get into phantom liberty, a dlc that is point blank required viewing. phantom liberty, on paper, shouldn't be that much different from the basegame. yet, in practice, it changes the entire way i experienced the momenttomoment gameplay. its stakes are higher and more concise, the story is a lot shorter but a lot more focused, its characters are much more consistently complex and secretive, and because of all of this the gameplay becomes a lot more fun. not much new is added to change its combat encounters, but phantom liberty is able to connect its gameplay to its story a lot more successfully than the basegame ever does. in phantom liberty, shooting dudes feels like you are progressing a story and protecting people you care about. in the basegame, you have an understanding that the same thing is true, but you generally don't feel it. there are gameplay sections, and then there are story sections. phantom liberty connects them in a way that feels natural."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,its first person only gta 7 with cybertech. whats not to love ? just do it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,i went into this game blindly not knowing anything about it and starting my first playthrough after the january 2025 patch that everyone talks about. i am honestly so shocked by how impressive and immersive this game is. you can customize your play style in so many different ways and certain choices impact the story. it's honestly so addicting and i just purchased the expansion to start a new save file. this game exceeded all my expectations. spoilerjustice for skippy tho.spoiler
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"i sat back and witnessed the chaos and disappointment of this game's initial release in 2020. i never thought it would be something i'd buy. but as the years went on it gradually clawed back it's reputation as the devs put more work into it. the version i bought in 2025 is a complete game, fully polished with a great story and characters, solid gameplay, and an immersive setting. don't forget the soundtrack and graphics either. i don't really care too much about graphics myself, but i have to admit they look great. as for music there's a wonderful ingame radio with about a dozen stations to pick from, as well as some great tracks for cutscenes and story moments. the combat started out a little clunky feeling in the early game, but once i got access to decent cyberware it really opened up. there are enough playstyles and ways of building your character out that i imagine most people will find something for them. i personally went for a close range mele and shotgun fighter, dashing around combat and slowing down time with one of the insanely fun sandevistan cyberware pieces. there are also options like ranged, stealth, and netrunning, as well as a ton of unique and interesting weapons. the dlc overall was probably the strongest part of this game storywise. its setting dogtown is pretty unique area compared to the rest of the city, and the way the plot all unfolds is really gripping. one minor gripe i had was that returning to the main story after completing phantom liberty in the middle of my playthrough felt a little disorienting. you might want to just experience the main game first if it's your first time, then play the dlc in a second playthough. i still had a great time though. i did three of the endings in my one playthrough, and each of them hit me hard emotionally. phantom liberty probably had my favorite ending of those i witnessed though i know that might be a rare opinion. overall its a great game to buy in 2025, both the base game and dlc. combined they do cost quite a pretty penny though, so maybe wait to get them on sale. that's what i did, but i think full price would still have been worth it based on my phenomenal experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"gta in a dystopian technologically advanced future. if you like gta you should like this. it's a bit clunky though, and npc models are reused so often, it's like the npc version of fallout's cut and pasted interior items... yes i know there are mentats under those cans bethesda..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,one of the best if not the best game i have ever played.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"picked this up around the 2.21 update, having avoided it during the notorious launch. the devs really put in the work to fix it and having said that, this is one of the best rpg's i've played in a very long time. out the gate it looked awful on my computer, but doing some research i resolved it in about 30 minutes after diving some forums specific to my video card.  the combat is satisfying, especially when you've committed to a build after learning the nuances of the skill tree. it can be a struggle in the beginning, but that's how these games work.  the story compelled me to explore various choices and i'm not close to getting through them all. i haven't felt that way about a game in a very long time. there's a lot of potential untapped, and i believe the devs will keep a focus on it, likely in the sequel  more exploration inside of more buildings, open the whole sucker up. you can go in a lot of places, and there is a good deal of exploration. but i'd like randomly going into buildings, sort of like skyrim, and encountering things you never would if you stuck to just the story missions. there's some evilsketchy factions and i'd like to stumble on operations of theirs, not just a few of them in an alley. some of the best experiences are isolated to story missions.  expansion of factions many are alluded to but never explore more than a couple missions, with more just mentioned or in random written portions. more factions would bring more missions, encounters, etc.  more unique random encountersbehavior with the general public.  more weapons. there's a good variety, but go all out with melee weapons since this is a neofantasy setting. i love the katanas, but you'd get a lot of enthusiasts who would enjoy other sword types or even blunt, staff, or spear weapons.  cybertech  was buffed for melee builds, but still feels inferior to katanas in a lot of ways, namely gorilla arms and mantis blades. they are viable, but more can be done.  post game repetition  you can keep playing, sort of, but after doing most of the sidequests, there isn't a lot. more things to do after completing the game would be nice, along with ng. i can't really say any game has this figured out, but with the setting, i feel there's some potential here, like v starting his own faction or something to that effect. overall a really good game it'll stay in my library for a good while."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"i didn't play it for a long time because i heard of the extremely bad launch, but the game is borderline a masterpiece. i absolutely loved it, especially the personalization and multiple combat routes. please get it, youll like it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"i really like this game even when it first came out i really liked the game. im not like these fake gangster gamers out here who sleep with a teddy bear. im a former og cyberpunk playing amd gamer. now im nvidia i done stepped my fudging wallet up and got the bando. now when i played the game i wasnt on nothing. i was out there shooting opps, and dropping mfs left right and from the side. i wasnt paying no attention to nothing. i was playing that bihh like it was call of duty. blasting the opss and not even upgrading. then i got learned. i started watching the youtube and reading the guides. i stepped the blick up and my character. the deep levels of customization and depth of your own story is incredible. phantom liberty's genre twisting element is something i had never experienced 100 hours into a video game. i am currently on my seond playthrough and i am shirtless only mode when playing. my 4080 super keeps it cool in the room because it's so powerful and so strong. i know there is more better out there but imma be honest when i say its a fun game. i heard they added romance options for panam which is great because formerly you could only stalk her at camp. i once sat outside of the camp watching her for 34 minutes straight. i have the video on youtube. i really like this game. panam is one of the most attractive characters in video game history. i have a panam tshirt, a panam copy of fetty wap cd and a panam mug that i drink my monster energy from. my goal is to play this game until i can graduate college. im currently not in college so i might play the game forever, you never know. i want to make youtube videos of me and panam holding hands does anyone know if i can play the game and hold panams hand??? maga. i really think when it comes to the game cyberpunk 2077 you have to consider the hurdles that cd projekt reddd much like sexie reddddd is a new game that blends genres. i don't know if i mentioned that but i really do enjoy this game. a new thing they need to add in cyberpunk 2078 is something similar to the need for speed series. where the cops actually chase you and pursue you in a realistic manner. i do have the 100 stat in this game and i really do enjoy it. i would rec this game to anyone and their momma. you have to get your mitts on this one, especially if you play sports games, call of duty and even something like age of empires. i really think the panam aspect of the game will help anyone relate. now keeannu reeves brother and cousin of austin reeves had a performance like no other. that mother fudger was dancing, crying, laughing and doing the absolute most he could to sell the role of jonathan silverhand. he gave an honest performance and in the block, its all you can really ask for. now dont get me started on idris elba. that fine ahhh hunk of man put on an acting clinic. he was like michael jordan game 6. he was like lebron in miami. i really cannot express that fine ahh mf idris elba and his acting skills this man was really snapping at the momment. i remember one scene he looked at me and i really felt like idris elba was looking at me. and they even added more map. how you gonna get upset at me when you run into my bullets? is what idris elba says when you run into his shots. if anyone wanna play when the multiplayer drop just hit me up because i have presitged 15 times in black ops 1, got good trash talking skills and i can dunk on a regulation hoop."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"good game. bought it much later, after the game's issues were mostly fixed, though there were still bugs here and there. the main storyline is solid and interesting and the combat is fun. the art style is great. the sidequests though are lacking in variety and depth. 8.510"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"incredible game. had a nasty launch but they got their shit together and i'm glad i waited to play it instead of refunding. story is very rich, graphics are amazing, and the immersion is crazy. the gun play is really damn satisfying too. highly recommend"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i picked this game up in 2025 after hearing the buzz and prepared for a let down, but glad to say it's been a fabulous ride. the world is incredibly immersive and feels very lively for the most part sidequests feel organic and worldbuilding towards the end they became a little samey and frankly too easy  sometimes later ncpd alert messages reference back to one or another sidequest which was a nice touch. the main story is engaging and thoughtprovoking, and decisions i made felt fraught, both in terms of character and morality. other characters pulled me in with emotional attachments, and i made my choice in the end trying to keep as many as possible alive. i played through the first time with phantom liberty attached, which almost feels like a whole extra game bedded in, rivalling the original game for storytelling scope and power. in the end, the highest compliment i can pay the game is that i was sad to have finished, and that though i wanted to know what the other endings are i am holding off for now to let the emotional impact fade playing them now would be like taking a great novel and doing 'choose your own adventure'  a conditional ending undermines the 'truth' of the characters. the game isn't quite perfect still, a few bugs tho none gamebreaking for me, vehicles are a bit soggy and from the midgame i couldn't spend my money fast enough felt like there wasn't enough to do with it. i was also sad to reach max level by about twothirds of the way thru  tho i was doing every quest i could. finally, just an fyi that the rating is not kidding about, i've rarely played a game so... aggressively... adult even in the sound design!. none of that detracts from what has been a spectacular experience. highly recommended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"one of the best games of all time. immersive, creative, and every update improves the game. the dlc is one of the best of all time. every time i start a new play through, i find something else to fall in love with. thank you cd projekt red!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"this game  good game. there is a certain weakness about repetition gameplaywise sneak, kill silenced, job done, but the game has a very thorough depth considering the setting  universe. as an rpg player i feel right at home. don't compare to gta, maybe compare to skyrim. i have put in many hours and it rocks, this game inspired me on a retake of one of my favorite ttrpgs  penandpaperrpgs. buy it!"
