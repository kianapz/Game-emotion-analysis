"Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible experience. The main story and side quests are captivating, well-written, and offer impactful choices. The Night City universe is ultra-immersive, with a striking atmosphere and characters.

And of course, only one thing to say. Judy.",True,40,4,2025-01-31 17:54:34
"Story is very good on the base game but in the Phantom Liberty it becomes great. I played the game when it first released on PS4, I can say it was the worst experience then but now I played it on update 2.22 and its one of the great game I can say at least on PC it is running like its a tech demo. I am playing with RT and its a treat to my eyes on night, In day time you will not notice it much but in nigh its a totally different story. if you are not getting FPS try FSR 3.1 Frame Gen Mod its works great if you have locked 60 FPS then with this mod you can get around 120 FPS with RT. I have around 150 screenshot taken because of how good it looks. Get the Game with the DLC guys its a must. Hoping there would be sequel to this game",True,8,0,2025-02-23 16:31:51
"For me this was an amazing game.
I completed all the achievements, did all the endings and have seen everything the game has to offer. And it was amazing.
Honestly, This is probably one of the best story games ever done. Night City is absolutely brutal and nobody ever gets a happy ending. You have to make very hard permanent choices, no matter what you choose night city will never let you win.
I loved Witcher 3 aswell and now Cyberpunk is my second cd projekt red game and if they keep this is up I can't wait to see what future games they will make. 10/10 game",True,20,0,2025-02-05 17:19:47

"Cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as Night City itself: glamorous and rotten to the core.

The city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. The missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. There are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing (seriously, the game kept throwing Panam's crotch into my face no matter how much I tried to keep our relationship professional). There are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. Updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games.

There are more issues but I'm too lazy to write them down. I hope you get the idea. I was about to click the thumb down.

Then I went through the ""point of no return"" and after that took some time to think back on the journey.

I'll be honest. I really enjoyed the payoff. And looking back, I very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. Time will tell how I'll remember this game. Is it worth being annoyed for 60 hours before a grand finale and an occasion to look at the state of AAA games? Your mileage may vary. 

Considering the games I enjoy, I would be a hypocrite if I gave this game a thumb down.

Cyberpunk 2077 is awful. And it's one of the best open world games I ever played.",True,5,1,2025-02-22 15:16:43

"223 hours in this game. Though about 130~ was in the 2.0 update. This game post 2.0 can only be described as amazing. 100%ing the achievements in this game became more of entertainment than a grind.

The RPG aspects give you different ways to play in both melee and ranged. From usual katanas and fists to rifles/revolvers to just being a netrunner menace

Each ending has its own unique spin to the point where none of them feel specifically canon in my opinion. All of them were very well written with something... lost.

I would 100% recommend this game to anyone that wants to enjoy a RPG FPS with a story. So many different ways to play, act, and end.",True,2,0,2025-02-22 23:23:47
"Я не застал Киберпанк во времена того когда она вышла и начал играть с версии 2.2. Я скажу что это одна из самых лучших игр в которые я играл. За 2 недели я без перерыва отыграл более 80 часов и никак не мог остановиться потому что игра реально затянула. Прошёл на все доступные концовки и все дополнительные квесты включая DLC и абсолютно доволён что приобрёл эту игру. Буду время от времени возвращаться!

I didn't catch Cyberpunk when it came out and started playing with version 2.2 and I will say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. In 2 weeks I played more than 80 hours without a break and I couldn't stop because the game really sucked me in.

"10/10
I got this game a few years back, 2023 I think. It had taken me 3 years to buy it due to the state CD Projekt had released it in. 
I played through the game the same year and enjoyed it. This was before Phantom Liberty and the 2.0 update.
PL released and it took me another year to hop back on because of other releases. 
Holy. Shit. Do I wish I had played through sooner. 
2.0 is a fantastic update and by extension 2.2. Phantom Liberty? Fucking incredible. I haven't even completed the DLC yet but I needed to say a few words about it.
If you were still debating buying this due to its bad release, or are holding a grudge due to said release. If you can, give this game a chance. I doubt you'll regret it,",True,2,0,2025-02-07 03:00:32
"It was a heck of a game and a long one, for sure. I liked it even though I thought I wouldn't. The only thing that I just realized at the end of it was that I could save Songbird, but I didn't want to go back to my saved files. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Whatever happened already happened, and it was a good one for sure, and I definitely recommend it.

"[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is quite the dish. Of course, I had to wait for the controversy to cool down before diving into this tasty-looking treat after that tragic launch. But to be fair, I'm happy to say I enjoyed most of my meal.

There's a lot to compliment on this plate: To start, everything is so delicately detailed that it's almost like a sensory overload - you don't even know where to look first. You can see that Night City has been carefully crafted to feel as lively as possible. The vibes and atmosphere this game delivers almost feel surreally alien, yet at the same time, you can vaguely imagine our future ending up similarly to the one depicted in the game. The combat feels undeniably superb, with every aspect of it working like a charm. The motion capture and acting carrying the game are significant selling points, too. A great range of topics are also covered, including loyalty, principles, business, religion, capitalism and more. It also contains many pop culture references, which is also a massive bonus in my eyes. And, of course, the story was great, too. Everyone blaming a city and corporations for all their problems, but never themselves, is a pretty funny plot. You also get some leeway in your choices while avoiding the overwhelm of too many branching decisions in the story. However, I think I had the most fun playing the side missions.

Despite this, the gameplay doesn't have as much depth as I was expecting. By this, I mean there wasn't much variety in smaller mission types, and unique or special gameplay mechanics were very few. For all it's worth, I expected more for such a high price. Thanks to me, my friends and this game's extensive marketing, my expectations skyrocketed. Yet, it feels like you're mostly paying here for the graphics, details and, of course, [b]Keanu Reeves[/b].

Some other noteworthy thoughts include the disappointment of not being able to play purchased Braindances. I'm sure they would've been a nice addition. Another issue was the romance options. But this isn't primarily a dating simulator, so I can look the other way. However, certain characters were definitely pushed more than others. For instance, some felt like predetermined romantic interests for your character. One thing I can't ignore, though, is the fact that you can change your penis size - even though you're never gonna get to see it in action. As disheartening as this may sound, it was probably just a clever marketing gimmick. Curiously, I think this game is like a mix of [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] and [i]Far Cry[/i] but with a futuristic and sci-fi twist. Due to this, my dad would probably have a blast with this if he could play first-person shooters.

All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty solid game, and I can recommend it to anyone with the computational capacity to run it at max graphics and experience it in its full cyberpunk glory.",True,13,0,2025-01-28 05:01:14
"Close to Masterpiece (basically it is but it does have small bugs here and there)

Great Story | Great Graphics | Great Gameplay | Grinding is NOT hard | Soundtrack amazing | Visuals, characters, storytelling are amazing

I don't get it why devs advertise Female V (main character) in promotional material and partnerships when Male V is clearly the choice due to how GOOD his relationships with the characters are. The brotherhood between him and plenty of the male characters is simply amazing and so is his relationship with Panam",True,2,0,2025-02-14 19:12:59
"Mid gameplay, but great RPG and story. One of the few modern open world games that can actually keep my current-day attention even in (most of) the side quests!",True,1,0,2025-01-29 04:48:48
"Wowie, this game quickly climbed into my top 5 games of all time. Cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games I have ever played, the graphics are fantastic and the world building is something else.

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk.

Now, the story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

I also really love the different routes you can take: Nomad, Streetkid, Corpo, which offers different dialogues and can have an impact your play style if you really want to enjoy the role playing part to the fullest.

Sickness all around, I have so much more to say, but this was it for now. 100% Recommend. Also recommend the anime, Cyberpunk Edgerunners. So heartbraking and it just adds to the world of Cyberpunk. I am glad to have joined this journey and I look forward to what comes next.",True,7,0,2025-02-10 07:26:26
"Bought it first time way back when it launched, it ran crappily even at potato graphics so I refunded. Fast forward to the game's patch 2.21, bought on sale. I can now play the game without frustration. I wish the draw distance and lighting in vanilla was better (though these can somewhat be adjusted to liking via mods).

Fun large map lots of things to do. Find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. 
Are you the cool stealthy ninja? Or are you Rambo? Or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? Or go cyberpsycho?

Plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. 

Storywise - No spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. Nothing forced. Pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. Wish there were some follow-ups to see the consequences of some choices ala Witcher 3. Wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well.

Voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. Keanu is breathtaking as well.

"Amazing open world RPG game. There's always something to do and story to progress. The action is exciting, it lets you experiment, and it lets you have fun. The amount of detail that went into this game is above and beyond. I enjoyed every second of playing this game and that includes getting 100% of all the achievements.",True,1,0,2025-01-28 23:55:18
"This is a game that rose from the ashes and became one of the titles that define this generation. One thing I wish the devs could fix is the goofy shadow V casts. I don't know if that's even fixable, but it's the only part of the game that now still looks janky. It runs great, it looks great, it plays great, the story's great, the sandbox and worldbuilding is fantastic, the variety is there, and the DLC gives you something that feels like a separate game entirely while still being distinctly Cyberpunk. You owe it to yourself to play it.

Note: On Steam Deck, the preset is Medium-High, and you can enable Frame Gen to make it run at 55-60fps with still crisp visuals and a decent battery life all things considered.",True,1,0,2025-02-12 20:39:16
"Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game and anyone who tells you it isn't probably is on crack.

While the launch was filled with so much bugs that it would make india look clean. The game really has ironed out most of them so it's definitely worth a shot, especially since it's still getting updated, just don't expect too much depth as most systems are pretty surface level, take romance for example...yeah lemme hear the same 4 dialogue options over and over again, like can I not take them out to dinner or you know play pool with them? How about the fact that the world doesn't really react to your ""choices"" too much or the fact you can't join up with different gangs to get more backstory.

There is a lot of replayability here from the amount of builds you can have to some differing options depending on gender, you can become so strong that it makes far cry 2's malaria look like rat's piss in comparison 

I mean Radiohead references exist in the game so I give it 0/10

"Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and I have to say—this game is now one of my all-time favorites. CD Projekt Red put in the work, and it really shows. If you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a must-play.

Night City is insane. The level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels lived-in—it’s everything I wanted from a cyberpunk world. The neon lights, the shady alleyways, the high-tech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. Walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. It’s easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in.

The main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. Playing as V, trying to navigate the mess of Night City while dealing with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves absolutely nailed the role) makes for an unforgettable experience. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you.

But what really makes the game special are the side characters. Panam, Judy, River, Kerry—they all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. Some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. The writing is just top-tier, and I found myself really invested in the characters and their stories.

The Phantom Liberty DLC takes everything great about Cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. New missions, new characters (Idris Elba’s character Solomon Reed is my favourite), and new gear make this expansion worth every second. The espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. If you already love the game, Phantom Liberty is a no-brainer.

Combat is a blast. Gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. Hacking is one of my favorite parts—being able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. You can play this game however you want—sneaky netrunner, melee-focused street samurai, guns-blazing mercenary—it’s all viable, and it’s all fun.

Cyberware adds even more variety. You can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with Mantis Blades. The skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding.

Building your version of V is one of the best parts. Whether it’s how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, there’s a ton of freedom to play how you want. The choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique.

The music in this game is just perfect. Whether you’re walking through the streets, driving through the Badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. The voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive.

Visually, this game is stunning. With ray tracing and all the graphical updates, Night City looks breathtaking. Performance-wise, it’s night and day compared to launch—smooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. If you’re playing on a decent PC or a next-gen console, you’re in for a visual treat.

Cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played. The story, the world, the characters, the combat—it all comes together beautifully now. CD Projekt Red really turned things around, and if you love sci-fi, cyberpunk settings, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",True,1,0,2025-02-25 19:21:25

Me fez refletir, me diverti com inúmeras interações com personagens bem construídos, e a narrativa é simplesmente de tirar o fôlego, com reviravoltas incríveis e de muito bom gosto.

Além disso, como apaixonado por arte, fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto.

O único ponto fraco, na minha opinião, é o balanceamento dos inimigos. Joguei no hard e senti que eles são muito fracos, enquanto os chefes da campanha são absurdamente mais fortes que os Cyberpsicopatas. No entanto, sei que existem mods que ajudam a equilibrar esse aspecto.

"The game is absolutely awesome! I have not been this hooked up to a video game for long time. I cant believe I held up so long to get it because of how this game was review bombed. It must have been over 2 years in my wishlist. Only shows how fans can be unfair sometimes.

Let's Start with Cons:
- Occasional bug and crash to desktop (happened maybe 2-3 times that the game flatlined). You can sometimes encounter wrecks of cars on the road which are not actual obstacles and cannot be interacted with, you can just drive through them like they were not there. From time to time you will see a flying object, levitating NPC or a car in really strange position.
- AI is superb dumb - police is the dumbest - even if you have 5 stars at being wanted they will forget about you in a minute or two if they cant see you. Even if you are just around a pillar and can see 5 policemen looking for you and slowly approaching your position then all of a sudden timer beeps, the stars start to flash for a few seconds and bang you are not wanted anymore. You go out of the pillar and policemen do not recognise you anymore even tho you just butchered a few dozens (or hundreds?) of their colleagues. I wish this could be addressed as it breaks immersion and is just straight out idiotic. Or when you enter the mission they stop chasing you. Not only police is stupid, all the enemies if they lose sight of you for a minute or something they lose interest or just stand there waiting to be smoked.
- You get too OP. I get that you are supposed to be a Night City Legend but the highest difficulty level should  be more challenging especially a little bit later when you get more cyberware and good weapons. For now game is only challenging on higher difficulties for the first few hours. Maybe until level 10 or 15. From level 40 you barely die and can just storm through 20 or 30 opponents. Only very occasionally you will die. 
- No flying machines that can be interacted with of piloted is a little disappointing in futuristic game like this. There should be flying cars or helicopters that could be piloted.

Pros:
- Story is amazing
- Most of the side quests are great and engaging. Even the repetitive quests like kill or steal are great because every time they are in different setting building etc and the gunplay never gets boring
- Gunplay is just great. Feels right maybe except for technical weapons which are not very fun. Also Melee weapons seems to be under-powered to compare them to shotgun for example
- NPCS are amazing so many memorable characters. 
- Voice acting is spot on
- Choices are good however there should be more 
- Romance option is thre and it is exciting
- Graphics is top notch
- Cars and driving feels great. Every car can be driven from 1st person perspective and every car has unique design with wheel radio and all interiors. How amazing is that?
- V - the protagonist is a cool interesting guy you can chose your starting position too
- Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves. How cool is this!
- Beautiful and alive city with so many people in and cars. So many unique districts 
- A lot of places where you can fight with lowlives just for fun without needing any quest
- Such a great music and variety. So many different radio stations
- You get a mobile phone! And can call or text other NPC! Cool
- Leveling system is good and rewarding.
- Quests are plentiful
- Almost no copy and paste buildings, cellars or locations. Everything feels unique

So much love was put into this game it is amazing. For me 9/10 - I dont mind an occasional bug but if they worked on poor AI and AI realism then it would be strong 9.5/10 for me. If they added extreme difficulty level with more challenge it would have been 10/10

I've enjoyed almost everything about playing cyberpunk, the DLC was a crazy good story on it's own... I've had more then enough side missions and places to explore and I'm heading toward endgame with around 70+ hours of gameplay on my save file.

I fell in love with every bit of lore, the freedom to strategize my build (no “right way” to play!), and the characters who feel like real people.

I got so attached that I played through every ending—each one hit hard, especially with that god-tier soundtrack amplifying the emotions. Night City’s story, the bitter-sweet moments, the music… it all left a permanent mark on me.

CDPR 100% did this game justice. If you’re on the fence, dive in. It’s an unforgettable experience.",True,1,0,2025-02-17 20:04:06

"I don't typically write reviews, but I picked up this game late 2024 and I have to say, it genuinely delivers such an amazing single-player experience; I just had to write something about it. It's worth at least trying if you enjoy the FPS or RPG genre. 

The game offers exceptional morally-ambiguous storytelling, immersive dystopian world-building, and extremely fun FPS gameplay. The versatility of the different cybernetic builds you can choose to focus on for combat alongside the weight of the choices you're forced to make HOOKED me into this game. Exploring Night City, engaging with the NPCs, the music, and the graphics are also amazing aspects of this game. I'd recommend getting the base game with the PL expansion as it feels like a seamless extension to the entirety of Cyberpunk. It also goes on sale frequently which is 100% worth the purchase. After beating this game months prior, I still think about it regularly. 

TL;DR: Wake the f*** up samurai and play the game: 9.7/10",True,1,0,2025-02-14 23:57:15

I enjoyed simply riding around on my bike (there are several car, ORVs and motorcyle offerings) listening to the radio. The price is worth it for at least one playthrough, but with the DLC content and all the side missions, the replay factor is on point.

"Would recommend this game to everyone if I could. Lots of life lessons on how the world is ran today, how people value material things a lot more than over the people around and who actually has more control of things around you. Yeah they could work on different dialogues depending how you play the game and which faction you choose but by the time you finish one playthrough it can run you up 80hrs, depending how you play. Asking for more is a lot yet they keep delivering with updates and dlc which says a lot about who the are as a developer. Rather than taking the money and running they keep delivering.

"I was barely at all interested in this game after seeing the dumpster fire of a launch back in 2020. I remember sitting in a discord call with a buddy, watching him play on release day- and seeing how horrible it was ruined any urge to even play it.
A couple years later, around 2022, I got the game on sale, tried playing it, and didn't enjoy it. I ultimately refunded the game and moved on. That was until earlier last year, when I saw a lightly used copy of the game for the Xbox Series X in a gamestop for 15 bucks. I figured it was worth a shot since it was so cheap, plus having the physical media was cool.

I finally got past the ""boring"" beginning part of the game, and it opened up to be this insanely beautiful experience. I have not had this much fun playing a game in a long time. For months this was the only game I touched, and it was well worth it. Back then, I wouldn't have told you to go a mile close to the storepage, now? I can't recommend this game enough. For how emotionless the city is, and how scary the world appears to be, it's hard not to grow appreciation for V, Johnny, and all of the other people you meet that burst with color. I can't remember being so heartbroken after beating the game since RDR2. I seriously sat in my chair for a solid 30 minutes in silence to process everything. It sounds like a loser thing to do but, I seriously fell in love with the game.

While I can't blame anybody for being hesitant about buying it, they truly have polished it and turned it into what the game should've been when it released. While I can't justify the major f*ckup from CDPR, the fact that they actually fixed it instead of moving on earned them my respect for sure. Aside from that, this game is easily one of my favorite games ever. Nothing in this game was boring, at all. I've beat it once on both PS5 and XSX, and have been achievement hunting and trying to 100% the game on PC for 94 hours. You will love this game, I promise. Give it a shot.

"On launch, this was a turd at 3/10. I uninstalled and did not think about it for years. Now, after the studio rehabilitated the game, this is a masterpiece and one of the best games ever created. 10/10. The world building is stellar, the voice acting is probably one of the best you will ever get, soundtrack is unforgettable and an instant download, artwork is fantastic. This world is so real that you can escape to it after finishing the main story just to unwind. The devs are still updating and adding content, which is always interesting to check on. If you want to 'test' your rig for fidelity and next gen graphics, this is the benchmark. A must play for any gamer.",True,1,0,2025-02-02 16:50:54

Excellent writing and open world. Although there are few bugs here and there game is very enjoyable.

"It is a rare thing for a game to transcend mere entertainment and become an experience—one that leaves an imprint on your soul. There are bad games, okay games, good games, great games, and even legendary games. But then there are the few that redefine what gaming can be. The ones that, when the credits roll, leave you feeling like a part of yourself has been left behind in that world.

For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard—a masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die. They rebuilt it, refined it, and with Phantom Liberty, they didn’t just fix a game—they cemented a legacy.

Experiencing this world now, in its fully realized form, is nothing short of breathtaking. This isn’t just one of the best games of our time—it’s one of the greatest ever made. You do not get better than this.

"[h1]OVERALL 9/10 - after 1300 hours on record.[/h1]


[h3]Plot: 8/10 [/h3]
- Great storyline; some stories seem ""raw"", lack ending or variety.

[h3]Character development: 7/10 [/h3]
- Some characters are wonderful, having background stories, different attitude towards your game choices, and act naturally; some other characters appear to be too scripted or boring, lacking variety or context/background/reaction.

[h3]World: 8/10[/h3]
- Although the world is nicely made with tons of decorations and variable areas/districts, after some time the map becomes limited/repetitive, causing lost interest. Great part is that you can see the world changing around you like TV news or NPC dialogues as you progress different parts of the story.

[h3]Roleplay: 6/10[/h3]
- The game definitely has a better roleplay than some games such as ex.: Sekiro, Metro, and Red Dead Redemption 2, but it still lacks the effects of the decisions a player makes. Your actions affect the game but in such a way that allows you to not care enough most of the time and still get the benifits. 

[h3]Gameplay: 8/10[/h3]
- Physics are pleasing; amount of things you are able to do is limited but is still somewhat satisfying. 
[i]=[possible to make it better with some mods][/i]


[h3]Variety of playstyle: 8/10[/h3]
- It is a pretty versatile game in terms of builds and playstyle you can choose. Of course it is nothing close to Skyrim, but it gives enough of combination of decisions, builds, weapons, and approach to the game to keep the interest for couple of playthroughs.

[h3]Combat: 6/10[/h3]
- Nice but terrible, to sum it up. Looks great, having some awesome finishers or skills but overall has a lot of issues such as silencers and throwables detection. 
[i]=[some mods make it better][/i]


[h3]Optimization: 7/10[/h3]
- Game has experienced enormous amount of patches and fixes since release and considered to be optimized. Regardless of the optimization it is quite demanding of the device's performance. You are likely to experience game crashes too. Sometimes the interface disappears or a quest bugs, but thanks to saves it is not as much of an issue - just save more often.

[h3]Character customization: 7/10[/h3]
- Significant amount of variations but at the same time pretty limited too. 
[i]=[mods help a lot][/i]


[h3]Sound: 9/10[/h3]
- Great dialogues, specifically appraise different cultures and languages present in the game in different regions; game story music is wonderful, especially V's theme and Johnny's theme; radio music is nice but feels like it lacks variety or ability to customize after you listen to it for some time.

"I won't take too long beating the same dead horse that's already been beating a 1000 times before. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the game had a disastrous launch, you've likely heard that CDPR lied & how now it's been experiencing a massive redemption arc the past couple years. 

[h3]And yes, it's TRUE.[/h3] CDPR hid, deceived, misled and outright actively LIED about the state of the game on release, lied about features and the way systems worked in the game. What is also true is that YES, they have made insane progress attempting to redeem this game and they DID redeem the game as a product if you can separate experience from the scummy/lying practices they exhibited 4 years ago.

[h3]If you can get past the past and focus on what the game offers you now, you're going to get one of the most technically impressive and impacting experiences you'll have in a long time. It's really an extraordinary game now. Now, let's focus on the actual review:[/h3]

[b]Positives:[/b]

1) Flat out, the game has what is in my opinion, at MINIMUM Top 5 writing for a video game ever. CDPR's unbelievably talent in this department only has gotten better and these guys ACED it here. The game understands and respects the power of immersion and goes the extra mile with all the small details. When the game sucks you in, you are IN.

2) Visually, it absolutely is as stunning as everyone has said it is. Top 3 all time from a graphical standpoint for me personally. From the under the hood technical capabilities of the game's lighting and fidelity, but also from the handcrafted world. It's constantly stunning at every step of the journey.

3) Really enjoyable and varied approaches to game-play with several different ways to build your character & approach objectives. It's also got that classic Morrowind feel where the game will let you become comically OP if you so choose. It won't restrict you. Wanna take a fast paced, physical melee approach, jumping over buildings and dashing at lightning speed in-between enemies?  You can. Wanna be a stealth operator, covertly subverting security systems, utilizing an arsenal of tools to avoid detection and taking out enemies with silent, precise strikes? You can. Wanna be an over the top, godlike net-runner who can drop every enemy in a building before even stepping foot in it? You can.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

1) The game world, while aesthetically, one of the best looking I've ever played, can sometimes feel a bit static & lacking in interactivity. There isn't a ton of interactivity and if you're coming from something like a Rockstar game world and expecting the same here, you won't get that.

2) The traffic is unfortunately still kinda horrible lol. The AI for drivers randomly just breaks and cars will just stop and stay stopped in the middle of the road and at stoplights. They've advertised that police chases are now fixed but honestly, it's still extremely underwhelming. You can be in the slowest of cars and instantly lose pursuers with basically zero resistance once you get a few streets away from the scene of the crime.

[h3]EXTRA: Also will shout out here, that Phantom Liberty, the expansion for the game takes all the positives of this game and basically DOUBLES it. Honestly the best content in the game and a must buy.[/h3]",True,1,0,2025-01-29 15:12:24

"The most immersive video game world I've ever experienced. There is no reason to not at least try it out.

Version 2.2 is CDPR at its peak. Shame that the game didn't release in this state in the first place, however the path towards it at least shows that they are willing to make a product they're proud of. Hopefully CDPR will continue to create great games in the Cyberpunk universe, just with an acceptable launch this time, now that they have a working baseline for the game.

"I’ll be honest—Cyberpunk 2077 had a rough start. But fast-forward to today, and it's a completely different game. CD Projekt Red stuck with it, refining and improving every aspect, turning Night City into one of the most immersive open worlds ever created.

🔹 Incredible Storytelling: The main narrative and side quests are top-tier, packed with emotional depth, memorable characters, and tough choices that actually matter.
🔹 Vibrant Open World: Night City feels alive—neon-lit streets, bustling markets, shady back alleys—every district has its own personality.
🔹 Deep RPG Elements: Perks, cyberware, and builds feel meaningful, allowing for a playstyle that fits YOU. Want to be a stealthy netrunner? A cyber-enhanced brawler? A gunslinging merc? The choice is yours.
🔹 Combat & Driving Overhaul (2.0 Update): Gunplay feels snappier, melee is brutal, and driving is finally smooth and responsive (with actual police chases!).
🔹 Phantom Liberty Expansion: If you love spy thrillers and action-packed missions, this DLC is an absolute must. Idris Elba’s performance is phenomenal!

Yes, Cyberpunk 2077 had its flaws at launch, but what matters is where it is now—a breathtaking, gripping, and polished RPG that truly delivers on its promise. If you were hesitant before, NOW is the perfect time to jump in.

The Story is amazing, the NPCs have so much personality and are unique and you just have to love them! I cared deeply for the side-quests. Even though I normally get burned out rather fast in other games when it comes to optional content, I simply had to help these people. No burnout in sight!

And the Gameplay is a blast as well! Nothing better than zooming across the map and slicing baddies up, feeling like a god~ 
You can customize your version of V however you want, being able to change your mind almost at any point! And due to that, the replayability is also very great in my opinion

"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game that fully delivers on its promise of an immersive, futuristic RPG experience. From its stunning open world to its engaging gameplay and memorable characters, everything comes together in a way that makes it one of the best games I’ve played.

World & Atmosphere – Night City is Incredible
The world is absolutely breathtaking. Night City feels alive, with insane attention to detail, neon-lit streets, and a dark, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in completely. Exploring the world is pure joy, whether you’re driving through the city or sneaking through high-tech buildings.

Story & Characters – A Strong Narrative
The main story is fantastic, with plenty of twists, emotional moments, and tough decisions. V is a great protagonist, and their story is engaging from start to finish. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic, and his interactions with V are a highlight of the game.

The side characters are well-written, with standout moments from Panam, Judy, River, and Rogue. Side quests don’t feel like filler—they add depth to the world and its inhabitants, making every interaction feel meaningful.

Gameplay – Fun and Engaging
The combat is excellent—gunplay feels great, hacking adds depth, and cyberware upgrades allow for tons of customization. Whether you prefer stealth, brute force, or a mix of both, the game lets you approach missions however you want.

Driving feels smooth, and exploring Night City never gets old. The RPG mechanics are well-done, with a good balance of progression, skill upgrades, and gear customization.

Final Thoughts – A Must-Play
Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has been polished into an excellent RPG. The world, story, and gameplay all come together to make an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you love open-world games with deep storytelling and exciting gameplay, this is definitely worth playing.

A fantastic game, and one I highly recommend!",True,2,0,2025-02-17 16:33:10

"Cyberpeak 2077 - Das beste Story-Game, was ich jemals gespielt habe!

Ja, das Spiel ist katastrophal gelauncht, aber dieses Review bezieht sich auf den Jetzt-Zustand auf PC und das GAME IST GEFIXXT.

Cyberpunk überzeugt mit seiner herausragenden Optik. Die Leuchreklamen, die Werbung, das Setting und vor allem die hohe Anzahl an NPCs lassen die Stadt (Night City) lebendig erscheinen. Es ist bemerkenswert, wie CD Projekt es geschafft hat, eine First-Person-City so massiv rüberkommen zu lassen. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie in einer dystopischen, futuristischen Megastadt, in der die Corps mehr Macht als Behörden oder Regierungen haben. Ein Grafikspektakel, das es so definitiv noch nicht gegeben hat. Die Welt so detailliert und immersiv, dass man sich wie ein Zeitzeuge vorkommt, wobei die Performance nicht schlecht ist. Die Werbung, die quasi überall zu finden ist, beinhaltet geilen Erwachsenenhumor und scheint darzustellen, wo wir uns als Gesellschaft hinbewegen. Im Allgemeinen ist das Setting von Cyberpunk sehr interessant. Dynamisches Wetter und vor Allem das Night-Life machen das Spiel nochmals atmosphärischer.

Night City ist nicht einfach nur eine dahingeklatschte Stadt, sondern hat Struktur. Es gibt verschiedene Viertel, in denen man verschiedene Leute antrifft. Pacifica ist zwar paradisisch, jedoch traut sich dort kein Polizist hin und es herrscht pures Chaos. Verlassene Shopping Malls, Skyscraper usw. Am Copo Plaza leben die Konzerner, die Reichen. Wolkenkratzer, fliegene Taxis und große Straßen. Die Badlands, eine Wüste, die Night City umgibt, ist voller Normaden und Plünderer, die die Menschen bedrohen. Jeder einzelne Distrikt ist verschieden und hat viel Neues zum Entdecken.

Es gibt so viel zutun, so viele Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. Das fängt schon bei den äußerlichen Merkmalen der Charaktererstellung an, wo man wirklich alles (auch das Genital) beliebig anpassen kann. Eine quasi unendlich große Auswahl an Kleidungsstile. Außerdem kann man sich mehrere Wohnungen (von billiig bis zu hoch luxuriös) kaufen und immer wieder Neues entdecken. Ein Porsche in Night City um 2077? - Gibt es, in gleich zwei Varianten und noch viele andere Autos. Genial ist auch, dass man diese zu jeder Zeit zu sich rufen kann (Taste V). Wer aber von langem Fahren aus GTA5 genervt ist, wird hier seinen Spaß haben, da es Quick-Travel gibt.

Hacken ist einfach nur grandios und simple gelöst. Man kann Gegner entweder leise und auffällig umbringen oder mit viel Aufruhr. Die ""Quickhacks"" sind einfach zu verstehen und es gibt so viele von ihnen, dass ich auch nach 70h immer noch nicht alle kenne. Autos kontrollieren, Gegner zum Suizid ""hacken"" und Granaten über gehackte Kameras aktivieren. Man kann seine Quickhacks erweitern und modifzieren. Waffen und Granaten gibt es auch ohne Ende. 

Bei den sogenannten Ripperdocs kann man seinen Körper anpassen und upgraden, wodurch man Fähigkeiten wie Double Jump oder Klingen statt Fäuste freischalten kann. Das Kämpfen ist also super individuell und fördert dutzende Spielstile. Looten kann man mögen oder nicht, aber das Lootsystem in diesem Spiel ist einfach nur perfekt. Allgemein ist die Menüführung extrem einfach und man findet sich schnell zurecht.

Der Skill-Tree ist einer der komplexesten, die ich je gesehen habe, was aber gut ist. Man hat verschiedene Bereiche, auf die man seinen Charakter leveln kann. So z.B. Hacken, Weaponhandling oder Movement. Jeder Bereich beinhaltet um die 30 Upgrades, die man frei wählen kann. Es gibt aber auch Upgrades, die man durch reines Spielen freischaltet und nicht auswählen kann.

Es gibt viele Dinge, die man in der Open-World tun kann. Bars, Clubs, JoyToys (xD), Autorennen, Verbrecherjagden und vieles mehr.

Nun zu dem, was das Spiel zu einem wirklichen Meisterwerk macht: Die Charaktere und die Story

Die Charaktere sind tiefgreifend und jeder hat seine eigene Story, die nahezu perfekt übermittelt wird. Sie haben Emotionen in Form von Mimik und Gestik, die man in kaum einem Spiel erlebt. Das Interagieren mit den Charakteren ist ebenfalls sehr gängig gestaltet und ruft verschiedene Reaktionen hervor. Humor, Ernsthaftigkeit und Bezüge zu vorher Passiertem machen die Konversationen lebendig und unterhaltsam. Vor allem die Charaktere Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves), Jackie und Panam sind perfekt geschriebene Charaktere, die einen durch die Story begleiten.

Die Story ist das Herzstück des Spiels. Sie ist komplex, aber dennoch gut verständlich, wenn man gut aufpasst. Anders als in vielen anderen Spielen ist die Story jedoch nicht vorhersehbar, was einen sowohl schocken als auch faszinieren kann. Es gibt verschiede Anfänge der Story und verschiedene Wege, wie die Story endet. Das Auge fürs Detail hatten die Entwickler. So unterhalten sich NPCs über Geschehnisse, die durch die Story in NC passiert sind und auch Narichtensender, die man in jedem Fahrstuhl unausweichlich hört, thematisieren Story Relevantes.

Man kann Side-Gigs machen, die einen mehr in das Stadtleben eindringen lassen. Auch Nebenmissionen mit eigenen Charakteren gibt es, die sowohl spannend sind als auch dazu beitragen, die Welt von 2077 zu verstehen.

Was ich auch bemerkenswert finde, ist die Synchro, sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch. Man erkennt auf beiden Sprachen viele bekannte Synchronsprecher. Das Auge fürs Detail ist nicht nur bei der Story mit an Bord, sondern auch, wenn es um Easter Eggs, die sich auf CD Projects Spiele wie Witcher 3 beziehen, geht.

Alles in Allem für mich ein 10/10 Game, da das Setting und die Story fesselnd und einzigartig sind, die Welt von 2077 quasi unendlich lange erkundbar ist und die Charaktere. 
Absolute Kaufempfehlung, vor allem, wenn es im Sale ist. 

Das ist das Geld, jeden Euro, wert, sofern man Open-World Story Games mag. Ein vergleichbares Spiel, mit einer immersiveren Welt und tiefgreifenderen Charakteren gibt es einfach noch nicht.",True,2,0,2025-02-10 23:55:27

"Wow, what a game! Just about everything in this game is spot on the way I like my games to be. First of all, it ran flawlessly and I never had a single crash. There was on part of the story early on that had a bug, and its documented. I had to change a few graphics settings to get through it, but luckily it never happened again. 99% of the game is flawless.
The audio in the game is great, I played it on dolby 5.1 on my Yamaha receiver. The graphics are very impressive. It took me a bit to get the HDR set right, but other than that I got a good average fps of about 85 to 90 played on my 3440x1440 UWS using my rtx 3080ti. It looked wonderful. Ultra wide screen was done great. I didnt pick up on any artifacts like stretched screen with that.
The story is great, and the voice acting is decent. Of course Keanu Reeves is in it and he has a major role in it. His voice is all through the game as well as his likeness. The DLC is well worth the price, if you get this game be sure to purchase that as well. I think there are alternate endings to this, and I liked mine ok. The ending was realistic and satisfying because of that. 
If you like role playing games that focus on the story then this is a game for you. The gameplay itself is really fun too. Its got a good amount of cutscenes, but there is plenty of free roaming in the city and lots of side quests. I played every quest there was I think, and got 148 hours out of the game. Its well worth what you spend.",True,1,0,2025-02-08 03:41:24

"Cyberpunk 2077 Review

🟡 Introduction

I bought Cyberpunk 2077 a year after its release in 2021, and at that stage, the game was in a rough state due to numerous bugs, performance issues, and missing mechanics that could have enhanced the experience. However, despite these issues, I still found enjoyment in the base game, which offered an incredible story and engaging missions. Over time, as updates improved the game, I grew to appreciate it even more. With the release of the Phantom Liberty DLC and the influence of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the game has transformed into a truly immersive cyberpunk experience that finally delivers on its original promise.

🔵 Story & Worldbuilding

The narrative of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of its strongest elements. Playing as V, a mercenary trying to make a name in Night City, you get entangled in a high-stakes conspiracy after implanting a bio-chip containing the consciousness of Johnny Silverhand, portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The story is deeply engaging, with multiple branching paths that allow players to shape V's fate. The emotional weight of the story varies based on choices, making each playthrough unique.

The side quests are just as compelling as the main story, often surpassing it in terms of emotional depth and character development. Quests like Sinnerman and Dream On showcase the philosophical and ethical dilemmas that define cyberpunk fiction. Meeting various characters, from rogue AI to rebellious cyberpunks, makes every interaction meaningful. The romances in the game add another layer of depth, with Judy, Panam, River, and Kerry each offering distinct and well-written relationship arcs.

🌆 Night City is a well-crafted setting that offers plenty to explore. Each district—from the neon-lit streets of Japantown to the corporate-controlled City Center—feels distinct. Random events, like cyber psycho encounters or gang skirmishes, make the city feel unpredictable. The small touches, like hearing snippets of NPC conversations or seeing braindance advertisements on giant billboards, add to the immersion.

🔴 Gameplay & Mechanics

Cyberpunk 2077 blends first-person shooter mechanics with deep RPG elements. The combat system allows players to approach fights in different ways: hacking enemies as a netrunner, going full-on melee with Mantis Blades, or using brute firepower to tear through enemies. The gunplay has significantly improved with patches, making combat feel more responsive and satisfying.

The hacking mechanics are a highlight, allowing for creative approaches to combat. Players can disable cameras, detonate grenades remotely, or even force enemies to commit suicide. Sandevistan builds offer another playstyle, slowing down time for deadly precision strikes, making you feel like a cybernetic samurai. Each playstyle is viable, offering a range of tactical depth that was initially missing at launch.

🚗 Vehicle Combat & Driving: The driving mechanics were one of the weakest aspects of the original release but have been improved considerably. Vehicle combat, added in later updates, allows for high-speed chases and shootouts, adding more excitement to the world.

🟣 Character Creation & Customization

The character creation in Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most detailed in modern RPGs. Players can choose their gender, voice, and physical appearance, allowing for full customization of V. The inclusion of trans characters and non-binary customization options makes Cyberpunk 2077 stand out in terms of representation. The ability to modify cyberware further expands customization, letting players build a truly unique version of V.

👗 Transmog System: The transmog system, added post-launch, is a fantastic improvement. It allows players to wear any outfit while keeping the best armor stats, solving the issue of mismatched clothing that plagued the launch version. This feature enhances both immersion and style, allowing players to dress V according to their personal vision.

🟢 Phantom Liberty DLC & Edgerunners Influence

The Phantom Liberty DLC is a game-changer, bringing in new mechanics, improved AI, and an engaging spy-thriller storyline. It adds Dogtown, a district filled with political intrigue, espionage, and high-stakes missions. The new characters, especially Solomon Reed, add more layers to V’s journey. The choices made in Phantom Liberty feel weighty, impacting the core narrative in meaningful ways.

Beyond the DLC, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners left a lasting impact on the game’s identity. The anime expanded the lore of Night City and introduced unforgettable characters like David Martinez and Rebecca. The game now includes references to Edgerunners, such as weapons and clothing from the show, deepening the connection between both mediums. Finding Rebecca’s shotgun in the game is a fun nod to fans of the anime, making it feel like an integral part of the Cyberpunk universe.

🟠 Modding Community & Enhancements

One of the most exciting aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 is the modding scene. The game’s support for mods allows players to fine-tune and expand their experience beyond what CD Projekt Red offers. With over 300+ mods installed, I can confidently say that modding makes the game exponentially better.

From quality-of-life improvements to entirely new gameplay mechanics, modding lets players tailor the game to their preferences. Mods enhance clothing variety, improve AI behavior, add new weapons, and even introduce new districts or quests. While it might seem odd that modding is needed to polish certain aspects of the game, it truly elevates Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its vanilla state.

🏆 Final Thoughts

Despite its disastrous launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has evolved into a masterpiece of sci-fi RPG storytelling. With the Phantom Liberty DLC and continuous updates, the game is finally what it was meant to be. The deep character interactions, expansive world, and improved mechanics make it a must-play for fans of the cyberpunk genre. While some issues remain, such as occasional AI quirks and underdeveloped side activities, the overall experience is phenomenal.

If you’re new to Cyberpunk 2077, now is the perfect time to dive in. Whether you're exploring Night City as a cunning netrunner, a ruthless solo, or a corporate infiltrator, the game offers something for everyone.

"Walked through the city

10/10 felt immersive",True,5,0,2025-02-02 17:07:17
"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that, every time I opened it, hit every dopamine and serotonin receptor. I was completely immersed in a world full of dystopian complexities, rebellion against the system, and characters who, whether bound by friendship, love, or pure hatred, all leave their mark on Night City. Some forge deep connections, others clash violently, but in the end, every action—every presence—shapes the world around them.

If you enjoyed Watch Dogs 2 or Mirror’s Edge, you’d understand that I’m a sucker for kinship-core themes. The way the world and its characters interact isn’t about heroes or villains—it’s just survival in a world of moral absurdity. If visualized, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting—chaotic, layered, and unpredictable.

Running along that edge, you witness the beauty and tragedy of those who push themselves to the brink—some reaching glory, others barely scratching it before falling. In Night City, it’s common practice to live off poisons—sex, drugs, anything to numb the pain or slip away from a world that no longer feels like home. A world already claimed by others, where your misfortune is just another commodity to exploit.

The edge is the only way to truly live—and to die. But those who die loud enough, those who burn bright before they fade, become more than just memories. They become legends. They are the sparks that ignite humanity’s resistance to oppression, the embers that refuse to be snuffed out.

And that, to me, is mesmerizing—or dare I say, breathtaking.",True,1,0,2025-02-04 15:38:49
"Highly recommend, great story line, multiple endings, relationships and more. I really wish there was more tbh. I played this on ps5 and wanted to see how it ran on my PC so I bought it again. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple endings and your choices affect the outcome. Not for kids, so parents be warned there if full on nudity in the game. 
 Wish I could find more games like this. Cannot get enough of this game.",True,1,0,2025-02-20 22:49:00
"I really wanted to like this game, but I guess it's just not for me. The character customization is much better than any other game I've played, so I'll give it that. But the story was hard to get invested in, the gameplay is just okay enough to be entertaining but not as in depth as I'd like for the genre, it's way too easy to become OP and stops being challenging around the 2/5 mark even if you set it to a higher difficulty... Realistically, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. I hope anyone else that tries it likes it more than I did, and you likely will; This game's gotta be marked overwhelmingly positive for a reason.",True,1,0,2025-02-26 08:14:53

"[h1] game of the millenia [/h1]

I bought the deluxe version of this game off of amazon for 25$ back in 2021 and although the bugs were terrible and the frame rate and overall optimization of the game was terrible, the story had me so immersed into the world, i'd never been so interested in a story until i played this, I love all the fun weird weapons in the game and all the cyberware, vehicles and clothing fit right into the universe, I absolutely loved each character and all the twists and turns that the game had to offer, i was so glad to hear that the game was finally getting fixed and that there was a new dlc coming out, on that note the dlc was phenomenal, i love idris elba so i was bound to like his character and it was well deserved I think, I always was interested in the way this game dealt with concepts like rogue ai and cyberspace and this continues to open up that world even more in a way thats both scary and cool at the same time and also *spoilers* [spoiler] the part in the dlc with the rogue ai controlled robot hunting you down like it's alien isolation was my favorite moment ever from that dlc [/spoiler] but back to the main game, the story of cyberpunk is amazing, it is both tragic and beautiful, it's tone and themes explored across the game are always so interesting and usually are always leaving you with more questions than answers, which I think grounds our charcater really well, showing us that there's always something bigger going on in the background, this game can be scary, leaving you shocked at the mission you just played or it can be emotional, sometimes its the funniest shit you've ever seen and I believe this game has it all, and don't even get me started on how much I love keanu reeves in this game in his role as johnny silverhand(they actually have music made by samurai you can listen to you should  def check it out) in my opinion this is one of the best games I've ever played and everyone should get the chance to experience this game at least once, I guarantee you'll have a good time with it, trust.",True,1,0,2025-01-31 02:00:18

"Probably one of the few games that is open exploration that I enjoy immensely.

The story of the main questlines are okay, a few of them are extremely gimmicky but I'd much rather just go in guns blazing for sake of the fact its quicker and easier than just having to stealth around all the bloody time.

I mostly just enjoy doing the side quests, bumping into random events, and doing the NCPD assaults. It is simply insane just how much money and experience you can get doing that--and by the time I finished only two districts in Night City, I was already max Street Cred.

The game has a strong emphasis on 'play how you want to play' and doesn't really punish you that heavily.

Yes, the game has a Wanted system that functions almost identically to the one in GTA V but its actually leagues above and beyond in terms of quality compared to that one. How?

Let's observe how it functions in GTA V first--In GTA V when you get wanted levels, cops instantly know where you are and home in on you like missiles, they will actively hunt you down and even go into side alleys, above and below ground level, and will even use flying copters to track you down until the cops find you and kill you. The likelihood of getting away from the Cops in GTA V is very minimal unless you have every street memorized or having hiding spots planned ahead of time.

In Cyberpunk 2077, the Cops are lazy. If you literally just stay away from the roads, hide behind buildings or on rooftops or stay underground; the cops will literally get bored of trying to find you and go do something else. The Cops in this game, as well--also unlike in GTA V--are extremely weak. You can blaze through most NCPD units without much effort. Then they send in armored units which can be a bit tougher, but are manageable. But if you are truly determined to turn Night City into a Warzone you will have to contend with something that puts even the Military in GTA V to utter shame--MaxTac.

MaxTac are essentially mini-bosses that come in squadrons of 4 after you reach 5 Wanted stars and continue to become a pain in the city's butt. Depending on your own level, the difficulty, your gear and your setup you can either mow them down easily (keep in mind they are literal bloody hit point sinks) or they will blow you away within seconds. But if you manage to kill them, you do get a rare chance of obtaining some of their MaxTac gear, from what I understand.

All in all, this game by CDProjektRed is probably one of my most enjoyed experiences in the entirety of my time playing any computer game and even when I play the game overly-much and burn myself out and come back later? I can get right back into the groove of things because of one of THE best character systems I have EVER seen in a video game.

The Character Attributes and Perks system.

In this game, you have attributes which help you do most any kind of thing. Same with Perks, with assist with all manner of thing--both combat and non-combat.

Want to be a Bulldozer and just plow through everything with nothing but a baseball bat, and being so armored that nothing can take you down? Check.

Want to be that stealthy cyberninja that is able to throw daggers that can instantly down unalerted enemies, or use a silenced pistol in order to blow off the head of some gangster? Check.

Want to be the most powerful cyberhacker (netrunner) who is capable of detonating the car of a bunch of gangsters chasing after you? Check.

And that's not all--you are able to completely refund EVERY attribute and perk, for free, in order to try out a DIFFERENT build later so there is NO way to screw up your game by having invested into the wrong, crappy build.

I rarely feel this way about games lately, but to me? This game gets a bloody 10 out of 10. Perfect in every bloody way. THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN A GOOD GAME, TRIPLE A PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS. TAKE BLOODY NOTES!",True,0,0,2025-02-26 13:06:10

" 	Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few years you know how chaotic the release for this game was. Now I can confidently say that all that’s in the past. My first playthrough a few months after release had me underwhelmed and I just stopped midway through the game. But I recently played the Witcher 3 and enjoyed it enough so that I wanted to give Cyberpunk a second chance, and boy was I in for a good trip ! Most if not all bugs have been fixed, the balance and overall systems have been redone for the best and now the game is a real treat to play. 
 	Much like the Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC, Phantom Liberty is a must, better than the base game in some ways and it offers the best missions, so make sure to get it along the base game. The best time to play it  - I find - is right before going to the point of no return.
 Additionally here are a few tips that made my playthrough more enjoyable :

- Cars are mostly fixed but motorcycles feel and drive much better, I went for the Yaiba Kusagani CT3X as soon as  I could afford it and stuck with it for the remainder of my playthrough.

-Night City is clearly the jewel of this game and probably the best city ever made for a video game, so don’t use fast travel and don’t skip rides as often as you can you’d be missing out on a lot of gorgeous places to just drive through.

-You can disable the annoying RPG hitpoints that spill out of enemies when you hit them, to get a more traditional FPS feel. Doing so doesn’t hinder you at any point and bosses still have a health bar. The game looks and feels much better that way IMO.

-Do all the gigs and side missions, they are nice.

-Phantom Liberty has the best gigs and side missions so get it !

"cant stress enough how much this game is the best game I played everything you do matters every choice will make you miss some part of story or experience said story, every little detail amazes me even in the world you will find random stories unrelated to any quest that will break your heart or leave you amazed just impressive however strongly suggest you play with the DLC as the polish and world building it gives seems necessary",True,0,0,2025-02-26 08:07:15
"(I grant this game 9/10 Shards this game is nova!)

This game is so great i had to buy it for 80 Euro's after pirating it.
First off i had pirated this game as i was skeptical with its launch since i was waiting on this game for years. After getting close to the end i saw how great th9is game was after Phantom Liberty released and i bought it simply bringing over my savefile. The story is really fun and great, Characters have actual personality, Music that truly matches the universe , Fun weapon play, Diffrent playstyles with no locked in classes. DO i need to say more? No? Because i am going to say more the DLC enchances the game from about an 8/10 to a 9/10 it is simply that good with new locations in a large dangerous chunck off night city with sidequests and new variations off old things like criminal activity. The main game can feel shrt compared to other games yet the amount off voiced and rewarding sidequests its really great to walk around the world and do those.

"It's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. I've completed all the endings, gained all the achievements, but I still get pulled back into playing this well crafted world. 

Playing this game is an other-worldly experience, one I wish I could experience new again. Night City is like a beautiful rose with thorns in every corner, with the permanent choices you have to make. I have never played a game with such immersive characters with exceptional voice acting, and an amazing story. 

Additionally, Phantom Liberty feels like a whole new game alone, the craftsmanship is incredible and I was amazed that this game could get any better. 

This is my favourite game of all time, and definitely the best story game I have ever played, and I can't wait for any future games CD PROJEKT RED release. I couldn't recommend this game enough, it is a work of art. But remember, there's no happy endings in Night City.

"Disclaimer: Played this after the 2.0 patch and with the Phantom Liberty DLC active.

If you like RPGs and guns, this game is for you. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best open-world RPGs ever made, thanks to its immersive storyline, deep character development, and refined gameplay mechanics. The skill tree and cyberware system allow for diverse and dynamic builds, whether you prefer a stealthy netrunner hacking enemies from the shadows, a brute-force cybernetic brawler, or a gunslinger with pinpoint accuracy. Combat feels smooth and responsive, with a good AI for both enemies and NPCs, making engagements rewarding. The UI is good but not the best in class and most consumables are an after thought in most situations. Also, the vehicle combat is good but not great, as it can feel a bit awkward at times depending on vehicle type. 

The Phantom Liberty expansion delivers a fantastic main story and a wealth of side content, all wrapped in an espionage-driven narrative. Personally, I found its storyline even better than the base game's main story. One thing’s for sure—the DLC is well worth the extra money, as it alone adds 20–30 hours of content with a proper playthrough.

Is it better than The Witcher 3? I’d say it reaches about 90% of that masterpiece in its current state. However, it’s still not a problem-free experience. While the game runs significantly better than at launch (from what I've read), I still encountered occasional issues, especially towards the endgame. NPC pathing can be awkward, frame rate drops occur in certain areas, and I experienced two random crashes in my 100-hour playthrough. 

That said, if you’ve been hesitant to jump in, now is the best time to experience Cyberpunk 2077 as it was meant to be played.",True,0,0,2025-02-24 20:59:13

It took me a while to really get to know the lore and the world, but the combat was fun pretty much from the beginning. I focused my build around only using blades (both katanas and throwing knives) and by the end I felt so powerful. I fell in love with the characters and ended up doing pretty much everything there is to do in my first playthrough, and even after 200 hours I wanted more. I just never got tired of Night City. I loved the themes around loss, impending death, and anti-capitalism. Even after putting the game down I couldn't stop thinking about it.

Went through hell, and back is what this game is, the story is just truly exceptional, Detroit Become Human like emotions, gameplay mechanics are exceptional, and the game truly deserves the spotlight it got.

CDPR, instead of being greedy and taking the money were like - hell nah, we will improve the game and make it good, and that's what they did. The tie ins with Edgerunners too - nostalgia and emotion inducing!

Have high hopes for Cyberpunk Orion now, and my favorite ending - (DON'T) Fear The Reaper. A satisfying conclusion to the game in every way, though yes, tough, but rewarding. Got 122 hours now, and still, haven't had enough of it.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is one wild ride—exactly the kind of chaotic, neon-drenched adventure I live for. I jumped into Night City expecting an immersive, futuristic playground, and honestly, it mostly delivered on that promise. The city’s vibe is unreal: slick visuals, a killer soundtrack, and characters who feel like they’ve stepped right off the edge of society. Every corner has its own story, and it’s hard not to get caught up in the sheer ambition of it all.

That said, the game isn’t without its quirks. Just when I was vibing with the narrative, some glitch or performance hiccup would yank me back to reality. It’s like trying to enjoy a high-energy concert when someone keeps hitting the pause button—annoying and a bit out of sync with the hype. Still, these moments rarely detract from the overall experience; they just add a layer of unpredictability to an already unpredictable world.

At its core, Cyberpunk 2077 is a bold experiment—a game that dares to push boundaries even if it sometimes stumbles over its own ambition. If you’re down for a ride that’s as flawed as it is fascinating, then Night City is calling your name. It’s messy, it’s imperfect, but damn, it’s an experience you won’t forget.",True,0,0,2025-02-24 06:25:17

"How do you describe Cyberpunk? A difficult question honestly.

The game is designed off of it's TTRPG counterpart Cyberpunk: red, Cyberpunk 2020, and Cyberpunk 2013, written by Mike Pondsmith, Cyberpunk is his brainchild.

This game does a perfect job of displaying and evolving the story, narritive, and style these table top games go for. 

With the updates that have been brought fourth the game is fun, and engaging, wonderfully intriquite systems, rarely will you see a bug anymore. and the story, gameplay, and art direction is exquisite!

"Alright, so Cyberpunk 2077 is basically the definition of a wild ride. You’re in a futuristic dystopia with neon lights everywhere, hacking into stuff, and doing some crazy missions, all while being chased by shady corporations and a city full of weirdos. It’s like Blade Runner meets GTA, but with way more glitches (seriously, way more).

The world is HUGE, and you’ll spend hours driving around, getting into random fights, or hacking into anything that moves. The story is solid, and the side quests are, well, a lot. You can get distracted by a million things and never actually get back to the main story. But honestly, who cares? The world is so cool, you’ll just get lost in it.

The best part? The characters. They’re messed up, hilarious, and some of them will make you question your life choices. Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand? Pure legend. But the game is also not without its bugs, and sometimes you’ll see people floating mid-air or driving cars in reverse for no reason. It’s all part of the charm, right?

In short, Cyberpunk 2077 is chaotic, full of glitches, but super fun. It’s a cyberpunk dream with just a few nightmares thrown in. If you can handle the chaos, you’ll have a blast.

 The game is able to capture the very essence of cyberpunk and transport players to a world of technology, crime, and dark alleys. The gameplay mechanics are also incredibly immersive, giving players a sense of control and agency within the world.

"When Cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it was a game full of potential that struggled under the weight of expectations. Now, after years of updates and the incredible Phantom Liberty DLC, it has become one of the most immersive and rewarding RPG experiences I’ve ever played.

What really hooked me was the different endings. Every choice felt significant, and after finishing the game once, I couldn't resist jumping back in to see how things would play out with different decisions. Each ending added new layers to the story and characters, making Night City feel more alive than ever.

Then came Phantom Liberty, which wasn’t just a simple expansion—it was a full-blown upgrade to the game. The new district, Dogtown, was packed with intrigue, new mechanics, and some of the best storytelling in the game. Idris Elba’s performance as Solomon Reed added so much depth, and the spy-thriller narrative felt distinct from the base game while still fitting perfectly into the world of Cyberpunk 2077.

And the crazy part? I haven’t even scratched the surface of mods yet. The community has been pumping out incredible content that enhances visuals, adds gameplay tweaks, and even introduces new quests. With modding, my time in Night City is far from over.

If you were hesitant about Cyberpunk 2077 at launch, now is the time to dive in. Between multiple endings, the Phantom Liberty DLC, and the endless possibilities of modding, this game keeps pulling me back in—and I don’t see myself stopping anytime soon.",True,0,0,2025-02-22 19:57:14

Stealth is limited at first but the more you level and unlock the more fun and versatile it gets.

There's a lot of cool music but I wish I could listen to the radio during missions. The music is also way mastered way too densely, in a way that ear fatigue sets in fast. I'd also like more customization for the cars. Having the custom paintjob vanish whenever you exit the vehicle is stupid.

"Cyberpunk is one of my favorite games of all time and honestly has affected my life in so many ways. It’s definitely one of those games that gets you thinking about the future of technology and what is possible. Its even inspired my own personal studies and interests professionally.

Let’s dive in- I know the game had a rocky launch, but where the game is at now is incredible. Even before all of the bug fixes, I really never came across anything too game breaking so no complaints there. Currently, I think the game is pretty optimized for the amount of data that needs to be loaded in and what is generated in the game.

The game is one of the most beautiful games you will ever play. An immersive futuristic city with advancing technology every place you look. Add in an incredible musical score and you’ve got something profound.

Regarding the story, I have to say it’s one of the best I’ve played through. I found it pretty cool that there are many different ways to play the game which alter relationships with characters as well as the endings. It really makes you feel like you are the one responsible for your decisions which I’ve never really experienced in gaming before. There are SOO many things to do outside of the main story too, but honestly even if you just played the main missions you couldn’t go wrong. 

The mechanics and customization have been perfected. I love love love the new system and how to spend attributes. Really glad they put some thought into making it even better than it was before.

The DLC is super good. Very fast paced and exhilarating with fun new characters and lore that ties into the main game. Definitely recommend buying and playing through at your own pace before completing the main story.

I really don’t have an area of the game that I didn’t like. That said however, I still wish they would have added some form of Co-op.  Can only imagine how fun this would have been been playing with a friend of mine.

This is the type of game where you could drive by an entire beach side slum packed with detail and never even engage with it. The world designers for this are quite literally the best in the world. The story is also top class. Only thing I can say is that ""very hard"" difficulty isn't very hard, but a simple mod to double damage turned the game into Dark Souls which I am happy with.

"This game was good. 
It had its ups and downs. I got it in the sale lately, and enjoyed it so much I got Phantom Liberty midway through the story. After 4 years of updates or so, I was thinking there would be very few bugs left.
This is not the case. Car summoning especially frequently breaks, often your cars will spawn 20 feet in the air or land upside down or any of a number of things. There are a great variety of minor bugs, but that didn't distract me from the important thing- there are no game breaking bugs.
Aside from Adam Smasher getting stuck in the air for 45 seconds or so (which was much appreciated) no bugs especially annoyed me or felt like they were ruining key parts of the game. \

The reason this game is so good, to me, is two reasons- the sheer amount of content and the writing. The map itself comes in at a close 3rd, but the first two really stood out to me. Maybe it's because I played Once Human lately, with its unvoiced, cheap side quests, but how thought out each and every side quest was, how each had a professional level of voice acting and graphics and cutscenes, really kept me immersed throughout this long, long, playthrough. And I hardly got everything done. This in conjunction with the writing itself. Especially in Phantom Liberty, YOUR CHOICES MATTER. The game makes it known when you're making a key decision and the consequences of your actions can be wildly different. I missed hours of gameplay and content because I made certain decisions that steered me away. Maybe I just haven't played enough story-driven games but the long timelines branching and their effects later on impressed me in a world where there is already so much to do. 
Further on, the writing was just GOOD. Romances felt realistic, characters felt real, and every other side quest had a moral dilemma to make you question yourself and the very way you think about things.
I didn't select the right dialogue for the secret ending, so I lost about 15 hours of progress going back, but this game was a solid 9/10.",True,0,0,2025-02-21 23:10:04

"Read reviews from when this game first came out---people complaining about how unplayably buggy it was, etc. Like most games I'm interested in I got on the train after the devs worked those out and the complainers weeded themselves out for the most part. There isn't a very long list of cyberpunk games to compare this to---there's Shadowrun, the 1980s Neuromancer adaptation, and a few indie titles...the open world format of this game is what makes it for me along with the IMO pretty generous range of options for character specialization within a story-based RPG where you play a specific character within that story. Combat and other elements are fun once you get an idea which perks you want to go with and build off them and well integrated into the rest of the game.

"This game has been through the wringer since its release, and I’ll be honest—I was skeptical going in. But after spending a good chunk of time in Night City, I can say it’s a mixed bag of brilliance and frustration. It’s not the flawless masterpiece some were hoping for, but it’s also not the dumpster fire some made it out to be. Here’s the deal:

The Good:
First off, Night City is stunning. The world-building is incredible, and the city feels alive in a way few open worlds do. The neon lights, the towering skyscrapers, the grimy back alleys—it’s all dripping with atmosphere. Walking (or driving) through the city at night is an experience in itself, especially with the soundtrack blasting. Speaking of which, the music is fantastic. From synthwave bangers to gritty rap tracks, the soundtrack nails the cyberpunk vibe.

The story is another highlight. Without spoiling anything, the main questline is gripping, and there are some genuinely emotional moments that hit hard. Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand? Yeah, he’s awesome. The side quests are where the game really shines, though. Some of them are so well-written and layered that they feel like they could be their own games. Characters like Judy, Panam, and River are memorable, and their stories add a lot of depth to the world.

Combat is fun, too. Whether you’re going in guns blazing, hacking enemies from afar, or slicing them up with a katana, there’s a lot of flexibility in how you approach fights. The RPG elements, like upgrading your cyberware and customizing your build, add a nice layer of strategy.

The Bad:
Now, let’s address the elephant in the room: the bugs. Yes, they’re still there. I didn’t experience anything game-breaking, but there were plenty of glitches—floating objects, NPCs T-posing, weird physics, and the occasional crash. It’s not as bad as it was at launch, but it’s still frustrating, especially in a game that’s been out for this long.

The AI is another weak point. Enemy AI is pretty basic, and the police system feels half-baked. If you commit a crime, cops just spawn out of nowhere, and there’s no real chase or pursuit mechanic. It’s disappointing, especially in a game that’s supposed to be about immersion.

The driving mechanics are also hit-or-miss. Some vehicles handle well, while others feel like you’re driving on ice. And while the world looks amazing, it doesn’t always feel as interactive as it should. There are a lot of cool-looking places you can’t actually explore, which is a bummer.

The Ugly (But Not Deal-Breaking):
The game’s performance can be hit-or-miss, even on decent hardware. I had to tweak the settings a lot to get it running smoothly, and even then, there were moments of frame rate drops. If you’re playing on an older system, you might struggle.

Also, the hype train did this game no favors. It was marketed as this groundbreaking, genre-defining experience, and while it’s good, it’s not that. It’s a solid RPG with some fantastic moments, but it doesn’t live up to the astronomical expectations set by its marketing.

Final Thoughts:
Cyberpunk 2077 is a game of extremes. When it’s good, it’s really good—like, “stay up until 3 AM because you’re hooked” good. But when it’s bad, it’s hard to ignore the flaws. If you can look past the bugs and the occasional jank, there’s a lot to love here. The world, the characters, and the stories are worth experiencing, especially if you’re a fan of the cyberpunk genre.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but with caveats. If you’re on the fence, maybe wait for a sale or until CD Projekt Red releases more patches. It’s not perfect, but it’s a journey worth taking—if you’re willing to put up with its rough edges.

"This game is ALMOST perfect. The story is engaging, the graphics and character customizations are beautiful, the replayability is great! You can follow the main story or you can go out and do your own thing for hundreds of hours. The easy mode is laid back and relaxing for a player like me that doesn't want to die all the time, however, my husband likes a challenge and enjoys the hard and hardcore modes for how complex combat is. There are NPCs you can romance, but don't have to. They have thought of almost everything that makes a game perfect. The only thing missing is a co-op option.

"One of the first games of the past very boring 5 years in gaming to give me such mixed feelings. 

Cyberpunk is a lot like crack in that it’ll give you the greatest highs, and some really low lows. It reminds me of initial Overwatch, except I wouldn’t play it for as long (though it has a lot of longevity). It dangles its best at you like a carrot on a stick and for every Judy questline diving for fucking nothing you get the incredible heist cutscenes and the FANTASTIC Maelstrom job. For every boring ass River Ward quest gunning down PNGs in ghetto Virtual Boys with 14 year olds, you experience the literal best fucking open world in the history of forever. And it’s not even close. I don’t care how much more practical every other one is, NC is so stunning that everything else wasn’t a comparison. 

Unfortunately, the game is foretold to be “beyond a hecking RPG” as always, but it doesn’t scratch the same itch with New Vegas where we missed the opportunity for true gang affiliation. In fact, I would just argue that Cyberpunk is your fairly average RPG experience. But it is a VERY VERY good one. I will warn you now that when you boot this game up, yes, you will be sitting in fucking car rides with Judy or Steve or whoever the fuck listening to them as you gaze at the (admittedly beautiful) landscape of NC. It is exactly the same shit Rockstar does but…oh well, RPG does as RPG is. If you can stomach it, go ahead, otherwise after the initial 15-20 hours you’ll be not wanting to do the side quests. 

Now, bar those warnings, when this game does good, goddamn is it fucking good. The combat is fucking amazing, and, no joke, shifting from Kerenzikovs, Sandevistans, being the second coming of Neo with a revolver and katana, deflecting bullets…bro. The combat is sex when you get your augments. This, alongside build potential with shottys, netrunning, sandys, berserk and the likes probably give the game a lot of the longevity people say it’s got. Mechs are annoying. Smart pistols were a mistake when the point of one of reflexes passives is to make you extraordinarily slippery when fast… Apart from that, and maybe how stupidly strong V gets at endgame to the point that you stop taking average encounters seriously, the combat is always a high point.

Secondly, the story is above the scop you get in a lot of games nowadays, and I found it pleasantly different and appealing. Johnny Silverhand was my favourite character and while the game fumbles the two a bit at the end (depending on if you get the Sun ending) no one can deny that you, mulling with Johnny, only for the two of you to go “fuck it, no one else needs to die but us. Let’s just go in and if we die we die if we don’t WE WON” isn’t badass. Again, the scenes it does right, the scenes it KNOWS it needs to do right are ALWAYS the best. I just wish the coolest ending wasn’t timegated to 4 choices in Chippin’ In and literally waiting 5 fucking minutes.

It’s music? 50/50 ass and 50/50 amazing. (that’s a recurring theme) Trust me guys, “I Really Wanna Stay At Your House” isn’t worth Grimes shit ass albums clogging up the FM. Just use Vexelstrom. 100% good.

The cars? Come on Projekt Red. You guys weren’t even trying to be futuristic bar like 4 cars maybe. The handling of the cool cars, like the car you get from “Sex on Wheels” or whatever, is also fucking ASS. I was really disappointed there too since I was stuck on using the Outlaw most of the game.

With a second game, I genuinely think we can have something special. The hard parts that Bethesda never gets right is there. Story, gameplay, cinematics. All of the easy parts are what’s left. More ways to spend money. More of what we have. Iron it out. Literally, all you have to do is that and I will be shitting out a 9/10 for free but Cyberpunk rn, for a hardass gaming cynic like me, is a good 7/10. Maybe even an 8.

"It felt like I was becoming the engram of my own V—like I’d accidentally downloaded myself into Night City, glitches and all. Escaping into this chaotic, neon-soaked reality wasn’t just about emotions; it was like therapy… but with more cyberware and significantly worse life choices. The connection I felt to the characters was so strong that I started questioning whether I was V or if V was me (existential crisis, but make it cyberpunk).

There were moments when I genuinely wanted to live in that world—until I remembered the gangs, corrupt corpos, and the fact that my apartment in Night City is somehow messier than my real one. Still, I felt their struggles, their joys, and occasionally their poor decision-making skills as if they were my own.

Cyberpunk 2077 has carved out a special place in my heart—right next to the neural implant I didn’t ask for—where fantasy, reality, and a whole lot of bugs beautifully intertwine.

"Through it's rocky start and subsequent series of updates and improvements, Cyberpunk 2077 has always excelled in its environment, story, and characters. Night City presents an impressive sense of scale while providing consistent visual patterns across different sections of the city. This keeps the player grounded to more localized settings, which helps keep the city to feel alive rather than hollow. The depictions of technological advancement in Night City also place it in the sweet spot of being advanced beyond modern day without extending too far into the future (i.e. the city has the tech but it also has the grunge). The game's story begins with ""the relic"", a conceptually interesting idea, and is able to turn it into a compelling narrative. I think the story's best attribute is the balance between its focus on technological problems and human problems; the need for sci-fi tech mumbo-jumbo is sufficiently met, but there's much more to it than just that. As expected, some characters clicked for me more than others but across the board, they all succeeded in feeling real with only some dramatic exaggerations that fit the game's tone. More than anything, Johnny Silverhand sells this game for me. As the inseparable companion of the game, you spend a lot of time with his character and see the relationship develop throughout the playthrough. At times he's my least favorite person and at other times he's my absolute favorite but nonetheless, he's consistent and compelling. 

The gameplay itself is sufficient for me, though boosted heavily by other attributes. Build crafting has improved dramatically since launch, which has made secondary playthroughs more enjoyable, though I still find it difficult to lock in on builds that have a distinct feel. Gun play isn't the game's best feature, although every weapon looks cool and has enough flair to make it feel satisfying in that regard. The main questline has a lot of well designed sequences, particularly at the beginning and the end. Side quests and gigs vary in quality; overall I would say that I enjoyed more quests than I disliked. 

As a fan of the genre, Cyberpunk 2077 delivered what I personally wanted years ago and has since continued to improve. Overall, I've had very good experiences with it and wish I could experience it again from scratch.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 21:04:16

"A Must-Play Sci-Fi RPG That Keeps Getting Better

Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredibly immersive RPG set in the vibrant and dangerous world of Night City. The atmosphere is stunning, with breathtaking visuals, a rich soundtrack, and a world that feels truly alive. Whether you're exploring neon-lit streets, hacking into systems, or engaging in intense combat, the game offers a deep and engaging experience.

The story is one of its strongest aspects, featuring memorable characters and meaningful choices that shape your journey. V is a well-developed protagonist, and Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic to the narrative. Side quests are just as compelling as the main story, often leading to unexpected and emotional moments.

Gameplay is flexible, allowing for different playstyles, whether you prefer stealth, hacking, or all-out gunfights. Cyberware upgrades and RPG mechanics add depth, making each playthrough feel unique. Driving through the city feels great, and combat is smooth and satisfying.

While the game had a rough launch, CD Projekt Red has significantly improved it with patches and updates, making it a polished and rewarding experience. The Phantom Liberty expansion further enhances the game, adding new content and mechanics that make it worth revisiting.

If you love immersive RPGs with deep storytelling, engaging gameplay, and a world that begs to be explored, Cyberpunk 2077 is absolutely worth playing.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 16:01:10

"There's been a lot of conversation surrounding how this is just a huge comeback after release, but as a long-term fan of the Cyberpunk series, I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better first entry. This genuinely feels like the tabletop RPG, thrown into an FPS RPG format. It ends up being a genuinely very unique, emotional experience.

The worldbuilding is second to none. The story is one of the best I've experienced in a game before. The gunplay, and even the most grindy sections of games lose me a bit usually, but there's genuinely something different here. It sets a new bar for most RPGs out there.

Triple A polish aside, there's genuinely a lot to love here. Every time I come in for another playthrough, I see myself planning 3 more. It's very rare to find a game you want to replay as much as this. Toying with all the endings, skill trees, weapons, I could go on. 

A little buggy, but only ever in a way I find funny, and forgive completely, especially given the general quality of the game.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a sprawling, ambitious RPG set in the vibrant and chaotic Night City. Despite its rocky launch, the game has evolved into a deeply immersive experience with a rich story, complex characters, and a world full of possibilities.

The story of V, a mercenary navigating the dangers of Night City, is gripping and emotional, with multiple endings that reflect your choices throughout the game. The characters, especially Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves), are memorable and add depth to the narrative.

The gameplay offers a mix of shooting, hacking, and stealth, with a wide range of weapons, cyberware, and skills to customize your playstyle. The open world is visually stunning, with neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and a level of detail that makes Night City feel alive.

Pros:
✅ Stunning world design with deep lore
✅ Engaging story and memorable characters
✅ Improved performance and mechanics after updates

Cons:
❌ AI and open-world interactions still feel limited
❌ Some RPG elements could be deeper

Rating: 9.6/10 - A flawed but immersive RPG that’s worth exploring for its story and world.",True,0,0,2025-02-18 22:29:06

So much fun! The story is excellent and the game play feels good and fluid. I will say the driving is meh though but still enjoyable. The guns are not your standard guns you find in every shooter and are so fun to use. I think one of its most unique features is the quick-hack system. The characters are fleshed out and feel like they belong in Night City and the lore is so cool and meaningful.

Each was crafted with thought. You have general quests, side quests, gigs, ncpd hustles and there are ton of them. I spent 180 hours for single playthrough to 100% it.

That being said once 2.0 came out with phantom liberty it felt like what it was meant to be in the first place and I have to give a lot of praise for CDPR for following through and not leaving this as a soulless and lacking title. 2.0 really changed my perspective on the games that I play and how I want to experience them. Cyberpunk became the first game I ever 100% and it made me want to experience everything else I can from the really solid games out there. Even now after I have completed every quest and side quest I find myself wanting to come back every now and then and force myself to play a new style and see how different the combat feels.

"[h1] Thoughts [/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible experience. The main story and side quests are well written, interesting, rewarding and impactful to the story as a whole. Nightcity is a beautiful and immersive city with a lot of things to do, you can randomly just stumble on someone doing something interesting. Its my favorite city/map of all time. This game has amazing side characters that are interesting. Its hard to find another game like this.

🟢Amazing story with great writing across the whole game
🟢Great combat and immersive gameplay
🟢Amazing soundtracks
🟢Beautiful world with a lot going on
🟢Phantom liberty is a must have DLC 
🟢Side missions feel rewarding and worthwhile to do

"I played this at launch. It was frustratingly close to being a good game. Now, with 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, CDPR have pulled one of the rarest of achievements: the complete 180 from a game I wanted desperately to enjoy but just couldn't, to a game that I cannot recommend enough.

If this game interests you, stop reading reviews and go play it. Trust me, it's well worth getting sucked in.",True,0,0,2025-02-17 17:05:59
"Highly Recommended:  10+/10, may be the best first person CRPG I've ever played
Version played: 2.21 with Phantom Liberty

Characters - 10+/10, maybe the deepest and best done group of characters I've ever seen in a game including multiple that are professionally voiced by A-list actors

Story - 10/10, there are a few holes in the story and a few slow periods but overall it was great with plenty of conspiracies, corrupt government and corporate actors, and quest and story lines that kept the game interesting. There are also multiple endings for both the main game and Phantom Liberty that are well done and worth playing out. 

Combat - 10+/10, very fun FPS combat with lots of weapon and skill combinations to try. Most importantly for me, the combat was fun and challenging at higher difficulties

Driving and Driving Combat - 7/10, fun overall but I found the controls and horrible fish tailing on the rear wheel drive cars especially were not fun. To address that I only used a car or truck when forced to for a mission. Otherwise I used teleporters whenever possible to travel and when I did need wheels I went with a motorcycle. The motorcycles are much more fun to drive and handle a lot better than cars or trucks - and they look cooler too. 

Graphics - 10/10 - the graphics are very good. I'd give them a 9/10 on their own, but the cool Cyberpunk setting and the atmospheric graphics and art that went with it were an easy +1 for me

Sound 10+/10 - great voice acting by professionals including some A-list professionals, great music from multiple genres that fit in a cyberpunk world including everything from industrial / metal rock to techno to hip hop.

Developers 10+/10 - over 4 years after the initial release of the game and they are still patching and adding content and enhancements. Much respect to CD Projekt!",True,0,0,2025-02-17 16:58:16

"The atmosphere, the characters, the dystopian narrative on a rebel without a cause on a nigh impossible goal of destroying corporations far too powerful to ever fail. The games honestly definitively peak. Everything about it feels genuinely real, and a commentary on a not impossible future with run-away capitalism that with reflection you'll realize already resembles the modern world, especially in the United States. 

Without spoiling anything, the characters themselves are written to feel believable in such a way that you can forget you're playing a game, and you're given an introspective into their lives within this dystopian world where they're still able to find happiness and joy despite the overwhelming reasons to despise life.

"The biggest issue with the game is I just want it to be better. There is still, years late, a ton of room for improvement, but it's very good. 

I played the game completely blind for the first playthrough and felt overwhelmed by the amount of shovel content that just didn't matter at all. Gigs, outside of maybe a dozen felt like a pointless chore. Side missions ranged from amazing to completely pointless. All Phantom Liberty content is a banger and they really learned from the mistakes of the base game but didn't bother to go back and bring up older content to the new standard they set. 

The modding scene for this game is huge and can be used for fix certain aspects of the game that remain either buggy (vehicle controls sucks, quests not popping up properly) or could use improvement (wardrobe system) but there is no catch all ""community patch"" like some other games have to fix widely agreed upon bugs. This makes looking through literally thousands of mods (or cherry-picking from popular mod packs) the solution to fixing issues CDPR should be resolving.

Gameplay feedback: 
- All gameplay styles are viable enough to beat the game on the hardest difficulty
- The difficulty of the game is terribly balanced and Very Hard (the hardest difficulty) is just as trivial as Easy by the late game, while being annoying more than difficult early on (stealth takedowns are the only reliable way to complete missions for the first 15ish levels, or abusing bad enemy AI.)
- Iconic weapons completely drown out all other weapons in the game.
- The crafting system felt completely pointless outside of ammo and upgrading iconic weapons. 
- The equipment system is barely a thing as taking any armor with bonuses is better than not.
- Engineering is far too powerful for every single build between enhancing Cyberware and providing mission skips via opening doors. 
- Air Dashing from the Reflex Tree is basically impossible to play without if you do it once. 
- Double Jump cyberware has the same 'mandatory' feeling.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 22:13:37

"Just when I think AAA games can't offer anything new in terms of technological advancements, Cyberpunk 2077 comes in with one of the most beautifully realized depictions of a fictional universe I've ever seen in a video game. Mike Pondsmith's TTRPG's setting comes alive in stunning detail, every location as immersive and convincing as can be. The storyline is deep, engrossing and filled with choices, with both main and side quests showing you many aspects of Night City's dystopian, complex ecosystem. In terms of visuals, sound and writing, it's easy to see why this game took nearly a decade to make and another few years to properly polish post-release.

The only real complaint I have with this game is in regards to the gameplay being far too easy. It's one thing to find a broken combo that trivializes every fight from that point in a game, but it's another thing when that happens accidentally 15-20 hours into an 80+ hours experience. The vast majority of open world adventure RPGs are horribly balanced and this one is no exception. I miss the beginning of the game, when I had to actually think about how I was going to approach an encounter or which loot I was going to find instead of one-shotting everything with the same shotgun and tanking ten guys shooting at me without any issues because it just always works perfectly.

Still, as someone who gets tired of repetition in games very quickly, the fact that I've played Cyberpunk 2077 for nearly 80 hours without any long breaks is proof that it is something very special as far as immersive experiences go.

"December 2020:-
Cyberpunk released to the world in a state that was almost unplayable. A product that fell foul of its own message. Corporate dogma. CDPR's legacy was tarnished due to corporate greed and impatience.

Fast forward to Summer 2022. After many updates, Cyberpunk is finally playable and due to the hit anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners; many return to the game to determine if it is truly a fixed game. Many discover that it is in a much better state than when it first released. Edgerunners' popularity made the game a hit amongst many old and new fans alike. 

Summer 2023. Phantom Liberty. What a story. What a masterful telling of thrills and espionage. The entire story perfectly captures V's situation, promising an alternative route. A life freed from the relic, but with its own twists and turns. The story perfectly captures that 'James Bond-esque' vibe through interactions with key characters, down to game-play mechanics. Phantom Liberty is what all additional content should aim to be like. 

In summary, CP2077 has come a very long way. Through internal company shifts of management, to carefully calculated releases of external content which practically resurrected a franchise that was otherwise deceased. It made a full u-turn, and in so doing, reignited the love and passion for a universe so many gamer's only ever envision in dreams and fantasy. 

With Mod-support, it makes the game re-playable and allows players to freely take advantage of quality of life features that I wish were better implemented into the vanilla version of the game. Hopefully, future updates to the game will include said mods, or at least implement some of these ideas into their next release.

TL;DR - CP2077 has come a long way since its initial release, almost unrecognisable compared to Day One. Cyberpunk Edgerunners and Phantom Liberty DLC sparked a new love for the game for fans who originally were not impressed with its Day One release, in so doing, brought in even more players, creating new fans to the franchise.

"The game is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. Night city is one of the most beautiful cities in gaming and it is cool to see all the modern rendering technologies in use to create an almost photorealistic world.

Even with the recent updates that improve this game, the world will never feel complete and NPCs don't feel like they belong to the world and just are objects for the player to swerve into more than anything else... it's arguable that the NPCs from GTA V, a game released in 2013, feel more realistic than this game.

I don't feel like my choices matter and the skill checks don't seem to actually affect the outcome like they would in a RPG, they just change the dialog a bit... the game is more an action game than a RPG.

The world still is very shallow and most buildings are just a shell, there isn't a whole lot to do in this open world just walking around. If you stick to the quests and driving around to look at the pretty city, it's a good game. The DLC content in dogtown is quite good too.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 23:22:15
"Really enjoyable, gorgeous, and fun sandbox game that tells neat little and big stories in. It feels like you are running around an amusement park sometimes but it has terrific atmosphere and once your character starts to get some skill points the game play is incredibly fun.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 23:21:22
"Look at my hours, play it. If you still have bad thoughts surrounding this game due to launch, let CD Project Red apologize to you by letting you experience one of the greatest masterpieces to bless the rpg scene. 

Buy it full price or on sale. Doesn't much matter, you will enjoy without regrets.

Highly recommend playing the DLC as well

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a awesome, immersive knowledge set in the sprawling, bright as in light-lit antiutopia of Night City. The futuristic world is abundant details, from the buzz of drones overhead to the way NPCs interact on sold, making the city feel like a living, alive entity. The character-construction is deep, with significant choices that shape the narrative and connections, notably with memorable characters like Johnny Silverhand. The blend of complicated advancements and gritty authenticity creates a perfect scenery for a story about navigating a practically complex world, place every decision matters. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a rich, talkative experience that rewards interest and exploration at every turn.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 19:40:00

I bought this on Stadia when they offered a free chromecast ultra with purchase of the game. It was fun then and apparently the least buggy way to play the game. Fast forward to now...I own on steam and haven't encountered any breaking bugs. It is just as enjoyable as it was the first time I played it. First time I had over 50 hours. I am very much looking forward to playing through this again. It is much more polished now. The driving feels great.,True,0,0,2025-02-15 18:23:46

"Yes I know, we all been hurt by the launch of the game, and we must never forget it, because it was a horrible day for the entire industry, but the difference is CD PROJEKT RED never abadoned the vision, and they kept working hard, so stay with me now.

The 2.0 update changed the whole game for the better. It remade the entire level up and loot system and it made it 100 times better. The update get rid of most of the bugs and the issues, and it now runs (almost) perfectly.

The gameplay is so unique and fun, I did almost every side gig in the game just because of it. You can be a cyber ninja who slows down time, or a hacker hacking into brains, or whoever you want to be.  The updated systems works wonder here too.

One of the main complaints were you don't have much choice in the story, which is incorrect but the truth is, this game is more of an action game which WANTS to tell a story, and it tells you that exact experience, and I know it is intresting choice, but the story is really great.

This games proves that there are second chances in this world, that's why you must give it a chance, you will not regret it.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 12:31:38

"Cyberpunk is a beautiful world with fun shooting gameplay, but it feels ironically corporate and soulless. You meet your “best friend” and 99% of your time spent with him occurs through montage. A project manager created a big list of tasks in Excel to make the world feel “big” and the game designers created an endless variation of different ways to shoot the same-looking gangsters in similar-looking locations for one-off quests. It’s just a main quest with an open-world bolted on the side. It’s Grand Theft Auto: Night City, Call of Duty: Dystopian City, it’s Borderlands without poop jokes or any sense of humor.

This is not a role-playing game, it’s just a shooter. You meet with an NPC to get your mission (or maybe they just call you on the phone). Then you go to a location, shoot the bad guys, interact with the key item/person, and then talk with the NPC about how the mission went. There are no real quest chains and almost none of the quests interact meaningfully with your actions in the world. You will occasionally get a dialog choice that will streamline an interaction, but nothing changes meaningfully, you are just rewarded for your stat choices by being allowed to bypass a bit of gameplay, such as skipping a gunfight or unlocking a convenient door. In fact, dialog choices rarely have any truly meaningful impact on the story.

You get hardly any interesting quests from random quirky characters, it’s just a main quest with a lot of similar-feeling single-location Fixer jobs or NCPD assignments. There are no real quest chains outside the main quest and you can’t join any factions or guilds. Your street credit means almost nothing, you can’t become more respected by NPCs and you can’t become anyone important. You can’t recruit any companions, you’re going alone 99% of the time. Occasionally you team up with your designated main-quest contacts to do a specific mission together, but you’re not really friends, they disappear as soon as the quest is over. You can’t seek out companions, befriend them through your choices, and cement your friendship through companion quests. You are strapped into the rollercoaster the developers designed and your job is to sit back and enjoy the ride they planned for you. A few plot branches and a skill tree don’t make a role-playing game. I loved the game in the moment, but I’ll hardly remember any of the story interactions in a few months, it’s all empty calories.

As a final example, there is a side-quest where you find a mysterious freezer in the desert with a historically-significant body inside. This is a great quest lead and has a lot of potential, but what do they do with it? Nothing! Like all quests, you visit the location, interact with an item, and bring the item back to an NPC (no shooting in this quest). The NPC looks at the items and you perform a mini-hacking challenge on it, and you receive a paltry reward with barely even any lore attached. It’s embarrassing to see such a criminally bad quest! I know that this is probably cut content and that the developer had a lot of issues around launch, so we’re lucky that they didn’t abandon it and spent the past 4 years fixing the many bugs in the game. But seriously, the bar is on the absolute floor now for role-playing games. We’re all just on open-world roller-coaster rides with pretty graphics, optional stealth at the beginning of combat, heavily-curated companion interactions, and mostly meaningless quests outside the main quest-line. The weird, the silly, the mysterious, and the fun have been lost. All buildings not required for the plot have been their doors and windows painted on. All vendors stand at their counter all hours of the day and sell almost exactly the same items for the same prices. This is what you get when the developers aren’t having fun. You can feel them working late, souls dead from too much crunch-time, desperately trying to fill metrics for a corporately-mandated amount of “content” that will be used in a PowerPoint slide to impress the press upon release to convince them that the open-world is “big enough” to be the next big thing.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 09:18:32

It really is a shame that the release state has caused there to be a stigma about this game being a buggy mess.

"I started to play the game due to the anime, and tell you what. I was not disappointed. 
The game feels odd at first, however once you understand how to move shoot and hack, it becomes whole different type of combat, at first it felt like just a shooter, but with the quickhacks it also gave like a ""Mage"" feeling. Since i could suddenly burn an enemy or make them blind.

Due to watching the anime before the game once i found what radio station the songs from the show play on i only listened to that radio station. The weeabo songs xD

Personally i really didn't like Panam. She just felt.. Empty, then again i didn't finish her questline.

The game is fun and allows you to choose the way you're going to play, it has a lot of ways to play, so take your pick and go nuts!

The main story felt.. rather short.. But it was really sad. Or that i did it too quickly.
About that, the game gives you the idea that missions ""must"" be completed that day or a few days later, otherwise the NPC gets insulted and assume you abandoned the mission they gave you. idk if that's true. Because of this i started the DLC without knowing it's the DLC until i already finished it.

I have a low end PC.
The game ran, well?
Sometimes it took a while to load the NPCs, roads & cinematics.
but nevertheless it ran! and i enjoyed it!
