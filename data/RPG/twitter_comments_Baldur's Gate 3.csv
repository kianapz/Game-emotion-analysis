1891568806440390692,"@Nick_Marseil Tried it a few weeks ago
I couldn't play more than 6 hours
The game is boring and mid at best
I'm all for a slow burn and long games
I played Persona and Baldur's Gate 3 
I wanted to try it myself despite the hating it gets
And sadly this game deserves the hate",2025-02-17 19:22:01+00:00,1,0
1891565987960586554,Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Baldur's Gate 3 are games I'm not interested in at all since they don't appeal to me. I'm more of an anime and hardcore action/adventure + hack and slash + fighting game person. BUT I allow the freedom of expression regarding players of those games… https://t.co/BPn407KmtE https://t.co/q4GwyN1UJW,2025-02-17 19:10:49+00:00,4,0
