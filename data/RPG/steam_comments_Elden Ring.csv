RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"elden ring is the first fromsoftware game that i actually played and i enjoyed it a lot but its not a perfect game by any means, i would rate it a strong 8 out of 10. there are a lot of things the game does right and well but it has its short comings too pros really good boss designs art style of the game fits it very well and looks really good a lot of different viable builds and playstyles a big map thats actually filled with content and is not empty there are some really good quest lines if you follow and pay attention to them progression system most of the time feels rewarding cons game repeats itself too much, you fight the same bosses over and over again, dungeon layouts are almost identical with only difference being their gimmick or the enemies inside of it there are a lot of weapons and spells in the game but a lot of them are not viable at all or different versions of the same thing game practically forces you to play it at new game and finish it again if you want to get your hands on all the weapons and drops etc.. for collection purposes or to try them out. you can't get everything in a single playthrough performance is not good, idk how they locked the game to 60 fps on all systems and still did this poor of an optimization job keyboard and mouse controls for the game is outright criminal, game tells you to not even bother and go buy a controller. i played through and finished the game with km and it was annoying camera controls for certain fights and enemies are horrible side quests are really really easy to miss out and they have some absurd lock outs, oh you dared to explore in this open world game and found a boss we didn't wanted you to fight yet ? 13 of the quests are no longer completable game has a decent story but you need to go out of your way to find it, game gives you small pieces of information and expects you to piece it together if you care about lore, if not just go unga bunga me find boss me kill boss and you'll be fine coop system is better than what it was before compared to other fromsoftware games but its still not good, its still a pain if you want to play through the game with your friends and you constantly have to summon each other back into the world and there are some areas you can't even summon and have to play solo, this is not brought up a lot as a negative because fromsoftware fanboys have no friends overall i don't want the size of the cons list to make it feel like i hated the game or didn't enjoyed it or something, elden ring by all metrics a really good game and i enjoyed it a lot, i kept the pros list short because it does those pros really really well"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"elden ring is not merely a video game, but a transcendental experiencea masterwork woven with the threads of legend, artistry, and meticulous craftsmanship. from the moment one steps into the lands between, it becomes clear that this is a world of staggering depth and beauty, one that beckons players not merely to explore, but to immerse themselves in its very soul. at the heart of elden ring lies a narrative that is both haunting and elusive, painted in the broad strokes of myth yet rich with subtle intricacies. the collaboration between hidetaka miyazaki and george r.r. martin has birthed a world filled with lore that never overpowers, but instead entices curiosity. the story unfolds not through overt exposition, but through atmospheric hints and environmental storytelling, compelling players to unearth secrets on their own. it is a tapestry of broken kingdoms, forgotten deities, and cosmic forces, where each discoverywhether in the form of a cryptic message, an abandoned structure, or a fleeting encounterfeels like a revelation. the artistry in elden ring is breathtaking. from the serene grace of the golden trees in the liminal dusk to the oppressive, yawning voids of desolate catacombs, the game paints its landscapes with a brush that is both grand and intimate. each area, no matter how bleak, feels aliveteeming with possibility, steeped in history, and imbued with a melancholic beauty that mirrors the worlds fall from grace. it is a visual feast, where even the most innocuous detailthe curvature of a shadow, the scattering of fallen petalscarries the weight of meaning. the gameplay itself is an evolution of the meticulous design that fromsoftware has become synonymous with, refined and expanded into an open world that feels boundless yet intimately connected. every encounter, whether against a towering boss or a subtle ambush in a field of flowers, is a testament to the precision of its mechanics. the difficulty, while legendary, is never unfair it is an invitation to grow, to learn, to rise above adversity through patience, strategy, and resilience. and through it all, there is a profound sense of agency. the world does not hand you your pathit challenges you to carve your own. perhaps most remarkable of all is the games ability to evoke a feeling of quiet reverence. elden ring is not a game that rushes it exists in its own deliberate pace. the slow, rhythmic exploration of its vast expansesinterrupted by fleeting moments of terror, triumph, and wondergives rise to a sense of time itself being altered. in a world that often demands constant motion, this game asks players to stop, to look, to feel. in conclusion, elden ring stands as an unparalleled work of art. it is a testament to the enduring power of the medium, proving that video games are not mere diversions, but can be profound expressions of creativity, vision, and emotion. it is a world to be revered, a journey to be savored, and an experience that will linger long after its final chapter is written. to play it is to witness not just a game, but the unfolding of a masterpiece."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"this is the first soulslike game i have ever played. i was a bit skeptical about it, but everything changed as soon as i started the game. the game felt hard at the beginning, but once you understand what needs to be done, how the combat mechanics work, and study the difficult bosses after a few deaths, it becomes much more enjoyable. the universe fromsoftware created is beautiful, with great level design and wellcrafted bosses. there are a few repetitive dungeons, areas, and bosses, and at times the game feels a bit stretched, but i can tolerate that because it's not overdone. there is a huge variety of builds and weapons, which is very useful if you plan to have more than one playthrough. on top of that, the game offers a vast number of hidden collectibles and secrets. it's a very special game, and i would highly recommend it to actionadventure rpg lovers. this isn't structured exactly like previous souls games, you have a massive openworld map with stunning locations and excellent level design."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"i do not even know how to put how much i love this game into words. no matter what flaws people see in this game to me it is what makes it great, there is not a single thing wrong about this game in my opinion and it is perfect on every front. my only complaint is that there should have been dialouge during the rellana and romina boss fights but not having it does not take away from how good those bosses are. the art is incredible, the story is phenomenal with literally every detail from every part of this game having a purpose in the greater story of elden ring, even sacrificing the players experience slightly to ensure that there are not plot holes in this game. talking about no statue of marika near renalla bossroom and reusing certain bosses to fit the enviromental narrative they are telling . i dont think 55 is fitting to rate the game so this is my rating if elden ring has 100 fans im one of them. if elden ring has 10 fans i am one of them. if elden ring has 1 fan it is me. if elden ring has 0 fans then i am dead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"the perfect game...but is very hard!! you need to persevire in order to enjoy it! give it time and you will love it!! is like tarkov ,both games have a longtime to learn it,mechnic of the game,gameplay,items,weapons,upgrade..all need to invest time! is not a game that match elden ring!! as far as performance on i5 12400x,4x16 ram,ssd and rtx 3070ti settings medium to high the game runs smoothly 7580 fps all the time!!pretty optimised"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"bit late but hay better late than never, anyway this game is a pretty good option for people who wish to try the soulsborne games. while i wouldn't say it's the easiest of the games it's a good choice due to you being able to go explore other locations and get better equipment and level up. while in other soulsborne games you are stonewalled until you beat the boss blocking your path. the combat is engaging and thrilling while not being overly complicated for no reason, it's all about timing and pattern recognition. the exploration it's great there are plenty of places to lost in and explore, however that's also a problem of sorts it's a bit overwhelming with little guidance from the game. in the form of grace which guides players in the general direction, but it's entirely up to the player on what they wish to do. i give the base game 9 out of 10"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"first soulslike game. fell in love. i'm someone who loves a competitive challenge whether it is pvp or pve. this game has both in spades. after 200 hrs i went back and completed the souls trilogy, they were fun but er is all their great aspects and more in one. the game has tons of replayability on new characters or continuing characters in new game. the base game alone gave me 200 hrs of enjoyment. at the time of this review i've put 34 hrs into dlc and i feel confident in saying i see myself getting another 100200 hours in dlc alone. i will say the game is not for faint of heart, it is challenging not the hardest game ever though, dont be fooled, but if you're willing to try and learn the game mechanics, once it clicks, it'll be hard to get off. many times the 60 price tag given to a title is rarely worth it, but this game is worth 60 and 100 worth a pickup on sale."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"an unforgettable masterpiece fromsoftware has done it again! elden ring is an absolute masterpiece that blends the best elements of their previous titles with a vast, breathtaking open world. the sense of exploration is unparalleledevery corner of the lands between is filled with mystery, danger, and rewarding discoveries. the combat is as challenging and satisfying as ever, offering a deep level of customization with various weapons, spells, and builds to experiment with. boss fights are intense and memorable, each designed with incredible attention to detail. the lore, crafted by hidetaka miyazaki and george r.r. martin, is rich and immersive, giving players endless theories to uncover. the world feels alive, yet hauntingly desolate, making every journey feel like an epic adventure. whether you're a veteran souls player or new to the genre, elden ring is an experience like no other. its punishing, but fairevery defeat is a lesson, and every victory feels earned. if you love challenging gameplay, deep lore, and an open world that rewards curiosity, this game is a mustplay. 1010  a true masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"i love this game, its just so good so many weaponsbuildsplaystyles you can try, such a nice scenery, cool characters even tho it feels lonely towards the end but thats just the vibe of the game its fun to slay bosses even tho sometimes i wanna throw my controller into the screen. overall 1010, elden ring never disappoints 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"yes, this is one of the best video game experiences ive had in years. i've played it last summer and i already have nostalgia for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"1010. the freedom of exploration is a standout feature, with vastness of the world encouraging discovery. unlike other openworld games, elden ring doesn't hold your hand  you'll be constantly pushed to learn, adapt, and face adversity headon. whether you're a veteran of fromsoftware's previous titles or a newcomer, this game will keep you hooked, offering endless exploration, an unforgettable challenge, and a world that you'll lose yourself in countless hours. one of the best rpgs ever made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"my first fromsoftware game. got it to all 4242 achievements. what an experience that was, wish i could erase my memory in order to play it blind once more. an absolute god damn masterpiece, 1010, pure cinema! 100 deserved game of the year!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"elden ring is the first souls game ive ever played which honestly i believe has its pros and cons. the developers of this game really tried hard to combine the free open world concept with the style of how many souls like games function. my experience with elden ring was entirely coop. i experienced 100 hours of endless boss slaying and exploration on what seemed like an almost endless journey. i love how one minute you will be walking around a tree and then a few seconds later a boss approaches you. lots of surprises. i will say the coop mod itself had many bugs which are definitely game breaking, however there are ways around them definitely not seemless. in terms of style, the game is original and jaw dropping beautiful. the lands itself show the misery of the tarnished and the destruction caused by attempts of many to claim the elden lord throne. the mix of supernatural, magic, nature and royalty is such a beautiful mix to encounter. oh and the music of the game fits the vibe perfectly. aside from the main story bosses, there are no rules for which bosses to face and when. although this doesnt sound optimal, i actually found that the game progresses you at a great pace and allows you the ability to achieve anything as long as you keep it balanced. take a break from story bosses and explore the lands, finish a side quest line or explore clues to solve puzzles. i was honestly a bit disappointed with the mechanics of the game. i chose intelligence as my build and found several limitations. these weapons were lack luster and you should definitely steer away from this class for this kind of game. also, most of the main story bosses provide you with strdex weapons. you could argue that the game leads you into trying different builds, but then why would they make you choose a class when you first start? this decision can punish you late game if you dont grind for the extra levels you basically wasted. aside from classes, movement is a nightmare. most of my deaths were from falling off things and i dont believe it was my fault even half the time. i will say, the main combat mechanics were very enjoyable once i switched builds late game. likewise, boss fights are very interesting and it takes time to learn the moves and get good i love that about this game. its definitely the challenge that everyone is looking for. the main story was pretty decent, although somewhat confusing if you are trying to connect it all together. i know the game was not intended to shove a bunch of story down your throat so honestly im not too upset. definitely not my preferred story telling method though. overall, this game was a great experience and i do recommend playing if you are looking for something challenging and enjoy the thrill of seeking new bosses to takedown."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,my only issue with the game is that it's so long it can be a little hard to do multiple playthroughs or set up invasion builds due to how time consuming moving through the larger world is. otherwise i like the direction this game is going in with combat design.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"elden ring is honestly incredible. the world is huge, gorgeous, and full of surprises, and the challenge feels just righttough, but fair. i had an awesome time exploring and battling with friends. if you're into tough but rewarding games, this ones a nobrainer!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"i love this game so much i have personally played hundreds of hours of both the base game and dlc and still doesn't get old despite getting every achievement the game offers i still find my self finding new areas and content. both the well written story and the art of the game get a 1010 and being my first souls game and what got me to buy and enjoy even more, this game is an absolute masterpiece i most likely will never forget."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,one of the best videogames of all time. a memorable and impactful piece of art. recommend for everyone!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"challenging, but fair. if difficulty is a problem, the game has many ways to overcome the barrier other than simple over leveling or dumping hours into the game. it does require some patience, but don't be dissuaded if people try to tell you the way you're playing is the wrong way there is no wrong way, play it how you enjoy to play it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"h3it can hardly be overstated what a colossus of a game this ish3 this is undoubtedly the pinnacle of from software's work, cutting edge gaming, the tippy top of rpg type gameplay, the most refined formula the souls genre has ever been, and it is bnot close!b this is basically the game of games for fantasy rpgs. i struggle to think of another game so mesmerizing and mysterious in it's approach, so impressive in it's scenery  setting, so deep in combat mechanics, but so simple of a concept, that it can almost appeal to pretty much anybody from a casual to a minmax tryhard player in every sense of the imagination. h3this game takes you on an unforgettable rideh3 you can think of this as a lord of the rings novel made into a game. it is that big and it is actually living up to that kind of an expectation. the hype seems too big, but it will most certainly surprise you with the lengths that they went to. it's a bbehemothb of a game and i still am in awe of it after all this time. when you consider that a group of people have made this... sitting in front of a computer for years, tweaking things, writing code, imagining things from scratch. somebody dreamt this up out of nothing and put all of their soul into it to make it a reality. it is a miracle created from human consciousness. we are so lucky to have it, to get to experience it and for it to be this satisfying. the fantastical scenery and soundtrack have stayed with me, crossing my mind every now and then, because of how immersive it all is. a combination so ethereal and aweinspiring, that it makes hollywood blockbusters pale in comparison. h3the downsides that should be namedh3 overusing certain assets, copy  pasting a few side bosses in the dungeons, vast areas where you might expect to find more and sometimes don't get rewarded after walking to the end of it. many people have called these things lazy development and i'd agree with that. everybody perceives it differently, but i'd say 1015 of the game is done like that. the company has only so much time and money they can keep investing before something needs to come out and make money, so considering how insanely polished this game is in all the other areas, i can't dare to imagine what this would have become, had they given it another year of polishing it. saturating a few areas a bit more with some small rewards, more mobs or dungeons, maybe more quests. who knows. but the fact that this is the only legitimate criticism that i think is valid, sort of proves that they could have done it even better. the rest of the game is filled to the brim and decked out with a variety of bosses and mobs, environments, equipment and everything that seems so new, fresh and innovative. they stole only from themselves to make up on time and meet the deadline. h3conclusionh3 if you don't like this game at all, the chance of it being you and not the game is most certainly over 90. maybe even higher. i might be exaggerating, but if you can't see the immaculate beauty in this game, then we are just not living in the same world, i guess. i can hardly contain my love and passion for it. this game is the result of what happens when an exceptionally talented group of people actually get close to perfection. the shadow of the erdtree dlc actually even oneupping everything i mentioned once more, which i don't think anybody thought was possible, but they did it. it is also so big it could be its own game. what a time to be alive..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,games great but be prepared to google your way through it. very hard
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"if you were a big fan of the nintendogs franchise and are looking for something to elevate that gameplay loop to new levels, look no further. elven rings is a cutting edge dog simulator adjacent genre bending experience that will leave you breathless. by far the best game i have ever played with outstanding gameplay, music, narrative direction, and lore. 6.510."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"very difficult but very fun game. the lore is not straightforward and a lot of the little details of the game lie in the item descriptions. i haven't gotten very far into the main story, but the graphics are beautiful and, despite the difficulty, i enjoy playing the game. it is also very satisfying when you do finally beat a boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,i don't find the open world to be empty as some others criticise. i suppose we just have different definitions of the term empty. but i really enjoy the landscape and wandering around.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"theres not much to dislike , its one of my favorite games of all time, ive been playing digital games since 2004. theres a threshold as you learn the game but once youve got past that, its a rollercoaster of emotions. and theres so much to explore, ive logged around 300 hours in elden ring and apparently theres still places i havent been. 1010!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"ive spent 150 hours in this game. got all 42 achievements. done countless runs, lost my mind and yet still have no maidens..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"i can confidently say, as someone who's beaten dark souls 3 and bloodborne, elden ring is not for me. the game feels a lot more timeconsuming and less streamlined than either of those titles. i wasn't particularly enthralled by the open world or the gameplay loop, which, to me, bordered on grinding. godricks area is where i call it quits. for the right person, i'm sure its a game that fulfills many players' desires and expectations, but for me, it didnt hit the mark."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i would of loved to of kept this game, but it is very hard to play in my opinion and didn't find a lot of instructions whilst playing the game, so maybe start off with an easier game than elden ring that's personal opinion though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,never thought i would play a game that made me read and learn new discoveries. fun and difficult. alt  f4 was my new favorite button after losing to melania 30 hrs.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"as i understand it, this game is the most controversial aside from ds2. i think, summed up in a few words, it's because gitting gud isn't worth it anymore. i bought this game about 48 hours ago and i've almost got 20 hours of playtime. saying nothing about my social life, it's clear that i love getting lost in the map of elden ring, and seeing multiple playthroughs of the game as well as all the lore vids hasn't lessened my enjoyment of playing the game for myself. the best part is, if one boss is proving too difficult, there's almost always a different path to take to improve gearlevel. but it's the moments of getting to one boss, finding it too tough and going to another to find another boss is too tough that makes you think why am i even still playing this? am i even enjoying myself? between the gank bosses that have always been awful since they perfected the formula back in ds1 lucky shot? and very low punish opportunities later on, it just seems like i'm gitting gud just to struggle against the next boss. i think that's also why this is the one that most content creators have come out to admitting that they dropped it and i actually see it. i'm not done with it quite yet but i've only gotten 3 greater runes and am on my way to leyndell castle so maybe i'll end up joining the group that has just had enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"love this game one of the best souls games out there, with multiplayer that you can play with the bros and create a really awesome journey that will be remembered forever 10010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"this is a masterpiece that impresses with its scale, depth of mechanics and incredible atmosphere. it's a huge open world filled with mysteries that you want to explore endlessly. one of the game's greatest strengths is its realism in conveying sensations  there are no intrusive markers and linear quests, and the world lives its own life. you decide where to go, who to fight, and which stories to discover."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"my favorite game of all time! my first fromsoftware game ever played, now i am making a run though trying to 100 all the souls games. elden ring, to me, was a great start to be introduced to souls games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"this is my first time playing soul games and all i can say this game is absolutely amazing. the gameplay, story, characters lore and design is 1010 for me. i wish i could play this game for the first time again, now i already got all the achievement, maybe i will try shadow of the erdtree when i have time. sadly i cant marry melina  lastly fck you varre"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"as someone who has never played a souls game and thought that i wouldn't enjoy it due to the difficulty, i found myself liking this game the more that i play it. has some of the coolest and most fun bosses in a game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"this game is very fun but also very hard so you aren't will to spend a few hours dying then i don't recommend is game for you, but if you are fine with dying a few time and are looking for a game full of story then this is the game for you. i am personally going to try to get all the achievements and i am not the best at this game."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"this is my first souls game and even though i just bought it, i hesitated for so long and decided to get it with discount obviously. i've learned a lot... died a lot but man... this has been so fun! the openworld is great, fights though only just beating godrick are amazing and when you beat something after dying multiple times too it to finally learn it, it feels sssooooooo good! i genuinely did not think i would like this game and i'm glad i took the plunge! i highly recommend getting elden ring, it's totally worth it! i can't wait to hit the dlc after beating everything!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"beautiful, expansive and extremely interesting. if you don't like handholding and buttonmashing difficulty, and instead like a challenging, interesting world to explore, this one is for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"great game, great graphics, but not easy, and you need to think, not just mash buttons."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"never finished it, but it's very good fun. there are 2 advices i would give new players 1dying is frustrating but it's not that big of a failure. the more relaxed you become, the better you are at the game. i often die a few time to new enemies, trying to see how they move and all. when i'm frustrated, i often mess up even more, while when i'm ok with dying stupidly, i get better expodentially. 2don't try an everything build. i love everything builds, generalist approach able to use everything in game, but that's not how this game works. there are far too many options that sometimes overlap. you have to find what makes the game easy for you, and then build your character around that. from my experience, there are 3 general focus spells invest in intelligence and faith, weapons find yourself the weapon you love and get the necessary attribute for it, and items craft or buy greases, bombs, special arrows to exploit the monster's weaknesses.. and most of all, have a good time ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"a brilliant evolution of fromsoftware's extensive library.totally delivers on the tough as nails gameplay we have come to love. a true masterpiece in a world that has been throwing that word around willy nilly. if you haven't already,come join the some 28 million of us who can't get enough of miyazaki and company's wonderful transition of ttrpg gameplay in video game format. you will hate it and then passionately love the brutal challenge that is totally unique and riveting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,this game is on a short list of goats and deserves all the praise it gets. the closest thing to perfection that we get in gaming. get in and get lost in it. don't be intimidated by the massive run time. there is no rush to experience everything.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"loved the time on these game, was recomended by a one of my closest friends, at first i was no hook into it until a bit later 34 hours of game gona say loved most of the boss fights and loved the story and lore of them prety amazing experience !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,game fun. except for you lion warrior. i will make sure you will be skinned alive for your feeble flesh.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,first time player. i love the open world and the lack of rigidity of gameplay
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"played the game at launch, and idk if any game will ever beat this in terms of the impact a first playthrough has. replaying the game can sometimes feel like a slog compared to the souls games although mods like seamless coop can bring a lot of that life back. regardless, that first playthrough is so special. the joy of exploration, of truly getting lost in this massive world and uncovering all the little tidbits of lore. it was all so magical."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i played this first on my xbox and it is just suck a good game, i would reccommend to anybody and the dlc is just as good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"from my gameplay experience, this is the best rpg game ever of all time. actions in combat system are very smooth and irrefutablely magnificent. its graphics are amazing and music is blissful and thrilling especially during boss fight. moreover, the number of bosses are more than 100s and each boss has gives you unique experience during combat. based on all soulstype games data from users for several years, elden ring finally came out as a great and great masterpiece with its unique story, actions and many others. i wonder i could have such a similar experiences and feelings when playing a game like this ever again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,fire game got beaten by some uce with a rose bunch for 3 hours recommend it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,i remember that when i first played this game in 2022 i sucked at it. it was my first soulsborne game i had ever played and i had no idea what i was doing. now after 700 hours and having completed almost every other soulsborne game i have to say that i still suck at the game and have no idea what i'm doing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"coming from someone who only plays destiny, this game is very fun and addicting in a similar way. lots of secrets to find, buildcrafting, triumph chasing, etc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"played this for my 8th time, but this time on pc minus the dlc. the graphics are just amazing and raytracing is beautiful!! i do wish the render distance on foliage was good to but way better than console!! and yes i did play this with keyboard and mouse. the issues are still there with the animation locks but its all good, part of the game. i still recommend people to play dark souls 2 or 3 before elden ring as it is so easy to get lost and not appreciate the open world, where if you know how a souls game is like you will love the open world exploration. you can go any build, i highly recommend int or faith build since you can explore the many weapons, but for this run i went for an axe build, since they aren't used as much. rosus's axe did a good job and using that with a dagger w golden vow was my run. i did use mimic tear and sleep on 2 bosses but i kept myself tamed to the rules i set out for the run. but remember, have fun and take your time!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"first soulslike im really trying out hard. straight up its amazing. be prepared to die, and learn. if you enjoy a grind and progression, this is the game that makes it all feel worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"at first i wanted to refund this game, but after i understanding the game mechanics it turned out to be such a fun game to play. trust me. and yeah once your character becomes op and you're get more skilled, you'll conquer everything. i think....probably.... yeah....maybe..... unless the enemies also get op... then we're all doomed.. but hey, that's the fun part!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"20 hours in and still lot of content to do, worth every money spent, bought on sale for 25 and its a steal for the base game even after 3 years of release. only downside i see is how some parts of the open world feels empty, story just exists for the sake of lore build up, it primarily focuses on gameplay aspects. if you have not played any souls game before or fromsoftware games, this might be for you because it is more forgiving in progression."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"elden ring is absolutely incrediblemassive world, tough bosses, and that classic fromsoft challenge. every corner of the map has something cool to discover, and the freedom to explore is insane. combat feels super satisfying, whether you're a mage, warrior, or something in between. died a hundred times, but every victory felt amazing. 1010, would get destroyed by malenia again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"this was my first fromsoftware game and i dont think id played any soulslike games before trying elden ring. i would have been more likely to put the game on easy mode before playing on a high difficulty. since playing elden ring, ive completed several games on the highest difficulty relishing in the challenge. on my first playthrough on another platform i went with a bleed build that was fairly meta at the time, unbeknownst to me. i used summons and ashes and didnt worry about overlevelling. while this made the game a bit easier overall, it was still a big challenge for me at the time. but it always felt fair and manageable. every death felt like my own fault  id get greedy or panic or mistime something. so after every death id usually be resolved to do better rather than be disheartened. ive since gone on to do a heavy axe run with no summons or ashes. theres enough opportunities to level up and come back whenever theres a roadblock or particularly challenging boss. you can go and explore another area and find some new weapons. theres plenty of build variety for different styles of play. its a lot of fun to find something that works for you. i enjoyed the map and exploration in elden ring. i found myself exploring by seeing things in the world and going to them, or eventually figuring out different patterns on the topography of the map. its not overwhelming with markers and the visuals of the different biomes are stunning. one of my gripes was that there were a lot of repeat bosses that i just became bored of fighting. id recommend it to anyone willing to give the difficulty a proper go. you will die in the game, but thats ok. its a challenge to overcome rather than a state of failure. be patient and enjoy the fight!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i do really recommend this game for the hardcore sweats of dark souls games, it's a hard but fun game and many people would enjoy it if you have played dark souls before."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"combat in elden ring is like trying to dance with a bear youre going to get mauled, but at least you look cool while youre doing it. every boss is a shakespearean tragedy wrapped in an existential crisis. am i good enough i asked myself before every fight. the answer was always no, you're not. you're gonna die. again. 1010, would die again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i didn't even know there were main bosses and even more places to explore, after i had pretty much tried to beat every boss at the start of the game. margits a bitch btw, cant get past him for now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,toxic positivity surrounding this game will have you believe that it's one of the best games in the series when in reality it's just an easier dark souls with more cheese mechanics and the added possibility of good players accidentally overleveling by unknowingly playing difficult areas prematurely and making most of the game dull due to resulting easy bosses  but it's worth playing just for malenia
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,would be a great game but mapping key bored to the way i play makes it unenjoyable another waste of my money all because i cant map key bindings to my liking
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"definitely one of my favorite games of all time. the first time i played through, i didn't feel as much of a connection to the games that i did in the previous souls titles, and there were many times that i came back to the game to start a run, and ran out of patience or got bored. i stuck it out this time on my second playthrough of the game, all due to experiencing the dlc for the first time. every moment was worth it. this time around i was just in awe with the amount of weapons, armor and items. i dove deep into the lore, read online, listened to philosophical takes, and the experience was just beautiful. nothing like the feeling of conquering one of the hardest bosses to fromsoft date final boss of dlc, and feeling so accomplished and amazing. the game is beautiful at times, and extremely grim and dreary at others, but overall the story and characters evoke a story that is akin to our own. its driven home that maybe, everything we dream of and worship in the heavens, just happens to be the same one that happens at home. thank you for the experience, and i will continue to play this game for the rest of my life hopefully."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"yes it is quite an amazing game, i enjoy the open world and fun adventures fighting the bosses. funny story i was actually thinking about refunding this game being stuck on tree sentinel but i found a great way to cheese the boss by avoiding it and getting a horse. the bosses are hard, but don't give up keep on pushing the game is truly spectacular!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"absolutely lovely rpg. only access if you enjoy overcoming very powerful odds, trying again and again, and finding out lore through item descriptions as well as dialog. access to the wiki is highly recommended but not entirely necessary."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,the game is great with a high variety of build to play. i've been enjoying discovering the game as i go. i tried to watch videos for clue on quests i might have miss but soon regretted doing so... it break the immersion and i stop trying to figure out things and just focus on enjoying a great game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"good game. starts to drag at the end. can be difficult, but the game provides you with plenty of ways to make it easier."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"what a game! absolutely incredible game that is worth investing whatever time you can spare. sure the combat part of it leaves you with some questions re the difficulty but oh my how rewarding the game is when you defeat a foe and make progress in the game. what to say? words fail me, one of the very best games going around if you like a challenge and have the patience to work and progress your builds for a rewarding and deeply satisfying gaming experience. perhaps the only criticism is some of the bosses power against you with one hit kills, i can never understand why devs don't give a difficulty option, it would please so many more people and allow them to play the games like this one at their own level. that and the interactive menus for assigning weapons, but even that can be tweaked to your liking once you learn how. but honestly this game is a credit to all the people that help make such an epic game like this. thank you so much for creating this for me to play and enjoy so much."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"one of the best games i have ever played, i absolutely loved it. the journey in the lands in between, the secrets to unravel, the gorgeous world, beautiful art design and the perfected combat mastered from older titles just absolutely fun game to play. not just it has a massive open world but even vertically from mountain tops to lake of rot it is just incredibly massive. thank you hidetaka miyazaki for giving us such a master piece, definitely a 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"this is simply my favourite game of all time and i've played through it probably over 10 times at this point. while i haven't played it much recently, i can say i've had lots of fun with the game normally, especially after the dlc. the game has lots more replayability if you're willing to mod it as well. i recommend running some randomizer runs or running some of the overhaul mods if you're looking for something kinda new. if you can get it working it was a pain for me, try to do a randomizer run with a friend or two in the seamless coop mod. easily some of the most fun i had with the game after completing as much as i could've in the vanilla game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"this has to be the best souls game. on the first playthrough. the first playthrough is absolutely magical, the sense of wonder from entering a new area and being wowed at the view is unbeaten, the feeling of overcoming a challenging boss is one of the most dopamine releasing things known to mankind. finding all the caves, dungeons and new weapons to use gives a sense of progression not found in other souls games. on subsequent playthroughs, more issues start to shine through. the game is inflated, a feeling not found on the first playthrough as you are too busy focusing on the large and expansive world filled with enemies and friends. a majority of content is entirely optional and not fun outside of the initial discovery. the bosses have a large number of unfair tactics that make them completely overpowered. however, the first playthrough was too perfect to not leave a positive review."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"goated game great experience, and good difficulty developing across the entire game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"simply a masterpiece that any newcomer to the souls series should come to first, because it's the most approachable. i personally don't think open world fits with this genre, as it felt bloated with 'bosses' that were pushovers, and catacombscaves that were repetitive. with this being said, about 50 of the bosses are unique and they are amazing. the cinematics are a highlight as it seems from has mastered the art of getting you hyped before you are pulverised in a matter of seconds."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,elden ring is the product of years of effort and the collective product of the souls genre. i would recommend this game to anyone as an introduction to the soulslike games. 1010 would recommend
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"elden ring is an unparalleled masterpiece that redefines openworld gaming. fromsoftware has crafted a vast, interconnected world filled with rich lore, challenging combat, and breathtaking landscapes. the freedom to explore the lands between at your own pace, uncovering secrets and facing formidable foes, is truly exhilarating. the game's intricate design encourages curiosity, rewarding players with each discovery. the combat system is refined and engaging, offering a variety of playstyles to suit different preferences. the art direction and attention to detail create an immersive experience that stays with you long after you put the game down. elden ring is not just a game it's an unforgettable journey that every gamer should embark upon. highly recommended!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"as a firsttime soulslike player, ive been blown away by elden ring. the open world is stunning and packed with secrets to explore, from eerie ruins to epic boss fights. the storys subtle depth keeps me hooked, and while the difficulty is brutal, the freedom to approach it my way makes every moment fun. a truly unforgettable experience!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,bought this when it first released. rage quit after a week. didnt play it for two years. redownloaded it last year and now its one of my favorite games ever and i have over 500 hours in it and plan to add more. please play this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"this game is the best game ever in my opinion its fun, its beautiful, and its difficult please get it if you haven't"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"this is my first souls like game. but even just 7 hours into the game i'm hooked, i will admit it was frustrating towards the beginning but once i acclimated to the new combat style i saw what i previously overlooked, its well paced, the combat is difficult but highly rewarding, and there's always something to do in the massive open world. this game has already became my new favourite game. but before you go into this game you must understand how unforgiving the combat is. you will die a lot. but because of that when you finally beat that boss you were stuck on it gives you a sense of reward that no other game can give you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,good game yay so much fun. only soulslike game i've ever played. i had fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"first off, graphics. hands down most beautiful i have seen to date. i really like the truly open world concept. the down side that takes a lot of patience is the game play. took me so long to figure out how to summons my horse without having to click into another screen. i am still learning how to evade well and have died a lot, but after four hours, that is probably to be expected. i recommend spending time watching a few you tube videos for newbies!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,best game ive played since dark souls 1. you could play this game for hundreds of hours and still find new things if you dont google everything.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"one of my favorite games of all time. i'ts got that old school charm and simplicity, while also possessing a robust rpg system which is easy to pick up an offers hours and hours of experimentation. the land is gorgeous, and in a world of generic ue5 clones this really stands out as an original work of art. it's just a joy to play and a joy to explore, a i say it all the time, a good game has to be fun all the time, not just 60 of the time, in elden ring everything feel snappy and intuitive, movement feels good whether it's on the horse or on foot, fighting feels good, and speaking of fighting, you have so many options for a build esp once you reach the 2nd half of the game or ng that you want to try them all, you have magic, ranged, dual wield, power crushing, speed, faith, and you can mix it all up however you want. loot is done well, there is no such thing as a useless item in this game, there are so many different playstyles that no matter what you pick up, it will be valuable to the right person, what you don't need you can just sell for souls the currency that also allows you to level up, it just works. the story, although taking a back seat to the game, trickles just enough information to tickle your imagination and make you imagine what caused this, who is responsible for this, the characters and monsters are so wonderful and well made that they will imbue you with a sense of intrigue, it's one of those games where you always want to see what's next around the next corner, what monsters, or treasures await?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"an open world adventure that won't be forgotten. besides steam, i've also finished the game twice on console including dlc once. i came to this having played some of the previous fromsoft games. after beating elden ring, i went back and played ds1 remaster and demons souls remake. i'm of the opinion that elden ring takes a lot of from's previous concepts and polished them more. the enemies ai is better, often faster attack patterns, but as the player your own combat feels more fluid and you've a very large variety of options. fromsoft veterans will recognize particular attacks of some enemies as some look familiar but in a way thats tweaked or sped up. if you're sloppy you surely run the risk of getting swarmed in some areas or running into a miniboss or knight you werent expecting. artistically the world design is very impressive, the npcs are interesting and have their own unique personalities and motives, and the cutscenes are very entertaining. the world and amount of hidden places you can delve into is huge, expansive, you can spend quite a lot of time. or if you want you can skip nearly all of it and bline to goals. previous souls games often had a looping interconnected pretzelian world space that at times left you feeling like where do i go now? some might believe that since this is open world, that feeling is absent, but...the legacy dungeons and many hero's graves serve to replicate that experience on a bit smaller more isolated scale. some of the graves even like to try and trick you with false paths. castles like stormveil and volcano manor will give you plenty of levers and does not open from this side. while playing the older games before and after this one gave me the feeling that elden ring is harder than those, i don't agree with the sentiment that it's too hard to be fun. thats just subjective, i guess, i was challenged but not to the point of giving up. beating this actually made me better at ds1, demons souls and the similar format ghost of tsushima. i think i can say elden ring became my favorite fromsoft game and favorite action rpg in general. it's one of those gaming memories that sticks with you and has a ton of replayability."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"amazing, challenging, and rewarding game with an interesting story and characters. couldn't recommend enough!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"the game is just amazing! it has variety, but it also gets repetitive sometimes mostly in dungeons. it has a lot to do and explore more than enough! i would not recommend it if it's your first souls game though. is it the best souls? imo, no that does not mean anything. but it's a fromsoft game, you can't go wrong with that! take a step and dive inside the chaos that awaits you, ye tarnished!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"game is beautiful, world and characters are interesting, combat is intense but the some mobs and bosses are just straight up malicious  810 s tier world design tons of weapons and builds to try out easy respec options over 200 bosses to fight interesting characters and quest lines ungodly amount of things to explore game is wayyyyyyyyyy too long bullshit difficulty is turned up to 11 most loot you find from exploring is pointless much prefer the semilinear dark souls world design to the open world inverted maze like dungeons are so fucking annoying ulcerated tree spirits can go fuck themselves"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"this game was worth the wait to play! it is so much fun, and the graphics are beautiful!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,this game shows that it was made with passion for the craft. and it really feels like an openworld with soulslike combat mechanics. that's enough for me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"so this game is probably the best game i've ever played. i tried and tried again to get into the game but the one time i actually committed time to the game i realized how much of a masterpiece it was. if i were you, i would buy this game immediately, especially with it being on sale currently. it will be the best 36 bucks you could ever spend, with some of the most interesting and challenging bosses, and some of the most beautiful areas. i would give this game a 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,gameplay dari game ini pindah tempat lawan musuh mati repeat 1010 would recommend this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"finally completed elden ring and its dlc, masterpiece, will go down on in history. the perfect open world exploration i ever had, will miss it, very sad. i don't think i stop comparing this open world exploration to other open world games anytime soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"don't lisyen to people who try to shame you for not liking games that are too hard for you. if you like the challenge, go for it, make it hard. if you don't, you have options to make life easier. this game gives you the tools to tailor the game to your preferences and you should use things as you see fit. the gameplay is a bit stiff and clunky. kind of like an indie title using stock plugins. not bad so much as needing an adjustment period. the graphics are nothing special and the pacing glacial. what this game has going against it, however, pales in comparison to the whole. as a package, it's so, so hard to dislike this. the atmosphere keeps you hooked, the design of the spaces makes you cautious, yet still willing to push on. any setbacks you have can be put off while you work on getting stronger and still engaging with the game fully. the side quests are not, they are all integral to the whole. truly a game that is not for everybody, yet appealing to so, so many. some people may put you off, but please remember that your game is yours. play it how you enjoy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"this game is very fun and has so much to do it is basically impossible to get bored. i have played for maybe 500 hours but on this account only about 56. elden ring is perfect for people who want challenges, and if you don't you can just look up extremely good weapons to get at the start if you want. elden ring lets you do pretty much whatever you want to and has a very good story line, even though at first i couldn't understand it, it was very good. i give this game a 9.810 definitely play. also if you dont have 60 the game is almost always areound 50 off so its not super expensive."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,genuinely the best game i have ever played. i would kill to experience the game for the first time again. one of the most awesome experiences i've ever had
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"best overall game i have ever played, would strongly recommend the seamless coop mod to play with friends after a solo playthrough"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"game has amazing exploration and gameplay that is hard to resist, very replayable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,just fun to get lost in the scenery. alot of things to figure out and do.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"it took me 500 hours to finally get to the end of this game. why? not because i'm bad at it tho i say that through hundreds of embarrassing deaths, but because i became obsessed with trying new builds and exploring the lands between in different ways. so much to do, so much to see, as they say. if you are a fromsoft fan, this will be one of your favorite games of all time. if you are not a fromsoft fan, this could still be one of your favorites of all time. difficulty be damned, it's oh so worth it to see everything this game has to offer. i love this game to pieces. it's an experience that i and you will never forget. just buy the game already. you know you wanna try it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,amazing graphics and fun but super hard i defo reccomend
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"the world is so well built, the mechanics are spot on, the exploration is fun, and the bosses were fair. fromsoft did a great job with this game and it lived up to the hype."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"base game good, yes. the dlc however rubbed me the wrong way, something about it feels off. bosses doing too much damage with too large aoe, nigh undodgeable charge attacks coupled with some sketchy hitboxes and long combos leaving very little breathing room. when you try to heal its almost like they are input reading just to try and negate any healing you just did. weapons and armor are cool though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"best sense of discovery in a game world since the original legend of zelda. the bosses are so much fun, and with the randomizer mod the replayability is endless. highly recommend seamless coop for a really great time with a friend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,incredible game hours and hours of game play engaging combat and the feeling of killing a hard boss is amazing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,this game is great but after about 15 hours it started crashing even when i have some very good pc components.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"this is an absolute masterpiece! the vast, interconnected world of the lands between, with its rich history of the elden ring, the shattering of the golden order, and the struggles between the great demigods, is unlike anything i've ever experienced. the lore of characters like radagon, marika, and ranni pulls you deep into its mythos. its a beautiful mess, and i cant wait to get destroyed by it all over again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"maybe a good game, idk tree sentinel is still guarding my ass since the start. consort of mustard of something like that cant be harder than tree sentinel. only at 20k death but we still trying"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"i think elden ring is one of the stronger games that has come out of this decade, is it the greatest game of all time? no not even close, the story, characters, weapons and equipment are all great, but as you finish the story and continue playing you come to realize that a lot of the side bosses are reused and over saturated, there are some bosses who've been used up to 5 times. over all great game, for 60 you will get 100s of hours of game play worth every cent."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"buy it. just get it! play it, die, try again, get good, and beat the game then put it away and join the community of people who will never find another game that scratches all the itches this one does until someone comes along and does it again or we get bloodborne 2."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"this game truly deserves the title of game of the decade. no matter how much you play, it never gets boringwhether it's the main storyline or the dlcs, everything is simply outstanding. even after finishing the game, youll want to dive back in and explore new approaches, continuously challenging yourself. its insanely fun! the only downside? its locked at 60 fpsthats literally the only flaw. for those still on the fence about whether to play itjust do it. you wont regret it. this is one of those onceinalifetime games that you absolutely must experience!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"elden ring is a huge, beautiful world full of danger and secrets. every fight is tough but feels amazing when you win. exploring is exciting because you never know what youll find. its a hard game, but its worth every moment. 1010  i kept dying, but i loved it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"unequivocally the most impressive game ever made. it's not my favorite game of all time, but objectively it is a historic achievement for game development. a mile wide and 10 miles deep, i think its unlikely that we'll ever see a game as ambitious and well executed as elden ring again. every game developer needs to finish this, and every gamer should at least try it. it's the mount everest of videogames. 130 hours in, and i'm still learning new things every time i play. how many games can you say that about?  the difficulty is there and skill matters to a degree, but knowledge towers over skill in this game and the most important skill of all is patience and not being stubborn. this is a game that rewards intelligent players, and punishes stupidity. you have to learn from your mistakes, and watch and learn from others as well, without your ego getting bruised. you have to study the game and this is where many people fall down. every boss can be 1 shot, every boss can be defeated without getting hit by a level 1 character with enough knowledge and practice. the impossible is possible  for everyone, even you. but what sets this game apart is it's open world design. it's the best open world game ever made and it's not really even that close, and when you factor in the expansion, i think there's a very real chance this game won't ever be surpassed in terms of size, scope, and design ambition. it's not perfect, the ai is sometimes bad and aspects of the ui are antiquated do we really need a pop up for every item we pick up? but these are minor quibbles in a tour de force performance. the map? it's perfect. music? epic. performance? designed for ps4! graphics? technically not great no dlss or fov changes without mods  but gets a pass anyways. art direction? it's up there with the all time greats shadow of the colossus, cuphead, journey, anything by vanillaware, ori, bloodborne, okami, inside, persona 5, botw, rdr2. the enemy design and animation is the best ever put into a game, surpassing all other developers and other fromsoft games. the game design itself is fairly simple  it's zelda 1 in 3d. but the execution? beyond anything we've ever seen. far, far beyond. elden ring is an unsurpassable masterpiece and i'm incredibly grateful to have finally given it a shot, grateful to be in the same universe where this game exists. as a jaded gamer, its tough for me to get into anything new let alone be blown away by it. but elden ring has blown me away like nothing else, and i doubt we'll ever get anything like this again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"elden ring was great, but just a few things were annoying . firstly, i had to restart three times because the game would keep crashing, but after uninstalling and reinstalling, it worked fine. another thing, in my opinion, the movement is really slow compared to other soulslike games. i finished nioh before playing this, and it made elden ring feel like i was playing in slow motion. anyway, i only actually got hooked after beating radahn. the start of my first playthrough was basically hours of riding around having no clue what to do, but the endgame was definitely worth the slow start. i would give elden ring an 810."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"this game is one of the most beautiful games i've ever played. the world is beautiful and vast. the controls might be a little annoying and the lack of customization options make it even harder to do well in this game. however, if players stick to it, they will reap the rewards and will enjoy an amazing gaming experience. would definitely ask you to try this. while this game can have a lot of relaxing moments, its based on difficult combat. so expect to grind and be on the edge of your seat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,so pretty i could just walk around and enjoy the scenery. the game is hard you knew this already excellent drinking game believe it or not. big reccomend
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,it is a super fun game and has epic boss fights and it definitely deserved game of the year and if the game is hard just use all the resources you can use
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"this game truly is the best bang for your buck. the challenges of this game keep you engaged, push you to strategise better, and have you ragequit. my main complaint about this game is the lack of direction. for some that's a benefit, for myself i found myself relying on the wiki at times to figure out how to progress some storylines. that is my only complaint though. i felt the dungeons were plesantly challenging, the in game world is stunning, and there are soo many fun builds options. fromsoft's approach to open world games is unique and one of a kind. the lore of this game is deep but sometimes confusing. i've spent hours on youtube watching lore dump videos. overall i loved every moment of this game. this was my first souls like game and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging game you can get lost in and try to gain a useless skill of being a dope elden ring player."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"amazing game! you'll find the ds difficulty, in a real enourmous open world. endless character customization. great content, great graphics. please be ready to poop your pants. a lot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,awesome game will be buying future fromsoft ware games and cant wait to play nightreign
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"genuinely amazing game, i genuinely cannot describe how much i enjoyed playing this game. had trouble with the game at first and just dropped it, because it was too hard, but few months later i picked it up again and the more i played the easier it got for me. genuinely glad that i gave this amazing game another chance. also, fuck fire giant and his rolling"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"calling this game a masterpiece would be an insult, the world is beautiful and detailed , the closest thing to perfection since sliced bread."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"a modern masterpiece. has a lot of repetition, as much as i like it it could be half the size and might honestly be better. i wish they'd balance pvp and pve separately. still one of the best games of all time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"game is honestly great. one of the few games we've gotten in the last decade to be worth the price, super fun to play, and leave you satisfied in every aspect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"if you like to play games that will make you rage this game is for you. if you want to have a really easy time playing this game just go with any kind of mage build and youll be undefeatable . if you want to struggle use any kind of melee weapon. if you want to have the hardest time possible, use a bow. graphics are incredible 1010. storyline is a 610. you have to do your own research to understand most of it, the game does a very poor job of explaining anything to you. i would recommend this game if souls like games are your thing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,elden ring is a great game and a must try. i personally didn't like it for many nitpicking reasons but i'm one person. i still recommend it. i'd like to see more games done in similar fashion that elden ring does open world. mmos as a whole would do better if the elden ring cooptional single player system were used. i live elden ring's system i just didn't enjoy elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,played all souls games. this is a souls game through and through. love it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"best souls game by far, surpasses even ds3 and bloodborne, most interesting map design, way more content, enticing story, new mechanics and qol features are amazing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"beautiful writing, amazing design, extremely challenging. hours of fun 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"a fantastical world that brought me back to being a little microbe reading eragon or lord of the rings for the first time, i haven't touched the dlc yet or even beat the tree sentenel but i've taken out a few dragons and two whole remembrance bosses and i must say i'm looking forward to what this game has in store for me!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"yagorath not quite dark souls 3 level of quality, but decent enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,great game but very rage inducing because i made a hole in my wall during the elden beast fight.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"this game is one hell of a masterpiece. i'm not good at this type of game though, so i couldn't enjoy it to the fullest... still a hell of a lot of fun. all i need is to improve my skill at dodging, and get used to this i guess. really fun, i rate it a 1010 maxing my character was a big pain but i did it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"elden ring  a magnum opus of openworld design and soulsborne excellence elden ring is a monumental achievement in gaming, a masterpiece that seamlessly blends the intricate, challenging gameplay of fromsoftwares soulsborne series with a vast, openworld design. directed by hidetaka miyazaki and crafted in collaboration with george r.r. martin, this game is a triumph of creativity, ambition, and execution. its not just a gameits an experience that redefines what an openworld rpg can be. score 1010 a masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the greatest games of all time. elden ring is a mustplay for anyone who loves immersive worlds, challenging gameplay, and rich storytelling."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"the scenery is beautiful. the lore is rich and deep. but, this game is incredibly difficult if you haven't played any type of souls like games before. but once you overcome the challenges, it's all worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"probably the greatest game i've ever played, amazing world and pretty in depth story if you decide to look into it. i've beaten the game about 6 times, and beaten the dlc twice, as long as you can stay committed and continue to play without giving up this game is an absolute testament to art. utterly recommend this game with my heart and soul, but you're gonna wanna have a cool build if you wanna have fun. my recommendation is to pick something you think is really neat then go with that, my second play through was all based around fire damage, so i was covered in flame weapons and spells, and only flame weapons and spells which added to the overall experience for me. don't be ashamed of what you decide to build, and never feel bad for using a guide."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,game really really good!!! there's this really cool place with flowers and stuff called caelid i liked it there
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"elden ring launched just over 2 years now, and i still think about it all the time. it's the closest a game had come to feeling truly endless. after 5 playthroughs, i was still thinking of new builds, and characters to roleplay as. even in the final moments of my 100 playthrough, my next adventure was forming in my head. excited for the next painting the game could put on my screen. through extensive brushed texture work, and effects the game makes like each image, angle, and lighting condition feel like it was put to canvas by hand. the story, conveyed through characters, level design, and item details imply a world that's layered. with a history not fit for a novel, but for a whole library. elden ring has not only set the standard for games, but for art as a whole."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"it's already a great game on its own, but with the seamless coop mod? easily the greatest gaming experience you'll ever have"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"great game. but sometimes it's a bit like bashing your head into a wall. play it, but do get out from time to time, this game can be frustrating."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"1010 game. good story line and insane difficulty. however, once beating the boss you are struggling on the adrenaline rush is like no other."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"recently explored caelid and nothing good comes from it, the only good thing to do in caelid is get the gut's sword and leave btw 1010 game worth every penny that i spent, i got elden ring for 40 sale"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,this game is beautiful. i love the game play and the graphics. it is my first dark souls game so don't come at me when i say it is a challenge for me but i do like that.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,great game! solid boss fights and a good running short story. but nothing will ever be more enjoyable than being beaten down by a certain few bosses and being humbled by them in an instant.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,there is so much to do in this beautiful game and you can play whatever kind of style you want. you can really tell the developers loved making this game and continue to pump out more good content for it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"if today felt unfair and hard, dont worryelden ring will be the same, just with a movement delay. but its all manageable. thanks fromsoftware for the jumps and the horned nag. the only boss i couldnt beat was gravity. the best game to relax, have fun, and unwind!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,after 220 hours and basically seeing everything this game has to offer i still feel like playing more as it is so incredibly fun. the feeling of struggling on a boss and then finally beating it after learning its attacks is amazing and after just recently beating consort radahn hitless let me tell you it feels so good to finally finish a challange. i dont see myself stopping anytime soon and if you have a bit of patience and like hard games i strongly recommend playing this if you havent. all though i dont think there are many people who still havent touched this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"elden ring  9.510 elden ring is an absolute masterpiece that pushes every boundary of modern gaming. the open world is vast and enigmatic, inviting you to lose yourself in its hauntingly beautiful landscapes and intricate lore. every battle is a carefully crafted challenge that rewards strategic thinking and persistence, making each victory feel earned. the combat system is deep and satisfying, blending fluid movement with tough, rewarding encounters. while its high difficulty might be daunting for some, its a core part of the games charmdemanding skill and offering unparalleled satisfaction when you overcome its obstacles. minor hiccups like occasional performance dips are easily forgiven given the immersive experience on offer. whether youre exploring hidden secrets or facing off against epic bosses, elden ring keeps you engaged and on your toes throughout the journey. for anyone seeking a game that combines breathtaking exploration with relentless challenge, elden ring is a mustplay. it's nearly flawless, and that's why im giving it a welldeserved 9.510."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"this game offers a massive amount of content, requiring hundreds of hours to reach 100 completion. its an extraordinary experience with adjustable difficulty through gear upgrades. while demanding in terms of timing and learning enemy patterns, it remains accessible even to those who aren't experts in the genre. get ready for an exceptional challenge! not being a huge fan of this type of game myself, i was pleasantly surprised. i found it difficult, but with time and practice, everything becomes manageable. i recommend installing a death counter, as unfortunately, the game doesnt include this feature nativelyits only real downside, in my opinion.point ngatif."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"just like real life, hits hard, you get down on your knees, you wake up the next day, figure out new plan, loose couple of times, repeat until you defeat the challenge"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"very good game. the leveling system works well, the story is good, but the best thing is the combat. of course this is a souls game, so it's hard but it is super rewarding when you get that demi god felled across you screen."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"with the short time i have played with elden ring, it is by far the best open world experience i have seen ever. the difficulty of the game forces the player to fix their skill issue and think hard about what improvements need to be done to their build or where they should go to seek better opportunities. elden ring has little design features that makes you appreciate the world around you. for example, the tree sentinel at the beginning of the game is basically impossible to kill at a very low level, so the boss and its golden halberd serves as a reward to those who go back and try to clear out previously skipped opportunities. overall, despite this being my first soulslike game and dying many times, i haven't found the urge to stop playing. elden ring is a masterfully crafted open world experience that makes every inch of exploration on the map worthwhile."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,very good game amazing but confusing story amazing pve the pvp is questionable
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"great answer to a world full of follow the yellow brick road fetch quests. i once thought this game was stupid, too hard, and a waste of time. then i took some time and got good. still doing that last part, but its a fun journey!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"excellent progression of souls formula, taken to a height all it's own. if your willing to take your time and explore, it can be as easy or difficult as you want it to be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"it's one of the best open world games ever made, just play it if you haven't. be ready to take a beating, but look up a few tutorial vids or pull up a wiki if needed, just play it any way that makes you feel comfortable. the community can be very gatekeepy but ignore all that, just have fun. use summons and big stinky strength weapons or bleed. go have fun lmao"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"this game is fun and you will die a lot, but you can't give up because if you just keep trying you will eventually you will win once, and that first victory is always a great feeling. other than that the exploration is really fun with ton of secrets to look for and dying more times than i can count to gravity didn't take away from the experience too much for me either. while the game is not without flaws, because sometime this game genuinely makes me want to smash my keyboardyes i play this game on keyboard it take some getting use to but it is not that bad, like can you stop reminding me that you are spoiler malenia blade of miquella spoiler."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"im sure you have all heard and seen this game before so ill make it brief. the game is gorgeous and there is still secrets im finding after 300 hours on first play through. i tried to explore as much as i could while playing and tried to not just instantly look up everything. im not that great at the game so it could contribute to why my hours are so high however im still having fun finding new bosses. i really enjoy the extreme customization in difficulty you can create for yourself by picking 1 class thats less optimal, choosing boss fights at a lower level than recommend, and even not upgrading items along the way to list a few. there are plenty of other ways to taper your level of masochist gaming, but ill leave it those basics for brevity sake and spoilers. you can make the game easier as well but i wouldnt ever call this an easy game no matter how you play it. there is always at least 1 clear strategy  mechanic the game wants you to solve and its typically not repetitive however thats not to say there is only going to be 1 way to beat any boss. it was evident that a great deal of thought went into every boss fight, which i found extremely bitter sweet more sweet. can you cheese many bosses, definitely. is it easy to find that cheese for every boss, not really. its not blatantly obvious how to break the boss but even when you find something there is never a guarantee you will succeed which is another reason why this game i believe has had so much success. i will say that you can skip a lot of the content in this game to rush to the end however i dont get why youd want to with the gorgeous artwork throughout the game. you simply are lowering your time per  spent by rushing. some enjoy the speed run while i enjoy appreciating the work put into a well put together game. there is one caveat  the game wasnt really optimized well for pc users when i started in 2023? major changes could have been made since then, but i would strongly suggest monitoring resource usage and temps on pc with the feel of the game. it may be better on console for your gaming experience. that being said if you havent tried out this breath of fresh air and you enjoy a challenge  souls like games then do yourself a favor and start with the base game you wont be disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"beautiful. the story is unmatched and the world is soooooooo well made, can be a lit hard in places but nothing 500 attempts at a boss cant fix"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"elden ring isnt just an openworld gameits a revolution in exploration and design. the lands between is vast yet carefully crafted, rewarding curiosity with secrets, brutal bosses, and deep lore. combat builds on dark souls with new mechanics like ashes of war, spirit summons, and seamless mounted combat. whether wielding colossal greatswords, casting devastating sorceries, or bleeding enemies dry with katanas, every playstyle feels viable and satisfying. boss fights are some of fromsoftwares bestmalenia, radagon, and maliketh push you to master your build and timing. the games difficulty is punishing but fair, offering countless ways to adapt and improve. every item and npc hints at deeper truths, rewarding those who seek them. with unforgettable environments, gripping combat, and an endless sense of discovery, elden ring is a defining moment for openworld rpgs. final score 1510  a mustplay masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"genuinely the best world building in an open world game i've ever seen. as you can see, i put some time into this game. i lived in elden ring in 2022. even for those who could not connect with the dark souls series, like me, elden ring irons out most of the level design and game mechanic choices from dark souls 13 that turned me off at least, for example, no over the top boss run backs, much fewer cheaply placed enemies that only serve the purpose of killing an unaware player entering an area for the first time, things like that. this game feels like all of the good from dark souls, with none of the frustrating parts, plus the richest open world you're going to find in a game like this. i mean, it's elden ring. it's one of the greatest achievements in video game history."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,if you like open world exploration and tinkering with builds. brave and aren't afraid to die in a video game you'll love it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"the greatest journey of fight, die, rage, repeat till i either beat the boss or beat the monitor. only turnoff is that you cant rizz malenia but besides that 1010 would recommend especially to masochists and spiteful people."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"59year old gamer here... when i asked my sons about er, they laughed and said the game would be too hard for me. well that's all it took for me to install. it quickly became my favorite game of all time. it took me longer than them to figure out some of the mechanics, and boss move sets. but, i finished it and the dlc before my sons... they still haven't done so. i've gone through it 5 times now. seriously, this is truly one of the best games of all time... gorgeous world design, smooth movement and battle mechanics, great lore, excellent interface, and a amazing variety of weapons and bosses to master. truly an epic game... but not for the faint of heart. prepare to git gud or uninstall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,good game play and works well with steam. having a controller does help as the bindings don't always do well but otherwise a good game and story!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"this game has the shittiest frame pacing i have ever seen, its infuriating how much this game stutters. its made worse by the fact that the game itself is actually good. if its a shitty game i can just move on, but its a good game with such horrible performance issues 2 years after release with multiple patches that i want to play it but i fucking can't because of how dog shit the performance is. fix this shit. i completely reinstalled my windows, have a 3060 running the game at med settings where gpu usage is well below 60 and cpu usage is at 1215. why the fuck is this game stuttering."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"haven't played any fromsoftware game. installed it, dreading its popular difficulty. today after 173h i completed it with 90 of all achievements in my first playthrough. have to admit, i liked it. the only buggyunfair fight for me was malenia where i died not understanding what i did wrong. that entire fight put a sour spot on the game, but other than her, all other bosses and fights were fair, i understood where i failed, when i failed. and after repeated attempts i got better at fighting the bosses. story wise, it lacks a quest log. something to read up on active and ongoing quests. having to search up a guide on the next possible location for the quest npc, for him to just appear is not how it should be. not to mention that some of the times the npc's themselves blend in with the terrain..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"this game is very hard but the game play is very good. depending on what you prefer, as in hard vs story, this game either way is for you. its biggest flaw is the rune loss every time you die. it can easily get fixed with a mod you can find on nexus mods website."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"it's really hard to describe what category very few games, like elden ring, fall into. rather the scarcity itself renders a category one of the very few games that cancels my future plans. this iconic adventure is already one of, if not the most immersive experience i have ever had. very seldom are developers delivering their initial marketing promises. i would say this exceeds any and all expectations."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"playing elden ring has caused me immense frustration, rage, and may have possibly increased my chances of a heart attack. yet, this game is a masterpiece. its vast open world, endless builds, combat, and lore makes me want to play even more after finishing my first playthrough. though brutal, the enemies in elden ring are mostly fair, and each victory feels triumphant and memorable. both malekith and the elden beast can go suck my left nut, tho. 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"this game is such a big challenge also enjoyable and accomplishing. can get really frustrating but keep at it. it's a really beautiful game, really creative! worth every penny! amazing graphics, and boss fights! the amount of stuff to do in this game is a great deal, always new scenery. the quests are fun, the gear you unlock along the way is bad ass. couldn't ask for a more enjoyable solo player game but also can game with friends. fight bosses together. definitely 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"this game is a overall 1010 game. i got into it and i can't stop playing 520 hours in and iv beat the game 8 times. the combat, weapons, bosses, story, and world design are all incredible. 1010 would recommend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,great game with a great dlc just like every other soulsborne games
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,this game is hard but its worth what its cost you should buy you will be happy because its long hard and it can be fun.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"yes it's peak guys just go and get it. it's not that hard either, what's hard is keeping in track with all the youtube guides that you'll definitely be watching while you play because you wanna experience the whole side quests that you can definitely miss as you innocently progress through the main bosses... spoiler to then get depressed spoiler. mini ranni10"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,this is my first from software game and it was awesome. played the game on release and through the dlc. beaten the game 3 times with 2 different characters. there is so much to explore and do. so many builds to try and play styles. i love how all the bosses are different and have different timings to keep you on your toes. highly recommend.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,hard but fun and modding it is even more fun but i do think they should make it so without mods u can play with friends for the entire game not just bosses
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,one of the most beautiful game i've ever played. the only caveat is the hard to follow main story and quests.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"this is a game that you already know is fun and amazing, but for some how reason never quite finished it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"after you get over how the game is just fucking hard all the time its really fun, it feels like you're a god when you kill a boss you've been beating your head against for an hour"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"this game is so good, all the game play the graphics are just so good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"this game is a truly immersive and heroic fantasy world, a ground breaking improvement in the souls like genre. highly recommend!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"its a good game, its everything people say it is but its not as hard as people think it is, the game is overhyped for difficulty, however, the combat, the gameplay etc, very fluid, good game! praise this message for good karma"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"probably the most accessible souls game they've made. for the first year or two after its release, i didn't understand why they didn't just make dark souls 4. then i sat down and actually played this, and realized it is dark souls 4. but it's so much more than that. this game is huge, long, and far more fleshed out than any previous souls game to date. my big reservation was that people hyped it up to be the hardest game ever made, which just isn't true. is it difficult? yes. is it the most difficult game ever? eh...not necessarily. that completely depends on your play style. certain classes are easier than others. depending on how you build your character, this game can be a cakewalk or a total nightmare. your experience with it is what you make of it. and like the other games, this has coop, so if a boss or dungeon proves too much for you, you can call in backup. all of the core elements of the dark souls games are here, but with a wealth of additions and improvements that make it a much more engrossing experience. if you like the other dark souls games, get this. if you've never played one before, this is a great entry point."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"if you enjoy a challenge, this is one of very few steam games worth 60. very well crafted, you can feel the time and budget that went into the game, very large and full world and fun weapons. multiple playstyles, you could easily have a fun time replaying. don't expect a great multiplayer experience, but it is a spectacular singleplayer one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"i'm very late to the party. here nonetheless. souls fan or otherwise, this one is a must try for any gamer. combat, world design, enemies and bosses, volume of builds with countless weapons and spells, lore, and on and on.....all so well done. i look forward to many, many more hours of play with elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"was overwhelmed at first. lots to learn. but i stuck with it and now i'm obsessed. amazing game. so much left to do. the only bad thing i can think of is a couple clunky inventory issues like not being able to compare stats of a piece of armor at a merchant, to your equipped armor. that's it. everything else is perfect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"one of the best games i ever played  its an amazing openworld soulslike that heavily focuses on world building and bosses rather then us doing tons of similar activities  and most of the time is done in a great way. game throws us to a massive kindergarden in terms of how we want to play our character giving us endless options to choose style we prefere. weapon, armor and spell choice is probobly one of the richest in any game ive ever seen and thanks to it ng never felt like a drag. locations are stunning, especially visually. they perfectly grasp player in mystery and give incredible satisfaction after reaching long distanced areas. bosses are challenging and most of the time  unique and way more responsive then in other souls games. music is masterpice and creats great memories with certin locations. lore is stunning and addictive, every discovery feels like finding a treasure. my favourite  npcs, who more or less are with us togeather for most of our jounry giving some more flavour to the game  multiplayercoop is disaster and feels horribly outdated for no reason. in other souls game it was at least excused by some lore stuff like covenants, here they wasted opportunity. repetetive bosses are the worst thing about the game. most of the time they are optional, but it still feels disappointing to see similar faces so many times. late game feels rushed, especially in terms of map. compared to what game throws at us in the beginning it is pity that without any reason areas feel less developed and boring to explore endings could be done better. most of the time they dont feel rewarding, as game doesnt really acknowlage that we finnished the game. cutscenes are short anyway, so their lack for some bosses hurts some gameplay aspects feel like they got abandoned in development process and have little impact on gameplay sleep, dead, franzy etc. which also connects to some favouritism for some builds npcs quest dont work as good as in souls game. ds series is way more linear and makes their stories easier to follow as they feel like they are progressed in natural way, while in er everything feels like its just thrown randomly on map in many cases without any tip how to catch up with npcs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"27 hours in and all i can say is this game is pure masterpiece. idk why i waited 2 years to play this masterpiece? a bit more forgiving compared to sekiro and dark souls 3, this game is so much fun to play with lots of customizations and play styles, vast beautiful open world to explore, lovable characters, and interesting story. what can i say? well, it's 1010. be warned, this game is also addicting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"this game is a 1010 masterpiece. this game for new players is gonna be a challenge. if you are good at games like dark souls, bloodborne or sekiro shadow die twice this game is gonna be a breeze. lastly, if you manage to beat all bosses you become elden lord."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"overall, this is a truly stunning game. the exquisite and beautiful art style, excellent map design, interactive boss mechanics some, diverse equipment choices, and distinctively styled maps all contribute to an immersive experience. the game also features compelling storylines and wellcrafted npcs that enhance the sense of immersion during gameplay. however, there are definetely drawbacks. some bosses have stiff and mechanical input reading for example, when i press the heal button offscreen, my characters hand hasnt even lifted yet, but the boss has already rushed in to attack me. most weapons suffer from poor balance, making many of them impractical and more like toys than viable combat options. while there are plenty of clothing choices, only a few are truly visually appealing. some weapons dropped by bosses lack the same effects as when the bosses use them. additionally, several side quests appear to be unfinished due to rushed development e.g., melina, bernahl, black blade, kale, mimic tear, etc.. on the other hand, i dont understand why dung eaters questline seems so fully developed. moreover, some of the lategame maps feel vast yet empty such as the snowfield and capital of ash. overall, id give this game a positive review, but theres still plenty of room for improvement. looking forward to fss next game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"totally recommended not really great story line but the game play is cool can not see myself playing it after it finishes, so i would not say it is top 5 games of all time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"its nice and definetly a project type game, if you dont want to play over 100 hours in one go. it has an amazingly detailed and layered map, offering lots of exploring. the only thing is, that its on the hard side, but not something some mods cant do to help you have a niceexample focussing more on lore experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"if it wasn't for bloodborne this would be far and away my favorite game of all time. this is the dark souls formula perfected. great lineup of bosses, beautiful art direction, challenging but mostly fair combat, and the best open world experience i have ever had in a game. there are some relatively low lows with some of the bosses but the highs also match or exceed the very highest highs of the rest of the series."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,this is a big game with a great story and many play options. after beating the game multiple times i spent some time crawling the map and discovered 50 more areas and bosses than i had found previously. i would recommend this game to anyone old enough for the content. i just downloaded the dlc and i am excited for the additional content.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"this game is amazing. it's probably the hardest game i have ever played, but still, it might be one of the best."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"elden ring is the first soulslike game ive ever played, now its ascended to one of my favourite games of all time. i probably died a thousand times before i actually got the hang of it, but once i powered through the continuous butt blastings i got from standard enemies i saw the beauty of the game. some of the bosses are kinda cheesy but they look amazing and have really cool move sets and animations. just send wave after wave of your own face and you can quickly learn the dodge patterns. graphics are amazing, love the open world concept, theres so much to do. 1010 this game is definitely worth paying full price for."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"i've never played any from software games before, but this ended up being my most played rpg ever. the world design is beyond amazing and the bosses and details on everything are stunning. the only thing i don't like is the fact that you can miss a lot of things and have to play ng to get everything in the game. the game's difficulty is reasonable and the boss encounters are unique and doable. nothing feels artificially difficult."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"this game is among the few aaa games that deserve a buy no matter what. whether you are a dark souls fan or not i wasn't it's definitely worth the buy. from the amazing level design, to the beautiful artistic choices in the music, this brings home everything that you want in a cinematic experience brought to your hands directly. i highly highly recommend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,super fun and allows for a variety of play styles and builds. the more i play the more i admire the attention to detail and creativity. every single item and enemy placement seems to have lore implications. how this got beat by ragnarok for best story is beyond me. truly the work of geniuses in every aspect of the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"amazing, absolutely amazing i haven't played a game this fun and challenging since dark souls 3 in 2016. i have played many hours which has included by intense addiction to this game. i have also beaten most of the bosses over and over showing the replayability this game has with ng. i would recommend this game for those who have the will power and focus time to keep going even if you die and if your into fantasy games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"everyone loves elden ring that's a souls like player. i mean its simply the best combination of exploring, hacking and slashing, characterdevelopment build aspects and finally the loot.... i could keep going on an on about the graphics or the world design but i think this is enough"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"this is possibly the best game i have ever played. even if you've never played a souls like like me you need to play this game, it's simply amazing and completely worth the price."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,one of the best games games ever made. just enough content and dificulty.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,ui is terrible and an embarrassment for a modern game. fun challenging game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"it's definitely difficult to play, but it's super rewarding once you figure it out. it's my favorite game now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"this game was definitely meant to challenge your will, somehow everything about it is tedious and difficult, yet it still finds a way to be enjoyable, the enemies are fun and challenging as well. the only issue i have is that there are no quest markers for side quests, overall one of my favorite games though and it will always be worth playing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,it took me a few months to get into it i quit after my first try came back and 100 this game is easily the best i have ever played and even better with seamless coop playing with friends
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,best game i have ever played and the hardest game i hava ever played. i recommend playing it if your good at gaming. 1010 game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,very detailed game the amount of weapons and ash of wars and spells and talismans makes this game amazing because anyone can use whatever fighting style they want and do things at there own pace. 1010 must play game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"so many builds to create, can never get enough of this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,great console game...trash console port over to pc. the hardest part of the game is figuring out how to use the ui  controls when playing with keyboard and mouse.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"despite all the filler content and the somewhat repetitive gameplay, this guys really popped off with this one. what an amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"love the game mechanics and the open world gameplay. haven't spent a whole lot of time playing, but so far it's been fun!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"easy game. welcoming to new players. if you didn't enjoy any other souls like game, this one is for you. play online and always have a rune active, you will get easy help this way!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"best game i have ever played in the history of games i have ever played. great open world great action, great story and great mechanics!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,this game is too easy. good thing there's a mod to make it difficult
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,the first ever soulborne game that i ever played. from now i will play lot of soulslike game this game will make you feel awesome when you finished it and sad at the same time 1010 best game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"good game if you can get the hang of it. if you haven't played a souls type game before, please for the love of god, search guides and playthroughs. nothing is as it seems, the game has almost no linear components, do not just follow the light trails, you need to grind."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"in the words of videogamedunkey, this game beeg! and he wasn't joking. i'm getting lost while exploring, sidetracked with every new hallway, and distracted my every new group of enemies i stumble across. i can't believe how much of this game while still feeling like i haven't even scratched the surface! there is so. much. stuff. everywhere you go there is someone to fight or something to look at. there're items i know i'll be sinking multiple extra playthroughs into just to get to use them to their fullest and at almost 200 hours, i'm still finding new things to craft. i do wish the experience was a little smoother. there are a few hitches here and there in high intensity areas, but nothing really awful. taking tight corners causes the camera to jank out like you wouldn't believe and i've fallen to my death from this on ranni's rise more times than i can remember. and for crying out loud, why isn't fall damage consistent?! jumping six stories in one spot and i'm right as rain, but jump from two somewhere else and my ankles are obliterated! all in all and quirks aside, even after i eventually put 500 hours into this game, i feel like i won't have seen everything. but i do look forward to trying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"can't say more than it has been said before, this is a game that test you. it is up to you if you accept the challenge this game offers. if you accept the challenge there are many ways to clear it, look for something that you are willing to try out. httpseldenring.wiki.fextralife.comweapons the dlc is only if you are close to finish the game, my advice is to only buy it if you reach the snow part of the game mountaintops of the giants. the dlc is harder if you don't try to get all the scadutree fragments and revered spirit ash, i used this guide to get as many as i could httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmgqjdnhtfoc my build was adapted from this one and i made modifications as i progressed on the game httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vrwgyajhxim you can check other base builds if you are new to this kind of game httpseldenring.wiki.fextralife.combuilds spirit ashes are npcenemies that help you on hard fights, my advice is to try to get lhutel the headless as soon as you can and from there chose another one, once you know your character build httpseldenring.wiki.fextralife.comspiritashes this game isn't for everyone but once you start your journey on it, you are going to remember it for the rest of your life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"varre can kiss my behind for calling me maidenless jokes aside for the real review after getting every achievement i say this game is a 1010, the storyline and lore is absolutely peak and the gameplay, exploration and combat system is done beautifully, if you have never experienced a souls game this is where to start, having an open world at your fingertips flooded with secrets, lore and life is something not many games do well but elden ring does an amazing job at it, hundreds of hours can be poured into this game yet everytime you start a new playthrough your going to find something new and there are so many different and unique builds to choose from for each playstyle i seriously recommend anyone and everyone to play this if they get the chance and goodluck to all new players 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"i've got like 600 hours on xbox, had to refund it on pc unfortunately cuz mine isnt good enough to run it. absolutely phenomenal game, my largest complaint is only that you can't open your map in combat, other than that its fantastic and i recommend it to everyone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,bro this game is heat like im still playing i havent beat it cuz i sucked before but now im end game and its amazing im prolly gunna beat it in like 1 more week and then buy the dlc
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,elden ring is a magnificent game with an entire world to explore. you will battle very smart enemies which give players plenty of rewards. each moment in this game pushes openworld games beyond limits and feels like an adventure. enjoy the journey!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"my favorite game of all time, this was my first souls game and after going back and playing ds1, ds3, and sekiro this game is still my favorite. everything about this game is great and near perfect, there is absolutely some flaws with the game like an unfinished later 14 of the game imo with a weirdly high difficulty jump but every boss is awesome except for godskin duo and gideon and some of the best osts of all time, genuinely love every art direction and scenery in the game and will continue to play this for a while until the next big fromsoft game comes out. highly recommend even if you think the game is hard your first souls game is always the hardest the rewarding feeling of beating a hard boss is nearly intoxicating with how good it feels. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"my absolute favorite game of all time. even to the point that this is the first game i've ever had the patience to 100 on pc, and xbox. though, that is for the base game, the dlc has it's quirks to say the least, but allinall, still a wonderful experience"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"i am just a girl that usually plays cozy games. i am not very good at video games and i thought elden ring looked fun.... i was wrong... or right. it is so fun. i die a million times but i'm still having fun. i played for 2 hours when i first purchased it and thought i couldn't play this.. i came back after a couple months and after dying a million more times i started to become better. the graphics are great and the story is interesting. i am also not used to not having a quest log so i do have to refer to the internet sometimes. overall this is a great open world game, you just have to be okay with dying a lot!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"not my favorite game but probably the best game i've ever played. music, gameplay, items, art, etc etc, to me its very high quality. the best adventure game i've played. i've yet to play a game quite as magical as this one. does have its frustrating moments but they are dim compared to this game's shining glory."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"very enjoy able, can use nintendo switch control with cable connected."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"looking back on this game it's hard to say if it's one of my favorite from offerings, on the one hand it does feel in some ways like a greatest hits compilation, which i don't necessarily mean as a negative thing, i think a lot of companies that make these kind of huge games could benefit greatly from the style of iteration elden ring does. there is enough meat on the bone to keep yourself engaged, i would call this a great game and while definitely not for everyone, it is the most accessible from software game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,if you struggle understand thats the same as in life you have to try over and over again you may get frustrated but the best option is to keep going and once you reach the summit of your journey every ounce of effort will feel like nothing in comparison to your acheivment
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"as a lover of fromsoft's pvp since ds1, when i say this is my least favorite fromsoft game, that still makes this one of my favorite games of all time. the netcode has had some improvements and also taken some hits since launch, e.g. backstabs now work, but lag has gotten worse across the board. and the overall pvp balance has improved significantly in the mid to late game while the early game also seems to have gotten worse. if this is your first souls andor fromsoft title, i strongly recommend getting through at least the first two or three areas without summoning for a better online experience overall, and just avoid the arenas altogether. the one area i think this game shines above the other fromsoft titles is the lore and story. there's just so much of it and it's so well done, so many little plot points and stories all webbed together to untangle like an anthropologist which is an absolute delight to engage with. fuck the consecrated snowfield though. considering this game is a bit bloated, as open world games often are, i'd just delete that whole area, instantly improve the experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"this is an amazing game. i'm only getting started with nine hours in. there are so many interesting things in elden ring's vast open world and so many fun opportunities to develop your character. sometimes combat feels infuriating but there's no better feeling when you beat a tough enemy after so many failed attempts. the game isn't perfect though. performance issues are one thing. the game freezes often for about 3 seconds not to mention the 60 fps hard limit. my computer has the horse power to run the game at higher fps but that option isn't enabled. for someone like me, who's never played a soulslike game before the does at times feel overwhelming. there are a ton of things players need to learn and the game explains almost nothing about how to play the game and succeed. all in all, i can recommend this game if you're willing to spend a lot of time researching gameplay guides and tips online. it's a 45 game for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"one of the best games i have played in years. difficulty level to the max, but not because of bugs or the like. it is just difficult. if you're looking for a game that punishes you in all the right ways  look no further."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"its my first ever souls like game, its not as stressfull as i thought. yes the game require some of your time to understand the mechanic but the games can be as easy as u wanna be, you dont need to beat elden ring like the pro streamer outer you dont need to understand all the bosses movement, there always some kind of tips  trick u can find out there to help you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,the game is fun but difficult. until waterfowl dance where it is just unfair.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"the human brain and water are a lot alike in how they flow and change. like water moving through rivers, our thoughts and emotions are always shifting. the brain is constantly making new connections, much like water carving out its own path in the world, always finding a way forward. both the brain and water are shaped by their surroundings. water by the land it moves through, and our brains by the people, places, and experiences we encounter. when were calm, our minds can feel clear and focused like a peaceful lake, but when life gets overwhelming, its easy for our thoughts to feel like a stormy sea, racing and out of control. water is essential to life, and so is the brain. it helps us grow, learn, and adapt. just like water finds its way no matter the obstacles, our brains have the power to adjust and learn from whatever life throws at us. in the end, both the brain and water teach us about flexibility, change, and the beauty in flowing with lifes currents, no matter how unpredictable they may be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"amazing game from start to finish. hundreds of hours of content in the base game, even more if u play with sote which is also really good. most of the bosses are fair and fun to fight, with a perfectly crafted balance of speedlifedamage, making every bossfight unique in their own way. would buy again, play again, then buy it as a gift to someone and play again. 1110."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"after ng3 and over 100 hours on this game, i highly encourage people get this game now or yesterday, because if you haven't played this game you are missing out because this is the best game to ever cross my life i love this game to the fullest, and for anyone struggling on margit please pursue and don't give up trust me everything will be worth at the end."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"after giving up on finishing the initial dark souls and dark souls ii, i was highly sceptical whether this game would be for me. however, the quality of life changes present in elden ring make the movement and fighting much less frustrating as fewer actions will happen that i never intended. i love the world. i love the bosses. and being able to spend dozens of hours in a single region or even castle just to see everything really hits a sweet spot for me. it's the first fromsoftware game that i seem to be able to finish. it hits the right spots to motivate me rather than being too frustrating to play and explore."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,this games is awesome! it is pretty tough but you get better at not dying over time! the graphics are really great and the open world concept is my favorite. this game is huge but super satisfying!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,9 feet tall woman with overly detailed feet destroys me over 10 thousand times till i showed her my greatsword with giant hunt. what did miyazaki mean by this? cant wait for nightreign where the next 9 foot girlboss with overly detailed feet dominates me and destroys my run
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"big open world to explore with lots of secrets and amazing boss fights. a hundred hours in, trying to find all the secrets and items and i still haven't beaten the vanilla game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,hard to follow along but easy maniacs. i don't usually play souls like so i don't like it but i would recommend it if you do.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"greatest game i have ever played, would be replaying and never get tired of it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,simply the best game ever created. its amazing 1010 everything is perfect  except the rot place but still a 1010. it open the world of dark souls to me. and oh boy it changed my life for the better. simply the best type of game and elden ring is the peak of all those games. cant wait to see where it goes after this masterpiece.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,it is my favorite game since 2022 it has beautiful graphics and one of the best storylines
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,its kinda annoying when u die over and over again. but when u beat that one boss oooommmmggggg it feels really good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"i've just beaten margit and i gotta say, i've never experienced a game like elden ring before. the open world is full of hidden secrets and items to collect and you really can go wherever you want not always a good idea tho. the game is a soulslike, so you know it's punishing and difficult, but i think it's a good game to jump into the souls genre as it's my first as well. i'd personally recommend looking at a map of the recommended level per region, this has really helped me to know in which order to do everything. it has also made sure i'm not underleveled. have fun, tarnished!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,only 8 hours to finish the game. what the fuck man i thought this game had loads of content. i am the elden lord after 8 hours and the bosses aren't even hard took 3 attempts on every main boss in the game. very beautiful game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"muito bom a lore do jogo, pena que tem muito bosses reaproveitado, o que deixa o jogo de certa forma enjoativa."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"besides the great combat, lore and visualls i think it's the best openwolrd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"usualy when i game i like taking breaks and enjoying the game or ill finish it to quickly, this game is so good i can't stop playing, stayed up all night because i legit couldn't stop, i might be overwhelled by the amount of connetent here and there, but over all i love it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"at one point, my character appeared to have two heads with a small third head growing from their chest. absolutely delightful!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"wonderful game, full of adventure and challenges, and the best entry point to the souls series for newcomers. the dlc is demonic."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"have a little bit of time on this game now and i can confidently say that it is hands down the greatest game ever made. it has captivated me for hundreds of hours and will do so for hundreds more. it is a perfect level of difficulty where the game is always a challenge but can be more of or less of one depending on how you play it. the pvp is shockingly fun and the story is rich, intricate, and sometimes a little bit emotional. i would highly reccomend this game to anyone it is absolutly worth the money and so is the dlc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"fantastic exploration, skill, non linear game play with the ability to grind to achieve what you want."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"this is the second fromsoftware game that i play, the first being sekiro. it started as hard as hell, but then i explored the world, evolving my character as best as i saw fit. it was a journey on its own. being able to turn around and go elsewhere is the feature i liked the most in this installment. once you get the vibe and mechanics, the game flows perfectly. the lore, being divided into items and a hundred thousand pieces, is something that did not get me. ten games later, and you still have to watch a bunch of videos on youtube to grasp the story. some might like it, some dont. souls games are not just games anymorethey have become phenomena. people keep playing, exploring, and trying, and in a world like the one we have today, that is something incredible. give it a try!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"w game, lots of respect for the devs for the open world capabilities."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"amazing visuals, challenging souls gameplay, lots of deep lore if you care to read all the item descriptions. from software just might be the best to ever do it..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,i got told to get elden ring i got elden ring i played elden ring i killed the first npc i got called maidenless im maidenless in game and irl nobody calls my maidenless later realized i got a special disease called skill issue tried to git good still not good at the game and still maidenless
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"amazing in every way. best souls game, amazing environments and lore, and great mechanics. one of the top ten games ever made"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"at first i really didnt like the game because the game was too hard, but i kept playing it and i realised this game is all about exploring. if anyone wants to try their first souls game this is it. yea its 60 dollars, but its absolutely worth it. absolute cinema"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,love this game and everything about it. would love to have more options for armor colors but that is just an aside.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"this is the most flawless fromsoftware game i ever played and enjoyed. in fact and rightfully so, it's the better soulslike game you should play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"this game is actually so fucking annoying, i love this game more than any other game than i have ever played besides hotline miami and i have so much fun every time i play a new play through, but radahn in the dlc is just ruining my whole day, i am so sick of fighting this stupid ass boss, i loved fighting him originally so much that i didnt even use the summons the game puts in the boss fight, but now that hes a short king i am losing my fucking mind, he is so much stronger than before it is insane, i understand i supposed to get better and i understand hes meant to be hard as hes the last boss in the dlc but jesus christ man i cant do anything, it feels like im beating my head into the wall over and over again expecting this wall to break but it turns out this wall is made of straight fucking hardened steel and im sick of it man, great game tho, def would recommend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"ich habe dieses spiel angefangen zu spielen ohne zu wissen was auf mich zukommt. jetzt nach fast 80 stunden spielzeit kann ich sagen, dieses spiel hat mir die schnheit vom spielen gezeigt und mir die augen geffnet. drum rate ich jedem diesem spiel eine chance zu geben und diese nachricht weiterzuleiten um mehr leuten zu helfen, den spa am gaming nicht zu verlieren."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,this is the game to have from from software. it's their ultimate accomplishment in soulslike genre they initially visioned in demon's souls and reiterated in dark souls series. this is their complete package and i highly recommend playing elden ring if you want to experience what has become of their long journey towards their dream game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"overall solid, but not a masterpiece, and lacks the replayability of the other games in the series due it major bloat. i'm a long time souls fan and this ranks in the lower end of the list for me. bloodborne and ds3 are my favorites it's games like this where i wish there was a mixed review option i beat the main game and will update later when i finish the dlc pros  in some ways, this game feels like what dark souls 2 was intended to be, with a more open, alive feeling world, not to mention the little touches like the spoiler half assed spoiler return of power stancing, key gates, giants, and unfortunately gank bosses  the legacy dungeons are overall very well designed. the first one spoiler stormveill spoiler is the fan favorite though, so you could argue the quality drops off gradually. i personally liked spoiler leydell spoiler the most  combat is more or less dark souls 3 but more fun, they added a new guard counter which functions like a parry but is easier to use. if you land a certain number, you can stagger the enemy or boss! weapon arts also make a return called ashes of war, which are significantly more customizable.  wielding two weapons at once, especially greatswords, can be a lot of fun as well. it isn't like dark souls 2 though, they can only be weapons of the same class  respecing your character is available relatively early in the gamed  same engine as dark souls 3bloodbornesekiro and it's a ps4 game at base, so graphically you know what you're getting. only new change is the addition of raytracing on pc. i personally like the engine and all the plasticy looking characters  in some ways, this is the most accessible soulsborne game. you have a new feature called spirit ashes which are like summons except they are enemies that fight for you. as the game is more open, you also aren't hitting a roadblock too often, and it can be possible to show up overleveled. fromsoft also included a few very explicit farming spots to help make leveling up quicker and earing cash to buy new weapons. spoiler the mohg palace cliffside at the start of the area nets you 3040k souls just be genociding some grey alien looking commoners. it only takes a minute or 2 each run, which then becomes 15 seconds per run once you can get the sacred relic sword and spam waves of goldspoiler cons  biggest issue is the bloat. it took me 70ish hours to beat the main game, but realistically there's only 3040 hours of true meaty content in here, including a bunch of catacombscaves. there's far too much traversal, and so far this issue has only been exacerbated in the dlc. the first area of elden ring you start in is the largest and most dense, then it falls off the further you get. if someone were to ever make a linearity mod that made the game closer to dark souls 3 or bloodborne in structure, that would be super cool  a lot of side content is in caves and catacombs, which can be repetitive. i loved the chalice dungeons in bloodborne, but wasn't a big fan of the catacombs, which were similar but lower quality. i did like the miners caves the most, which are more or less required if you want to be able to purchase unlimited weapon upgrade materials. the miners caves reminded me of the one in demon souls  of all the soulsborne games, i would say elden ring by far has the weakest bosses. you definitely have a quantity over quality approach...but this unfortunately extends to the main game as well. there are several main bosses that are outright repeated spoiler you fight margit twice, mohg twice, godrick twice, several tree sentinels, the fat noble twice, radahn in the dlc spoiler. there are also a lot of gank fights. all in all, even dark souls 2 wasn't this egregious with boss repetition  bosses tend to be on the more frustrating than fun side, many of them have aggressive aoe attacks that are difficult to avoid and instant kill, or cause serious issues with the camera like spoiler maliketh, and some of the dlc bosses like dancing lion spoiler. my favorite boss was the final boss spoiler radagon, however the second phase is elden beast which is iffy. too much chasing the boss down spoiler  dark souls 1 had an annoying weapon upgrade system, but there was viability to use different elements. in elden ring, most enemies and bosses are weak to bleed, so you hardly have a reason to use anything else  spoiler malenia spoiler is the hardest and most broken boss i have ever fought in a soulsborne game. after overleveling and using bleed build, i am embarassed to admit i had to use a mimic tear summon. best i could do solo was half of her phase 2 health bar. she breaks all the rules of the game, her most egreious being her life regain that heals her even if she only makes contact with your shield. as a longtime souls fan who fully beat every boss in demon souls, dark souls 1, 3 and bloodborne missed a couple in 2 and sekiro but i still beat bosses like fume knight and ishin and recently finished lies of p, i have never used a summon until now  elden ring has some of the hardest bosses as well. i think a newcomer would truly struggle with even the first two story bosses, with their delayed attacks and 57 hit combos  horse combat is pretty limited. the double jump is nice to have, but your horse can't have  pc performance has a lot of stuttering issues, and performance is worse in the dlc  like any souls game, you need a guide for the npc quests, they're just as vague as before. this is one thing lies of p did a much better job. it's even worse this time around because the game is so dang open, so you realy don't know where to go and it takes even longer to find npcs. i missed the most important side quest in the entire game.  because the game is not linear, there are possibilities you might miss important mechanics. i did not know about the crystal tear system until the spoiler mohg spoiler fight, and then it turned out i never found the item in the game, had to use a guide to locate it  i solely play pve so i cannot comment, but i've heard this game has some of the worse pvp in the series"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,i recommed only if you have the time to play this game. its not very straight leading like it doesnt tell you what to do which could lead to being bored. so if you like knowing what to do then i dont recommed
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"i haven't played many soulslike games, but this one feels like a good entry point into fromsoftware's games. the environments are beautiful and it can be fun to run around the world discovering new things on each playthrough. there aren't a ton of cut scenes and long exposition sequences, but lore and story can be found if you go looking for it. the game does feel long in both good and bad ways, but i don't ever feel like i've wasted my time after doing yet another playthrough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,goated game. spent 3hrs on the tree sentinel first time i got into the game. spent more on other bosses. loved the fights and pvp is solid.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,game looks fantastic and the game play is great! multiplaythroughs are fun as well and feel rewarding. a must play!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,there's always something new to find and a tuff as hell boss to fight . definitely worth it for all kinds of players
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"there is a genuine and quite valid argument that this is the greatest game ever made. i personally hold that view as to many others and it's not just recency bias or overhype. now the game has been out for 3 years, i think enough time has passed to objectively look at the game and it's flaws there aren't many and say that it is without doubt a masterpiece. 1010 doesn't seem enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"the first third of the game is the best game i've played in my life. the exploration, combat, sightseeing and character building are brilliant. then at the second third things start being messy and tedious, repetitive. the third third of the game is just rehashed assets from the first two parts and is just a chore to get through. 810"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,start game  create character  wake up in a strange castle  die to your first grafted scion  get graped multiple times after that 1010 would do again
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"what are you doing here, tarnished? the fallen leaves tell a story... of how a tarnished became elden lord. officially the best game of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"absolute great game, worth its price and the gameplay is peak. bosses sometimes are annoying especially if you consider that it's an open world game and you can easily find yourself against endgame bosses but it's worth your time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,very fun. enjoyable boss fights. confusing quests but that makes it even more interesting
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"elden ring set the gold standard for tower defense games on pc  it is arguably the king of td! it ticked all the boxes with insane replayability, challenging score based gameplay  a big list of levels  modes. it was the perfect balance for many gamers with some clocking thousands of hours of play time. in all the years to follow no tower defense game has toppled elden ring from its throne  but now there is a serious contender from fromsoftware's own stables.so, is elden ring the worthy successor to the crown? all the components that made dark souls 3 are essentially in elden ring plus more! that means pretty much all the towers return, along with the aliens. similar number of campaign levels on offer  fletcher returns with some new 'friends' to provide some raspberry comic relief. i got a bit lost with all the new ai voices and story twists but that is not super important for a td game. it plays like it's the same with more detailed graphics  enhanced mechanics. everything is a little more refined that includes a few more modes to challenge, medals for all difficulty levels, extra powerup  commander upgrade options  some dynamic 'moveable' maps. these newer elements add more tactical  strategic weapons to your arsenal. online has gotten a lot of attention with multiplayer being added. this was like playing a whole different game! my favorite mode is elden ring fighter. in this you face off against a competitor, each of you has your own map in wich each kill you make spawns an alien on their map in the location you killed it. games were hectic, intense and generally close with the ability to counter each other's defenses in realtime. it is excellent fun! there is also a full coop mode where you share the same map squares  resources wich actually wasn't as much fun as i hoped it would be. for that, you really need a good understanding with your partner  not playing with random matchmaking people. the third mode was a bit of a hybrid, with players being allocated set squares on the same map, defending the same map but competing for kills. it was all a bit confusing for many i think on how best to play this mode wich limited its appeal. finding players was a bit inconsistent, but it was well designed to allow you to play single player while you wait in the multiplayer queue. what was not so well designed was managing with the dropouts i experienced a lot of defeated players who would rather drop the game than suffer a loss  this will also mean the end your game too  prevent you from recording a high score or achieving a medal. frustrated me to no end! it would have also been nice to browse a list of active games to join. another welcome addition is the level editor for community created levels! this will to elden ring's longevity although i was dissappointed to see the steam workshop is only used to submit for paid maps. might be a technical limitation with steam  there is a external community run site www.eldenringfreemaps.com to get free maps, but having it all integrated in steam would have been really nice. both paid and free maps to encourage the community to keep on playing  exploring content. at time of writing this, there is only 4 official paid maps available via fromsoftware store, but close to 20 more via the external site. on a more positive note, i really liked the introduction of the boost tower. this tower acts as a simple block on an empty square, but it also provide a tower built on it greater line of sight  powerup options that enhance the tower like revealing stealth units or scoredamage boosts these powerups also make the command tower from the previous game redundant hence no longer in elden ring there is a command structure on each map through wich provides level modifications for purchase. these raise or move sections of the maps to give more building options and better defenses. they add variety to each play through, but felt they were a bit underutilized. after several runs through a level you find you don't use them anymore. there are some other differences that set elden ring apart from its predecessor. on a minor point, there are no flying aliens i always found them a distraction so i don't mind they are gone!  on a larger point there is a new scoring system now i need to take a moment to explain this further as it is a deciding factor that does change the feel of the game. dark souls 3 scoring system was time based this meant the longer you can keep the aliens in the map, the more interest on your resources you got  a higher score. this was somewhat flawed in design as it encouraged players to 'juggle' the aliens on the map as long as possible  do things like sell towers for extra interest near the end of the level. in elden ring the scoring is efficiency based  this means when you kill an enemy you get a set score for the alien plus a bonus based on the amount of resources. no more increasing interest over time, but there is periodic drip of supplies you get at key waves. the result puts the focus back on killing aliens  making sure they don't escape with a core. you can still juggle to improve efficiency but the length of time is no longer a factor. although it is a more logical scoring system, for me it doesn't have the same tactile response or feel you get when you are doing well. in dark souls 3, you could see by the resource score ticking faster  faster along with the combination of the effectiveness of your towers in real time to really feel how well you were doing  it felt precise in a weird way. in elden ring there is now a ingame real time graph wich helps negate the lack of 'ticking', but i find it still harder to judge just how much better you are doing. i think this is due to the very small window zoomed in graph you see and the relative impact or lack of?? towers seem to make your scoreefficiency . it's different but for me even though the old system was flawed it was simply more fun to play. the flaws gave dark souls 3 its character  a unique style of play wich now seems lost to a certain degree. elden ring wins on many fronts, but my conclusion is that dark souls 3 retains the crown. if it were an olympic 300 foot sprint, it would be a photo finish down to the milliseconds! if the old scoring system rules were available as an alternative play mode i think there would be a new king! elden ring is still a fantastic game despite my preference for the old scoring system, that's really deserved of every strategist  tower defense fan's game collection. update 2015 the old scoring system is back! players now have the choice between the new and old scoring systems. this is great! many thanks to fromsoftware for continuing to improve this awesome game. if you enjoyed reading this review, please follow true blue reviews for more reccommendations!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,at first felt too hard and was wondering how anyone would play this and enjoy it. then i got good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"i love the lore, the replay ability, all the different buildsweapon types, the music, the bosses...the list goes on and on."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"thou art maidenless enough to journey forth through the land of death. it's a game that defines a generation. over 100 hours of content, with no farming. game is simply goated. anything positive that can be said about a game, has already been said about elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"h1 my first soulsborn game and it is nuts h1 elden ring was my first game of this genre and the amount of combination and ways you can play this game is b insane b. the story is all around you, just waiting for you to pickup and stitch together in correct order. there isn't a wrong way of playing any game, elden ring proves it. loved the game, completed nearly all achievements and multiple class gameplay. supper recommend it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"the quantity over quality game of the souls games. i'm not sure i would be very positive about the game without its much better dlc, but i like dark souls 2 so i still wouldn't be able to justify a hard negative review. after all, one of the reasons people think dark souls 2 is the worst souls game ever is because of the repeated and large number of bosses with the focus on quantity over quality. i'm sorry to say it but the open world and scale feels detrimental to the game. literally 90 of the bosses are weak and filler. there are over 200 bosses in this, and a lot of them are repeated andor pushovers. the major bosses are great, but the entire experience becomes a highly diluted slog when the majority of your gameplay is exploring a somewhat empty world with largely lame bosses. i'm not excited for what comes next after pushing over my fourth crystalian boss. if you haven't played the souls series, bloodborne, or sekiro, i would recommend you play those instead. they're much more finely crafted linear experiences compared to this flawed and unengaging open world. it's a slog, it gets dull, and it gets boring. if you have played the others, then sure, there's no reason not to play elden ring as well. the dlc is definitely recommended. i wouldn't say the base game sucks, it just has glaring flaws that largely come down to a matter of quantity over quality. elden ring pvp is the worst pvp has ever been, so if that's what you're looking for, you better get that out of your head. the more i go on the more i want to give it a negative review, but i think that's too harsh for what you get. dark souls 3 just had its seamless coop mod released. maybe you should give that a try."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"one of my favorite from games. i started playing from when i was a kid, starting at demon soul's. while i enjoy aspects of each game elden ring best encapsulates some of the best of each game. the only game that i found comparable to enjoyment for me is bloodborne and dark souls iii. 1010 recommend, and this extends to the dlc as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"i did not understand why elden ring got game of the year back in 2022, until i played it. playing games used to give you a sense of reward and satisfaction. now the only time i feel a sense of satisfaction is when i win a comp game in a multiplayer game. this would be nice however, playing withagainst real people can get toxic and not fun real fast. i am a streamer and my friend recommended me this game. he talked very highly of it and said i should give it a shot. i was hesitant at first but decided why not. playing the first 5 to 10 hours was okay but, beating more bosses made me feel a certain way. i kept playing and got hooked to the game. i did a full strength build and the feeling of reward i would feel after defeated a hard boss like morgot was something i could not explain. i beat the game a couple days ago and i just have to say, i understand it now. this game is beautiful, challenging, and rewarding. the game is a combo of skyrim and darksouls! you do not have any right to judge this game unless you play a decent bit of it because it is truly an amazing game. reaching 109 hours in the game and approaching the dlc, i can say this game deserved game of the year. 1510"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"elden ring is a very good starting point for new souls players who want to experience the genre, although depending on how you play it, it could be the hardest one to start on. the base game and dlc are personally the best experiences i have had in games and they have lead me to try the other souls game and find my fondness for them. overall, elden ring is an excellent game that i would recommend to everyone, with the precaution that they will die many many times, but that's just part of the experiencelearning curve that a lot of people don't understand, and is the thing that originally made me not want to try the games. if you look past the obvious downsides of the game like the reused bosses and the sometimes stupid fights, you will find an at least 910 gaming experience that you will never forget."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,amazing story line. beautiful graphics.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,after 50 hrs of gameplay and death i finally beat the first boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,amazing open world souls experience. great game for beginners and veterans alike.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"1010 nothing else to say. playstyles i have tried  mage gravity sling buildice mage greatsword 510 really easy world traversal, decent against early bosses, falls off hard later.  unga bunga heaviest armorflamberg str tank 810 super easy, easily tanks 5 hits from bosses before healing, mimic tear alone almost solos bosses.  dragon paladin still playing, heaviest armordragon incantations 1010 easiest build so far. rot breath clears hords of enemies with ease. rot breath a boss and run it around. no need to play agressive, rot will kill the boss over time but getting some hit in will speed it up. dragonmaw also does big damage. ranni is best girl, honorable mention for melina for her sacrifices."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,elden ring is an amazing game with amazing graphics. the play style is also something no other game has
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"not my first souls game and had much of it spoiled over the last couple of years, but still managed to not only surprise me, but kept me engaged throughout its long run, excellent soundtrack, beautiful world, couldn't recommend more to anyone. 9.710.0"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,for the love of absolutley anything and everything dont fight that damn tree sentinal when u first start
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"i've enjoyed playing this game so much lol, completed everything and the dlc was honesty a fun challenge. there's so many different ways to play the game with the different classes and the pvp option, and i get to use cool ass weapon skills and spells"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"already played this for 600 hrs up until messmer in sote, decided to buy it to enjoy multiplayer as well as finish it thru the official game, and currently saving for dlc and upcoming nightreign. definite recommend. time flew by when i was getting destroyed by mobs, and especially bosses, and passed as quickly while i get a hang of their move sets. conquering bosses gave you an unequivocal rush of joy and disappointment the disappointment, being unable to fight and destroy the boss until the next playthrough. hoping everyone can try this masterpiece. every now and then, a game so good gets released and redefines gaming quality. godfrey, malenia, radahn, radagon elden beast, fortissax, senessax, placidusax, borealis, bayle the dread, divine beast dancing lion, rellana, and messmer these are all memorable fights worth all the hype everybody was raving about, and it's not even half of it. come to the lands between, prove your mettle, and if you're worthy, become the elden lord."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,its highly addictive and hard to stop playing. the scenery is beautiful and breathtaking 3
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,best game. i love fantasy games and this world is great. i want more lore and a second game for sure.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"elden ring serves as a testament to open world video game design. there is a true sense of accomplishment once that rockhard enemy has been slain and, something that compels a player to relentlessly do it over and over again until they succeed is truly rewarding. the world is humongous and an epitome of how exploration should be encouraged, by intriguing players to see what is over the hill. elden ring is an unmissable, mustplay, gaming experience with surprises galore. elden ring is the true triumph that fromsoftware was striving for all those years. complete and utter triumph."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,it is so much fun to beat a boss that you have been trying to beat for 6 hr straight. the feeling is immaculate.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,amazing i feel like i've discovered actual gaming. i played the game for two hours and then bought the dlc play this game and you will be astonished the dlc brings even more to the table then the base game and my god if you want to best gaming experience buy elden ring and if you want a even better experience buy the dlc too.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,its a very good game worth every penny. feels like a new open world game but on old principals. no hand holding nonsense explore it at your own pace find bosses level up till you strong enough to beat them. if you start on this journey and you beat some of the bosses you feel like you gained experience in real life not just your character hence very immersive. i think its good for casuals and hardcore gamers. i enjoy it so much want just to take my time with it see everything it has to offer. keeps you guessing like i'm just gonna go over whats there? and hours passed. it is a true masterpiece!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"if you've completed one playthrough of this game, then i urge you to try atleast one more playthrough with a completely different build with a noticeably different playstyle. don't just jump to the next game. make full use of the money you spent for this game. even if you didn't end up liking the playstyle you'd still have some kind of idea of what to pick for your next build."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,almost 100 the game and its amazing. although it keeps crashing when i enter cealid s i cant really play in caelid
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,great game just be wary of the targeting system its kinda stinky but other than that game of a life time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,this game is really fun if you have patience. i am not very good at it but as long as you're a little overleveled its still great.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"elden ring is full of unforgettable moments! the thrill of beating your first major boss after countless attempts is unbeatable. exploring the vast open world, stumbling upon hidden underground cities like siofra or nokron, and the sheer terror of stepping into caelid for the first time make the journey incredible. the joy of jolly cooperation with other players, mastering the combat system, and discovering wellhidden secrets like the haligtree add to the magic. every playthrough feels unique, and thats what makes it such an amazing experience!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,this game is so good it is very fun the bosses are very good and intresting storry they look cool and if you are worrying if the game is to hard i played it on a mage character and a priest character they are very easy idk about the other classes that actually use swords and axes i think theyre harder but this game is just very good even the dlc worth playing and worth the experience
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,great game 1010 for everything challenging but great
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,i've spent more time on this game than i would on most and am still very much a beginner. this game is insane in every way possible
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,top 5 games of alltime. been serious gaming for years. the game that gives with no pay to win or money for skins is refreshing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"this game truly is a masterpiece from start to finish. if you play this, you will get an experience, unlike any other. the difficulty of this game, although hyped up to be extremely difficult is actually completely customizable depending on your play style. unlike previous souls games in the series, you have complete freedom to fight whoever you want to fight and take as long as you need. having trouble fighting a particular boss? then go do something else. this game never ceases to bore me there is always something new to discover. the build you use while playing the game is completely customizable and with enough effort should always work no matter who youre fighting. this game truly is a masterpiece through and through."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"this game is massive and a total masterpiece  the world is extremely immersive with so many things to do, and so many ways to advance your character to prepare for the intense and difficult yet fun boss fights. i'm still on my first playthrough and am approaching 100 hours without even trying for completionist, and i still have quite a lot to do. this is also one of the most gorgeous games i've ever played without a doubt  every area, every boss fight and everything about elden ring's design is a pure work of art. what keeps this game from being a 1010 for me though is that the design of multiple endgame bosses suffer, not because of their difficulty, but because of their mechanics. i've been playing souls games for about 11 years, and intense difficulty spikeslearning new strategies doesn't bother me at all, it's part of the experience  but some of the lategame bosses have designs that make them really frustrating to play through, beyond the normal amount of frustration to be expected, i suppose. some are frustrating to the point that they aren't enjoyable. a few of these bosses use certain maneuvers over and over again that are extremely powerful, but you can learn and work with them, but the way they're done make so many of them battles of attrition, which is exhausting to do over and over again. others have attacks that aren't dodgeable that would be in other fights, or are more easily completed with certain builds  and good souls boss fights just don't operate this way. with every other fight before the end game, and in other souls games as well, the difficulty, repetition, struggle, and frustration all feel fair and part of the experience, but these bosses just aren't pleasant, for me. this is just my opinion though. elden ring's nothing short of incredible and everyone should play it. i'd give it a 910  ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,good game that you spend hours playing and lose track of time. feel like a kid again playing this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"start 2 completely different builds, play them at the same time. twice the fun"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"very hard game for beginners but if your that kind of player than it is perfect, stunning visuals and funimersive game play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"game is a 1010 visually and gameplay wise, everything ingame is absolute cinema except fire giant. honestly the worst fight i've ever played. the camera lock in was terrible, i can't see any of the attacks coming, and i hate the terrain on the boss fight. it took me 2 hours to beat both margit and the fire giant, but fighting margit felt more rewarding as i was getting used to the game and it was fun getting closer and closer to killing him. the fire giant however didn't feel rewarding at all, i literally just felt happy that i'm never fighting this boss again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"1010 this throws me back to games like oblivion or skyrim, you know back when bethesda made good games? anyhow it's massive and you will be deterred initially by the douchebag giant on the god horse righ in the very beginning, ignore him, move on and explore... the lands between"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"why are you reading some random guys opinion about this game? its been glazed enough, playing it felt like getting butt fucked by a nazi with a greatsword for a dick. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,great amazing so far im doing a strength and faith build with dod slayer seal and jellyfish shield with godslayers great sword w game 1010 would bang my head at margit again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,game is peak. if you get this game expect a challenge and for the love of god do not quit due to morgott the fell omen. it gets better after
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"absolute art. not only the way this game was designed, but also the way you can end up playing it. the only possible downside that i could find were the npc's and the questlines. i wished they did something like in the witcher 3 with the cinematics and the dialogues but this is just a caprice of mine. 1010!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"very fun, yet to fully beat it, but very funs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"amazing game  smashing graphics  fun to play  very open world, you can go anywhere you like it's hard though, i had never played a souls game before so it took a while before i got the hang of it. but watching a bunch of youtube about it before you start to avoid pitfalls. it's a nice game to get totally obsessed by."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"a masterpiece worth experiencing again i already completed elden ring on playstation, but i decided to give it another shot on pcand i still had just as much fun. this game is a triumph in openworld design, blending fromsoftwares signature challenge with a vast, beautifully crafted world. the lands between feel truly alive, filled with secrets, breathtaking landscapes, and hidden dangers at every turn. exploration is endlessly rewarding, with every corner offering new challenges, lore, and powerful rewards. the combat remains as satisfying as ever, offering deep customization through weapons, spells, and abilities. whether you prefer aggressive melee combat, strategic magic, or a mix of both, elden ring gives you the freedom to play your way. the boss fights are unforgettable, each one demanding skill, patience, and strategy to overcome. with its rich lore, stunning visuals, and nearly endless replayability, elden ring is a mustplayeven for those whove already completed it once. an absolute masterpiece that sets a new standard for openworld rpgs!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"great open world but the veritable depths of hell are directly next to the starting area, and this isn't new either, this has been in every fromsoft game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,this game has challenging harsh skill curve to it that i like and a very big world to die in over and over. if you don't learn some sorts of fighting skills you will die over and over. the reality is once you are built up enough you are on your way killing almost anything in your path and then you meet that new boss that seems almost impossible. a real challenge. and a beautiful world on every front. progression is slow and a serious challenge.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,its so good. one of the best game i've ever played. its an expand version of dark souls series and its rpg. very recomended everybody that like souls game to play this game. and its a bit easier than previous games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"goated game, but you will die, a lot, first playthrough final boss took me 80 attempts, took me 100 hrs to 100 the game and well, i think my playtime speaks for itself about replayability"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,boring after first game but fun for challenges if you got the motivation
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"game is ok, the final boss of the dlc is not a fun fight tho, you have been warned."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"wonderful , remarkable looking game. it is a great game without a doubt,, easily goat when it came out. this is a souls game, if you don't know what that means please turn away now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,best souls game ever it really grasps the easy and hard all in one. the open world is stunning the big yellow tree is the most beautiful thing ive ever seen in a game ever. 100 a 5 star game love to see more.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,game good. game nice. i play full game for what feels like half the price. cause it's just that damn good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,base game is real easy and fun but the dlc is where you find out this truly is a souls game except fo the runbacks
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,its hard at first but dont worry youll get better i promise. its a fun game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"amazing game, would definitely recommend the seamless coop mod if trying to play with friends."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"i love all the souls games but elden ring has a special place in my heart. once you get passed the crying and anger stage, the game truly opens up"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,the game that gives you a heartattack every 5 seconds lol! give me more!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,played 160 hours on console and now i'm back at it again to terrorize the lands between. once more into the breach.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"very good game. differs a lot from previous souls games in good and bad ways, tons of content. while not my personal favorite souls game due to bias and wishing it was more legacy dungeons, it deserves every bit of love it gets."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,one of the best fantasy games i've ever played up there with skyrim for best game of all time imo
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,great game. 400 hours. only issue is 60 fps lock. sht gives me headaches. this pandering to consoles sht needs to stop.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"finished this game with already knowlegde of how it the gameplay was because i watched a playthrough but fomo got the best of me. so now that i have played it for myself what do i think of it. this game makes u feel like the main character of your own story all while the other main characters are ending their own. it truly feels like a world where so much has happened and now you are a part of it. the start of the game is hard when u have no knowledge of where to go exactly on the map. everyone has nightmares of the boss u encounter in the overworld. the tree sentinel and while u can run away. i am sure that there will be most of u who will do your very best to beat him no matter how hard it may be just like i did and that rush of adrenaline when u beat him will a high u chase this entire game. i have beaten all the main bosses. because i did not want to miss out on anything because if u just follow the path the game gives u. u will miss out on so much of the story of the world. i did not even see everything and i would not even know where to go. the fighting itself and the different weapons are so goddamn cool, spells and much more make it so that this game is so replayable. i might replay it just for the fun of it. you can become as overpowered as u want to be. did i feel despair fighting the hardest boss while refusing to get the op weapons. yes. did it feel really good when i beat her my own way. yes. and i will never forget that feeling"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"this game is open world dark souls with a goat horse to ride, if that appeals to you then play it. this game has countless weapons and builds to play with and try and this is a game that any rpg fan should play"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"just beat the game, dont listen to the reviews complaining about difficulty or whatever. if you stick with this game through all of the intense challenges that are thrown at you, and push through to the end, it will give you the most rewarding feeling you can probably ever get from gaming. so give it a shot, and learn how to be a little patient."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"amazing world, in the beginning, you get killed easily. after a few hours playing this game, you still get killed easily."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,start the game and get your ass handed to you. you died for a brief moment making you believe that's the name of the game. 1510  would hands down recommend the game. its an experience and a lesson than its a game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"easily the most immersive and engaging gaming world i've sunk myself into to date. the sheer size of the game world not including the massive additions of the dlc coupled with the massive variety of weapons, bosses, and dungeons is nearly unmatched by any game to this point. truly a world you can lose yourself in for days on end."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,great game. can be hard to learn the mechanics. when you get it down its rewarding to beat hard adversaries.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"the perfect gateway to soulsborne games. first experience with this genre of games and i loved it, planning to play the others."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"there's a reason people went crazy for this game. the very beginning can be a bit tough, and i bounced off the first time i tried, but i'm glad i came back to it. i'm not sure that any game comes close in terms of wealth of exploration. it's a huge world to explore and the variety of environments is incredible. there are certainly frustrating areasenemiesbosses, but because the game is so huge and there's such freedom to go wherever you want, you can pretty much always just head in a different direction, and then come back later to whichever part was giving you trouble."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"amazing game, great story, game play and graphics are superb"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"i love this game. there is so much to do, and it's just so much fun. if you are looking to get into souls games or just haven't played this one yet, totally worth it. i actually have this on ps5 and i liked it so much i got it on pc as well. it is a shame you can't port over accounts from different systems via an account or something like that as i would like to port over my 300 hour account, but it isn't too big of an issue. over all, it may be too hard for some people, but this is a perfect starting game for the souls franchise."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,the most accessible souls game. very enjoyable to play through and through. my only issues with this game is the sheer amount of copy and paste catacombscavestunnel bosses as well as the massive amount of roll catches each boss has.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"i first started playing elden ring due to the amount of youtube videos i've seen about it and the recommendations i got from friends. elden ring offers something for everyone, and while being initially hard at first, the games mechanics get easy to figure out as you progress the story. the game offers an open worlds expanse so you always have something to explore andor find, and the amount of weapons and armor you can get are fantastic. i can't recommend elden ring enough, my only advice, level up before you fight margit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,if you have good patience and determination then this game is amazing. although some item collecting and quests take a bit the boss fights make up for it all with the cool move sets. you can repeat the game and get items that are only once obtained your first play through to make crazy broken or fun builds. the story line is also great with the dots connecting after most quests big or small. along with plot twists or cool cut scenes before a fight usually for main story bosses.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,just goated in all aspects for a game. only downside you would see are players who struggle at the difficulty for bosses but skill issue doesn't mean it's bad.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"the best game that fromsoftware has ever created. you are doing yourself a great disservice if you do not play it at least once in your life. you get your first playthrough only once, so take your time and explore everything and please read! you will miss out on so much lore if you do not stop to read the short paragraphs that items have. admire the gorgeous scenery and vast lands that you will stumble upon, the diverse characters will lore and connecting story lines and the mommies, of course. anyways, it's a great game and perfect to start if you have never played a single soulslike in your life. the game can truly be made as easy or hard as you would like it to be. just know, that i am jealous of you for getting the first time experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"absolute cinema o7 my first souls game and it's absolutely fantastic  the landscapes, views, bosses everything  goddamn. definitely recommend but beware of a lot of rage inducing moments while trying to not get killed d arriseee n0ww ye tarnishedd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"hard but really fun, i highly recommend this game 5 stars. if you think about getting it is worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,its a great game with a good difficulty the only issue is sometimes the bosses make you wanna throw a brick at your computer
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,its a real man's game its quite hard at sometime's but it is worth alot. also runs great on the steam deck
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"you die, you get run over, you lose all your runes. repeat. you do this until you feel like you're no good at video games. you keep playing because there's an itch you cant scratch. you beat a few bosses and get through. friends play with you, maybe drop you a weapon, play some more, kill some bosses, die some more. and some how... you beat your first run. you sit the game down for a while. the itch comes back. you need to beat the one boss. you try beating her for days and weeks and it finally clicks, you beat the second phase. am i actually getting gud? you enjoy the dlc, and you finally say i'm going to 100 this thing. you lock in, and suddenly, you run two back to back campaigns to get two alternate endings in under 12 hours. i fell in love. i died. i got gud. elden ring is a once in a lifetime game and the first one in a long time i have yet to uninstall or stop playing since getting the 100. truly a game in its own class"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"a good game, it looks beautiful and the fights are hard but no story."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,very good just im prolly gonna lose my mind beating the main bosses since it took me like 2 hours to beat the first main boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a 120 hour experience, i also would suggest not using any guides although if you want to, that's fine as well as i've found the fun comes from the trial and error nature of the souls genre in general. i found this game to be very enjoyable and the amount of time and effort put into this game is palpable. probably should've mentioned this earlier, but by trial and error i mean every with every deathdefeat you learn something, dodging that bosses attack slightly late or jumping over that attack rather than dodging. with that being said, following leveling guides and get op early videos might not help you as much as you think it would, since you still have to know how to fight the boss, at least to a certain extent. i think that's what a lot of people who leave these negative reviews don't really get. have a nice day."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"if you love games that are super duper relaxing, then this game is for you. if youre not a serious gamer, dont worry this game doesnt involve that much skill. the thing that elden ring does best though, is not making you want to break your  controller, pc, and monitor 50 times per hour. it definitely doesnt do that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"unequivocally one of the greatest games i have ever played. i sincerely wish i could reexperience elden ring for the first time all over again, especially when this was my first true gateway into the soulslike genre that fromsoft created. from the sheer diversity of how you can create your character, the ridiculous amount of weapons, spells, and incantations you can find and add to your arsenal, to the raw, unapologetic challenge that this game offers, and to the vast, beautiful landscapes that the lands between offers..... elden ring is more than just a game, it is truly a piece of art, that deserves every single bit of praise it gets. regardless if you are shy to the soulslike genre, this game deserves the attempt to be played by everyone. you will find yourself tenacious, and headstrong, trying to beat every enemy and boss this game offers from its challenge of difficulty, and the end result will always be pride in overcoming difficulty. i cannot recommend elden ring enough. sincerely give it a try. you will not be disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"a fantastic open world rpg adventure game. the difficulty scaling is not obvious, however. you may have seen online complaints about the first story boss, margit the fell omen, or even videos about the mounted knight near the beginning of the game. these two encounters are different ways the game tells you how difficult things will be. if you go into an area and have trouble facing a boss, the ideal tactic is to leave and train elsewhere. now, while the world is open, there are more difficult regions than others. the difficulty is both a test of your progress and a warning to mind your step. combat is smooth, and you shouldn't have much trouble against an enemy or two. however, you can often find yourself surrounded by several enemies and they don't necessarily wait for their chance to fight like in a superhero game. so you'll have to be careful with your stamina and try to make your healing items last between checkpoints. no strategy is perfect, however, you may find yourself against a challenge that you see no way out of. if that happens, you must find a way to retreat. i can offer a piece of advice to avoid being trapped, make sure to follow the light of grace and secure enough checkpoints. once you secure a few checkpoints, you will be treated to a cutscene and obtain your trusty steed from the promotional videos. after that, you're pretty much good to go. the game is a grind, you will fail, but you learn from your failures most of the time and success will be all the better for it. if you are curious about the dlc, don't buy it right away, it's more challenging than the main game. beat the game first, and if you find yourself hungry for more, then by all means, take the plunge. i may have made the game sound like quite the challenge, but it's all about one step at a time, or is it that the greatest journeys start with a single step? either way, if you want to try a game with a challenge and enough content to keep you in the game even half as long as my playtime, then elden ring is a wonderful choice. good luck, tarnished."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,best game ever i beat the game 5 times total and even got all achievements on xbox and its still fun.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"honestly solid game i cant say i'm great at it, but i have enjoyed it to its fullest potential and even though its a challenge i kinda enjoy that aspect of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,if you arent familiar with souls games or if its youre first onelike myself it is indeed hella hard but youll pick it up eventually and its fun grinding i got 16 houyrs rn lets see how many more i get
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,wasnt really into souls before but this game is something else. so atmospheric and rich in content. a visual masterpiece and a unique world
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"greatest actionadventure game ever made. the scale of this game is unbelievable and the character build options are completely wide open. few games can match the exploration and aweinspiring environments of elden ring. this game boasts incredible and addicting combat that will have you coming back for more and more. maybe the most replayable game i own. 1010, possibly the best game of all time."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"this is probably the best open world game it is really fun and all so, yeah i really recomended it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"the most user friendly gameplay for new player, i still recommend to play darks souls series , bloodborne or others"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,elden ring is really good. it's a massive game with a huge variety of mob and boss types. well worth the money and time investment.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"i'm having quite a bit of fun with it after i started playing at the same time as a friend, its really demotivating to play by yourself in a genre of games youve never played before. this game is probably not good for a first dark souls game, it explains very little and a lot of mechanics can completely pass you by and you'll never know. i also wish i had at least some sort of questlogtracking feature for tasks given by npc's  im 30 hours in and i have no idea where im supposed to be going rn. im trying to avoid google as much as possible but a few times its been unavoidable. i will say though the game is clearly made for an xbox and nothing else. the control scheme is auto set to xbox controls even though all i have is a keyboard, and the keys mapping i had to completely redo myself to make it usable. it took quite a bit of trial and error since i was learning the mechanics and realizing i needed keys that were automapped to keys i assigned to actions. there is also occasionally moments where the game freezes for several seconds, but that may just be a computer issue. the coop is miserable. it barely works, and unless you like invading other's worlds for some reason i dont really see the invasion mechanic as a positive point for the game. i want to play with my friend and fight bosses with them but people keep invading in the middle of those fights and killing us both, which is just frustrating, since neither of us are interested in pvp. the coop system in this game is the most convoluted system ive ever encountered as well, the multiple password system that barely works, the summoning pools which dont really do anything if you want to coop with a specific person the pools do jack, you still have to be in the same spot since im not interested in cooping with randoms the multiplayer system thats been implemented here is lackluster at best. not to mention the terrible load times and random connection errors, we're in the same house so the disconnects make no sense despite my complaints though the game is very fun and im experiencing the learning curve of getting gud i just reached a point where im finally starting to do good dmg and its very satisfying. the bosses arent too difficult to telegraph the movements of and even with my previous low dmg output i could fight most bosses if i was patient and agile enough"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,beautiful environment and a beautiful story telling and voice lines.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"without a doubt the best game i've played in the last 510 years. i was never a huge fan of soulslike games. i have 120 hours on ps5 and about the same on pc and i can only say to any gamer if you are even thinking about dipping your toes into this game, take the plunge. it will truly be worth every penny and minute spent."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,the sensation of finally beating a boss that you died to so many times is the best. just have some persistence and all will be well.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,elden ring is a phenomenal game. it's challenging but never gets boring and constantly draws me back. i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys soulslike games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"have 400 hours on ps, beat the game in every possible run, this game is so peak"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,love the premise and the individual gameplay. husband and i wanted something to play as coop. didn't realize that it wasn't truly joint. as in i am a guest in his world and if he dies it kicks me off his world and we have to start the whole summoning process again...unless i am missing something.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"my first souls game and i have 408 hours in, so clearly something clicked. all the detailed art and mesmerizing worldbuilding of other soulsgames, but the open world setting is a bit more forgiving."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"elden ring is the best game i have played hands down. everything about this game is good. the bosses, world design, sound design, and everything else in between. i didn't know about fromsoft or dark souls games until i heard about elden ring. now, i absolutely love both the series and the genre. like everyone else, i struggled hard when i began playing this game. i even quit for a while, but that is what is best about this game. while this game is a challenge, the reward you feel for finally beating that one boss, or finally getting that ending that you wanted more than makes up for it. i could recommend this game to literally anybody because it is that good. this game is a masterpiece and i can't wait to see what fromsoft creates next."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"amazing game my, my all time favorite game this game has so much content s is so fun and engaging"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"fun game, only issue is that godrick soldier is too op. needs nerfing. i only beat him yesterday."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"meh, its fun enough. just beat this margit guy, hoping it gets better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"it's alright, but it's no elden bling. no wonder they put a stop to that, it would've made elden ring look like child's play. since you can't play elden bling because those animals removed it, go ahead and play this instead. it should be able to capture a similar feeling, albeit minuscule in comparison."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,i loved the old souls games. this is a little more forgiving than those but seems to be a much bigger world and story to play through. challenging and entertaining.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"elden ring takes almost all of the problems with previous souls games, and corrects the problems masterfully. this is definitely the best game i've ever played by far, a game that ive beat 4 times in the past 6 months, and i'm still discovering new things. my only complaints are that parts of the storyline are almost impossible to discovercomplete without looking up guides. also the repetitive bosses, like the tree sentinel, tree spirit, crucible knight, pumpkin head, dragons, and a few more."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,difficult game but well worth the money its not one of them games you pay alot of money for and beat in 4 hours
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,good game 1010 got kicked by some snake with a funny voice
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"its a great frickin game. im no souls player ive tried ds3 but quit at abyss watchers but this game is lit. its a very challenging game, sure, but it feels fair and you understand why you die etc. the open world is great and npcs have interesting stories. overall a great and challenging game. if you put every rpg you play on the easiest difficulty possible and like more of a casual experience then this may not be for you. if you like a bit of a challenge however, elden ring is as good as it gets. dog, o, dog"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"elden ring is one of the best and most fun games i ever played, i absolutely loved the major bosses, the weapons are all unique and fun to use, the art syle is amazing and the world is literally perfect"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"i love elden ring perfect game, perfect world, lore and story. a must play, really believe anyone can do it if they play however fits them. i love miyazaki and his works, thank you for your blessings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"favorite game of all time, hands down. easy anti cheat needs to go,. i'm fine with anti cheat measures but this is just stupid."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"damn would've been much better if it was a roguelike with supers and a battle royale storm and it was called elden ring nightreign or something, michael zaki really missed with this one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"this game is absolutely astonishing. here are some of the best things about elden ring. first the game is so beautiful i see other reviews of people saying the graphics are trash, and stuff like that but if you have bad graphics in this game it is your pc not the game. second, the bosses are some of the most challenging and fun bosses in this game. third, this game has so much variety for builds. one of the best weapons in the game is iron balls. i'm not kidding. i would highly recommend getting this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"one of my favorite visions of from software. why not take dark soulsbloodbourne and make it open world? a fantastic souls open world game, full of challenge until you figure it out, with a massive open world to explore and build a character that you want. fun to play alone, or with the multiplayer coop mod."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,amazing game and sometimes frustrating but if you put in the time and effort a run can be really cool with lots of builds to choose from and also lots of ways to play the game.and as a last resort use summons for a boss your struggling with and explore before margit since lots of people just run straight to him and die immediatly since they didn't explore and level up or they just did't git gud at the game so they just died.also fire giant can be cheesed with loretta spirit summon look it up on google
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"this game is nearly perfect. this game earned my love. i want to kiss, love, marry, start a family, and grow old with miyazaki. i had this game on playstation through game share and put 150 hours and got platinum on there. then, i decided i wanted sote and to actually own the game so i got it on steam. i started playing right after the worst time of my life and i genuinely think this game saved me. i don't even know what to say about the game itself, it continually leaves me speechless. i had never played a souls game before, i haven't played one since. i am awful at the game i use all the cheese and bs available and it still never fails to give me a sense of accomplishment. i think i could write a doctoral thesis on this game but i won't here. thank you elden ring, thank you miyazaki, thank you dark souls. don't you dare go hollow. p.s. try finger, but hole"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"great game. only complaint is too many reused boss fights, but almost everything else is spectacular. also relatively easy and good starting point to get into soulsborne games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"otra obra maestra de fromsoftware, aunque me ha costado adaptarme a su ritmo de juego frente a sus predecesores detesto los mundos abiertos, sin duda la escencia de quienes amamos los souls sigue estando en este juego. un mundo inmeso por explorar, infinidad de items que descubrir, sorpresas y retos que aunque seas un veterano de este tipo de juegos, significara un nuevo reto. totalmente recomendado."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"a masterpiece of exploration, combat, and despair. highly recommend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"storytelling masterpiece and graphical wonder. 1010, would recommend to fans of dark fantasy, challenging gameplay, and difficult decisions. i highly suggest going in blind and limiting online help or guides. that being said, your decisions can eliminate entire endings andor questlines. truly an incredible and complex story that sets a nigh insurmountable challenge for games within the genre"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"great game would recommend, can be hard and challenging for some but not for this god gamer, shit was to ez ngl. dlc was fire 2"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,this is a great game in my opinion i had it on my console with more than 500 hours of game play half of that in one character i even beat all the bosses in the game but i do admit i'm not a great player i'm a very casual player but i did still manage to beat the bosses with the help of the mimic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"played it on series x, and on pc. phenomenal game, 1010 easily in every aspect. literally bought the whole game twice lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"this game is peak. i've played an unhealthy amount of of this across platforms and its one of the best games ever made. masterclass, 1010. needs more feet!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"this game is so amazing. the world is beautiful and full of details you wouldn't find in other games. and the bosses are so amazing. a challenging game, but worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"amazing game,love every bit of it, sure there are some times in the game where it can be extremely difficult and you feel like you cant beat it, but unlike the other souls games, her you can just say this is too hard i'll come back to it later and just level up a bit, and it's an open world game with technically nothing stopping you from just skipping bosses and going straight to the next one, and there is no requirements to get to the next area like some games, someone even beat the game at level 1, and someone beat it without being hit, so if you enjoy open world, rogue, souls like games then this is perfect for you! and i highly recommend it for people new to the souls genre, as it is the easiest of the souls like games and there's nothing stopping you from leaving a boss area getting better stuff and coming back, unlike other souls games."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"never played a souls game before, for everyone who is new to the series...its super hard. but i guess thats why its worth grinding a lot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"the ultimate culmination of from software's challenging gameplay and gorgeous art direction, mixed with a deep lore that demands an investigative nature from the player."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"i uber advise others to play this game, way better than dork souls 2 matheus pacheco know nothing of good games..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,the game is fun it has a lot of challenge thank you for adding the arabic language
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"if, and only if, you enjoy getting so into a world, that it frustrates you to the point of contemplating castration  this game is for you. i have donated 250 hours to this game and i love every minute of it. the combat sweeps you off of your feet, the dialogue with every character you run into is very engaging and overall the plot never dulls for a moment. p.s. what the fuck is with the age of stars ending."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,really love and enjoying this game and didnt ever get bored it. the feelings of exploring and new area that misses last playthrough and finding something new just feel so good! been having alot of fun pain and suffering definitely worth to try out this game and play it on your own paced. soulsborne game suffering is something very common
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"it's elden ring bro. if you haven't played souls games, this is probably the best one to get into in terms of variety and the worst one to get into in terms of it already being the best and damaging the integrity of the rest of the series. the difficulty is optional. you can make busted builds and play with broken mechanics and have as much fun as you want. you can also choose not to level up faith as your main stat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"game is fun, my friend said the game was relaxing, heeeeeee i think i know, why she said thet, cuz now i'm fill sooooooooooo relaxing when play this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,elden ring is a celebration of fromsoft's prior genre defining titles and an entry point into the soulsborne games for new players. it's a mashup of the styles we love while bringing it's own unique twist and intense combat to an incredible fantasy setting. congratulations fromsoftware and thank you for a decade of joy and pain
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"i've only played it for like 15 hours and it been going great. well worth the full 60. please play on controller it is so much better,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"solamente lo he jugado 10 horas, es mi primer souls, llevo jugando videojuegos desde que tengo 4, desde mi primer computadora con 256mb de ram y 20 gb en disco duro por alla del 2002, es un juego maravilloso, buenos graficos y me gustan los rpg, me ha hecho volver a enamorarme de lo que mas me gusta, jugar algo con picante, dificil y emocionante, lo recomiendo bastante"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,it's worth 60 dollars. bloodborne but it's on pc elden ring is similar 66 hours on record. it's like a very modded skyrim. bloodborne on pc when
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"great game. played through with seemless coop mod with two other friends. can't recommend it enough. especially fun with other people. thoroughly enjoyed exploring, acquiring new weapons and armor, fighting the bosses and learning their weaknesses. the world is beautiful, learning the moves and how to dodge and fight is rewarding. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"i've played every souls game, this one tends to not tell you where you're going or what your objectives are so if you tend to get lost expect to run into enemies that 1 shot you a lot. i enjoy the dlc weapons and wish they'd been included in the game from the beginning. game engine is an upgrade from ds3 but i like bloodborne a little better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,i love this game ive made and completed over 14 characters and am currently working on my newest one this is the most welcoming souls game in the series if your wondering which one to start with i seriously recommend this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"one of the best game ever. also, a great game for those who want to try a soul game. definitely recommend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"not my thing. hard to play this after witcher 3. the elden ring is basically, go kill whatever you want, just because. witcher 3  you help distressed, protect innocent, bring justice, show empathy, gain friends, get women, protect step daughter, avenge. elden rings go kill whatever just because... no reason to do anything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"the game is so big, like my love for the game. coming from someone with 1k hours on playstation. multiplayer stuff is super goated and has some flaws but mostly really well made and fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"elden ring is a game which is goodtogreat until the halfway point where the game reveals that it has no more cards up its sleeve and will give into it's most unsavory design decisions and unwillingness to fix problems which has persisted in fromsoft games since at least dark souls 1. the latter half of the game has mind numbingly boring or much too easy bosses with some exceptions. many of the latter bosses feel a bit familiar with bosses from the first half and among the less fun ones they have consistent design patterns. the lack of a consistent animation language all throughout the game is additionally a point of frustration which makes the game less satisfying. spirit ashes are a potentially really fun and cool mechanic. it was not well implemented in my opinion. do not let people fool you, elden ring is not particularly hard. it is at worst a bit tedious. if you explore enough you can easily make yourself more than well equipped enough to handle any boss. the open world is the game's strongest point. it lets the player take the game at their own pace, along with an open world design that is a notch above most games with them. if the game was shorter and smaller i'd be able to look past some of the flaws but the basegame alone already feels too large and overstays it's welcome. additionally the stuttering on pc is greatly annoying, as it comes out of nowhere and can at times just freeze the game for up to two seconds. as it currently stands the base game of elden ring does not offer a greater package than many of it's contemporaries and adding more content to it in the form of a dlc is not something that i could see changing this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"terrible controls. terrible camera angle. in order not to be refunded, very hard made. fuk the mother of the one who made this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"i've slain countless gods before, but the ones that dwell in these lands kicked my immortal arse beyond recognition. to exacerbate, i have also been quarantined once for importing a level 150 save my own character is at 500 and i was beginning to believe that it is to blame for my dire coop matchups. regardless, while this game may not be for everyone, it is indeed a masterwork for those masochistic lot who crave tough love from their game devspublishers. the combat stills has its fair share of jank but satisfying when you attain an acceptable degree of expertise. the world of course is as immersive as the tales go, with iconic characters that will brand you with memes that outnumber the very stars. if you are into waifus, there is also a plethora of them scattered about the map, waiting to rizz you with their uniformly poetic parlance. the storyor rather storiesare yours to unfold because miyazaki is too preoccupied with his next miasmic swamp offering."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"me and my friend were messing around trying to get invaded, we got this guy who was being passive, so i punched him with bare fists and me and him brawled to the death using nothing but fists. 1010, i love this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,i can't tell if the witcher 3 or this game has more unforgiving fall damage mechanics.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"i have elden ring on my xbox, and i have put in at least 600 hours into it. i am not joking when i say this game kept me alive during my darkest depressive episodes. in my opinion it is the best game ever made, fromsoftware always puts in maximum effort with their games, with the level of detail, quality of music, and voice actors, and game play. their expansions are bigger than most aaa games these days that cost 70. the game is challenging, but not impossible it gives you way more support with bosses than the other souls games, and use every item you can to beat the game, don't let people gate keep and say if you use certain items it's not really playing the game, and have no shame using guides online."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,souls games have always been difficult for me to play but elden ring is a amazing game.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,this game is a masterpiece! so so so difficult but such a great game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"one of the best soulsborne or soulslike games to date. you want a long game, massive open world and unforgiving difficulty with the sense of satisfaction upon victory? get this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"no ultrawide. no thanks. nothing immerses you more than giant black bars added on the sides of your screen. great work developers. 10 thumbs down, refund incoming."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"while exploring i kept dying, and founding enemies which killed me in two hits. figured out i'll try to follow the path game laid out to me, couldn't beat margit for 3 hours. those games are not for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"extremely well designed game, terrible to play, not rewarding and felt extremely clunky. 510"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"well i enjoyed it, i like the atmosphere, aestetics and characters. i think the game is great i will play the base game again definitly, but i am not willing to get into another dlc collecting game if you are willing to spend your money like this then go for it i dont judge. you do you. but its definitly nothing for me. it was not good enough for this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"don't know why people love souls games. it's masochistic. i did 3 hours of game time but only actually 'played' maaaybe 2030 minutes. the rest of the time was spent running through the same area killing the same respawned monsters to retrieve my runes where i died over and over and over and over and over. weeee. everything kills you in one hit, while you have to bash the daylights out of them. it might be different with a controller but on mouse and keyboard sometimes you'll just wiff right through the bad guy doing no damage. you'll still be in a swing animation but since your weapon passed through them without hitting, there's no stun so they do some lightning speed combo on you before 12 your animation is through. swing animationno hit registersdeath animation. welcome to souls gameplay. or you'll hit the key to roll, it doesn't register and you're caught flat footed staring at the obvious attack you would have dodged had the input registered. then there's the boss who has some ludicrous hp pool you have to chip away at for 10 to 20 minutes while you're dead in one hit. until you get the game mechanics and quirks down to the level of a spinal reflex you'll spend more time dying than playing, which is the point of a souls game. i find the artificial difficulty built into these types of games tedious. oh, and you can't map the programmable buttons on your mouse. lame. hope i get my requested refund."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"games great!!! loved playing for the short 19 hours before i stopped. upgraded my setup, got an ultra wide monitor. and come to find out it doesn't support those monitors because the player base doesn't impact the game enough. honestly no other complaints get the game and enjoy it. it's fun, hard and easy way to kill time when no one is online. beautiful game. hope they add the support soon and i won't mind changing the thumbs down to a thumbs up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"first half of this game is fantastic. worth every praise its been given but, the last half is dog shit. once you get the fire giant the game changes for the worse. boss design absolutely tanks to just not being fun anymore. the price is worth the first half alone. however with every play through the final 5 bosses you have to fight make me want to uninstall the game not play again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"the game boasts amazing graphics, stunning landscapes, and impressive monster designs. the weapons, abilities, and spells are also wellcrafted and exciting. however, the lack of difficulty scaling especially in combat speed is a major drawback. if you have slower reaction times, limited working memory, or are on the spectrum, the absence of adjustable difficulty settings makes much of the game inaccessible. while it's enjoyable to watch others play, actually playing it myself was more frustrating than fun. unfortunately, i can't recommend it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"just preposterously hard. no sense at all in a game being this difficult. will not play another game of theirs, making it impossible to progress is only fun for sadists."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"bro what's up with the constant 30 second freezes? they started out infrequent, now it takes a whole minute to exit the settings and boss fights are actually impossible. otherwise, the game runs at 120 fps smooth at 1440 just fine."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,did not enjoy. mostly a slashdodge game. extremely difficult. found the constant deaths to be frustrating.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"after nearly 300 hours, i can't recommend this. everything up until morgott is perfect, and then the game falls flat. all endgame enemies have insane health and damage, the areas are terrible and the bosses, oooohhh the bosses. every boss can basically 3 shot you with 60 vigor, and every boss has a 5 hit combo now. this isn't sekiro, all i can do is roll. slow everything down, take back the combos, which while being visually stunning, are not fun to be on the receiving end of. tldr buy on massive sale, or quit after leyndell"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"after many hours playing it, a hacker invaded me on pvp, and made me fall on a loop, where i got items like malenia remembrance, closed the game and open it to stop the falling loop, now i cant even get items from bosses, just killed bayle without igon because no finger, i lost the iconic baayyyyyyyleeeeeeeee, also its remembrance and heart, not even the drops of the dragon princess, for real? went up that mountain not specifically to fight the devil, mother of fingers? no remembrance, no drop, not even night katana... after that my game play just got bugged and no solution."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"the art of this game is truly amazing, but there is too much aoe bullshit. i love souls games difficulties, but the amount of aoe attacks that can instantly one shot you is ridiculous which does not make for fun boss fights. also, the amount of time to punish a boss for its 20 attack combo is too short. please tell me how this game is very good in the comments, i am genuinely interested and would like to see what ya'll think of the game and why it's good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"one of the worst keybind loadout ever in history of game making, not only it does not make sense, it feels it was left to a child suffering of dyslexia to decide what all key press do. tutorial oblivious to basic functionality, written functions are mostly w's mind boggling a lol at the game industry achievements, not getting anywhere and not on par either, let alone better. buy this game if you have friends and you really don't mind whipping yourself to torture into unnatural habits and ready to redo over and over until the dyslexia sinks in"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"i purchased this game after many reviews about how great the story was written by george rr martin and it was one the best games to play. my son and i both played different saves and at 100 hours and beating everything in the capital we both are done with the game. this has to be the worst storyline game as there really isn't one. you have to rely on youtube or other sources to try to understand the scant info you are given that really tell you nothing. the thing that capped off my frustration with the lack of substance was that i wanted to feel purpose so instead of just exploring until you find something new, i followed just one npc storyline. i liked sellen, so i followed a ign walkthrough of sellen's quest. you meet her early in the game, she is a magic merchant and doesn't give you much guidance. luckily the walkthough tells you what you need. soooooooo, i had to go halfway to the other side of the world, find a guy huddled up in a off the way nook, he doesn't talk, is half crystal so is easy to miss. when you try to talk to him he just slowly raises his hand and gives you a spell. somehow this is the trigger for sellen again all the way in the early area to do something other than sell you stuff. she then, at least, gives you some guidance of where you are to look for the next master lusat. buttttttttt, the place you have to look is a normal looking part of a mountain just like the next 20 miles of mountain boundary this happens be behind something, but nothing else tells you you anything and if you hit it, it disappears. deep inside the dungeon you will find the guy you are looking for also huddled up and just raises his hand to give you something, no speaking, doesn't do...anything..else. when you give sellen this and then do her next quest you meet her at the academy. things are progressing goodish, but when you return after meeting her at the academy the first time she is no longer there, just a ball of magihelms that you've seen a few time before that now mumbles with her voice like she is having trouble speaking, but still will sell you the same things. what?!!? so, what happened, what do you do now, should you have done things differently? you'll never know, you have to to to youtubereddit for theories. this is great story telling? saddly this was one of the more full conversation quests i found. my son and i have been trying to find what makes this game so highly rated. but the negatives outweigh the postives and i'm not getting much enjoyment out the the timesuck this game is. positives beautiful landscapes, varied, fun to explore surfacedungeonsunderworld. varied weaponsarmortrinkets. varied npcsbeastsbosses. negatives lack of direction for nonsouls players the first grace you go to that is supposed to guide you to your next objective points you to the tree sentinel that you try 1000x to beat but keep getting crushed, when you look it up  oh, no, that guy is for latter in the game, matter of fact don't follow the grace until you level up a bunch. what? you think there should be a npc to tell you that or something instead of a npc that tell you to follow the grace? then you grind forever to get stronger while no real direction what each stat is for and how they work with different weaponsarmortrinkets unless you again go to youtubereddit to findout. grind some more...rinse and repeat. the game is very frustrating apparently that is what makes this game so good is how punishing it is? but even when i was stronger than most things i faced and would wipe them out with one death poker use, i wasn't having fun because i didn't feel i knew where i was to go next half the time, or why i even care. i started this game because it was a highly rated story driven game knowing it would be punishing but i found the lack of story didn't give me purpose enough to keep playing. my son felt the same and actually quit it before me after going through the capital as well. there are sooooooo many other games that are more ejoyable with better storytelling."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,this is a great game but i have never encountered so many cheaters in any game. this has the worst incel cheaters i have ever seen. i'm ok with being invaded when i need to coop a friend but they need to do better with the cheaters.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"not fun! poor pc controls. obtuse game mechanics. without torrent and on foot, your dead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,its an amazing game but do not get it on pc theres some sort of bug that ive seen a bunch of players ask to be patched me included that makes lag spikes like i have more than enough specs to run the game at high settings and it still lags with graphics at low and all optimization settings that i can find turned on and for some reason its damn near only at boss fights and other fights again its an amazing game and i cant get it on anything else so im gonna beat the game like this but its horrible it freezes mostly when the boss swings at you and the only way to get the game to be unfrozen is to stop touching any buttons at all or else it just completly freezes and that means that bosses are almost impossible to kill the worst its been was at the draconic tree sentinel at that boss it just freezes so much hes basically unbeatable its insane but its still really good and if you can overlook it i guess you should get it but if your gonna get it id say get it on console or have the best pc in the world lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"the story feels empty and generic medieval fantasy, the design of some bosses is peak hitboxes not that good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,the process working towards freeing the undead population from being outcasts and segregated only for that blue bitch steal your ending when you missclick a message and usher her silly ideology over stopping racism towards the undead that and the boss design doesn't hold up to ds3's in the late game and the pvp is just kinda meh
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"i've owned this game since release, but didn't feel like leaving a negative review at the time. but even after giving it several chances to win me over, it failed to meet expectations. at launch, the game was extremely buggy, and had the worst optimization i've ever seen. the game was literally unplayable for the first week or so due to how poorly it performed. i'm talking 523 fps on minimum settings and 24 second long hitches every 715 seconds. the game also, unfortunately, has this orange smear filter over everything if you try to play below native resolution. the bugs were numerous random crashes, getting frozen in midair until the game auto killed you, spirit springs not functioning at all, torrent movement in every possible way, multiplayer connection issues, etc, etc. unfortunately, it didn't really improve much. it's 3 years later and the game barely runs. the hitches are still present, and you're lucky to maintain a choppy 45 fps. it still doesn't really matter which settings you use, as the game will run the same whether in 4k or 720p. they did fix most of the torrent related bugs, but the horse can still randomly hyper accelerate in a different direction than you are moving the joystick. the combat is the worst i've seen in any fromsoft title. coming directly after sekiro, this was the ultimate disappointment. it's slow, clunky, and predictable. all the bosses act so similar there's virtually nothing to really separate them. some of them are literally copypasted around the map. the difficulty was insanely watered down to the point where nearly every boss was defeated in the first or second attempt. the dlc was promising for exactly one fight... then it quickly went back to the slog that the base game had. this is the only game i've played where upon finishing the game... i felt disappointed. there was no feeling of triumph or satisfaction in any way... i merely pondered why i'd bothered walking around for so long hoping it'd get better. edit perhaps i was too harsh on this game. i decided to give it a 6th chance, and decided to stop treating the game like something it was not. elden ring is an exploration game. at its core, elden ring is a walking simulator. the enemies are not really meant to be a challenge, but a small inconvenience as you wander around. most of them will drop in a hit or two, with some taking a little bit extra. but you only need to bother with them if they are blocking you from picking up your thousandth arteria leaf or mushroom. you won't do anything with the things you collect, as there is no need, all that matters is you've found it. you press on, watching the scenery change around you, with billboards and trees reminiscent of a ps1 port. the textures pop in and out, the lighting spazzes, but every so often things will look absolutely beautiful. you stop for a moment to take a screenshot as 3 enemies blow themselves up behind you. you could almost feel it that time. but alas, nothing can actually harm you on your peaceful walk in this wretched place."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,its a good game but currently it is too buggy to play. so many bugs that i cannot progress through the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"i must be in a vast minority since i played this for about 2 months and then deleted it, on a pc the gameplay was not user friendly, the fact that you could fight and be strong enough to beat a foe but fall to your death for a dozen different reasons just left me so frustrated i gave up. the graphics and story were good but i play to enjoy myself not to engage in self flagellation so i hope you enjoy it but i feel like i wasted my money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"very over hyped. it's super clunky and doesn't feel good to play  for myself. i don't think mismatching animation timings for enemies to artificially add difficulty that is no fault of the player is good design. previous from soft titles had more consistency in animation theme and style and also had more states amd transitional animations for most things , where in this it's all mismatched and poorly executed in comparison to previous titles. aside from that, while it's one of the easier from soft games, it's also one of the more boring ones. the graphics are as boring and dull as the story. even while maxed out, looks fine but not good or excellent, like it could. i don't think the open world stuff really works in this game due to alot of content being heavily recycled over and over and over again. previous from soft titles were just superior overall. couldn't find any excitement or fun after 30 something hours with plenty to do, but not much desire to go do those things. of course, glazers that enjoy stroking from soft with their wallets, will continue to glaze and overhype this game, but it's just boring. probably the only from soft game i'll never finish. i think from soft is on a creative decline."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"unless you eat, sleep and breath video games, do not get this game. i dont get the hype. nothing fun about this game at all."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"this is a good game. however, now that i've played it i can tell that the hype behind it is mostly because of the looks. yes the boss fights are good, if you are willing to put up with constant loss. personally, now that i got it sitting on my library, i wouldn't pay more than 20 for it. maybe check out another crab's treasure instead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,dark souls but again but open world. if you like any of the previous games like this then just get this game already. if you're new to this style of game then this one is built to be a perfect starting point for you. easily my goty the year it released.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"good game, has a lot of feet"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"it is a grate game that is played like when your motherthe boss used to beate uthe player, but now u can learn how she attacks and doge and then beat her."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,unplayable. freezes for 56 seconds every 15 seconds.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"the devs from read berserk and were inspired to make a series of souls games from correctly assumes gamers are stupid masochists elden ring is a visual feast. an aesthetic statement. user inputs are basic and produce basic output combat feels solid but lacking in depth. the burden of complexity falls on the bosses, whose mechanics are a thousand times more exciting than anything a player can produce. i am a veteran of mmorpg pvp which is a dance of a million flourishes. the amount of keybinds that requires isn't viable on controllers. there's undeniably skill involved in elden ring. i would say the game demands a high level of skill. however there is very little room for creativity. most of gameplay is avoiding damage, from there are few paths to retaliation. it is sad to me considering how fantastical the setting is that the magic  sorcerer  astrologer class is the least complicated. when in kmmorpg i used a good 38 a full sized keyboard keyboard and then 3 mouse buttons for all my binds. each bind had a cooldown i kept track of. i just thought of a metaphor...that has implications... typing. elden ring damage dealing is like typing with morse code. tera's kmmorpg array of abilities is like typing with a fullsized keyboard. although i don't really use the shift key bc i am ego suffering... somewhere in the future there will be a combat system similar to a courtroom stenographer with combinatory inputs...like chords on a piano. bdo black desert online implements something like this but the binds are trash and not very customizable. tera's default binds were unuseable and because i was a pvper i kept my bindings private instead of creating a tutorial...partially because personal preference is a key factor and memorization is also important...if you've been playing the game to lvl cap with your binds keep em. my first character was a confessor. dogwater class. terrible choice for a beginner. mostly because the confessor incantations are horribly implemented by the developers. i would've been happy with a slow hot heh i used shift, heal over time that is roughly equivalent to a pot balanced by the fact that although casting is near instant it would take 15 seconds to regen the hp meaning the next love tap from the boss could prove fatal. instead i get a healing skill that casts slow and is less powerful than a pot. bc they balanced game around making survival difficult instead of yk, common sense or what would make for pleasant gameplay. i rerolled to sorc and despite being bored out of my skull i actually have physical braindmg rn so idk if i could perfom 110th of my prime  peak sorc ... everything was so much easier. i did some reading on the wiki bc i had already compromised my immersion  discovered i could kill a peaceful npc who was already doomed for a better staff. the world in this game is truly special and i felt guilty until thop killed me 20 times muttering 'why on earth' as 'you died' displayed across my screen hello this realm isn't earth. maybe dialogue establishes a canonical link to we dimension this game takes place in i forgor braindmg  planet earth. anyways i ended up thop by dealing dmg to him then hiding behind a pillar. initially i was almost raging bc the camera stops locking onto targets if u hide for too long...but this ended up leading to the discovery that if u hide long enuff the npc gets adhd  short term memory loss  i the player can surprise attack them again. the reason i recommend this game is bc i am in my antisocial arch i see the way the game treats the player and find it amusing that 12 million ppl bought into it. myself included. i probably wont ever finish it unless one day i become a well renowned streamer who needs to be humbled  publicly humiliated. this is probably the best setting of any videogame ever...the more i think about it...it could certainly have more depth  scale to the systems tho. its art style is very naturalistic but im nitpicking how easy it is to see behind the cutrain  facade. i love fighting the berserkesque  lovecraftian monsters. i also just caught some angel egg vibes. apparently george rr martin was involved in writing the backstory...with the main story already written...that makes sense because that ol writer of got definitely couldnt have written the influences  vibes im pickin up on."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"don't think twice, buy it. i very much disliked soulsborne games before elden ring, i loved elden though. buy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"when she elden on my ring till i erdtree in all seriousness though, this game is amazing and well worth it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"played over 250 hours on my ps5 back at release, getting the platinumbeating it like 6 times and this is probably one of the best games i have ever played. just returned playing on my pc after a 2 year break and i restarted. has me feeling the same way when i had first played. if you have not played, you are missing out on a gem."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,not too easy. story is packed and interesting. recommend this game

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"oh yes... tarnished, are we? come to the lands between for the elden ring, hmm? of course you have. no shame in it. unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"best 40 offer ever. i am big fan of rpg games,but this game is so hard and i love it. smart ai mobs,and boss figths are incredibl. first day with 9h of playing,and i die like 50 times."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"very good game, a bit hard to understand at the beginnig but gets funner and funner through out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,i spend 4 hours on the first boss. it is very challenging and that's why it is so fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"this was my first souls experience, and it was probably the best thing i could've played in this dumb era of slop. highly recommend for all gamers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"a masterpiece! ive been waiting for 2 years to buy this game with significant discount, and now here it is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,there is no other game where it is impossible but fun at the same time everything about this game makes me feel happy even though i died a million times to weak enemies would recommend to people who just like having a good time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"game play peak soundtrack peak story peak optimization terrible if you can put up with inconsistent and semifrequent stuttering, get it, if not, just buy it for console."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"i usually like to be quite detailed in my reviews but there simply isn't much to say about this game. it is phenomenal. one of the best rpgs ever created. the gameplay is amazingly balanced, not too easy, not too hard and everything can be beaten by a patient gamer. tons of weapon variety from far fetched fantasy weapons to historical weapons that are shockingly well recreated. near infinite possibilities with builds and playstyles. huge and beautiful map. great lore if you did into it a bit. i know i'm late to review it, but this game is genuinely a masterpiece and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who somehow hasn't played it yet."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"i highly recommend watching some guide videos to help you choose a class and understand how to play it. i'm currently on my third playthrough, and i finally managed to beat margit! its a unique game since theres no traditional quest log or much handholding, but the more you play, the better it gets. i'm only 27 hours in so far, but ill update again once i have more time in the game. if it werent for youtube guides, i probably wouldnt have stuck with it as much as i have. vigor is your best friend!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,best game ever but doesn't work on my steam deck for some reason isn't launched on steam deck . apparently run or play good on steam deck  but not in mine . trying to get help from steam but not answer or help . long
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"max poise or dodge nude, those are the only ways to play this game. fucking great. dodge end game bosses wearing a fucking sombrero launching pink lazer beams from a katana made of kittens."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"love it, since the beginning, and have played every souls to completetion, ps4 ps3. the only thing i don't understand, and i'm sure many other's also don't understand, is why no uw 3440x1440 support? i read this was because it was an unfair advantage, but 4k which this has support for has both a taller and even wider view than ultrawide, 3840  2160 so that is seems odd, unless the 4k fov is locked to the same fov as 1080p and nonultrawide 1440p? not trying to neg the game at all if that is the reason, and i'm not going to only play offline to use uw but still it is the only flaw i can see in the game. i did check again and i see no field of view settings. strange when i start the game it does start in 3440x1440 uw but then switches after a minute to 2560x1440, as if the ability to run at ultrawide is already baked in just gets disabled when detected. they fixed most early issues with time. do miss rob and hoarfrost stomp for sure"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"my first souls game, hated it at first but ended up loving the soulslike games because of er. 1010 cinematic game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"play this game at all costs, add it to your bucket list even. just play it ffs thanks to my friendo was able to play this, eternally grateful to them. absolute gas!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"game was hacked by an invader, permanently ruining my save file. there is no fix. neither steam nor bandai has taken action against the person who hacked me their steam profile is still up and publicly takes credit for hacking elden ring players or made any patches that could help address this issue like automatically create backup save files. on the plus side, i've basically given up on videogames and have gotten a lot of reading in."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,picked up this game to see if its fun. it is just its not my type of game but i will still leave a postivie review of it. its a fun game and rewards for beating every boss and enima you kill. open world is very nice and lots of detail. story is good as well.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"ah yes, elden ring. one of my most beloved fictional works. well, not really fictional. unlike most aaa games, elden ring is completely realistic both in the fantasy world and the world of physics. you see, elden ring makes use of a commonly overlooked physics law. the wiens displacement law, which allows tarnished to displace every demigod using his soulslike wien. elden ring is perfect, and i highly recommend it to any student or individual seeking to expand their knowledge of the sciences of this world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,really amazing but kinda feels like panda tumble simulator at times
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,second best souls game but bloodborne isnt on steam so its the best souls game on steam

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,after 480 hours i finally beat the game. i don't know what else to say besides it's a masterpiece. just don't let others influence how you play it.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,fight boss get bonked grind for levels and learn move set of boss boss pulls new move out of his ass and bonks me again 1010 would recommend to a friend
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,super great game. i am late to the party and have never played a souls like quite like this. it can be hard but it's rewarding to succeed if only to say fuck you! to the bosses and enemies. the world is beautiful and really enjoyable to explore. i love that you can get like everything most npcs are wearing. the armor and weapons look so cool in this game. it has quite a bit of depth too if you look into the mechanics and the story isn't crazy but it's enjoyable. the world has lore but you need to go out of your way for some of it but if you just listen to npcs you will get a lot. torrent is the real og. he has saved my ass so much. i'm super casual now a days and i have been doing glintstone sorcery and even then i have had some bosses i have had to try over and over. learn the timings etc to beat. if you want an expansive world to explore and find new things in this is the game for you. did i mention the armor looks super cool? the scale of the world is well done. the huge environments and structures feel really large. anyways good game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,it is a pretty challenging game in my opinion. i have beaten it a lot of times on my xbox account maybe like 50
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"didnt know what the hype was about, but now i know. my first session was 6hrs straight and i cant stop playing since. im on new game plus 5 and beat the dlc twice as well. amazing, need more dlcs. alot of places to explore, a massive variety of armor and weapons. great storyline with multiple endings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"if your a fan of the souls genre just buy it you'll love it. for everyone else, it's truly unfortunate how high the barrier of entry for this game is. this is one of very few games to do the open world genre justice, it's gorgeous and everything in the world feels intentionally placed with very little empty space. the really impressive part of this game for me is the sense of scale it conveys. the map will consistently surprise you with how large it is, and walking up to the base of a structure after seeing it miles in the distance for hours is incredibly satisfying and feels like magic. the distant views this game manages to pull off are staggering and they continue to impress me every time i see them. people generally will love or hate souls games and this definitely isn't any different. elden ring has almost all the pressure points of the previous entries, its hard, the leveling and equipment system is unforgiving to new players, the story is inaccessible without research, and some questlines are vague and easy to mistakenly lock yourself out of. in short if you want a good experience your first playthrough, you'll be playing with the wiki open and a leveling guide. there is no correct build choice, every build will have different points in the game they'll struggle with and other points they'll breeze through. just find something that looks fun and if you change your mind and want to try something else, fairly early on in the game you unlock the ability to completely respec your character. the one thing elden ring fixed that i must praise is the near complete removal of the boss runback, in every prior souls game after dying to a boss you respawn at the nearest bonfire, leading to a 12 minute run past enemies to get back to the boss. this has always been the most infuriating part of these games in my opinion, i like difficult boss fights but let me grind attempts back to back, don't waste my time and break my concentration for the sake of being punishing. the new respawn system allows the player to spawn at an effigy that's right outside the boss door. there are only a few bosses in the game i can think of that don't use the new respawn system and their respective run backs only take 1520 seconds. combat is great, it manages to feel a bit more snappy and satisfying than other games in the series and is very rewarding to learn and improve at, in terms of the bosses themselves everyone's experience will differ depending on the build you use but generally i found the majority are well designed and fun, with only a couple exceptions. it is worth mentioning the performance issues the game had on launch, for the majority of people the updates the game has gotten seems to have fixed them but for others myself included it took hours of tinkering to fix stuttering problems. everyone's solution to this games mysterious stuttering seems to be different, all i can recommend is to go down the list of dozens of potential fixes, and hope for the best. i really didn't like this game at launch, but after giving it a fair chance and beating it for the first time i understand the hype, if you have any interest in trying it i would highly recommend doing so, it is immensely satisfying to work your way through and delivers some of the best world exploration out there."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"well, what can i say?  i've been playing this game for a loooooong time. i won't say it doesn't have its downsides, but it definitely has more upsides. i've done everything i wanted to and could, and ifwhen i ever return to this game, i'll be happy to dive back into it. a heartfelt thank you to everyone who worked on this game. a special thanks to the community, which has become an integral part of the game. i hope players will continue to help each other, especially newcomers. give newbies a break in invasions, please, and dont be kevins!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,loved calculating the stats to optimize getting slapped in the balls by a giant skeleton bird and dragons...good for masochists

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"bro, this game is a work of art bro. its so much better than any shtty mobile games. ive sunk like 500 hrs onto this game, and the one i bought on steam is only my alt. my main account, on the ps5, has over 1100 hrs on it me and my dad combined. no complains, love ranni, love melina, hat love malenia."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"this is my first ever soulslike game i've played and first fromsoft game i've played so bear with me. that being said, this game is a master piece, the world itself is gorgeous, the combat is fluid and so much fun, the game allows for so much replaying the story with all the weapons and builds you can choose from. i just recently came back to playing again after getting stuck on radahn my first time playing back in 2022 and dedicating the time to just getting better at souls games. this game is tough, i won't sugar coat that, but watching playthroughs or even asking people for advice or going on the wiki to see some build ideas is super helpful. the games story having so many different options and choices is super engaging and you can easily lose track of time while playing. this game is easily one of my alltime favorite games and it's gonna be pretty hard to beat. the feeling you get when you finally beat a boss after many tries and lots of preparation is truly indescribable. this game is a roller coaster of emotions but in the end it always ends with joy. this game is easily a 1010 for me and highly recommended to anyone looking for a challenging yet fun and engaging game to play next."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"alright, lets be realelden ring is a masterpiece. fromsoftware took everything great about souls games and threw it into an open world that somehow doesnt feel empty or repetitive. every time you think youve seen it all, boomtheres a hidden dungeon, a secret boss, or some weird npc with cryptic dialogue that makes you question your life choices. the world feels massive, but not in that bloated ubisoft checklist wayexploring actually feels rewarding. combat is as satisfying as ever, with a crazy amount of build variety. want to be a dualwielding crazy? go for it. a spellflinging mage? absolutely. a guy who throws pots at enemies? weird, but possible. the bosses are equal parts amazing and soulcrushing, with some of the best and most rageinducing fights in any souls game. but, lets talk about the hitboxes, because man they can be straightup jank. theres nothing worse than dodging what should be a clean miss, only to get smacked by some phantom hit that sends you back to the grace screen. and lets be honestif you trashed dark souls 2 for its hitbox issues but praise elden ring, you might want to check your bias. still, despite the occasional wtf just hit me? moment, elden ring is one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,never played a souls type of game my friend introduced me to this and ive none stopped playing ive put in over 230 hours from in 2 months
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"i would like to say, after several hours and commitment, i finally beat my first fromsoft game here on elden ring! in the vast amount of recommendations for this game, i know mine might not stand out, but i just want to say, this is one of the greatest games i have played in modern times. if you have never played a soulslike and are wondering to yourself which game you should get into, this is the one. several elements of this game are not only enticing but the world is enriched in beauty and horrific sights galore. i honestly never thought i would find myself a game that i truly cherished such as this, now that i am done with the game, i can finally dive deep into the long awaited lore videos and additional content without feeling bad about not finishing this game. this is the first game to pull me in like this since games like the legend of zelda or other great games that have a huge amount of lore to explore. to those who take up the challenge, i hope you have the best time, because this game is worth every minute!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"elden ring is truly a breathtaking experience that completely captivated me from the moment i started playing. the challenging gameplay combined with a vast open world felt both thrilling and intimidating in the best possible way. exploring the lands between was genuinely magical. i found myself constantly amazed by the stunning visuals, beautifully designed landscapes, and atmospheric settings that added depth to every step i took. the graphical detail and art style are exceptional, making each area feel distinct and memorable. the enemies are terrifying yet masterfully designed, contributing greatly to the immersive atmosphere. the combat system is incredibly rewarding, blending precision, strategy, and timing perfectly. every victory, no matter how small, felt meaningful and hardearned. the boss battles were especially remarkable, providing intense challenges that pushed me to my limits but always left me eager to improve and continue exploring. above all, elden ring's extraordinary atmosphere and impressive graphics make the experience unforgettable. the immersive combination of visuals, sound design, and gameplay created a captivating journey i'll cherish and revisit for many years to come."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"honestly, it's a masterpiece. the replayability is incredible. even 1020 playthroughs later, i am still finding new items, routes and builds. and even though the coop system is tedious, playing with friends the elevates the experience to a greater level. if you are considering getting this game, i would vouch for it time and time again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"really beautiful world design, the weapon designs and arts are very cool to mess around with. the fighting becomes a bit dull after you try most weapon classes, but you can always mod"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"awesome game, but i wish they had an option to lower the difficulty setting! the world is huge and there is so much to explore. it really gives you that send of wonder! game play is super fun, but can be hard af and can get repetitive in a literal sense if you die a lot! this is the nature of souls like games, which i both love and hate!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"ryzen 5800x3d, 3080ti and 32gb of ram and the game freezes for 3 seconds every 20 minutes playing the dlc. it's a shame because i love every souls released by from software but i cannot forgive this, is almost unplayable tbh."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"if i stuck my dick into malenia's vagina, do you think my cock would rot off?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"a masterpiece amont a sea of medioce games. great looking game even though its 60 fps, insane story and awsome bosses. must buy imho."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,it was an amazing game to play and the detail to every little thing was amazing. this was my first souls game and i had me hooked would recommend
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"best rpg i have played to date. love the challenge, open world  options to do whatever you want."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,23 hours so far and i was tell anyone to play it. magic isn't that slow to cast. 34 bosses down including the magma lizard. i love the skills for the swords so far. going to have 300 hours soon
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"boy oh boy where do i even begin. miyzaki... honey, my pookie bear. i have loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you. the way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. the silky smooth camera movements, and the gorgeous views in your games. i would do anything for you. i wish it were possible to freeze time so i would never have to watch you retire. you had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. you are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes i even call you dad. i forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. you have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. i remember when you weren't nominated for 2016 goty and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. but a tear still fell from my right eye when i watched you win game of the year in 2019, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. i just wanted you to return home. then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and i rejoiced. after 2019, you went quite and those were hard years for us, but in 2022 you made history happen. you came back with elden ring and i couldn't believe it. i was crying, bawling even. not only have you changed the gaming industry and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. and now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. i love you pookie bear, my glorious king, hidetaka miyazaki."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"played for over 500 hours on my old sony account. should tell you all you need to know. it's perfect, aside from the 60 fps cap and optimisation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"from the very first moment i stepped into the world of elden ring, i knew it was something special. as a longtime fan of fromsoftware's games, i was prepared for a challenging experience, but what i wasnt prepared for was the sheer scale, beauty, and sense of discovery that elden ring delivers in spades. my first playthrough was a journey full of frustration, triumph, and moments that cemented it as one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. the games open world is nothing short of breathtaking. the lands between feels alive, with sprawling landscapes, deep forests, treacherous mountains, and mysterious ruins at every turn. the world doesnt just exist to be explored it feels like a living, breathing entity. theres always something hidden in plain sight, something that makes you stop and look around, ensuring that every corner offers new opportunities for discovery. the freedom to approach objectives in my own way made each moment feel personal and unique. however, elden ring isnt just about beauty and exploration. as expected from fromsoftware, the difficulty is a central element that challenges you at every turn. there were times when i felt utterly overwhelmed by powerful enemies, seemingly impossible bosses, and the unforgiving nature of the game. the frustration was real  dying over and over to a boss that seemed unbeatable or getting lost for hours on end. but thats where the magic happens. the games difficulty isnt unfair its a carefully designed challenge that pushes you to grow. every defeat taught me something new, every challenge required me to adapt and rethink my strategy. and when i finally overcame that seemingly impossible boss, the sense of accomplishment was like no other. thats what makes elden ring one of the best games ive ever played the balance between frustration and triumph. its a game that demands patience and skill but rewards you in the most satisfying way possible. each victory feels earned, and each hardfought battle is worth the effort. the combat in elden ring is brutal yet satisfying, offering a blend of precision, strategy, and power. whether wielding a massive sword or casting powerful sorceries, theres a weight to every action. the animations are smooth, and the timing required to master each weapon or spell feels rewarding. the ability to experiment with different builds means that the game constantly feels fresh, even after hours of play. the story, told through cryptic npc dialogue, environmental storytelling, and the rich lore, weaves together a narrative thats as mysterious as it is compelling. its the type of story that doesnt hold your hand but encourages you to piece it together for yourself. the deeper you dig into the world, the more intriguing it becomes. yes, elden ring can be frustrating at times. the difficulty spikes, the occasional sense of being lost, and the tension of facing bosses that seem unfair  all of these moments can make you question why youre still playing. but then you remember the feeling of finally overcoming those hurdles. you remember the sheer joy of exploration, the excitement of discovering new areas, and the thrill of taking down bosses that once felt insurmountable. in the end, my first playthrough of elden ring wasnt just about beating the game  it was about the journey, the moments of doubt and triumph, and the memories made along the way. despite the frustration, it was one of the most rewarding and unforgettable gaming experiences ive ever had. elden ring is, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,awesome game! done a ton of playthroughs and am still finding new things every time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,i like when i get butt fucked complain about how bad the game is for hours but keep coming back bc i hate myslef 1010 game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"played for just about 700 hours on xbox. done with console so, now i'm here. yes, the game is that addictive that i will start completely over on a new platform and be happy about it. i'm not entirely sure why but it gives me big kingdoms of amalur vibes but, if it was a more mature sequal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,1010  epic scenery and a massive upgrade to the soulsborne series
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,i was originally having a bug with the click function  seems to have been patched. great game. 1010.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"games too easy, really needs a hard mode 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"this game will humble you, it will make you wanna cry and break your monitor but its so rewarding at times you forget how bad you just got beaten. 1010 will play again and again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"game has big bonk, therefore game good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"holy shmoly, i've sunk way too much time into this title. 19 playthroughs in on steam and xbox combined and i'm still coming back for more. what more can i ask for as this provides it all? given good personal temper, i admit. if you like learning, then this is a good nonacademic game for you that's why i love it so."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,absolutely perfect game 1010 after doing all achievements
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,beautiful game! my entry to soulslike. i've played other souls games and bloodborne and this is still one of my faves from the genre beside bloodborne.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"this game kicks ass while kicking your ass. i'm not a fan of soulsborn games but im creeping up to 300 hours which is a lot for me invested and that's for many reasons. artwork, graphics and game design are all beautiful. the combat is surprisingly fun once you get the hang of it or as all noobs do get over the panic rolling. this will be in my top 5 favorites for a long time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"why are you looking at reviews just buy the game, its so good its like a full time job"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"great game, super open, and wide variety. would recomend 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,cinematic and very nice graphic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,i had my doubts becase i don't think i was good with soulslike games as i had never played before but my gosh this game is a masterpiece. it is not actually that difficult if you level up enough and choose the right stuff etc. easily one of my all time favourites now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"this game is 100 hands down the best game i have ever played, and would hiiiiiiiiiighly highly highly recommend it to anybody."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,become elden lord or become maidenless your choice best game ever
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"very fun, but ummm maybe make the game a little freaking harder, alright!!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,love from software and this is game is a testament to the type of games this company can produce.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,great game just like dark souls series
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"you'r first playthrough will change you forever, like for real play it play it play it dont think about buying it just do it worth your time become the true elden lord 1010 also dont forget the dlc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"amazing and full of action and adventures ,plus has a lot of battles and weapon and stuff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"do you recommend this game? no, i just spent about 100 hours because i disliked  you get maidens, which is good enough for me to play"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"elden ring is the culmination of the soulslike genre from software has been pioneering since king's field. it is a masterpiece of gaming. here are some short thoughts the world is incredibly detailed. every corner of the map has something to explore or fight. this, surprisingly, allows for quick bursts of gaming. i often hopped on to play for an hour or two before having to take care of something else. ashes are an incredible edition. ashes are npcs you can summon to fight with you during battles. while i rarely used them except for some of the terrible duo fights, ashes allow players to scale the game's famous difficulty to their level. elden ring has an actual story and mythology, unlike other souls games. it feels less like your exploring a dead world and more like your exploring a mythological realm. thanks grrm! there are actual characters in elden ring. characters like marika, radagon, miquella, ranni, and godwyn become fascinating figures that have complex relationships with the world around them. unfortunately, most npcs start out with interesting arcs only for most of those arcs to sputter out. the dlc, however, fixes this. the celtic and norse aesthetics help elden ring's dark fantasy stand out from its peers. images of marika and the erdtree imbue the game with a stronger sense of mythological grandiosity than any other dark souls. elden ring is surprisingly generous with graces the game's checkpoint system. souls games are known for their difficulty at this point, but elden ring gives out checkpoints frequently. this helps to stop the most frustrating part of a souls game when you're bashing your head against a difficult boss. the checkpoints allow players to leave a boss they're struggling with to explore something else, before hopefully coming back stronger or with a better weapon. along with ashes, this makes elden ring a souls game where you have a surprising amount of control over the difficulty. bosses are also often improvements on previous souls bosses, with welcome new editions. the final few bosses are especially fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,i would recommend fighting the first person you see after getting out of the tutorial. the dude on the golden horse.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,fun and at times frustrating. excellent with seamless coop mod.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,its hard but if you try you will make it!  i have only defeated margit and tree sentinel lol but i still get better with every death. so the ultimate weapon in the game is to never give up
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,difficult but rewarding and well worth getting good at this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"beautiful landscapes, good music, marikas tits, absolute cinema"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,best game of all time. but! your gonna die! and you learn.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"i'm surprised i haven't reviewed this yet. not much to say that hasn't already been said, it's fromsoft's first foray into an openworld soulslike and they knocked it out of the park. out of all the soulslikes i'd say it's the most beginner friendly but at the same time has some of the hardest bosses in their entire catalogue. highly recommend this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,mental torture for 7 hours and then you get 5 seconds of pure bliss just to realize there is a second phase.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,malenia healing on hit was unnecessary but this is still my favourite game of all time 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,if you're happy and you know it throw your controller against the wall. what an experience! several moments of frustration only to be followed by the thrill of victory. the typical souls experience imo.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,this game is amazing but it is very hard is not for those who will give when they can kill margitbleedeasy mode
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"como un jugador veterano de souls, no puedo recomendar lo suficiente este juego. elimina las partes tediosas de titulos pasados manteniendo el desafio y la diversion. mi unica queja es no haberlo jugado antes"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,engaging game for those wanting to get into games of a higher challenge rating
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"1010, very beautiful you died screen, whch is what you'll be seeing most of the time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,i love this game yet hate it. how i beat most of the bosses is through determination and listening to my friend. never give up!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"to me, this is a fantasy exploration game where nearly every nook or cranny rewards you with something... sometimes that is a useless piece of string that only served to bait you into a trap. other times, you'll see an isolated tower at the very edge of the map, climb to the top, think you've gotten a treasure but instead be teleported miles away where you can fight or evade a boss to get one of the best talismans in the game. most points of interest have three or more interesting locations visible from them, so exploring feels invigorating because you are always drawn to see what is over the next hill. and the wide variety of biomes you travel through is astounding... massive bioluminescent caverns, misty beaches, plains full of flowers that attract lightning storms, dim catacombs with danger around every corner, crumbling castles, ancient ruins trapped in the eye of a timeless storm, massive poisonous swamps, abandoned villages filled with former occupants driven mad from a plague, frigid tundra filled with giants, a volcano filled with snakes for good measure, sewer systems that bend your mind trying to navigate... and every single one has mood music that heightens tension, lulls you into complacency, or sometimes just complements a beautiful vista. the difficulty of the game can be a turnoff to casual gamers like myself however, this game has a number of features that are available to make things easier. most notably, if you feel too shy to summon jolly cooperators other players you can instead summon npc mobs to help fight your battles with you. if you take the time to gather wild ingredients, you can craft explosive pots and other consumables to give you an edge or exploit a difficult enemy's weakness. of the souls games i've played, this is by far the most approachable. while i most often seek to trivialize all the encounters i can, i still fight the bosses that don't have all these features available because the allure of fully exploring each zone is indomitable. other great features, in no particular order you can jump your horse can doublejump. if you feel you messed up your build, respecs are fairly abundant once you unlock them. there are npc invasions for people who just don't like interacting with others but want to play the pvp mode. for less direct interaction, you can leave messages and read the ones others have left. if people like your messages, be that for their timely warnings or humor, you receive a small amount of healing. this is rarely useful, but it's nice to get that positive feedback for taking the time to try to help others."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,100    10010
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,naa was hella fun not gonna lly 5 stars i guess just hated the gravity macnizm
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,things ive learned from this game. 1. i am a tarnished 2. die 3. spend 1 hour trying to kill a boss to get an item you wont be able to use for a while
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"honestly, i suck at souls games, but i love the atmosphere and all the lore, so i keep playing. 1110"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"should be called elden feet because miyazaki is the tarantino of games. which means the man knows his shit. it's between this and bloodborne for the best 'souls' game made thus far. this plus armored core 6, fromsoft is in the zone. now if they can just stay in the pocket and keep making bangers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"slss titusener bosser for endelig  n the elden ring, men ble jvla skuffa da det ikke var en cock ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,my friends told me you most play this game with us at level 1 only omg i can't move i not recomened this game. dislike
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,this game is hard you will die a lot but it's still a lot of fun and i highly recommend it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"i know it is a great game and all, but i will tell you what i found tedious in this game. first of all open world this big, is not my cup of tea. i would have said that i did not mind it since you can also easily follow the main path and finish the game, but you have to buff, a lot. some might say if it is not your cup of tea just dont play it no need to dislike it but i felt the need to say this. the open world offers so much content, even more than the main path and to me, it just makes the game tedious because then, you have to find all those good weapons and loots in the most hidden areas. there is just a bunch of crap in the main path and i dont get this design at all. they should have definitely put another option for players that dont like exploring, yet love the challenge, to just follow the main path withouht having to buff for hours, as bosses only test your skills the whole gameplay. to me maybe not to you that is the peak game design a game could have. but i guess i am also kind of at fault for not doing proper research before buying this game. i knew it was open world but just was not expecting a map this big with all good sht in the most unexpected and well hidden places, with no instructions leading to them at all. unless you look it up on yt or google to find them, you will most likely be lost for hoursjust like i was and just get mad at yourself for getting ur ass handed back to you on every single enemy i am not bad at games guys i finished sekiro but some enemies get too overleved at random points it feels tedious to beat them. so yeah, thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"this is a masterpiece of a game and i really recommend for someone to play this if you're into self loathing and pure rage... def follow the quest lines, they will also mentally mess you up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"pinnacle of souls games predecessor of dark souls and bloodborne and one of the greats of gaming, while difficult this game is also rewarding, it punishes rushing and greedy players who don't take their time but also in the same rewards those who do, exploring every nook and cranny is helpful and always beneficial and the build variety is endless, the armour is unique and generally aestethically pleasing and the bosses are plenty with over 200 counting mini bosses overall it's a 1010910 and my undecisiveness is because as a verteran to this genre it was easier to exploit boss hitboxes and moves to make generally challenging bosses a joke, not so much a game flaw unless experienced enough to hug bosses properly but still a flaw, otherwise gameplay is flawless, map is gorguess, and the story while vague at times is intriguing and deep if you look into it more!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"souls rpg, the game offers a lot of options to beat it. open world exploration, cliff deaths ahead, sadness ahead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"started the game. saw a tree. the tree killed me. walked in a different direction. a guy on a horse killed me. tried sneaking. a random bush exploded and killed me. finally won a fight. another enemy 100 yards away felt my arrogance and sniped me with a magic laser from hell. played for 6 hours, accomplished nothing, found a dog that was actually a turtle. best game ever."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"so, elden ring. the game that made me question all my life choices, my patience, and whether or not i actually enjoy suffering. and you know what? i absolutely love it. the world is gorgeous, if you can stop screaming long enough to look imagine a breathtaking fantasy world filled with stunning landscapes, eerie ruins, and majestic castles. now, imagine sprinting through all of it at full speed because everything is trying to kill you. thats elden ring. every new area looks like it belongs in a painting, but also, theres probably a dragon waiting to barbeque you the second you admire the view. the combat every fight in elden ring feels like a boss battlebecause even random squirrels in this game have hands. the combat is tight, satisfying, and full of variety, but lets be real your first 10 hours are mostly spent getting bodied by tree monsters and accidentally rolling off cliffs. and then there are the actual bosses. oh boy. these arent just fights theyre traumatic life events. each one has an entire anime battle soundtrack and attack combos that seem scientifically designed to make you rage quit. but when you finally land that last hit? euphoria. pure, unfiltered joy. you feel like a god. until the next boss slaps you back to reality. the story? its there i think? look, i wont pretend i fully understand elden rings story. something about a shattered ring, demigods, and a lot of questionable parenting. most of the lore is hidden in cryptic dialogue and item descriptions, so figuring it out feels like solving a puzzle with half the pieces missing. but honestly? thats part of the fun. just assume that everyone you meet has some tragic backstory and is either dead, cursed, or about to betray you. elden ring is not just a gameits an experience. a brutal, frustrating, magnificent experience that will push you to your limits and reward you with unforgettable moments. youll rage, youll laugh, youll cry mostly from dying to the same boss 30 times, but you wont be able to stop playing. score 1010 would die again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"i like gobbling souls more than runes, but this is one of the best games i have ever played. and i play a lot of games...a lot of games."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,awesome and hard. but the best world i have ever seen in a game. beautifull sceneries as well
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"this game...is incredible. for starters, my only experience with fromsoft before elden ring was dark souls 2 and i hated it. i only ever played and 'completed' one other soulslike game since then which was codevein when it came out. i very much consider myself an outsider to the dark souls community. i'm the kind of person who is disgusted by difficulty for the pure sake of being difficult in other words, artificial difficulty. i do not get enjoyment from from excessive challenge. i do however, get enjoyment from being better. for earning my victory through superior tactics, outsmarting my foe and doing it fairly. that being said, there are times when your opponent will be slimy as all hell, absolutely cowardly...but it's an organic cowardice. the biggest flaw of this game is that while the story is massive, rich, deep and heavily thought provoking...it's almost entirely missable. the game does a fantastic job at looking absolutely jaw droppingly gorgeous and at throwing countless hostile mobs and bosses out you. 95 of entities in this game are mindlessly hostile towards you for seemingly no reasons. monsters? makes sense. animals? yeah sure. but humans too. if a human is in armor or is armed, there's a 98 chance it's hostile towards you. this conditions you to simply attack everything and ignore everything else because if you don't, something you're not paying attention to can catch you off guard and kill you. this game loooooves ambushing you. countless enemies chilling behind a corner, waiting for someone to blindside and catch a cheap kill. all this conditioning trains you to become as mindlessly hostile as everything else is in this game, which it in of itself, is an extremely meta explanation as to why everyone, people included are so mindlessly hostile towards you. it's a never ending self feeding cycle. it also punishes you severely for allowing the game to condition you this way, because if you attack an npc that isn't hostile to you, you could potentially severely damage a quest line. this game does not hold your hand. it treats you like a human being with a functioning brain. you need to read. you need to listen, you need to pay attention to the things everyone tells you. you cannot complete missions otherwise as there are no journals, no quest markers, no nothing. you must find a way to adapt your own personal real life weaknesses when it comes to your ability to retain information...or google a walkthrough. do not listen to anyone else when it comes to what you can or cannot use. everything is viable. everything. if it doesn't feel viable, there are items in the game you can get that will make it viable. until then, do whatever feels best to you. even if it's a dex bleed build. this is a game you will absolutely want to replay over and over again. after your first blind run, you will experience one of my favourite video game phenomenon, the morphogenetic resonance. when you play a videogame, everything your character learns, is transferred to you. everything they learn, you learn and everything you learn, they learn. every time you restart your game with a new character, everything you've learned from your previous playthrough is transferred to your character. your character will perform far superior to the previous character that attempted to leave their mark on the world, and every iteration that comes after will continue to perform better and better. surprisingly, this isn't something that can be easily pulled off in many games but elden ring pulls it off exceptionally well. every time you die, you're almost going back in time with everything you learned being transferred back with you and your character alike and you can apply that knowledge you gained, however small to change your fate and overcome what the you of the past failed to do. you will die a lot. but you aren't dying for nothing. you aren't dying because the game is needlessly hard. you're dying because your lack of knowledge is punishing you. but death also remedies that for every time you die, you're gaining knowledge. your first playthrough will result in you missing out on so much. and you can't possibly fathom how much you're going to miss...but these fragments of knowledge you did get will be rewarded every time you restart or every time you do a new game the game gets better and better and better every time you play it. your persistence will be rewarded. if something isn't working, there's a reason for it and a way around it. don't be afraid to look up how to get past obsticles. there are thousands of things in this game that can solve any single problem that you simply cannot know about on your first second maybe even third playthrough! if you're absolutely not a fan of dark souls, even more so than i am, then you can probably skip out on this game. but if it's on sale, you absolutely owe it to yourself to give it a try. i find myself always thinking about it, always wanting to go back to it. always wanting to solve a problem im having. you will feel lost and aimless, but anywhere you go, there's something for you to do, which is more than most games could ever claim. this game very much feels like post apocalyptic skyrim. if that sounds interesting, play this game. the combat feels so damn good and can cater to just about anyone."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,mandatory invasions are a dogshit mechanic for a game with such a toxic fanbase
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,smashed a monitor broke a mouse destroyed a keyboard slapped my mom punched the wall until i made a hole in it and shaked hands with the neighbour next door pretty good game 1010 lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"first i couldn't even launch it because of anti cheat, then i had to do a bunch of fixes just to get it to work. now anti cheat is causing stuttering while i have a 4090... cheatings a problem but this ain't an answer. i'll eventually get this to work and i'll probably have a bunch of fun playing this. hopefully its as good as dark souls, but i'll always remember i had to buy this and then work on it for a morning and play for 30 minutes before now having to go to work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"this game can be fun, but mostly suffers from a flawed enemy design, either the enemy has too many attacks for a normal enemy type, on the other hand mini bosses or bosses have unreactable attacks that ruin your chances of beating them. i should of just bought a different souls game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"good idea, mediocre execution, if it is good will depend on your luck cause there is a wrong way to play it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"profoundly boring ass over rated game. like a 6.510 weak as fuck souls entry. like 7.5 outside that context. among the top most over rated games of all time. list  empty trash open world dotted with cookie cutter repeat garbage. even the unique structures are meh with a few exceptions.  couldn't be paid to give a fuck about the lore or story even though it spells it out with 10x the clarity of the souls games.  gay big tree is not a good plot hook and the fingers motif is retarded. dollar store yggdrasil.  characters are just no where near as interestingcompelling as previous games. they all have dumb ass names.  weapons are mediocre by and large. while i appreciate what they tried to do with the ashes system it really just didn't work out well.  changes to attributes scaling and more weapons having int and faith req. is a hard l.  vibes are off hard. nothing feels as interesting and mysterious as it did in other titles. sense of grand dying world you are just a pawn in isn't there.  let me solo her is a beta soy loser and should not be uttered in the same sentence as the legend giant dad. multiple other souls legendscreators deserved recognition by fromsoft before this idiot.  malenia fight is not that hard, fake hype. bum ass character and a loser that spreads her stank everywhere.  fuck that dumb blue bitch ranni and her army of simps. fuck the dumb foot fetish cult leader rennala.  multiple bitch tier easy mode options like spirits to trivialize the game. game journalist skill level helper bullshit. list they basically took dark souls and made it for npc redditor cucks. haven't played it yet but just from clips good chance black myth wukong moggs lden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"severely overated title.i have experience with fromsoft games so i know what i was geting myself into i feel that all the hype and good reviews are from the diehard fans of fromsoftware. the only good thing this game offers is the scenery and the atmpospheric world. other than that feel free to waste your time in a game where geting gud means memorizing every single pattern of attacks the enemy does after many tries and eventually beat it. i call that laziness. furthermore i dont know why noone mentions that the combat feels clunky af and almost turnbased, no dynamic flow of combat makes it play out like a broken record. getting good in an action game 100 of the time means learn your character and your combos as good as you can to the point it feels natural to do the proper combos and eventually win. the learn the attack patterns of the enemy is always a secondary thingie which comes as you play and obviouly enhances your skills. so due to lack of combos and proper combat system you literally spam the same 2 attacks in between dodges and parries the devs decided that the only way to make the game hard is to roll around and dodgeparry the enemy attacks for an hour until you've mastered the art of memorizing every single attack the enemy does. now you are ready to go and delete that specific enemy easy af. but have you actually gotten better at the game? nope. you ve jut gotten better at that specific enemy. cudos to you ! hooray! you feel strong now? onwards to the next enemy that will destroy you in a couple of hits and make you feel like a noob again until, you ve guessed it, you memorize by heart all the patterns of attacks that they do. rinse and repeat. so if that sounds like fun to you be my guest and play that thing. sincerely i dont know what's wrong with ppl nowdays and why do they hype a garbage ass game like that. it looks good as a movie. is it actually a good game? objectively not by a long shot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"pretty good, but need more content from ranni, malenia, marika, melina, roderika, sellen, rennalla, fia, millicent, leda, romina, and especially miquella."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"dlc was poorly designed with scadutree blessing bologna. next time design the dlc properly instead of doing that lazy dark souls 2 b team bologna. do better, miyazaki. i know that you can."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"nerveracking simulator. well diverse and gigantic world with near endless exploration challenging stats have too little effect too much crap items and equipment armors do not look good, especially the top tier ones armors have next to no impact, you can bulk up with heavy armor and still get one shot by a sword etc crafting leaves much to be desired deaths by falling the world is too dark and depressing to sum it up, the role playing part of this game is horribly executed and just plain bad. otherwise, it's alright."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"so, speaking as someone who just finished 100ing sekiro as my first soulslike, i'm thinking maybe souls games just aren't my thing, sekiro was hugely fun to me and i know people say it's not a traditional souls game, but this really feels like a downgrade in a lot of ways to it and i can't help but keep drawing similarities while i play. as a kbm player while i appreciate the attempt at making it more playable with target lock sensitivity and stuff, it's worse there too imho. i just cannot find a comfortable, easy to remember layout to play this for the life of me, and i don't have nor want to play with a controller. the combat itself is pretty boring to me, a critique i have with all of the souls games, it's just dodge roll dodge roll dodge roll swing maybe once or twice, sekiro had way more interesting gameplay with all the different ways you could respond to attacks and how aggressive it encouraged you to play vs how passive the others are, i'm a big fan of parry mechanics but the attacks that you can and can't parry aren't clear at all here, i do however like the guard counter mechanic, i think that's a pretty neat way to buff more tanky playstyles, another thing i always gravitate towards. while i play it i feel lost 247, i don't know what's going on, if i'm in a level appropriate area doesn't help that it's easy to get thrown in a late game area right out the gate of the tutorial, the stats on everything are just overwhelming, and god help you if you take a break for a while, then come back and forget where you were in the story. the exploration aspect is definitely athe strong suit of the game, but it's really not enough to keep me playing for long. that said, i do believe i'm gonna probably complete this game eventually, if not just to say i didn't waste 60 dollars. tldr, if you think this game sounds cool, andor you like the gameplay of standard souls games, then go ahead and play it i'm sure you'll probably like it, but i'm definitely not the type of person this game caters to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"boss fights are absolutely atrocious copy pasting of bosses delay attacks stamina management doesnt exist in this game no attack windows built in cheeses the summon tears, btw if u use them u didnt beat elden ring and your opinion doesnt count this is easier than ds3 and sekiro by a long shot, but bosses hit you with lingering hitboxes, bullshit frameskips looking at you morgot, unnatural delay attacks, no wind ups, etc. not one fight has been hard, not one has been fun. do not buy this game if you enjoy ds1  3 and are looking for something similar fromsoft sht the bed with this one and btw idc if i get jestered, its not just my opinion there is tons of vids pointing out the flaws in the boss design on yt if ur interested."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"dark souls 4 was not worth my time absolutely unneeded stealth and crafting mechanics, unengaging, poorly connected map see teleports to seemingly unrelated locations for example with a little to no reward for exploration, mediocre bosses, strange difficulty balance due to the game being open world and many, many more smaller issues. it took me 3 years to complete the game i had to take 2 long breaks from it because of how boring it is. overall, it's a huge step back from dark souls 1 and sekiro even though it's not entirely correct to compare the two"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"this isnt a review that i wanted to make as i hold a deep respect for fromsoft and their works. they have superior artistic vision compared to just about everybody else in the industry aesthetic mastery par excellence. i would also consider some of their older works to be some of the most fun and fulfilling games ive ever played. if i were to compare this game to anything it would be skyrim. both games showed a grandiosity in vision relative to their time of release and an inability to fully realise the potential of their worlds and both games were uncritically lauded by contemporaries as the best game of all time. elden ring is by no means a bad game and it certainly does a lot right. i could ramble on and on about how beautiful the lands between are and how fascinating the lore and worldbuilding of this game is, the new innovations to the combat system, and the stellar sound design and soundtrack with a minor issue being the use of ai generated vocals in many of the tracks but that is not what i want the emphasis of this review to be about. having already completed a full playthrough of this game on my xbox series x and encountering no issues, i was shocked to see just how badly unoptimised this game is on pc. even with many patches, this is still an utterly abominable pc port and especially for such a high profile game! you would think that the developers setting out to make the hardest game ever would prioritise performance but nope! the performance of the game is especially bad during the games more notable boss fights with all of the visual clutter you are constantly being bombarded with. this is why i cant in good faith recommend anyone play this port of the game. my pc is fairly capable too and i dont consider just buy a 2000 graphics card to be a valid counterargument but instead mindless boot licking. just stating this as i have seen examples of fromsoft fanboys telling inanimate objects to git gud."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"might be an incredible experience as many people say. might have been worth the seventy bucks i plonked down for the base game and dlc. i don't and likely never will know due to the limitations on frame rate and effective resolution. it's absurd that i would need to install thirdparty software to enable something as bogstandard as high frame rates, or to disable the ridiculous black bars. i will be very leery of this company in the future."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,my fucking game wont open fuck this bitch ass game worst game ive ever seen who ever made this go back to the shien factory and quit making games
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"dog shit game. remove l2 button and we good micheal zaki. b serious review  b the pc port is horrendous. i have a ryzen 7  rtx 3060 and the game runs like shit. the game struggles to maintain 60fps even on the lowest settings. u constant stuttering if u  you use a bt headset  you connect your controller to a non usb 3.0 port  its raining in game  you play online with eac  you use weapon with more than average vfx  and more esoteric shit that will take you months of googling to find a fix b online play  pvp b the netcode is shit. the pvp in this game is more engaging and fun than pve content for a large part of the community. 90 of my playtime in this game is doing pvp and invasions. why is it so hard for fromsoft to have dedicated servers? did miyazaki spend all the dlc sales money on feet pics? seamless coop makes it slightly better but the average invasion latency is still 150  350ms. b bossfights. b how do you create the best bossfights in video game history for dark souls 3 and fuck it up so bad for the next game in line. nearly every bossfight in elden ring has one or two mechanics that seem to be purpose designed to cheapen the experience and funnel new players into braindead caster builds. usome examplesu  morgott's piss daggers that punish you for good timing and fight rhythm.  godrick's near instant stormcall that punishes you for staying close.  input reading yes i know its not technically input reading you fucking pedant. but it leads to the exact same outcome in gameplay  malenia being an incredible fight ruined by one poorly thought out mechanic waterfowl bfinal dlc boss spoilers b this fight felt like a lords of the fallen boss. fromsoft, i know you're expected to up the ante in terms of difficulty every release, but lowering the quality of attack telegraphs does not make for good difficulty. it only creates the illusion of a hard fight and sacrifices mechanical fidelity in return. prime radahn felt like fighting a boss in a mobile game ripoff of elden ring. ds3 had fluid fights with smooth and intuitive back and forths. you had to learn spacing, timing, and whiff punishing. byou couldn't hit l2 and ignore the game's core mechanics.b elden ring is a serious downgrade from anything else in the fromsoft catalog when it comes to combat gameplay. souls games are arguably best known for having the most solid combat of any game ever, and elden ring massively disappoints in that regard. bthe open world was a mistake.b if i wanted to make a new pvp build in previous games, i would start and finish a whole new playthrough . replays were never tedious and i enjoyed them just as much as the pvp that came after. every time i want to make a new build in er i remember how the game turns into horse riding simulator to collect the necessary items. playing the game is insanely tedious. half your time during replays will be spent alt tabbing to look at the wiki. so you end up learning how to make a pvp ready save with ce and skip all that shit altogether. to conclude, elden wrong 210, ds3 was better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"this game caters entirely to pvp players. i would never recommend it at all as i despise the players who value their penis playing by being level uber elite and going to level 10 zones and killing level 10 characters. if this game had the ability to prevent those assholes from joining my game, i would actually recommend it. but right now... i want my money back."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"awesome game, must play for everyone, its just a shame i need to install several mods to be able to play in ultrawide when previous games worked without it"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"i just can't with elden ring. the first time i played i had fun in limgrave, i really thought this was going to be amazing. all the way through storm veil castle i was all for it. then the game just slips. i started going through the lake and got lost, not like lost in adventure, i mean i was lost, directionless and unsure how to progress. i completely missed the lord of the lake and instead fought the magic horse lady, i have no idea what her name was. i assumed i had finished lake then kept going and... uhh where do i go? the other side of the bridge led to a dead end and the enemy camps were starting to stomp me. i was going dex faith, which is supposedly really strong, and i had basic miracles, my weapon didn't seem to do anything and even with red fire enchantment i couldn't get bleed in any reasonable time to help me in fights. i just kept going, got up a cliff and killed the salamander only to fight tons of ogres i could barely one on one. i kept going, dragon with red lightning one shoting me. i kept going i see a giant golden door, two of the golden tree knights guarding it, i couldn't kill anything without hit and run tactics... i snuck past them, only to find more and more rediculous stuff that i couldn't hope to have gear for... i know a lot more now than i did then and honestly... i still have no idea what to do in this game. builds? that's for other people who have somehow figured this game out. items feel so disperate and all focused on hyper specific builds. like i found the winged scythe which is dex faith and yet didn't like it... it felt slow and cluncky for something meant to be dex. i've never finished the game ligitimantly. i don't think i ever will because the game loses it's fun right around the lack area and i've played limgrave a lot... i'm gonna burn out on it entirly one of these days and just not come back to it, as i still try to extract the bits of fun i original payed to have and instead got pain and disatifaction. also horse combat sucks... alot. it feels like the game is pushing you to use the horse constantly. it isn't as refined or fun as the dark souls combat. and yet, every time i see someone like ironpinapple play this game, i ask myself, why was i so hard on the game? this looks fun! i come back and get disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"horrible game for anyone that doesn't love punishment. you die, die again, and again, and hardly get a chance to do anything. even if you look past that everything is incredibly unintuitive, you get a summon, that you can't use, until you find a secret bell and then it doesn't work in most areas. don't make the same mistake i did and force yourself to try to like it because all the rave reviews then spend too much time to refund it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"this game is fromsoftware looking at ubisoft and saying, yesss, i want that! the game shines in its legacy dungeons where the environment is carefully crafted and full of secrets with clever enemy placements, and everything. in those areas, the game is fantastic. however, when youre not in a legacy dungeon, you spend a lot of time in a copypasted, halfarsed assassin's creedlike open w0rld filled with the same enemies, the same bosses, the same caves, the same everything. there is like a dragon or crab every 20 meters. at one point, you have to defeat a boss called crystalian, which jumps around like a monkey nonstop. a bit further in another boss fight, you need to kill two crystalians. then, in another fight, you need to kill three crystalians. and you know what? thats ok, let them copy the same boss 200 times. except you cant kill the fckers with the build youve been using the whole game because they are nearly immune to damage unless you hit them with a big club or something. its plain stupid. most of the bosses in this game are boring and unmemorable because they are just fillers, for them to say ooo, we have 600 bosses in the game. when theyre not boring, theyre ridiculously overpowered, with bs movesets like radahn or godskins. and now theyre releasing a fortnitelike game with nightreign, which should tell you the direction they are going. i've played and loved all the dark souls, demon's souls, bloodborne, and sekiro. but er is just a huge disappointment."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,does not support ultawide resolution. the game adds black bars to the side of the screen. just horrible.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"to start off right, i love the souls series, i love the genre, i played multiple times through dark souls 13, bloodborne, elden ring and shadow of the erdtree, i am by no means a bad player not particularly good either, but i definitely got good and i pull my weight in most bossfights. with that being said, i learned to hate this game with passion. the latest bosses don't indicatetelegraph their movement properly deliberate movement ambiguity or little to no movement at all  looking at you scadu tree avatar detonation, framedata shows hitboxes are badly aligned with meshes and lag behind movements or preceed it and everything and their mother reads your controller input to wait with attacks precisely to cost you an additional flask. ok, it makes the game more difficult, and longer combos contribute to that of course, but prior iterations of souls games had a different kind of approach. e.g. ds3 had specific rythms of bossfights. it felt like music, like a dance between you and the boss. i loved this principle and i absolutely miss it in elden ring. not just that the music is hardly memorizable  less iconic, but the bosses feel like small children, starting to cheat and bang on the table if they don't get what they want. fire giant, drake knights and co. quite literally bash their hands down on you, with no way to block or evade except with absolute perfect timing  and i mean like frame perfect timing  or you just stay away from them, which is in most cases the most dangerous thing you could do. why does that feel like cheating? because normally there is a trick or remedy for everything, except for specifically chosen bullshit moves you can't anticipate, read or counter that just eat away your life bar. in many cases i found myself only able to beat a boss  using all kinds of help at my disposal  by changing my build. but if i want to play as an intfocussed spell blade with rellana's drip? no chance, i have to respecc into a strengthfaith build to beat the boss. great. thanks, i hate it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,first souls game i ever played and really helped me understand the appeal to this genre. going from getting squished by godly bosses to learning attack patterns leading to eventual victory is an amazing feeling.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,one of the few games i've made an active effort to replay every year since its release.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,its single player game not co op i just can play with friend for short time not worth for it if cant play with friend as much i want
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,i waited too long after the two weeks to install and try it. and the key and mouse bindings are a shit show. i have a standard corsair mouse 4 button and cant get elden ring to recognize it for shit. and normally games that fail this regardless of reviews get a hard pass. remember folks if your the type that wants or needs to rebind things check your games shortly after buying them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,"i have a lot of thoughts about the game, but to keep things simple i'll start with a procon list pros decent artstyle some interesting boss designs the musical score subjective proscons few cutscenes mostly boss introductions lore insert markiplier face open world cons balancing late game the camera boss one hit kills many enemies are damage sponges personal thoughts mostly just a rant on poor design, feel free to ignore while soulslikes are difficult on principle, the game feels difficult not by design but by poor implementation of concepts and artificial difficulty . the open world is the biggest example of this, as with most open world games you are rewarded for exploration, however because a lot of enemies in elden ring are... dark souls enemies, one wrong step in any direction could result in a complete loss of leveling progress as you lose all leveling xpin game currency on death though no fault of your own, aside from not constantly checking the wiki every five seconds to know that deadnor the immortal spawns in this random corner of the world. in smaller dungeons and more traditional dark souls linear gameplay this can work, but in the open world, this creates difficulty through being tedious rather than being hard. add to that that most side dungeons reward you with summons or weapons that require specific stats, meaning you could clear a dungeon and get something your character can't really use without grinding for x statsredoing stats that you have no way of knowing you need until you've beat the dungeon and get the thing. and this punish the player for playing the game the way most game are supposed to be played and the lackluster exploration rewards makes it feel more artificial difficulty rather than a well designed challenge, given that the game does this constantly with most of its game design choices. spoiler honorable mentions for worst boss mechanics any grab move, malenia sword of miquella, scarlet rot, and of course nihil, nihil, nihil spoiler of course, this is just my opinion, and given most people seem to enjoy it, feel free to ignore my opinion, or call me wrong about my subjective feeling on a game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"with a heavy heart, i have to say that elden ring did in fact not click with me. yes, it is my first souls game. yes, i absolutely suck at this game. yes, i summon a cooperator for every boss i encounter. and lastly, yes, i was playing the astrologer. fyi i quit before the boss at deeproot around lvl. 80. i have many gripes with this game honestly, starting by the obvious, the difficulty. now hit me with the skill issue and git gud all you want, it's not going to change the fact that this game is not accessible to the majority of players. inheritely, this is not an issue because it's a niche genre, but being niche usually means to only appeal to a certain demographic. with 20 mil. copies sold, er is far from niche. some way to make the game easier and therefore more accessible would have been helpful. and no, the game doesn't lose it's reputation and soul or whatever the toxic diehards gatekeepers love to say, it would be optional to begin with. besides the difficulty, i didn't enjoy the world overall. it felt so samey, besides caelid, everything was in these greyish tones and to the point i got, it's just castle after castle to get to the next boss. i would've liked more variety, more wow effect. the huge erdtree looks awesome and caelid does too, but everything else isn't remarkable to me at all. i like the designs of most of the npcs tho, the voice acting is also quite nice. most of the bosses are somewhat unique and bring something new to the table. the radahn fight was my highlight, visually and mechanically. visually, this game is a masterpiece in some aspects, while failing in others. what i don't like mechanically tho? is the staff's playstyle. usually i go with sorcery role play, but it just feels awkward and boring in er. casting times and the scarce of spells did it for me, it was my last straw. i haven't tried any other playstyles, so i cannot comment on them. oh and riding torrent is really offputting, it feels like its mission is to make me trip and die. and for the story, i don't even know. i only know we have to get the runes. i had to actually google what maidens are, because it was never explained. blaidd also never appeared where i needed him in sofria and mistwood, but he decided to finally do so at the festival. i do like blaidd and he's the only character with melina who i was slightly invested in. mind you, i will probably watch something akin to a playthrough or story explaination, because i want to see that through somehow at least. the cooperator and invader format is really nice, i liked the gimmick. it was mostly fun and helpful, as of now, i haven't meet anyone malicious, but many claim i, so beware. this only contributes to the weird and imo horrible pc port, but i won't dive into that in this review. i simply wasn't having fun, everything felt like a drag and hot take after playing a couple of open world games, the glaring issues of that formula will show. i feel like i can never truly go back to the first wonders of open worlds botw for me and the nostalgia is too strong. thus resulting in expectations, which won't be met ever again. so, if you do not have the patience to grind, lose 50 times and then win  rinse and repeat and feel frustrated easily, this game isn't for you. one man's mental illness anger issuesinvoking game might be another's patience is key the payoff will be worth it game. it just depends on your preferences, because i value a more present story and a decent difficulty, this game is sadly not my gem. well, i still think blaidd is really cool, i might turn into a furry, so at least one win ?."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"h1 joy from pain h1 i've played and finished many hard games cuphead, celeste, getting over it and a hard game is like riding a bike. some are harder than others, like having to learn how to ride while on a steep hill, or having to learn while riding on rough terrain. none the less, any time you fall while trying to ride can be linked back to you're inability to do so. aka, skill issue. elden ring on the other hand is like trying to ride a bike, on a hill, with rough terrain, while your drunk father throws rocks at you and pushes you off the bike. this is why i particularly didn't enjoy elden ring, because while the games stated previously are hard, they make it to where you're in control on whether you win or lose the rough terrainhill. elden ring is unfair due to conditions outside of your control the drunk father hurling rocks. firstly, while this game encourages exploration, they make sure its no better than fighting bosses with an inconsistent spread of difficult areas, traps that'll teleport you to over leveled areas that you can't escape from, and having sights of grace respawn all enemies you've defeated. this makes exploring very slow, with it only becoming easier with finding better gear. except the really good gear is by defeating bosses, and the ones that aren't are hidden behind invisible walls or cliffs. there are ones you can obtain through quests, except there's no quest log so keeping track of quests is only fun if you have a guide. unless you already have experience playing souls games, guides are almost required to play elden ring if you want to play with an actual good build and weapons. the biggest example i know with this game being over the top with unfairness is the area with invisible black knife assassins. there is no way you can see them coming unless you have the sentry torch, which can only be bought at the hermit merchant shack. this is the only item in the game that allows you to see invisible enemy's and is the only place you can get it. not only that, but the game never directlyindirectly tells you how to get this item. this is what i mean by elden ring being over the top unfair, it consciously makes it impossible to do parts of the game unless you have previous knowledge on how to do it because it won't tell you. it's why so many people play this game with a guide, because if they didn't, they would spend hours running around like a headless chicken trying to figure out things like this and quests until they stumble upon the answer. this isn't just making it hard, it's making it confusing, which is far worse. the story while good is anything but linear, in order to understand what's happening in the game, you have to watch 10 hour youtube videos on the game's lore. don't even bother trying to play with friends in this game too as they can only join during boss fights. also god forbid if you're friend joins one time to do a boss for shits and giggles, you're world will be forever open to be invaded by people with over powered gear and levels that can't be stopped from killing you unless you kill them or rage quit. any criticism thrown towards this game has been deflected by hardcore fans with the notion that those who don't enjoy the game are simply bad at the game. they refuse however to acknowledge that gamer's who are displeased with this game, and how it intentionally causes problems outside of the players control, would in turn cause them little pleasure in trying to finish the game. the main pleasure you get from beating elden ring is the testament that you beat something built to be intentionally unfair, however do the ends really justify the means? i acknowledge how many awards, and how many people applaud the game, and i get why. the game is beautiful, the combat is terrific, and the different builds make customization in this game wonderful. i don't wish for people to read this review to persuade them that his game is bad. i want instead for those reading that are obsessed with the game, to try and understand those who try elden ring and decide its not for them. not everyone is willing to spend countless hours on a game that will cause them so much negativity, and that criticism about the game is just as valid as its praise. for anyone reading this deciding now whether they should try the souls genre, please consider what i've written. with the thought on whether you're ready to commit tens to hundreds of hours for a game that will do everything in its power to bring you pain. there's much joy and awesomeness to be found here, but only if you're willing to deal with the game hurl rocks at you. players too if you summon someone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,honestly... kinda over hyped. its not something to remeber its not a masterpiece and every part of the map feels the same. dark souls 3 is much better
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"got bombarded with tutorial messages or whatever the fuck mid fight and died because of it, its a good game but ive never seen a video game do that"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,terrible mechanics and a souls like just isnt good open world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"elden ring is without a doubt one of the most overrated games in recent years, and i can't understand why. everything about this game is just awful. the open world is boring and empty, with little variation and way too much unnecessary space. the combat system is frustrating and unfair, where you just die over and over from enemies with completely random attacks you can't predict. the graphics are mediocre at best, and everything looks like it could've been made for the ps3. the story is so bad its more confusing than engaging. the characters are flat, and you feel nothing for them. overall, elden ring is an exhausting and pointless experience that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. i absolutely hate this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"i bought this on sale, without much research, given it was lauded as a masterpiece when it came out...my reaction after 10ish hours? i didn't think i could be so annoyed by such a fancylooking toy, this isn't actually a video game, this is a schadenfreude simulator it is an interactive art exhibit highlighting the folly of human effort. oh, and breath of the wild does everything this game does, but better, and it has the courage to use colors outside sepiatone. also, the random, fake pvp invasion thing is real stupid... and coop? forget it. 90 of the community is morally against making the game easier for you and will find you and kill you. seriously guys? why tf you you even care how someone else is trying to play this game... privately!? yes, two people can be private that's how you came along. oh, but that's not all the intentional placement of you can't win road blocks actively punishes you for wanting to explore any of this vast world, and figuring out what actually matters, where your progresslocking points of interest are, or even just generally where to go protip not the roads, and certainly not the grace lines is infuriatingly obtuse... and this is coming from someone who plays monster hunter. it's practically unplayable for the uninitiated, and it is painfully obvious that you are required to posses a very strong prior affinity for the other dark souls games... and a willingness to regularly break immersion to go watch youtube guides on where to find the next important point of interest... or maybe you like to flail around endlessly until an invader spawns and either kills you or ruins the progress of whatever you were doing? why do so many people like this game? do they just really like the ultraedgy, heironymus boschmeetsdiablo aesthetics?k you know, i think my negative disposition comes down to a failed opportunity at better communication. if this game was called dark souls the elden ring, i would have already known what i was signing up for, and probably just skipped it to begin with. instead, they call it a different game, and i just assume there's some modicum of truth to that difference. psyche! you're playing dark souls, but this time with an eyewateringly massive array of primarily useless rpg elements in an equally massive, directionless open world, with nebulous reasons if any, for encouraging the player to even bother getting out of the starting building. seriously, why is the main character trying so hard to get the ring? oh, i'll learn that later on? yeah, this is a game, not a book players generally require some reason for playing in the first place.... especially rpgs. oh right, everyone loves the twodimensional make no meaningful decisions ever, but be really pensive about ittype characters like the witcher. you know, it's me, not you. like what you like. nobody can stop you anyway. i give up. i'm officially too old to enjoy video games. so pardon me while i clear my throat... get off my lawn"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"h1 synopsis h1 release 2022 value for money full price is fine recommended if you like large openworlds, dark fantasy, challenging gameplay campaign playtime estimation based on my playthrough 5060 hours h1 reviewminor gameplay spoilers h1 elden ring provides an experience the truly evokes a feeling of an odyssey. every new region provides new challenges to overcome and a large area to explore. elden ring looks fantastic, utilising dirty, almost grimy textures to add to the atmosphere. it also sounds just as good, everything from the wind to the clicking of equipment sounds pleasing. the designs of creatures and enemies are generally quite unique whilst also feeling coherent, aided by the very solidified world the game takes place in. you are never itoldi about the world similarly to how you are never itoldi what to do, only learning about it by actively piecing information together. this was my first souls game and it did not disappoint. gameplay wise it was exactly what i was hoping for difficult, but only as much as you want it to be. the major bosses were extremely memorable fights, the visual storytelling was amazing and the composition of introductory areas was masterfully done. unfortunately, despite not having many map markers, the game still struggle with some checklist syndrome. some of the side content is repetitive, mostly seen in the caves and evergaols. nonmain bosses even excluding cave bosses became quite uninteresting later on, often being repeated. i'm sure if you have played this game and are reading about this review you know about ithati evergaol. despite this the game is incredible, with so many moments and beautiful areas. i cannot begin to describe how i felt after encountering the first dragon, it truly was spectacular."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"before i write a negative review, i'm going to open with i love the series and i love fromsoft and i loved all of the previous games. however, i do not recommend elden ring if you intend to play it coop with friends in vanilla. if you are going to play it single player by yourself, it is a 1010 experience. elden ring is a great game, a truly amazing experience, it's a lot of fun and a very beautiful journey to walk. in single player it's 1010 and worth every penny. if you intend to play multiplayer, you're going to have a very frustrating experience getting invaded every 5 minutes from the most toxic community ever. the current cooldown for invaders feels like 5 minutes. that means, every 5 minutes, someone uninvited can just barge into your session and bring whatever equipment and consumables and spells that they want into your game, and try to kill you with it. in a situation where you're an experienced player where you know what you're doing and you have decent gear, this is fine, and keeps things interesting. if you're just starting out with a friend who is brand new to the series and you want to introduce them to the game you love so much, just imagine, you start out and you have a wooden club, and some pants as your equipment. no spells. no other weapons. no consumables. you start out with 4 flasks like normal because your character is brand new. some guy invades you, and he casts 3 spells in a row and regenerates hp faster than you can damage him even when you score back stabs. he then swirls some blades around him a bunch of times, and throws a pot at you that inflicts scarlet rot on the first hit. he has the maximum number of flasks available, reinforced to the max level. he has a lag pedal, or is literally from china, invading you on the north american servers, so all of his hits will connect and all of yours will miss. he's going to tbag you like he demonstrated any level of skill at all in the middle of the fight. your friend is like wow this guy made us chase him all over the damn map while we were trying to explore, how often is this going to happen? every. five. minutes. i know for a fact there's going to be people saying git gud, lern 2 play and that's not the point. i know how to play the game and if it was just me and the person was legit trying to 1v1 and duel me it would be different. but if you're trying to explore with a friend and you have some twink with end game equipment and spells invading you at the very start griefing you with scarlet rot before you even have a chance to get something that cleanses it? your hunter takes a full 5 minutes to load in, while the invader encounters can be lost in 30 seconds? it's a very strong tell saying that the community is just toxic. ya'll hate new players and you hate letting the player base grow. you don't want other people to have fun with their friends. you want easy kills and to dunk on new players while running around the map, trying to lure the host players into packs of mobs endlessly so you can get an easy kill. if you're going to play the game single player, 1010 experience. if you're going to play online with friends, be ready for the most annoying running around foreign country dollartreewifi chase of your life on some guy that has end game gear. every. five. minutes. miyazaki, please just region lock the game if you insist on keeping pvp like this in. please just ban people with high enough ping rates from invading. or please just allow us to turn invaders off. why do we need to mod the game to get rid of them? it's an open world game, why do i need to get invaded every 5 minutes while trying to explore?"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"game terbaik kumainin, wat a masterpiece game to stand before elden ring and become elden lord!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"i'll try to be synthetic, but how do you even talk about a game this massive? i mean, meme aside, they literally released a second title and called it a dlc. two thirds of one if i'm honest. so, elden ring and shadow of the erdtree. pros  beautiful. and i don't mean oh hey it's pretty nice, i mean the landscape distracted me and i got killed by that mob that runs a lot faster than it looks like it should. seriously, pan that damn camera around, it's worth dying.  challenging. alright, maybe infuriatingly hard is clearer, but who likes a game of chess against a rock? this game doesn't want to let you win, so you'll have to learn attack patterns, to understand how delay works, to practice timing if you want to dodge glaive master hodir's bonk stick, and sometimes you just can't dodge and you need to figure out how to mitigate. there's like twelve ways to play. if something doesn't work, change the approach. and you know what? you never lose anything to dying. well, runes, but if you just take the time to explore a bit that's not an issue.  rich. well, actually, very obscure and unclear, so if you want to truly understand the lore, vaatividyia is your man. but in gameplay? things aren't ever quite what they seem. for every marvel in this world, there's a manmade horror beyond comprehension waiting around the corner to pop out your eyeballs and eat them like jujubes. it looks like a story about taking a crown from marika's inbred . but it is so, so much more than that.  funny. genuinely funny although it's rare. go on, parry the knights. land a charged crucible horn on malenia. i think the crozier's charged attack works too. befriend blackguard boggart. sometimes this game is just plain goofy. cons  infuriatingly hard! i mean, what's new here? you need to learn a bit of detachment, young jedi. hesitation is defeat, and victory requires a clear head. and even with all this, sometimes, some bosses are just chores. they vary a bit from person to person, and it's clear that you're better off if you can tolerate the very rare mandatory bosses. if you can't? time to look up for a cheese strategy... see niall and his two goons? just yesterday i learned that barricade shield hardcounters the two goons. you can bully them in the most satisfying way.  it's quite easy to spoil your first experience because of the difficulty and the obscurity of the game. try and go in blind unknowing of the story, of the efficient strategies, of the good weapons, receiving little to no help from cooperators... is it painfully hard? yes. is it worth it? also yes. did you end up midra's cousin? because blindness is not an excuse for that, the ingame warnings are pretty clear.  guide dang it. some questlines are, uh, 'unclear' without the internet. you might want to not follow them too fast, or to look up where is the damn chest. there. is the game worth it? yes. is it for everybody? no, although i think you should give it a try. is it the best way to discover the soulslike experience? probably. is the dlc worth its price? it's literally a second game. i'm not joking, it's absurdly big. and don't you dare hit a turtle. you monster."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"i just dont feel that this game deserves the rating it has. i will say, it is a really solid game with an open world that has some of the better visuals i have ever seen in a game. my main complaint is how absolutely horrible the port to pc is. it feels like 1 singular intern was given the task to port it, a week before release. why are almost no keybinds editable? why do i have to thumb through all my assigned items, instead of just clicking a hotkey i made like every other game? why does it take holding down a key and pressing another to do something as simple as getting on my mount? im using an entire keyboard, is there anyway yall could let me use more that like 7 keys? i also still cant get used to the crazy weird key setup of the menus. just a lazy port. i have googled and still dont understand in the slightest, but why is there no pause on a single player game? how is that possibly ever a good thing? i literally choose to play single player games a lot of times because i know i may have to pause it without notice and walk away. not having it in feels so clunky. on the combat side of things, i personally cant say that i have enjoyed the combat too much. it hasnt been terrible, but also not great. it feels like 50 gear levelcharacter level, 25 luck, and 25 skill. from what i have read since starting, the clunkiness is just part of souls games, but it just doesnt feel like good. before i had played this i assumed souls games were a lot of exact dodges, and well timed parries. what i personally have found is animations not being precise with where to where damage is delivered, being hit through walls and other obstacles, staggering affect on both enemies and the player character being way too strong, along with a few others that im too lazy to list. overall its a solid game i just dont understand the people saying its a generational game. so i guess the expectations going into it could be part of my reasoning."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,my friend recomended me this game ive never played a souls game before and im ready to play all the other ones if that tells you enough
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"alright, first off, i gotta say i aint got no personal beef with mr. miyazaki, the goddamn mastermind behind these games. seriously, i fucking loved sekiro shadows die twicethat shit was fire. but holy fucking hell, maybe i just havent played enough games in my life, cause ive never seen a game that shoves this many vomitinducing freaks into your face. in the shortass time i played, i ran into a dragon so ugly it could scare a trucker, these egglooking fucks spewing poison everywhere, a crustyass giant crab, and some monstrosity with a sword on its back and a gaping hole in its stomach. like, what the actual fuck? my trypophobia kicked in hard, and i nearly threw up my dinner. miyazakisan, i gotta askyou got some kinkyass fetish or are you just a straightup psycho deep down? keep your weirdass fantasies to yourself, man. nobody asked for this shit. oh, and heres another thingwhen i pan the camera, the distant scenery gets this nauseating wobble. thought it was dynamic blur, so i turned that shit off, but nope. still feels like motion sickness simulator. sekiro never pulled this bullshit, and my rigs got an amd r9 7940hx and an rtx 4070. hardware aint the problem, so what gives? boss fights? dont even get me started. the stamina bar drains like a motherfucker, blockings a fucking joke, and rolling feels like its lagging through molasses. after sekiros butterysmooth combat, this is like downgrading to a fucking potato. maybe im just built differentsekiros more my speed. look, i know this games got mad praise online, but im keeping it real. if youre thinking of buying this, take this as your headsup. peace out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,it just doesn't live up to the magic of dark souls. i force myself to fire it up every time just to go through it without feeling anything
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,the base game is awesome. the expansion requires more time spent watching a guide than playing the game if you want smooth progress and that is not fun in the least. the expansion borders on being bad. i hope the base game isn't the last masterpiece produced by this developer.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"from demon's souls to elden ring. i've been through and maxed every, single, one. the praise this game got is very much not earned. it's a joke of some irony to watch the cesspool that rpgs have become. there was good things to find this run around, but they aren't worth mentioning since who will care, they and from will never change. 1. story and gameplay, handinhand, are reused in each fromsoftware game broken as the record it plays on. seeing the asylum demon come back as a tree sentinal or vengarl back as consort redahn is not a callback, its clearly the fetishism of the authors bringing back the design to keep making more of it. but each iteration is watered down for more spectical. the simple fact i watched durability get weened out by the third dark souls was restlessly boring. i crave the game forcing me to only take one weapon because of item load, but since sony owns demon's souls on a collar and chain, i can no longer play the remake. which was a dream to play once more. 2. somehow, the ability to start a new play through vs. continue a cycle is worse this time. the shear amount of collectibles that are scattered in every forsakenly scattered cave is infinite. since starting a new cycle carries over your crafting, memory slots, and maps solildifies the feeling of dread as you start a fresh save and open your map to a black screen. i used the wiki from 0 in the first run ever to 999 in the second after milking my first to ng100. 3. the reason exploring a new map is rotten, is the fact 80 of it is baren, empty, worthless collectibles. oh found a new ruins? it has a titanite3 only one in it. another chest in castle fort? it's a loretied sword wow. beacause of durability mind you, i maxed my starting weapon and it did 400 more ar than the sword i found in said chest, so not using it. even in my first run i stumbled right behind the storm castle and found the backpath to liurnia before i explored limgrave, and when i did return, i realized my first discovery was better than every once of land i found in limgrave. 4. if it is the story that must be mentioned, the design of this world is...perplexing. ds, dark 12, and bloodborne making a world where you can even find a toilet and living space for the inhabitants gave it a kind of, energy of life. a home that ruined. limgrave is, well what the hell is it. limbograve is just full of rubble and grasslands with 800 hallowed enemies wondering it... where the hell did they live??? are they even still alive, hallowed, or undead? the game never mentions what it means in this land. from fighting humans as a human using the help of a demon in the first, to being undead fighting hallowed, to, you're some kind of warrior brought to a... is there land outside of land between? the geometry looks etheral but the map is a island surrounded by ocean. so other crountries are just minding their business? with this warsource of power left unchecked? or this is an afterlife that is special to undead who travel here for eternity? how does dark souls 2 make more sense than this? oh, i love how the turtle priest mentions his queen loved radagon across the country or a world away or some sense, yet it takes me 20 minutes to run from the church to lindel and another 15 to reach the city... what, a, joke. and here i thought skyrim was small! i can't believe i can see this mess turn from a beautiful unique jrpg into an action rpg in realtime with each game in my library. and in the end, i feel like i betrayed ds 2 with how i somehow have more hours in this rotten corpse of a game than the enigmatic song and wondrous dance the oldies was. elden ring isn't the first to do this. other classics have lost their performance despite getting bigger budgets and time. i still am appalled after years from hearing someone call elden ring just a bit better than morrowind. but a game as old as me, is far better and satisfying than this cinematicslop. and after its all over, i don't regret having played it, but i wish i could be owed back the money i wasted on this. it isn't worth any respect. a return to origin would. make. an. rpg. in case you don't know how look up dnd. make some stats. make some classes. instead of watering down the skill, make tatical fighting and magical interference a real fantasy."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,my rating  910 blows my mind how fromsoftware creates worlds like these. the attention to detail and complexity of the map and enemies are second to none in the modern game market. only setback which is mostly on me is no quest log so i do have to google what to do and where to go from time to time.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,good game 1010 i played keyboard and mouse.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"elden ring may not be a bad game, but it's certainly not for everyone. there is an intriguing world to explore, with an art direction that makes you want to find out what's in the distance. this was my first fromsoft game  i had always avoided these games in the past because my skill level is quite low and fromsoft games are notorious for their difficulty. but i heard so many incredible things about this game that i wanted to give it a go. my takeaway is that if you kinda suck at video games like i do, the positives of this game do not compensate for spending hours upon hours upon hours smashing your head against a wall. with almost 40 hours in i have only defeated the first major boss, and there are plenty of areas in the starting area i have yet to properly explore. so i am experiencing the game very slowly compared to what's normal i imagine. there is a level of satisfaction and intrigue of exploring somewhere new, but reexploring that same area for the 20th time to try to kill something or just retrieve the currency you spent hours building up for the next mostly useless level up does not carry that satisfaction or intrigue. elden ring is a combat game first and foremost. everything else about it is supplementary, at least in my experience. so if you're not a fan of combatfocused games, don't be fooled into thinking that the exploration or world design will carry the game for you. it probably won't. there is also essentially no story to speak of and a nearcomplete lack of npcs, so that won't engage you either. elden ring is a game about trying to kill tough bosses and everything else is window dressing. if trying to kill tough bosses isn't that exciting for you, feel free to ignore all the massive hype surrounding the game and give it a miss."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"the game runs fine on my old pc and runs fine on a steam deck on lower settings. if when it starts up it you have a 5min black screen and it randomly freezes for minutes at a time constantly, request a refund. if this happens on your pc, no fix you can try will fix these issues. i have tried every last potential fix i could find and none of them have worked, and its only this one game that does this on my pc. when it runs correctly it's really fun. lots of things to fight and find in a nice looking world."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,i hate this game. don't let my hours fool you i've been stuck on the first boss the whole time and i haven't learned one thing. wheres the step by step tutorial? such poor guidance in a 60 game. do better fromsoftware!!!

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,i have no idea who those people were who decided it should be the goty 2022. quantity doesnt equal quality. you can easily apply this for every aspect of the game from the size of the areas to the amount of bosses attacks. overall elden ring was disgustingly exhausting. 310
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,the only reason you would like this dog shit of a game is if you were retard who likes getting butt fucked. this game is designed for people who hate themselves and don't have enough money for a dominatrix to beat the shit out of them. do not buy this game if you like fun.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"ahh, ye tarnished, this and some epic orchestral battle music with operatic elements go hand in hand."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,the best game ever made to this day. remarkable. amazing. 1110
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"the gameplay , the graphics , the lore."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"this is a fun game but i would suggest that you used a controller it better that way, thank you for your time and i hope you have a great day. from the plague doctor."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"after finally getting every achievement, beating the main game and dlc 3 times each, exploring every possible area and using pretty much every unique weapon i thought it would be worth making a review. keep in mind this is based on my personal experience, with plenty of subjective takes. the positives the main thing that stands out to me with elden ring is the sheer amount of options you get creating a build, there are so many cool unique builds you end up making when you play and i personally find the build creation easily the most enjoyable part of the game. choosing an armour combination that looks good, pairing it with different weapons and having fun playing with it. there are literally thousands of viable builds and watching videos online from people explaining their personal builds then trying to combine parts of their build into mine, searching for the perfect build that looks and feels amazing to use is whats kept me hooked for hundreds and hundreds of hours. along with build variety the gameplay itself is absolutely incredible, the combat is based on a dodge and counter playstyle that feels amazing when you perfect it, taking no hits from a long string of attacks because you managed to read the movements of the boss perfectly is an irreplaceable feeling. the boss fights themselves are some of the best you'll ever experience, the designs, abilities, and ost especially the dlc ost from each remembrance boss make for the most memorable fights ever, the open world is one of the most visually stunning open worlds i've ever explored, it feels rewarding to explore and is incredibly immersive, you could just ride around the map for hours on end without even realising it. the lore is some of the most intricate and detailed you'll ever see, you can literally watch a 9 hour lore video on a single boss, and the mystery behind certain parts of the story is incredibly clever. the negatives the quest design is frankly pretty awful, completing a quest without watching a guide is practically impossible, you're given no clues the majority of the time as to what the next step of the quest is and if you had no external knowledge completing certain quests would only be possible with dumb luck. the balancing is ridiculous, the effectiveness of a weapon should be directly tied to the difficulty of obtainment, if you beat the hardest bosses in the game, they should reward you with the best weaponsincantationssorceries in the game, but instead they give you mediocre weapons that get overshadowed by weapons you get early game, the final boss of the dlc is the best example. if a boss is difficult it should give you a good weapon, a simple concept the devs choose to ignore. the ui often makes gameplay more clunky, for example switching between sorceries and incantations, on keyboard you need to press the arrow up key multiple times before you can use a specific ability and it completely ruins the flow of combat, the simple fix is to allow us to bind sorceries and incantations to specific keys 1,2,3,4,5..., it would make spell casting so much smoother. the storytelling, while in theory i do understand the benefits of implied storytelling, slowly figuring out the history of the world as you explore, but elden ring takes it too far imo, there are times when you don't even know who you're fighting until you watch a lore video afterwards on who that was. it takes any emotional and narrative weight behind certain fights and makes them simply a 'thing to kill' rather than fully presenting the lore they've put so much effort into crafting. i'm not saying to make the lore obvious, i'm just saying at least a hint about who you're fighting could change the experience of so many boss fights. despite the fact that the negative section is just as large as the positive, the negatives are simply the things that hold elden ring back from being being a perfect game imo, i could go on for hours about the positives, it would just be too much for a review if i wanted anyone to actually bother reading it. if you plan on buying the game hopefully you will i'll answer a few things you might be worried about is it too hard? the game is hard, but only as hard as you make it, stuff like summons and certain builds can completely cheese the game but i'd say use them in moderation, i regret using summons on the second half of my first playthrough because i didn't fully get the chance to enjoy the bosses. personally i think a good rule to have is use summons if you're outnumbered in a boss fight, basically a mimic to avoid getting jumped. the important thing with difficulty is you want the fights to be challenging, but not to the point of insanity. how well does it run? i play with a 1050ti on high graphics and i rarely ever have any stuttering or framerate drops, it should run fine on most specs. elden ring is for me summarised with a single word, incredible, and i would recommend it to literally everyone, i've never been so hooked playing a game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,if you are looking for a challenging game with an impressive storyline then this is for you!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,elden beast fight sucks ass but the rest of the game is fire

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,absolute blast if you enjoy getting smashed 7 ways to sunday
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"elden ring  shadow of the erdtree  goated in all categories imo few games redefine a genre the way elden ring has. fromsoftware took everything theyve mastered over the years, challenging combat, rich worldbuilding, and deep lore and expanded it into an open world that feels alive, mysterious, and endlessly rewarding. the lands between is a place where every step leads to discovery, every fight demands respect, and every victory feels like an earned triumph. with the release of shadow of the erdtree, the experience has only become richer, pushing the boundaries of exploration and difficulty even further. the brilliance of elden ring lies in its design philosophy total freedom. theres no checklist of objectives, no forced path, just a world brimming with secrets, waiting to be uncovered. one moment, youre scaling the heights of altus plateau the next, youre descending into the eerie underground cities of nokron or stumbling upon an entirely new region you had no idea existed. its a game that encourages curiosity, rewarding those who wander with breathtaking vistas, hidden bosses, and lore that deepens the mystery of the world. shadow of the erdtree expands this world even further. with new lands shrouded in mystery, fresh horrors lurking in the dark, and lore that redefines what we thought we knew, fromsoftware has ensured that elden ring remains an adventure without equal. combat endless possibilities, relentless challenge that does not hold your hand whether youre a dexteritybased samurai, a tanky knight with a colossal greatsword, or a sorcerer unleashing devastating magic, elden ring offers unparalleled variety. the combat is fluid, punishing, and endlessly satisfying. no build feels like the right choice, every playstyle is viable, as long as you master it. with ashes of war and spirit summons, the customization only gets deeper, allowing players to tailor their approach in ways that make every encounter feel fresh. side note shadow of the erdtree cranks the intensity up even further. new weapons, abilities, and enemies ensure that even seasoned players will have to adapt. the expansion isnt just more of the same, it refines what was already an incredible combat system, pushing players to experiment and evolve. bosses that test your limits boss battles in elden ring are not just fightsthey are nightmares given form, merciless trials designed to break even the most seasoned players. each encounter is a relentless dance of life and death, where hesitation means annihilation, malenia, blade of miquella, moves with impossible speed, her waterfowl dance carving through even the sturdiest defenses, regenerating health with every slash. she is the embodiment of endurance, a boss that punishes mistakes with surgical precision and tests the limits of patience and skill. then theres general radahn, a warrior so powerful he literally holds the stars in place. his opening assault alone can wipe out an unprepared player, and his second phase, where he crashes down like a burning meteor quite literally feels like an extinction level event, where he descends from the heavens like a dying star at the player that will one tap wipe if unprepared. malekith, the black blade, is the very embodiment of death itself, his attacks not only lethal but soulcrushing, shredding through health bars with abyssal fury. his second phase transforms the battlefield into a graveyard of desperation that will make youthe player feel helpless against his relentless blitz combos. radahns promised consort form is the ultimate test of everything elden ring has thrown at youa final, merciless trial where even the most battlehardened tarnished will struggle to survive. his attacks are an overwhelming mix of raw power and terrifying speed, each strike shaking the battlefield as if the very world is rejecting his existence. dodging feels almost pointless at times, as he closes distance with unnatural speed, chaining together devastating combos that leave no room for recovery. the arena itself is a ruined wasteland, a haunting reminder of the destruction left in his wake. and then theres the musican aweinspiring, almost mournful orchestral piece that builds into a furious crescendo, perfectly matching the chaos of the battle. its the kind of soundtrack that makes you feel like youre in the middle of a legend, fighting against an enemy who should be completely unstoppable. if that doesn't sound daunting enough, theres miquellaethereal, mesmerizing, and utterly captivating. whether through his presence alone or something far more sinister, once he embraces you the first time,the fight feels like a desperate race against time no matter how much damage you've done, if he gets ahold of the player once more, the fight instantly ends. the bosses in this lovely game are truly an experience that i feel every player should be exposed too regardless of skill if you're unable to beat a boss, you do in fact, have to get gud a game that respects the player elden ring doesnt hold your hand. it doesnt spoonfeed you lore, it doesnt point you toward objectives, and it doesnt make victory easy. thats exactly why its so rewarding. the thrill of discovery, the satisfaction of overcoming seemingly impossible odds, and the deep, unfolding mystery of the world make this one of the most unforgettable experiences in gaming. without question, elden ring isnt just one of the greatest games of all timeits a landmark in gaming history. no other soulslike quite matches its sheer scale, challenge, and depth, making it the definitive experience for those seeking true mastery in the genre."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"steam asked me for a review, so this is what i have to say. it's amazing, the depth, the grandeur, the detail and creativity of it all. i love it. so glad it exists. i've played 175 hours and i want more. the combat feels so good, my heart beats faster when i'm in the thick of it. can't say enough good things about this game. if you haven't played it yet, i'd recommend it.  sincerely, your fellow gamer."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"elden ring  a masterpiece in a league of its own  1010 elden ring is just goated, plain and simple. fromsoftware took everything great about their past games and turned it into one of the most insane open world experiences ive ever played. no handholding, no forced objectives just pure exploration, discovery, and challenge. the world design is next level. every time i thought id seen it all, id stumble across some underground city, a hidden boss, or a completely new area i somehow missed. its the kind of game where you just get lost in the world and dont even mind. combat? peak. whether youre going for a bleed build, tanky greatshield knight, or fullon sorcery spam, the variety is crazy. my endgame character is stacked with weapons, armor, and spells, and im still trying out different builds. theres always something new to mess around with. and the boss fights? just ridiculous. some of the best in any game. malenia, radahn, godfrey, radagon, each fight feels like an event, where you either get humbled or pull off the sickest clutch win of your life. this game doesnt hold your hand, but thats what makes it so rewarding. every victory feels earned. every discovery feels genuine. its easily one of the best games ive ever played. now its time for the dlc. lets see what fresh hell fromsoft has waiting.  easy 1010. play this game."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"100 the game and i loved it. cant wait to save for the dlc. genuinely hate the input reading though, it never felt like that with ds3, input reading prior to this game was based on your movement. in elden ring input reading is based off a button press, and to confirm this i've only ever noticed this on elden ring, one of the few things i dont like about this game, its bad game design."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"honestly, its peak. still hard as fuck if you have the reaction speed of a sloth me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,i have never wanted to break something more in my life. this game is a great test of how many damn times can you die before you lose it!

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,most infuriating game of all time. can't recommend it enough.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"h1 elden ring  a masterpiece of challenge and atmosphere h1 as my first fromsoftware game, elden ring was an entirely new experience for me. i was drawn to it by the sheer hype surrounding its release, but what i discovered was far more than just a trending titleit became the best video game i have ever played. h2 a world that demands exploration h2 from the moment i stepped into the lands between, i was captivated by its breathtaking world design. every location feels meticulously crafted, rewarding curiosity with hidden dungeons, powerful weapons, and lorerich encounters. the atmosphere is unparalleled, making every moment feel like a journey into the unknown. h2 a combat system that demands mastery h2 i wanted a game that would challenge me, and elden ring delivered in every possible way. the combat is brutal but fair, requiring patience, skill, and strategy. every boss fight feels like a test of endurance and adaptation, and finally overcoming them brings a sense of accomplishment few other games can match. h2 lore and storytelling that draws you in h2 unlike traditional rpgs that spoonfeed the story, elden ring lets players uncover its deep and mysterious lore through exploration, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling. the characters, both tragic and terrifying, left a lasting impression, making me eager to learn more about their histories and roles in the world. h2 unforgettable atmosphere and music h2 the games soundtrack is another standout aspect. whether its the haunting melodies of the loading screen or the adrenalinepumping orchestral scores during boss fights, the music perfectly complements the games tone. it enhances the intensity of every battle and the wonder of every landscape. h2 final thoughts  a mustplay experience h2 for those hesitant about diving into a fromsoftware game, elden ring is the perfect entry point. it challenges you, but it also rewards perseverance in a way that few games can. the combination of exploration, combat, and storytelling makes it a truly unforgettable experience. this game has ignited my b love b for fromsoftware titles, and i cannot wait to explore dark souls, bloodborne, sekiro, and beyond. if you're looking for an immersive, challenging, and rewarding journey, elden ring is an absolute mustplay."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,i slammed my head against the wall and got a concussion cause the bosses gave me an aneurysm. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"its a fantastic game, but it might be a bit hard!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,if you hate failing over and over and occasionally succeed fail somewhere else. not for the faint of heart.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,this game made me break a headset a monitor and beat my wife. amazing game 1010 would play it again!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,almost gave up after the initial 6 hours with the first boss 1110 game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,this game is fun and well balenced even if you wana play with friends
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,kinda nitpicky reason but does not support ultrawide natively. odd for this new of a game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,maxlreiber denkt er wr der goat in elden ring aber er yappt so krass
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"hmm, game is good. good horse. cool bosses. 1010 hard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"i played this game for about 24,517 hours on my playstatin, and honestly iits kinda mid. its way to easy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,play this game if you want to rip your eyeballs out whilst fighting the fire giant or melania
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,got this game on my xbox have about 200 hours on it after selling my xbox i had to buy this game again mark my words im putting another 200 hours on this game if not more. if you never touched a souls game before then i would 100 recommend this to you i'd sell my soul to experience this game for the first time again
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"it easily the best game i've ever player. i've created 8 characters and beaten the game over a dozen times. each character and play through offers new opportunities that make the game fun to play again and again. while i definitely have my favorites, there are so many weapons to build your character around that it completely changes how you approach fights and bosses that you think you know."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,this is the best game i have ever played no doubt the experience this game gets u in is a wonder man i love this game and thanks fromsoftware for giving such master piece
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i loved this game on console and after the dlc came out i wanted to experience it on the pc with better graphics just to find out it doesnt support ultrawide monitors and its locked at 60 fps.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i think this is the best fromsoft game to just pick up and play if the bosses were your main draw for playing in previous games. a lot of tedious aspects from the souls games are gone. this removes some of the unique challenge that earlier games had, but it works mostly well here. the game is a lot less punishing overall which is why i find it really easy to just play and have fun most of the time. the main downside i noticed from this is that there's not really any long stretches where you have to fight through enemies while surviving on your limited estus charges. you're never really that relieved to find a site of grace since there's so many of them even in the legacy dungeons, and by the end of the game, you have so many flasks that taking damage is not that serious. the bosses here are mostly very fun and challenging fights. i think that they're probably the strongest part of this game besides the nice visuals. there's obviously some not so great bosses, but i think this game has significantly more hits than misses compared to ds1 and ds2. the copy paste of bosses does get a little annoying though. this game is also insanely enjoyable to explore and get lost in during your first playthrough. after the first time however, i think it loses a lot of the fun. i never went into the small side dungeons unless i had to after my first time. they start to feel very boring and copy pasted after you get what they're about. overall, this game is pretty incredible. it just has some meh parts that i wish weren't there. it's quite pretty, has a lot of nice qol changes, and has some really impressive boss fights."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,this game makes me feel earthquakes of rage unmeasurable by the richter scale. 1010 will play again
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,cant even play it. when the game starts up without even alt tabbing. it gets stuck moving up and down in the menu. unplayable.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,hard but rewarding. if you want to try a game like this and are worried about the difficulty start here.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,the best dark fantasy game youll ever find. a zelda for adults that can surprise you even when youre not playing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"decently difficult game, also the storytelling often feels missing because it comes through cryptic lore and environmental storytelling. not a ton of fun, but still well designed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,i've beaten this game 4 times not counting modded runs and i still could play it several more times
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,difficulty makes the game fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,one of the greatest games of all time
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"great game as you have probably heard, but the security model is terrible. you think after decades of development they would validate summon and invader actions server side but they dont. so everytime you engage in online play youre gambling that the other player isnt going to completely corrupt your save if not do worse. cant recommend a game that is still struggling with this issue 4 years after release."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,immediately after starting the game i was curb stomped then told i was maidenless. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,fun but not fun at start u needa get used to not grinding 1 npc and start going to other places
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"has made me feel so many things rage, determination and then more rage 1010 i keep coming back to it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,beating this game is a feeling you wont understand until you do it yourself.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,this game makes a pro gamer cry ...hard but fun open world with alot of twists and deaths and losing money is worse then dying...lol

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"souls games started off like a family owned restaurant. menu's were a bit janky and didnt always make sense, some food was mild and meaty, easy to eat, some were super spicy and a challenge, but all the food tasted amazing. people seemed to enjoy the spicey food the most, especially the competitive eaters. now here we are, no more mild food, everything is so focused on being spicey that it sacrifices the taste. this place used to be about good food, now it's how spicey can u make it and people will still eat it. edit nvm i discovered square off. easy game easy life completed it, ds1 still king"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"elden ring was my first venture into soulslike games, and what an experience it was! i spent countless hours dying to the tree sentinel and nearly every boss and hostile npc in limgrave. yet, despite all the setbacks, i found the game incredibly fun and couldnt get enough of it. it took a bit of time for everything to click, but once it did, i was completely hooked. as someone who tends to get stressed easily, i found this game surprisingly therapeutic. the intense fights can be stressful, but focusing on staying present, breaking the challenge into manageable steps, and accepting the outcome of each battle turned out to be a soothing process. it made me think games like this could even work as a form of immersion therapy for stress managementif approached correctly. however, its important to note that if used improperly, it could have the opposite effect and amplify stress. ill admit, i still need to get good, but i thoroughly enjoy the experience regardless of my skill level. while elden ring may not suit everyone, id wholeheartedly recommend it to most people for its unique and immersive gameplay. pros immersive open world the vast, interconnected world of the lands between is stunning, mysterious, and filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered. challenging but rewarding combat every encounter feels meaningful, and overcoming tough bosses delivers an unmatched sense of accomplishment. freedom of exploration the openworld design allows you to choose your path and face challenges in any order, adding a sense of freedom and adventure. therapeutic potential staying focused and managing stress during intense fights can feel deeply rewarding, offering a unique mental challenge. rich lore and atmosphere the subtle storytelling and intricate worldbuilding create a compelling atmosphere that invites curiosity and exploration. cons steep learning curve new players may find the game daunting, especially if theyre unfamiliar with soulslike mechanics. punishing difficulty the high level of challenge might deter players seeking a more relaxed experience. lack of guidance the minimal handholding can lead to moments of frustration as you figure out where to go or what to do next. stressful battles while therapeutic for some, the intensity of combat might feel overwhelming or anxietyinducing for others."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"with out a doubt the best game i have ever played, cant wait for more"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"the culmination of fromsoft games. if you loved demon souls, dark souls, or sekiro then you will love this game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"tldr another souls like with nothing new but the addition of a completely open world. if you've played others in the series and want to see if this offers more... imo it offers the same quality as usual but in a crazy amount of quantity. if the open world idea was a gamble, it certainly seems to be one that paid off. story furly fingers, elden lords and runes. it's all pretty grim and secretive, but what i gathered was this at some point the erd tree showed up, marika is chosen to carry the elden ring, she shagged godfrey who's now waging a bunch of wars to protect said erd tree and had a bunch of kids, who inevitably start killing other's kids, making even more problems. you pop out of somewhere and have decided to clean house, starting with house rats, goats and hands to pretty much killing god. yyyyeep, sounds about right... right? gameplay if you've played demon's souls or any of the souls genre, you'll feel right at home. or at least right up until you see the giant world map and realise you're now playing skyrim with a character that can easily instantly die from a debuff. leveling up requires you to spend runes, which are acquired via killing enemies, but true to its genre, dying means dropping all your currently held runes on the spot. should you happen to die again before picking them back up, well, they're now gone forever. each level up requires an ever increasing amount of runes, thus encouraging exploration and farming. weapons require base stats to equip and can be upgraded up to 25 times. armor do not have base stats to be equipped, however they weight a certain amount, and depending on your max load capacity, you might end up having restricted evasive maneuvers... aka fat rolls. health and mana can each be recovered via a flask which can be upgraded both in potency and in uses. stamina is a gauge that drains for every action, be it attacking, running, blocking, dodging, etc. it refills quickly over time but is one of those things that depicts how you fight and how you should lv your stats. when outside of combat, running doesn't drain your stamina, smart choice from the devs. as any other souls genre, playing online means that other players can invade your world to kill you, but this also means you can receive help. i'm no fan of this and imo, invaders usually just ended up wasting my time, especially since they tend to get dlc weapons and have the minimum stats to wield them to have an advantage. i found this a rather cheap strat, but it still was a 5050 winlose ratio. having said this, it does bring a little adrenaline from time to time. imo this was never a smart feature and doesn't bring anything to the genre except an annoying player who's likely to aggro mobs to help them on their quest to slow you down by... making you drop your runes. most of us have better things to do than this. bosses are where the souls series shine, they are either big, stupid big, hard, stupid hard or such pain in the ass that when you finally beat them, you feel like being released from death row, or rememberrealise that there is more to the game than this one boss. graphics on a quality level they are okay, however the game chooses an aesthetic that looks amazing. they play and balance colors in a way that makes every area look rather different, unique and memorable. but to be clear, there are older looking games that look better out there. audio it's good, but not amazing. slow speaking npcs and creepy music isn't enough for me to feel in awe. look, this is a cut and dry review because i've now played almost every souls game out there out of spite for the genre. i've never found them hard per se, just challenging for all the wrong reasons. if you want to convey a story, then just do it ffs. don't hide it behind hidden dialogues from random npcs. you want us to do a quest line? then just offer it, don't hide it in obscure chain of npc enounters that may or may not pop up during x period of the day. i've always found the from software games to be overly hyped and for this reason alone.... i'm gonna say... i'm really proud of them to have decided to change at least a single thing... it is now open world. yep, only real change from the others in the series. i still think bloodborne was better than this at least on its release date."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,plenty of bad guys to kill and mommies to serve.
