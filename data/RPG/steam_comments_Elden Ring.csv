"An amazing game and the first fromsoft title i've beaten.

not as difficult as others make it out to be, people act like this game is super hard 100% of the time but while it can challenging this game gives you a lot of room to explore and level your character so anytime you feel like a boss is too hard you can just go explore or do one of the many side quests available and then return once your strong enough.",True,44,0
"FYI- I finished the main game then I posted this review there is a lot of side content left

This is the most fun I ever had with a souls game its not super hard its not easy either... It took me 91 hours to beat the main story I did a lot of side stuff too.. I Think its a great entry point for someone who has never played a souls game before... This game guides you, humbles you and teaches you... The open world is beautiful and filled with Skyrim like dungeons with a boss waiting in the end.. I am gonna finish the side stuff now find awesome weapons and armour level them up and try different combinations  then i'll maybe get the expansion for the price its an amazing game YES! I would recommend it 9/10",True,74,5
"Oh boy, where do I even start with Elden Ring? Imagine a game where the devs were like, ""Let's make every blade of grass deadly."" You step into this gorgeous world, thinking, ""This looks like a chill spot for a picnic,"" only to realize the picnic's actually your wake.

The graphics? Chef's kiss. It's like you're inside a Van Gogh painting, but every stroke wants to off you. The landscapes are so stunning, you'll forget to breathe – until you fall off a cliff.

Combat in Elden Ring isn't about skill; it's about how many times you can bash your head against a wall before you get it right. Every boss fight feels like they've got a personal beef with you. They're just there to mock your sad attempts at living. (git gud)

The lore? Man, it's deep. So deep you'd need a submarine to get to the bottom of it. And just when you think you've got it, some NPC comes along with a backstory that could be its own book. Good luck figuring out the story; it's like doing a puzzle blindfolded.

But here's the thing: despite all the pain, the frustration, the ""I'm uninstalling this"" moments, you can't help but love it. There's something about Elden Ring that pulls you back, like a moth to a flame, or a player to their doom.

100/10 for me - would die over and over again. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a way of life. A life of pain, beauty, and the occasional scream into the abyss. If you want something that'll test your patience, your skill, and your swear-word collection, this is it.",True,110,29
"    游戏本体设计90%都非常好，首先是非常耐玩，和之前的线性地图区别很大，风景也比之前的作品更丰富；第二就是boss的招式设计也比之前的作品要丰富很多；第三，主线中的地图也是延续了之前作品的特点，剧情的设计也比较吸引人。
    游戏本体的缺点主要就是最后几张地图，圣树天空城灰烬王城，怪的数值有点偏高，如果是正常游玩主线的话等级一般不够，去打周边的副本也提不起来兴趣，因为洞窟地牢这些玩到后面重复性也有点高，还有“米凯拉的锋刃”玛莲妮亚这个boss，对纯翻滚实在太不友好，摸索他的攻击判定点都要打几十遍。另外就是怪有点读指令，而且比较明显，一眼就能看出来的那种，不过这个可能也不完全能算缺点，可能是增加难度的一种方式。
    DLC就只能说好的地方和不好的地方都很多，先说坏的地方，我是二周目进去DLC，首先就是怪的数值实在是过于离谱，只要不是最垃圾的小怪，是个怪都能三下打死我，boss就更不用说了，只要两下。
    另外就是探索奖励太低，根本就没有探索欲望，也没有那种人物属性成长的快感，第一个boss双月跟最后一个米塔恩都差不多数值，打我都是两下，除了攻击频率米塔恩高一些，但是也高不到哪去，适应了这种难度之后都差不多，我三天就通了DLC，因为他这种过高的数值还有低探索奖励就会让人想赶紧玩完完事，本体我是花了比较长的时间去体验，大约有75h，但即使是这样，后面我还是愿意花时间去做一些收集，但DLC肯定不会了。
    DLC还有个最大的问题，怪的读指令过于严重，比本体还要严重不少，而且属于是那种恶性读指令，比如你离他远远的按一下攻击键，他就会条件反射一样的做出翻滚或者后撤的动作，甚至你背对着他攻击一下都会这样，这一点在游戏设计上就太偷工减料了，就算要读指令也完全可以做成例如，三个技能，每次读指令的时候随机发动。因为这种重复的复读而导致的打不过会让人感觉非常气愤。
    DLC也有好的地方，例如地下墓地的地图设计就比本体还要好，还有就是不谈boss难度的话，演出效果做的非常好，另外就是对于这种高难度的boss，拼尽全力战胜他之后，得到的成就感跟简单一些的boss还是有点区别的，会比简单的boss要多一些。
    总体这个游戏满分10分能给到9分，扣分就在本体后期和DLC数值过高-0.5还有读指令-0.5，已经算接近完美的大作了。",True,29,14

"A World Like No Other
The Lands Between is Elden Ring’s crowning achievement. Unlike other open-world games that fill their maps with checklist-style activities, Elden Ring rewards true exploration. Every hilltop, ruin, and cave hides something mysterious—sometimes it’s a powerful weapon, sometimes a terrifying boss, or even an entire hidden city. The game never holds your hand, trusting players to carve their own path.

Combat: Brutal, Rewarding, and Deep
FromSoftware’s signature combat is here in full force, refined to perfection. Whether you’re a heavy-hitting Colossal Sword wielder, a dexterous katana master, or a spell-flinging sorcerer, Elden Ring offers more build variety than any Souls game before it. Every enemy encounter feels meaningful, and every boss fight is a spectacle—full of awe, terror, and satisfaction when you finally emerge victorious.

Storytelling & Lore: A Myth in Motion
Written in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, the lore of Elden Ring is dense, tragic, and utterly fascinating. It unfolds subtly, through cryptic item descriptions, NPC dialogue, and environmental storytelling. There are no forced cutscenes or expository dumps—just a world teeming with history, inviting the player to piece it together.

A Soundtrack That Elevates the Experience
The music in Elden Ring is nothing short of mesmerizing. Haunting choirs, bombastic orchestras, and eerie ambient tracks set the perfect mood for exploration and combat. Every boss has a theme that makes their fight feel like an event of mythic proportions.

Final Thoughts: A Timeless Legend
Rarely does a game come along that truly redefines its genre, but Elden Ring has done just that. It is challenging yet fair, vast yet focused, and deeply immersive in ways few games can match. It respects the player’s intelligence, offering freedom without sacrificing meaningful design.

It is not just one of the greatest games of its generation—it is a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.

"I genuinely don't think any other open world game (except Breath of the Wild) gave me anything close to the feelings I got when playing this game. An open world always felt like the natural progression from the semi-linear world of dark souls 1, and felt incredible to actually go through and explore. I can keep gushing about the art direction, the graphics, the smoothness of the gameplay, and just how wide your options really are in defining your own playstyle. 

However, there is 1 thing that really bothered me that I must say even though I love this game to death. On PC specifically, even with quality specs I ran into lots of frame drops (even worse in DLC areas) that made the experience occassionally less than enjoyable. Since so much of this game relies on being able to react and dodge attacks, having frame drops and stuttering at key moments in fights leads to situations where you getting hit is completely out of your hands. I do hope they step up their optimization for elden ring Nightreign, but as of now I don't see any further updates to fix the framerate issues on PC for this game, so if you have an old setup I would recommend against buying this due to poor optimization.

There's a lot of exploration, a very wide map, lots of characters and an epic story even though I had to look at the background story of each character on online forums, because what is explained in the game is not detailed.
I also missed some items because I took the wrong steps, and there was no way to get these items other than repeating the story again. actually it doesn't have much of an impact, because there are so many other builds that can still be used.
I am quite satisfied, overall this is a good game.

What I Loved 

Elden Ring looks incredible and is filled with a great amount of beautiful concepts. There are spiritual battle flags standing where massive battles once took place, mmm spiritual trees, spiritual spirits — you get it. The world of this game, despite sometimes feeling still and empty in certain aspects, gives you chills and makes you want to explore.

There are a few exploration caps that require fighting mighty foes to progress, and here lies the cornerstone of this game. Bosses are everywhere, and many of them are the same ones, just appearing in different locations or in a combination with others. They will make you die over and over again until you memorize their movesets and manage your timings almost perfectly. Unfortunately, in many cases, you'll feel happier that it's over rather than proud of your achievement.

Thankfully, Elden Ring offers ways to make things easier. You can explore its world to find better weapons and buffs or obtain summons — some of which can be received within the first 20 minutes of the game. You’ll still need to grind to stand a chance against certain bosses because, without good HP stats, you’ll be constantly one-shotted. If your strength and stamina are too low, you won’t be able to land effective hits in time to defeat a boss within a reasonable time. Eventually, you’ll find good farming spots, and I strongly recommend watching guides to locate them — especially if grinding bores you in other games. Otherwise, you risk burning out before experiencing some of the best and most entertaining parts of this world.

If you, like me, are new to this genre, you most likely will experience something incredible: a shift in mindset that will affect how you approach other games as well. Dying is the core of this game, and although it's sometimes incredibly frustrating, you will eventually learn to lower your expectations before each fight and accept death as a necessary part of the experience. In return, this will make you feel stronger — not because of your character's stats, but because of how much you’ve improved as a player. Your reaction time, adaptability, and skill in general will constantly increase, allowing you to perform well even if you start the game over.

What I Hated

As I mentioned, many bosses require a great amount of attempts to defeat, and some don’t have save points nearby. This means you’ll often have to run back through difficult areas, losing not only time but also valuable HP flasks. It’s time-consuming and frustrating.

Another complaint of mine is that the game barely teaches you anything. I read everything I could and explored every corner, yet after 70 hours, I still found myself confused about the story and how to progress through it. Many times, I stumbled upon the right location or NPC purely by accident. Some say that Elden Ring doesn’t hold your hand so you can experience it on your own, but I’d argue that it’s hard to be invested in the story when, by the time you reach the end, you barely remember where it all started. Many quests are easy to complete unintentionally, and there’s no quest journal - only a few of them even have map markers. There are some general routes to follow, but that doesn’t guarantee you won’t struggle with understanding what to do. I certainly did.

Because of this, while other games often make exploration feel unnecessary by giving you all the information right away, Elden Ring goes to the opposite extreme, offering almost no guidance. This leads to a lack of investment in both the side and main stories.

Final Thoughts

I love and hate this game. It sometimes throws frustrating design choices at you, but it also offers a unique experience — a hostile unforgiving sandbox where you often decide whether to fight or run away. While dying is the core Elden Ring, exploration is also its essence. I don’t think it’s the best game ever, as some claim — there are many flaws — but there is beauty in suffering, in learning through trial and error, and in in eventually overcoming your struggles.

I highly recommend at least trying this game, even if you’ve never played anything like it before. It will likely change how you perceive failing — not just in gaming, but maybe even in life.",True,4,0
"Actually my first Fromsoft, or even soulslike title. Came from growing up with DOOM, Quake, Ratchet and Clank, etc, but eventually just phased out of enjoying games in my early 20s. Picked up this game after hearing about the difficulty on the ps4, and absolutely fell in love, just like I did when I was younger. It's a challenging, but fair, and Fromsoft makes beautiful, detailed games you can immerse in for months honestly. Most of the player base, minus that one group we all know, is super helpful, and kind as hell from my experience. Been my ps4, and steam accounts, I have at least 500 or so hours combined. I even went on to get a nice amount of love, and time in DS1, DS3, and Bloodborne. If you love a challenge, this game is perfect, along with all other Fromsoft titles. Just get used to watching everyone you protect die regardless lol.",True,2,0
Without a doubt my number 1 favorite souls-borne game. The world building was impeccable as with any other souls-borne game but Elden ring has the addition of being absolutely gorgeous.

"Elden Ring definitely has a bit of a learning curve to get past. But ultimately a fun and rewarding experience. Coming straight out of Dark Souls 1 I was already used to certain mechanics, but the dodge timing and parrying was definitely challenging in the begging due to this game's fast paced combat with some of the enemies inflicting passive damage debuffs. It's not for everyone to say the least. 

One thing I wish this game had though that should be incorporated to more games with character customisation style mechanics is the ability to ""transmog"" armour sets or at the very least offer more options to alter all armour pieces. The altering mechanic is pretty useless in my opinion given the fact that 9/10 times it's just removing a cape, or a piece of cloth on a chest piece, or head, etc. and inevitably lowering stats as a result. The limitations of such a mechanic can be pretty frustrating also, since it's only a very small handful of chest and head armour that can be potentially altered. 

The combat becomes increasingly difficult in some scenarios forcing you to think carefully and outside the box on how to approach it, which makes for an exciting and rewarding experience when you do figure it out eventually. Death becomes a natural learning tool as it has for many ""Souls like"" game in the past. Ultimately a fantastic game throughout. Much like Sekiro, I'd highly recommend this game if you're up for a challenge.",True,1,0
"A nearly perfect game in many ways, and a world you will never forget. Ride through misty forests and dank swamps, explore castles and ancient ruins, and face foes out of your worst nightmares. The lore and story of this world are not spoon-fed to you, and it can be esoteric and strange at first glance, but it will open itself to any player who is willing to look for the details. Once you invest yourself into this experience, it will take over your gaming life for a very very long time.

The challenge in this game is top notch, and will test your abilities in many ways. Most encounters can be changed to make them more or less challenging, depending on how much you want to push yourself. Hundreds of different weapons and dozens of movesets are available, from small daggers to huge warhammers and everything in between (you can even do a hand-to-hand martial arts combat style if you'd like, with the DLC). And for those who appreciate armor and ""fashion-souls"", there are an overwhelming number of armor sets you can mix and match to customize your looks and stats.   

The multiplayer experience takes a few different forms ... you can join friends to go on quests together, invade other players to challenge and ambush them, or go to specialized arenas to match up in fights and tournaments. Some of the match-making for online play can be a little janky from time to time, but overall it's accessible for pretty much every play style.

I love this game ive made and completed over 14 characters and am currently working on my newest one this is the most welcoming souls game in the series if your wondering which one to start with I seriously recommend this game.,True,0,0
"I don't know where to start, this is just one of the most beautiful, immersive, and intriguing open world RPGs I've ever experienced. I'm 122 hours into it and feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

The game puts more emphasis on exploration than hand holding with quest markers. It's very modern feeling, but also old school in the game's esoteric structure. It feels very similar to Shadow of the Colossus in it's cryptic approach to progression and story telling, but the world is much more dense. It's something you'll just have to experience to appreciate.

This is the first FromSoft game that I've ever played, and it definitely won't be my last. If you're looking to spend hours and hours getting lost in a incredibly crafted open world, look no further. So far it's a perfect 10/10, but I'll update my review if it falls off at some point. Alright, off to become Elden Lord!",True,0,0

"It has been almost three years since this games released on 2/25/2022 and I still find myself playing it. From-software should be commended for how they always make their ""Souls"" games extremely re-playable. I think it is because they make their games really fun to slowly learn and explore on first playthrough but then really accessible on repeat playthroughs.

Even though some may argue that Elden Ring is the least re-playable game by From-software because of the sheer size of the open world and the tendency for repeat bosses (aka Erdtree avatar but red this time), I would raise a counterpoint that BECAUSE of this game is made like that I rarely feel the need to fight everything or go everywhere. The player can tackle the game in a variety of ways and at different paces. The developers also found a really good balance of when the player will fight repetitive enemies and mini-bosses versus when they will fight grand super-bosses like the god-like Shardbearers. 

Also, the sheer variety of spells and weapon types in this game is stellar and this is even true within a single build/character let alone across multiple characters.",True,0,0
"Elden Ring is an enjoyable action and adventure game with an interesting story, memorable characters, and unique challenges to overcome, all set in a breathtaking open-world environment. It is one of the few games I have finished and the only one for which I earned a platinum achievement. I would highly recommend it!",True,0,0
"From the moment I launched Elden Ring on my PC, I knew I was in for something truly special. This game has exceeded every expectation, blending stunning visuals, a vast, intricately designed world, and engaging combat in a way that few games can match.

The open world in Elden Ring is unlike anything I’ve experienced before. The environments are beautiful and varied, from eerie forests and sprawling castles to desolate, haunting plains. Each area is full of hidden secrets, tough enemies, and rewarding exploration. The map is massive, and there’s always something new to discover, which kept me engaged for hours on end.

The combat system is challenging but rewarding, staying true to FromSoftware’s legacy while offering new mechanics to keep things fresh. The variety of weapons, magic, and abilities allows for deep customization of playstyle, and every encounter feels meaningful. Boss fights are intense, with each one offering a unique challenge that keeps you on your toes.

The narrative is intriguing and mysterious, and while it doesn’t hand-feed you the story, it’s all the more satisfying to piece together the lore as you explore. The NPC interactions and side quests are well-crafted, making the world feel alive and rich with history.

Performance on PC has been smooth, with great optimization, even on mid-range hardware. The game looks gorgeous, and the sound design perfectly complements the atmosphere, enhancing every moment of tension or triumph.

Overall, Elden Ring is a stunning achievement in game design. It’s a must-play for fans of the Soulsborne games, as well as anyone who enjoys expansive worlds and deep, rewarding gameplay. FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves, and this is easily one of the best games of the decade. Highly recommended!

After a while i started to get in to the rythm of the game and began to understood what the game is about . It absolutely hooked me and it wouldn`t let go . The exploration is top tier in this game. Every time you try to explore, the game rewards you and every time you take a risk the game rewards you even more. The game is hard , I died like a 1000 times across my playthrough, which took me just shy of 90 hours. The bosses are top tiers also. The game is a masterpiece in my eyes and the only thing it could do better is to introduce new players in to the genre a bit more gently. 9.5/10",True,0,0
"
In terms of gameplay mechanics and sheer scale/ ambition this is certainly the greatest of the Souls series, but for me I wouldn't call it the best in the series due to several clear shortcomings; and I can see why Miyazaki-san aren't fully satisfied with it. The open world is too bloated in parts, some repetitive/ derivative and frustrating designs, bland music, weak overall narrative/ story telling and some wasted characters.
 
Overall though, Elden Ring was a fantastic game. Not a surprise many people consider this one of the greatest games ever made, and I honestly I sort of agree with them. Like with Dark Souls, the massive success of this game has definitely elevated Fromsoft's reputation to the next level.

The story is immersive, with deep lore scattered throughout the environment.

"I recently immersed myself in Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, and I can confidently say it has captivated me like no other FromSoftware title before. In my opinion, it’s one of the best games ever made. While I’ve always appreciated FromSoftware’s work, I never delved too deeply into their previous titles until now.

The world of the Lands Between is jaw-dropping, with meticulously crafted environments that encourage exploration and discovery. Each area is filled with hidden secrets, making every moment feel rewarding.

The combat mechanics are fluid and diverse, allowing for various playstyles. Personally, I opted for an arcane dexterity build, which has been incredibly satisfying. The introduction of the jump mechanic and mounted combat adds fresh tactics to encounters.

What sets Elden Ring apart is its deep lore, seamlessly woven into the environment. I found myself engrossed in the narrative, eager to learn more about the characters and their stories.

While I'm still on my first playthrough and haven’t touched New Game Plus or fully completed the DLC yet, I’m excited to explore more. If you enjoy exploration, rich lore, and challenging gameplay, I highly recommend Elden Ring and its expansion. They’ve truly become modern classics in the action RPG genre. I give it a solid 5/5 Erdtree Blossoms.

"This is the closest I have ever seen to perfect.

From has once again redefined what an open-world action RPG can be. Elden Ring was already a masterpiece, yet Shadow of the Erdtree takes that foundation and elevates it to new heights, delivering an experience that is nothing short of breathtaking.

Every inch of this world is crafted with meticulous detail, from the hauntingly beautiful landscapes to the brutal boss design. The new map introduced in Shadow of the Erdtree has some of the most visually striking and mechanically engaging areas From has ever created.

The combat remains flawless—challenging, rewarding, and endlessly customizable. The new weapons, spells, and gear breathe fresh life into an already deep combat system. Elden Ring and its expansion provide an experience that adapts to your playstyle and pushes you to master its intricacies.

The storytelling—both environmental and direct—is masterful. Cryptic yet resonant, the lore of the Lands Between and the tragic figures within it are as captivating as ever. The expansion deepens the already intricate narrative, introducing new mysteries and revelations that will keep us theorizing for years.

Simply put, Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree are a triumph of game design. They represent the pinnacle of what an open-world game should be: an experience that respects the player's intelligence, rewards curiosity, and offers an unparalleled sense of adventure.

If you haven't played Elden Ring, there's never been a better time. And if you have, Shadow of the Erdtree will remind you why this world is worth losing yourself in all over again.

It's a game I have found is great to play at your own pace, explore, fight, and when you're ready go after that boss!

Sound is well made aswell and there are some places which I think a tremendously good regarding the atmosphere. Definitly a 10/10 game, you might could go 9/10 because the story is a freaking mess and sucks.

Maaaaan.... when it comes down to the story.... I'am 42h into the game and most of the time i have no idea why am I doing what I'm doing. Yes I want to be elden lord. But I have no idea why and how this all started. To me this game has no story. The world feels like a dead place and somehow you are the one trying fight yourself through the dead land. There is basically only a few people alive randomly placed in the world who are not trying to kill you. No village, no farms where people trying to stay alive, just a dead empty land. And most of them cleary have deep depressions and should visite a therapist.

To me this story is the most empty/soulless game i have played so far. 99% of the time I just run around clueless to discover places and try to find the mainbosses. 

If you look for a good story and introduction with the difficulty of Elden Ring, I would recommend ""Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order"" instead. There you have a proper intro, cinematics, and a freaking reason why you do what you do and why you go to whatever places. If you want to checkmark one of the most popular games in the world to have fun talks with friends - then have fun with this.

It's very different from DS, as the open world kind of fight a bit against what I normally would do there.

In DS I found nice to make new characters and test new builds, as once you know what to do it's fairly easy to finish the game from beginning to end. This was extremely true for og DS, less true for DS2 and again relatively true for DS3.

Instead in Elden ring everything is scattered around, there is a lot of repetition that normally in DS you wouldn't see so it gets a bit more tiring running again with a new character.

But again, the world is very vast and finish the game is going to take a while anyway, so there is that :)

Pros:
Fun open world with lots to explore, ton's of secrets 
an immersive story if you want to excavate it! 
Decent amount of build types

Cons: 
Every boss has a 1 hit kill combo - So if you don't co-op you better git gud! If that's not your idea of fun this game isn't for you! 
Re-skinned enemies // bosses // areas - big world but be prepared to see the same thing over and over
1000 useless craftable Items!
No cohesion for NPC stories - they're just kind of everywhere and you're expected to cross the map over and over again to find them all
Most fun items/armour are locked into late game 30+ hr

"Elden Ring is rightfully showered with praise and considered a masterpiece for good reason. Elden Ring is so good, in fact, that upon reaching Radahn I decided to go back to the earlier souls games and experience those before continuing. It's not perfect, however.

Rather than join the choir of those singing it's praises, I'll point out some shortcomings that you may or may not be aware of.

Elden Ring is like walking into a sweet shop of different weapons and fun goodies to choose from except for some reason the rigid upgrade system and respec roadblocks make it as difficult as possible to actually experiment with all of this without mods. Elden Ring feels like it actively punishes experimentation rather than reward it. This, for me, is easily the biggest frustration with the game, and it's something that was an issue in the Dark Souls trilogy, too.

The co-op system sucks, but this is entirely fixed with a simple to install mod. I have no idea why FromSoft has not just implemented this themselves. You may also need to install another mod to increase the difficulty of Co-op since having two players can make the game much easier.

To get an FPS above 60, you once again need to install a mod. 

A lot of bosses will come up repeatedly which can get a little boring after a while. This can be forgiven given the scale of the game, but you do end up rolling your eyes a bit when you see yet another Crucible Knight (I've seen three by the time I get to Radahn).

Put simply, to get the most out of Elden Ring i would highly suggest tweaking the experience slightly to get over some of these shortcomings. If you're willing to put in a little work, it will pay off.",True,0,0

I just finished it, I never played a From Soft before except Sekiro.
I don't have the words to begin to describe all the feelings that it gave my during this unique adventure.
It reconciled me with solo games, open worlds, exploration.
This game lit back the flame of my dying passion for gaming that has been slowly tarnished over the years because of bad experiences, too many multiplayer and adulthood.
If you ever sat in front of you PC looking at your hundreds of games library  you never played without any desire to play any. Nostalgic of your childhood gaming memories when it was simpler less overwhelming when gaming bringed you true joy and excitement.
That´s what this game did to me. It gave me back my childhood like memory of the wonders and magic of gaming at this time. Wanting to explore, go further push my limits, understand the game and this mechanics to get better and the reward of progressing in a new world.

But now that it is almost over (I fortunately still have the DLC to do) I can't shake the feeling that I will never be able to experience this ever again for the first time.

"Gameplay is amazing and is why you should get this.

Storytelling is horrendous and anyone saying otherwise is insane. Without searching things on the internet you could easily miss ~30% of the games content because of how terrible it is at instructing you what to do (because it doesn't).

For example, in a fairly hard to reach underground area, you find a doll. You are supposed to somehow know that you're supposed to rest at a specific site of grace, try to talk to the doll not once, not twice, but thrice, then it will talk back and tell you to kill an enemy that is somewhere in the region. After killing it, if drops a key and it doesn't tell you what it's for. You're supposed to know that it's to open a chest that's in the room of a boss you probably killed 30 hours ago. This chest gives you an item that opens a path for blocked area in a far away boss room. This path brings you to a part of the map, representing probably 5-10% of the total Elden Rings map surface area, for you to explore.

"A masterpiece on its own. This is my first souls game and I truly enjoy every second of it. 

Gameplay is amazing. I enjoyed every boss fight (not you, Valiant Gargoyle Duo, you won't be missed). There are tons of awesome builds and character customization.

What I enjoyed is that the game is very minimal when it comes to guiding and giving hints to the players. You are left to explore and discover things on your own. There are tons of side contents that are easily missable

Visual and aesthetic is very on point and captures the atmosphere of the whole story line really well.

The lore is very deep and well-written. The characters and the world-building are very unique and have a interesting background.

If this is your first souls game, I would definitely recommend Elden Ring as a starting point.",True,0,0

"Easily one of the best games of this decade. 

I loved every bit of The Elden Ring, since I have been a souls fan for years. 

Everything that miyazaki wanted to do with Dark Souls he did put it inside The Elden Ring. 

Amazing mechanics, massive confusing world but also very beautiful. Story was good but it could be better, but let's be honest it wasn't about story but the gameplay and becoming GUD. Every main boss is unique and hard to fight. A lot of enemies are also super annoying but this game makes it worthwhile, once you finish it and make it until the end then I hope you understand. 

Get the expansion too, the challenge rises once you're gonna fight the enemies in the expansion and it gives you extra 30 hours of the game. That is if you take your time with it. 

Get it on sale for sure or right now.",True,0,0
"while fromsoftware has earned a reputation for releasing difficult games, elden ring stands out for its relative accessibility. overall, it’s definitely one of the more welcoming titles in fromsoftware's catalog. for example, the generous checkpointing system cuts down on the tedious boss runbacks that plagued earlier fromsoftware games, making progression much smoother. its open-world design also means there are fewer rigid roadblocks, enabling players to explore freely and tackle challenges at their own pace. while the boss fights can be tough, the satisfaction of victory makes them all the more rewarding. overcoming challenges is a huge part of what makes soulslike games so compelling, and elden ring strikes a careful balance between punishing difficulty and fair progression, ensuring that players feel challenged without getting hopelessly stuck.

so, if you're looking for a (RELATIVELY) gentle introduction into the genre, elden ring is absolutely worth your time! and if you're already a soulslike fan... well, you already know this is a must-play",True,0,0

"Such a great and beautiful piece of art. This game is so fire and unique I’ve been wanting to play this game for a wild but was too lazy to get the game. I also really dislike open world games, but when one of my friends called and asked me to get the game (cause we were going to play multiplayer) I was skeptical but I still did. The first 4 hours were pretty boring and I thought I wasn’t going to like the game but after grinding and beating the beginner bosses the game just changed. The game isn’t just an open world it’s an adventure that you will see and never forget. When fighting a boss and you lose over and over but when you actually kill the boss you just have this type of surge in your body that just makes you feel happy. All the bosses have different types of moves and abilities that just make the game more fun! My favorite boss is probably fire giant cause his abilities were cool but made me kinda pissed.

I absolutely love this game and I wish I had realized that sooner. I've owned the game for about two years but really only have played it in these past few months.

So after almost a full two years later I was inspired to get back on the game with  the announcement of Nightreign. And boy that was the best decision of my life.

I total recommend this game if you have the time and patience.,True,0,0
"What can I say about this game?

It's simply CINEMA!

It perfected all the elements of the previous games, getting the strong points right and fixing the mistakes that already existed. I believe that the addition of the Torrent and the jumping mechanics have greatly influenced the gameplay style of the game. In terms of additions, we can talk about the game's new facilitators, the summons and the war ashes, which I believe have helped a lot with the discussion about soulslike having an easy mode, so much so that a large part of the game's new fan base came about because of this addition of facilitators, showing that everyone can and should play games like this.
The artwork is wonderful, and the soundtrack as impeccable as ever, really conveying the feeling of the bosses and the new areas, which, by the way, are very different from most soulslike games.

The level design remains as immersive and detailed as ever, with the addition of new challenges, the dungeons, which create a good immersion with the game and help the player level up and upgrade very well. Another addition is the grace indicator on top of the bonfires, which helps the player's exploration a lot, even though the presence of Tervore already serves as a guide throughout the game.

The special thing about the game is that the Bosses, from start to finish, whether primary or secondary, are all incredible, both in cutscenes (when they exist) and in movesets, favorites aside, but Bosses like Maliketh and General Radahn totally steal the show and are much more striking than the final Boss himself, for example.
Finally, I got to play the DLC, not completely, defeating Mesmer and then taking a break, and I have to say that it's really very good, it's a bit expensive, but if you fell in love with the base game, you'll definitely like this expansion!

Just play it!",True,0,0
"Fantastic stuff!
Elden Ring fixes the 1 thing that I could never defend in their other games : the damn walk back. 
Respawn points are all across the map and even if you get walled by a boss you can keep trying without spending 5 or more minutes just getting back to it.
Cool soundtrack and a absolutely stunning map full of stuff to explore and see
If you like your virtual dress up there's a ton of fantastic looking sets of armor and clothing and the ashes of war are a really fun system for customizing the weapons you have a preference for

"Never played a Souls like game after the original Dark Souls, which I never finished. I fell in love with this game, with its world, with its storytelling, with the sense of exploration, but most of all, what I love is how this game teaches you to think. Not every enemy in sight needs to be killed, what matters is how to achieve your objective. How to find paths, weaknesses, when to fight, how to fight, and when to come back later, stronger, with a different weapon, different items or summons, all rewards for natural exploration.

It isn't perfect, it reuses some themes and dungeons a lot (such as imp-filled catacombs), though they often come with a twist. Bosses are also recycled, again, with a twist, but recycled nonetheless. It feels as if its ambitions overstretched its resources, and there was not enough time and money to do it 100% justice. But they did it 90% justice, and that 90% is absolutely worth every hour, every death, every ragequit. It rewards you like few other games, both in terms of lore and worldbuilging, and with that sweet rush of figuring out a harsh boss or how to get through a tough area. Build diversity is immense, and replayability is substantial.

Highly recommend, 9/10",True,0,0

"Probably my favorite game. The atmosphere and lore of the game is top notch. The gameplay is fun and exciting. If you are a Dark Souls it should feel familiar, but there were definitley some upgrades. The most notable one is the the array of spells and ecantations. Another notable difference is the multiplayer in the game. Though I still recommend the seamless co-op mod, you can mostly get by with the base multiplayer functions in the game. Also, a feature that is unique to Elden Ring is the plethora of dungeons that you get to adventure through while going through the map

There is so much to say about this game. For me it feels like skyrim and dark souls had a love child. It was the perfect balance of exploration for adventurer-type gamers, and hard-hitting action packed fights for sweaty gamers looking for an actual challenge.  Whether you are a souls veteran or a newcomer trying to start out in the sub-genre, I can vehemently recommend this game for anyone and everyone who wants a fun fantasy game to play.

I was new to Fromsoft when this came out, I got caught up in the hype and decided to give it a shot. I was SO BAD for the first 30 hours, but holy crap this is a damn fine game.

"Elden Ring is the kind of game I just never wanted to play. What's the point of playing these insanely hard games that do nothing but beat you down over and over again? There has to be something about these games that is satisfying and enjoyable in them right? 

Theses are just a few of the questions I asked myself when I originally bought this game on Xbox. And boy did I ever find the answers to the questions. 

What I find most enjoyable about Elden Ring is the freedom it gives to let you play how you want. Sure that's an easy answer but its also true. This game challenges you to be better than you were before. It wants you to overcome the things you struggle to do. And once I played and beat my first ever soulsbourne boss, it clicked. No other game has given me the satisfaction of beating what lied ahead of me. it made sense as to why I see people struggle for hours to beat this game (my hours don't reflect my first ever play through). 

If FromSoft games seem intimidating its because they are. It isn't easy. But once you beat the first boss, nothing and I mean nothing, can stop you from continuing on and beating the game.

"I liked the gameplay.

I did not like the hassle of having to set up CRU to make Freesync Premium, HDR and AFMF play the game at 120hz on my TCLQ750 television.  In the end, I have been able to get it to work over HDMI 2.1 with Freesync, VRR, HDR10, HGIG and Dolby Vision, with this television.  It has a few issues with HDR; I have to patch it through to the TV directly and mess with a ton of EDID settings. And then it only runs well at 1440p with frame generation.  

I have made 120hz work WITHOUT the Elden Ring FPS unlocker, and 240hz work WITH the FPS unlocker. 4k over HDMI 2.1 seems to trigger the anti cheat even offline, and things like Hoarfrost stomp seem to stop rendering almost entirely.  Possibly because TMDS is too fast over HDMI 2.1.  I can get the game to work with Windows set to 8 and 10 bit colors, both RGB and YbCbR, but cannot confirm what color bitrate or colorimetry settings the game itself uses.

CRU custom EDIDs allow for the HDR in game to actually report to the television which is nice, and custom EDIDs are probably mandatory for 120hz frame gen with HDR anyways.  My TV supports both VRR and Freesync which is frustrating, and I am not sure Freesync itself is compatible entirely with HDMI 2.1, nor the game. There are loads of contrasting features that can go wrong and the entire system becomes more sensitive than scientific machinery, BUT, when it is working the HDR looks spectacular, especially at 1440p with frame generation. AFMF simply doubles the frames steam spits out, but the reporting back from the television to the game may be what is causing issues. 

Not that it NEEDS a 120hz solution, but at 1440p it is nice when my 1% lows are above 60fps, or even 120fps with the frame unlocker.  You literally have to hack the game for each different scene, and adjust colors for everything gaming on these TVs, and on top of that this television is barely functional compared to an LG television with secret HDR menus. 

Great game, and I wish I could play this online, but with how difficult it is to get HDR to work correctly in Windows, with its SDR to HDR scaling in Windows 11, or just plain not 100% functional in Windows 10 (which is much better to work with imo) due to colorimetry and shit having 8-way switches for every setting under the sun, I think it needs more attention from developers or maybe a multi-gpu solution or reshade to keep it stable at default 60fps settings everywhere.

"Having played over 500 hours on ps4 and now played over 70 hours on PC, I guess I recommend this game to others. This is a once of a lifetime gaming experience that I have ever had the pleasure of going through and my favourite game of all time as of its' release. I could write an entire essay about EVERYTHING that I liked about this Fromsoftwares' Magnum Opus, but I will try to keep it simple. Besides I doubt I can do it justice, unlike people who have made hour long videos explaining why it's so great.
From the world to the music, art, lore, bosses, environments is simply superb. If this is your first souls game, enjoy this religious experience, as I wish I could re-live it again back in 2022. Please do not spoil yourself. Have a fun ~160 hour journey through The Lands Between and become The Elden Lord.
PS - if you have a ps5, play the ps4 version on it for a steady 60fps. For this type of game you really need a stable framerate. Unfortunately, the PC version still has quite a few frame drops in wide shot places.

"So this is my second fromsoft game, the first being dark souls 1, & while this is no DS1, it's still overall a very fun experience for the most part. I know Lordran like the back of my hand, but especially considering just how large the lands between are, I've no interest in learning this game to the same degree. There are so many caves and catacombs that, while all a fun individual experience, the design for most of them don't stand out enough to make them very memorable. The story also is also something where I feel like it's lacking compared to their previous efforts. I feel like I have a very good grasp on the lore, world, etc of DS1. The game provides a lot of information about these things from cutscenes, npc dialogue, the flavor text in item descriptions, & even just the layout of lordran itself that paint the broad strokes of the history of the world & you can get really invested in this lore, creating theories and headcanons to flesh stuff out between the lines, & I assume Elden Ring is roughly going for the same approach, but I still have so many things I don't really understand yet, but I admit that this could be a skill issue on my part. I don't really get the motivation of the Tarnished. Like, yeag, the elden ring was shattered but, so what? Why does that matter? Like, the fire in the kiln of the first flame going out has consequences for its world & the people that live w/in it. As the chosen undead, you stand at an important point in history: will you succeed gwyn & continue the age of fire, which is realistically just buying time for the status quo to keep being upheld until the flame dims again & another person will take your place; or do you start the age of dark: where humans are the ones w/ power like the gods before them & the dragons before them. But what are the stakes in elden ring? why does it matter that godwyn was killed in the night of black knives? I understand what grafting is since we literally see godrick do it in his second phase cutscene, but like, how does he have that power? Is it just something gods or demigods can do? But like, why? Just to invoke some of the body horror of bloodborne? Why does the fire giant cutting off his leg activate the second face that's on his chest and make him more powerful? Marika is married to godfrey, the first elden lord, but then gets married to radagon instead but also she's radagon, and somehow radagon and marika despite being the same person but w/ exact oppostie goals, ideals, etc, give birth to miquella who is also st trina, and malenia & others, or w/e & I realize this sentence isn't really going anywhere but neither does elden ring. At least based on only 1 playthrough, the story feels like an excuse to just have something, anything, so that there's a world that can check off the requirements for the same game design that fromsoft has been doing for over a decade. & yet, I""m okay w/ that. The fromsoft formula is mostly fun & that is still true in elden ring. I had a lot of fun feeling my character grow stronger & fight the cool bosses (except for fire giant & elden beast, which I loathed on my first playthrough. boring ass fights that also take forever bc of way too large health pools). Did I need to fight some of the same bosses copy & pasted but w/ damage & health numbers adjusted to make them harder later into the game? No, but this isn't an issue unique to elden ring. For example, that's like, bethesda's entire game design philosophy for fallout & elder scrolls. Overall: fromsoft made a big open world game that has the usual flaws of big open word games. If you like big open world games &/or games in the nebulous genre that is soulsbourne games, you'll prolly like this one. I know I do.",True,0,0

"I genuinely love how many QoL changes that FromSoft made with this game compared to previous Soulsborne games in the franchise.
It initially felt weird being able to jump for the first time, but I quickly got used to that. Also, I highly appreciate the stamina drain being disabled if you're not in-combat and you're just exploring the Lands Between. The crafting system's neat as well, and it can come in a pinch if you need to make anything like consumables or arrows. A lot of the weapons are really interesting too, and I personally like to run a dual Uchigatana build with the Reduvia as a backup for my first/main build.
As of writing this, I'm not too far into the game's story (only about mid-game), but it's been a ton of fun and I'm enjoying every second; save from a few times where I got my ass beat by some specific bosses, however that's primarily because I suffer from skill issue.
I know I've likely left out a bunch of key details on why I like this game, but these are just some of the ones I thought of highlighting.

Overall, I personally would give Elden Ring a 9/10.",True,0,0
"My only tiny complaint is the following: Spirits trivialise 99% of the bosses, making the game really easy (Black Knife Tiche is better than like 99% of the players. Mimic Tear is broken with some builds, and even stuff like Wolf Spirits which you have from the start make some fights 80% easier) In fact, for someone who stepped into this universe with Dark Souls 3, playing it and beating it all the way to NG+7 fully offline, Elden Ring is in mostly a walk in the park (Melania was so fun though, I wish more bosses were like her), and with spirits it is even easier. I just wish it was a bit more challenging, and I do not simply mean boosting the HP and DMG of enemies.

Otherwise the game is a masterpiece, really enjoyed it, even though half of the lore was completely unknown to me. Can not wait to watch all the Videos about ti though hehe",True,0,0

"It's a really good game. The boss fights are challenging, but once you get used to the way the game plays they feel reasonably fair (most of the time). The level design is excellent as always. The world is fun to explore with lots of things hidden in all the nooks and crannies. The endgame gets a little repetitive, without many new enemies in the very, very late areas, but I don't think that's a deal-breaker (it still far surpasses the later areas in Dark Souls 1, in my opinion).
The game also plays very differently from previous From Software titles (i.e. Dark Souls 3). The ""stance"" mechanic rewards you for using a mixture of attack types instead of just spamming light attacks. It adds a whole additional layer of strategy to the combat, which I really enjoy. That said, I do think there's a steep learning curve here, and the game could do more to teach the player about this brand new mechanic. The inner-workings of the mechanic are hidden from the player's view, so it can be difficult to know how to use it at first.
That said, it's still an excellent game. Although not my favorite thing that From Software has made (Sekiro and Armored Core 6 rank higher for me, personally), it's still well worth playing. Strongly recommend.",True,0,0

This actually in turn makes it more fun to explore more and enjoy the scenery and graphics since it's an open world. Honestly Elden Ring in a nutshell is - Fight die repeat. Choosing a specific class at the start does not restrict the playthrough as the stats can be played around with to explore different builds and be creative with boss fights and dungeons. Summoning players to help with dungeons made the game easier and enjoyable. In the end, the grind never stops :) Eat, sleep, Be Tarnished & repeat",True,0,0

"The game runs better on console, but with a decent PC it runs well enough. Although I've only played 31 hours at the making of this comment, I've actually played well over 200 hours on console in addition to this. The replayability is great, with a great selection of viable builds. The open world can be a little annoying to ride through if you have a specific destination in mind, but if you're simply exploring, it's great. The world is packed to the brim with ruins, camps, churches, villages, catacombs, caves, forts, castles, and other weird but fun phenomena. However, the game also hides a lot of things away, which is both good and bad. On one hand, if you find those hidden spots, it's cool to go in and explore and find a new weapon or cool armor. On the other hand, it's mildly irritating when you look up a tutorial and realize that there was a whole area that you never found because you had to jump across half a dozen ledges that looked like they were not meant to be jumped on. My only other complaint would be a few bosses-specifically, Margit and Morgott, and the Fire Giant. These bosses are all cool, but they all have one or two attacks that make it more of a roll of the dice to see whether you die than something based off of your skills.",True,0,0

This game is buggy af. Its fantastic in all respects but for some reason the easy anticheat software breaks my game if I am online and every time my graphics drivers update its so much trouble shooting just to play it full screen. I'm not going to give it the big meat sucky sucky because quite frankly after a hundred hours of playing the amount of bullshit just to get it to run correctly on a pc that has no problem running any AAA title makes this a 7 out of 10. I can't in good conscience say its better than that if I have to manually adjust settings that should just register on boot up.,True,0,0
"I think the game is great. Things I would personally like changed are the ridiculous sizes of many of the weapons and to bring their size scale down a lot so I could have some fun with them (I am more into how things look and feel versus power and effectiveness in games). I also would like to see the game just go full on with a scaling system when leveling up to maintain challenge throughout or some kind of hardcore mode right at the start. I spent many hours modding the difficulty level of the game myself, and it is a complex thing to tune properly.",True,0,0

With concern about the difficulty, this game exceeded my expectations and even fell in love with it!

It's a experience one in a lifetime, compared to other games nowadays it really is a breath of fresh air.
With its amazing story and beautiful world, this game is created with perection.

The first thing you see when you step into the world is the beauty of the enviorments, stunning colorful visuals and outstanding sights.
Other standout thing is the soundtrack of the battles that plays during some of the fights, is it either intense and dramatic or slow melancholic sound that match the feeling.
Speaking of bosses they were breathtaking, with variety of different creatures like monsters, imps, dragons and etc., challenging to this point where you enjoy it.

The exploration is ginormous, after every time you feel that you got to the end, you realize how further you can actually go on.

This game is an experience!  The challenge is real, but the sense of accomplishment that comes after that is incredibly satisfying.

I beat the story for about 60 hrs, but even after that there is somewhere to go for another 20-30 hrs maybe.

But in all honesty, this game is the pinnacle of action RPG's in so many ways, and I've only barely scratched the surface of what seems to be a rather large scale endeavor. The game world and lore is weird and unique enough to certainly be memorable (their fascination with fingers cracks me up).

The graphics are great enough to give you plenty of ""Whoa"" moments. Ray Tracing and HDR technologies are done well here. It also ran perfectly well on my non-RT GTX1070 and looked just fine on my non-HDR display.

Great sounds. Epic orchestral scores for music. Top Quality here with the audio.

Anyone put off by the difficulty, don't be, there are many ways to play and finding a playstyle that you like will make the game less difficult and more enjoyable.

First souls game I've played and I know any game I play after this will never live up to my first playthrough.

"My very first souls game. I had friends try to introduce me to the previous titles, specifically Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. I only played with friends and never gave them a fair chance on my own. I, like many people, had the biased belief that these games were unnecessarily difficult and I didn't think I'd enjoy the worlds. Elden Ring proved me very wrong. 

The gameplay can be difficult but it is absolutely necessary. It is simply a challenge, and they give you many tools and methods to get over said challenge. Trial and error. The world and lore/story is beautiful and wonderful to explore and learn about. Many people say Elden Ring does not have a story, and I find that wildly insane. It has a very rich and engaging story, it's just told to you in a different way. It's easy to ignore the details and just try and run quickly through areas, but really taking a moment and analyzing the sounds and your surroundings can tell you so much about the area you're in and the people that inhabited it. But so much of the plot I feel is told directly to you. The dialogue can be confusing since they use almost a Shakespearean type dialogue. But I feel like it's pretty easy to figure out what they mean, and there's always google. 

I get how people don't like how co-op and PVP is integrated. It does take a lot of extra steps that other games stream line. Personally I think the extra steps are cool, because it applies lore reasons to how/why this is possible. But at the same time, that cool factor diminishes frequentlly. My same criticism applies for how you respec your character. Having a finite amount of the item required to respec is kinda silly. I get why they do it, but it was kind of a headache to go find all of them just so I could try this really cool weapon/spell/incantation I just got. 

All in all Elden Ring is one of the very few games I would say is a 10/10.

At times haunting, sad, thrilling, or funny, Elden ring is a game of truly impressive scale, that still manages a neat balance of level design and scope.

"Ah Elden Ring, a beautiful game that I can't help but have conflicted feelings on. I have 200ish hours on console and recently purchased on Steam. It is a game that has some fantastic moments, beautiful vistas, and extremely refined mechanics, but I cannot call the best From Software title. Many of the enemies have long combos and delayed attacks designed to catch the Soulsborne veteran off guard. Some of the level design also falls short due to the scale and open nature of the game so it does not have the same perfectionism found in other titles. Overall I highly recommend, but feel it is still only their third best game I have played, behind Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2.",True,0,0
"Fans of souls games will love it, and its open world with a fresh story make it a great place for new players to start. The DLC is excellent but I reccomend finishing the main game first even if just for the possibility you don't finish it! I think the best way to enjoy this game is to take your time exploring everything you come across, so speedrunners may not have as much fun with this as other soulsborne games.",True,0,0
"Definitely a really good game, but probably not what I would consider the best of the souls games. FromSoft have evolved their design so much from Demon Souls and there are definitely bosses on display that show that best in this game. I know it's a design choice to not have a journal, or mark dungeons you've cleared, but it's pretty annoying that it isn't a feature in the game. For a new player going in blind, the early game was quite a hassle to try and figure out what I was doing and where I should be going.

"After beating the game almost 155 hours later, I am simply speechless. For a game to have such minimal instruction, dialogue, and assistance, it is by far one of the best truly open world games I've ever played. This was my first ""souls"" game so I did not know what exactly to expect, but man I was not disappointed in the slightest. First game I would genuinely mean 11/10.

Do not get me wrong - It is not an easy game especially for your first play-through. I 100% understand why so many people quit without completion. You can and probably will spend hours in one area, and the occasional rage quit might happen. But after having a forte in single player open world games, completing Elden Ring has got to be the absolute most rewarding. 

I strongly recommend this to anyone still living in a cave or to anyone who has given up on their play-through. I myself debated on spending the money ""if ill probably rage quit in a few weeks"" - Just make the jump and maybe follow a guide if needed. Ill be preparing myself to now make the jump to the Erdtree DLC.

"Elden Ring is undeniably a good game, but I can’t help but feel it’s a bit overrated. While it has its strengths, it falls short of the universal praise it often receives.
At its core, Elden Ring is a Souls-like RPG with challenging combat, amazing open-world exploration, and a focus on cryptic storytelling. Unfortunately, the main story left me cold—it’s one of the most unengaging narratives I’ve encountered in a game of this scale. Surprisingly, the side quests were far more compelling, adding layers of intrigue and adventure that the main plot lacked.
The visuals? They’re decent for a game released in 2022 but far from the groundbreaking masterpiece many claim them to be. While the world design is imaginative, the technical graphics didn’t blow me away.
One of the most annoying aspects of the game is the messages left by other players. While the idea behind this system is unique and occasionally helpful, in practice, 90% of the messages are either pointless or placed in the worst spots. It’s frustrating to see them blocking levers or items I need to collect, and during fights, I’d often accidentally read a message instead of focusing on combat. Only a small fraction of these messages are genuinely useful or funny, making the whole system feel more like a distraction than a benefit.
My biggest frustrations, however, come from the game's lack of proper guidance and its pre-boss enemy encounters. Without clear direction, I spent about 20% of my playtime consulting YouTube or online guides just to figure out where to go or what to do. The game doesn’t make it easy to care about its story or even understand it, which only made me more disengaged. And those enemies before the bosses? Often more of a tedious slog than an enjoyable challenge.
That said, Elden Ring does have its moments of brilliance. The combat, though occasionally frustrating, can be immensely satisfying, especially with the variety of weapons and playstyles available. PvP adds a fun, chaotic layer to the game for those who enjoy battling other players.
In the end, Elden Ring is good, but not the untouchable masterpiece it’s often made out to be. If it weren’t for the game’s reputation, I might not recommend it. However, because it’s Elden Ring, it’s worth experiencing at least once—flaws and all.
(Oh, and as a side note: if you check out Elden Ring videos on YouTube, you’ll notice the creators tend to fit a certain ""geek"" stereotype—beards, long hair, glasses, nerdy voice. It’s just something I couldn’t help but notice.)",True,0,0

This game is beautifully crafted in both the world, and its lore and storytelling. It's challenging, unlike most modern games that hold your hand, there is nothing in the world of Elden Ring that is forgiving.

"Fromsoftware released the first ""Soulslike"" game in 2009.  They spent the next 13 years releasing sequels and learning.  Elden Ring is the result of all of that experience and hard work.  I have now bought the game twice; once PS4/PS5 and now on PC so I could play with some Mods.

The world is vast and offers the most rewarding exploration I have ever experienced in a video game.  The combat is challenging but incredibly satisfying to master. The story is deep with a ton of incredible lore however, you can ignore all of that if you want and just go kill some bosses. (Warning: You will miss out on some boss fights and cool loot if you go this route!)  The different playstyles and builds you can incorporate, as well as the satisfaction of now being able to bully bosses that gave you problems the first go around, makes this game endlessly replayable. 

A note about the difficulty.  Do not let the hype around the difficulty of Souls games dissuade you.  In the end these games are designed to be beaten.  Every attack can be dodged.  Every boss has a weakness.  The only thing that makes this game difficult is it forces you to learn it  and seek out answers. Nothing is spoon fed to you. If you are still struggling, the game gives you a ton of tools to make things easier on yourself like the ability to summon NPCs to help you fight.

There's a reason why this game was most people's game of the year in 2022 and it's excellent DLC ""Shadow of the Erdtree"" was nominated for game of the year in 2024.  Why not find out why?  I believe this is a must play for anyone who appreciates games as creative works of art.",True,0,0

"So there are some extremely poor game design errors, but that doesn't keep this from being a great game.

I recommend not playing with a browser open, with a few exceptions I'll note - because of poor game design.

1) Some weapons are absolute garbage, and if you upgrade them your materials are wasted.
2) You must upgrade your weapons (spell foci included) to be relevant.
3) While the weapons are /fairly/ diverse with mildly varied move sets, there's no way to test many different weapon types early in the game so your first weapon isn't likely to be of a type you'll actually want to use - so maybe pick the Samurai.
3b) Drop rates for some of the better weapons are terrible, and their upgrade paths hidden, so when you find a weapon you like go ahead and look up the best version of it and then go get it.
4) Unless you start with a magic class, it'll be inaccessible for a while.
4b) The Demi-human staff is a trap, it's only good on an Int dabbler not an Int main.  Go ahead and look up the meteorite staff and go get it.
5) Attributes have soft caps, so look that up before you level any stat past 20 or 40.  And you're going to want to limit your stat points to your few key Attributes - whatever they may be.
6) Parrying with a shield means you can't really use an ash of war, and that basically means parrying is irrelevant in PvE.

Dark Souls is one of the best games of the past 30 years and this is a fairly worthy successor (We won't talk about 2 & 3).   Make no mistake, this is a game about boss battles and game skill.  The game will attempt to trick you into thinking it's about fighting groups of peons, but it's not.  Timing is important.

Spirit ashes are a great addition to the Genre, because playing with random people on the internet is not fun - and it's good that while it was designed to be played multi-player there's a viable way not to do so.

At some point you'll be able to respec, which is great, but this ability should've been granted earlier in the story or outside it and upgrade materials should be refundable.

So it's basically a great game if you like exploring, skill, and challenge.",True,0,0

"Currently about to finish my first play through, and Elden RIng has quickly become one of my favorite games in only a matter of weeks. No game has sucked me in like this since Skyrim. The game rewards curiosity and exploration greatly, has stunning visuals, satisfying combat, intricate and thought-provoking lore, and incredible flexibility in building your character. 

That said, it's not free from its issues. I can ignore a lot of the problems other reviewers will list, but the one thing that the game is sorely lacking in is detail. Limgrave and Liurnia are some of the most well-designed areas in any open world game I've played, with plenty of things to find, but after those the regions begin to feel shallow. Caelid is the only other one that comes close to the first two, which is really sad given how great they were. Altus feels like a watered-down Limgrave, Gelmir is great to look at but has very little depth, Mountaintops of the Giants is cool but feels empty (but perhaps that lends itself to the overall experience of the region), same with the Consecrated Snowfield. While all of them were fun to explore, I can't help but wish there was more present in most of them. Even the underground regions that were so beautifully designed and have the feeling that they're harboring some ancient secrets and power are relegated to simple fetch quests most of the time with pretty uninspiring bosses. There was so much potential in these areas but I'm left being a little unsatisfied with them.

But, despite this overarching flaw, I've had no problem regularly sinking in dozens of hours into this game because it's just *that fun*. Solid 9/10, could even bump to 9.5/10 after I play SOTET, but until then, a recommendation will have to suffice.",True,0,0

"Awesome 10/10 game. Quiet hard for casual gamers but its fun coz its very satisfying after winning. The scenery, music, ambience, nature, and lore of the game is great. Not to mention the very wide selection of builds you can choose from. You can always try what comfortable build you want and the exploration is just *chefs kiss*. Just be patient you truly can appreciate this game.",True,0,0
"One of the best game I've ever played.
The gameplay is so fun and engaging, there are no part of the game that is boring. It encourages you to try and experiment new kinds of builds and strategy to defeat an enemy. 

Will definitely play this game again",True,0,0
This is the greatest game i ever stumbled upon. It is worth every dollar for the dlc the actual game its worth. your able to play for hundreds of hours and still discover new weapons and bosses that you never fought. for me its the beauty of this game the graphics is incredible you can wonder around and explore for hours without getting bored. must buy,True,0,0

"I liked Dark Souls 3 but was hesitant to get elden ring. ITS SO MUCH BETTER! if you liked dark souls but didnt love it, there's a good chance you'll LOVE elden ring. Incredible game. 
The open world is awesome. So is the combat, so are the bosses, etc. 
Only issue with this game is you gotta spend a lotta time on the wiki haha. I never knew what to do without prior research, this game is impossible to figure out without it. Didn't ruin my experience though, and to be honest this game is probably now my favorite game ever! 
HUGE endorsement!",True,0,0
"very fun game with lots of content! getting the dlc is like a 2nd game! tons of exploration and secrets to uncover along with a huge variety of weapons , spells, armor. the story is great! nice and easy to get into from the beginning compared to other souls games but then ramps up in difficulty depending on how you approach things and when you do. overall 10/10. GET THE DLC WITH THE GAME! ITS WORTH IT! the dlc was very challenging straight from the get go which i liked!",True,0,0

"Masterpiece, 10/10 game. Great for soulsborne beginners since it's not as challenging as the others. Only flaw is that the game isn't optimized perfectly so you will see very subtle frame skips from time to time.",True,0,0

"This game is really much more massive and fascinating than I had ever imagined, given the game is only 50+ GB large! You will have a feeling of deja vu if you are familiar with Skyrim, and with souls-like challenges, you will have an opportunity to simulate the survival in a wild, harsh but beautiful world.",True,0,0
"This is definitively one of the best games I've ever played. Great open world with tons of secrets to be found with little to no hand holding. Bosses are hard but mostly fair. The atmosphere in the game is also great, including the lightning effects and the sound. I ended up liking the game so much i chose to 100% complete its achievements.",True,0,0

I didn't like Demon Souls long ago. I gave Elden Ring a try after being praised by the gaming community. Great freaking game. I took me a lot to finish it but it was a great entertainment value for the money invested. FromSoftware stands out as one of the best gaming studios. Will try a second playthrough with mods now!,True,0,0
So far it is such a brilliant experience. The word is expansive and really fun to explore. Try your best to push through the early stage frustration because there is an amazing game here.,True,0,0
"Pretty great! Second best souls-like, in my opinion. 

Great combat, exploration, vibes, everything. And a tough challenge, too. That said, admittedly, the catacombs are quite bad.

"This is my favorite Fromsoft game. Played through this game about 5 times and each play through discovered at least one new part of the world. The combat here feels the most refined and smooth in the series. There are so many weapon and spell choices here and each feels like you can make it viable with the right build. It also makes it feel way more friendly to new people coming into the series, with the open-world nature where you can redirect yourself if you find an area too challenging. The spirit ashes are great for use early and getting comfortable on until you feel ready to solo areas and bosses. The bosses here are all unique in presentation, scale, and combat flow and are exceptionally a joy to learn and overcome. The Npc’s in this game I think are some of the most memorable in the series and I enjoy going through all their questlines and where they lead to. As usual, there is so much rich lore to get lost in and it makes the exploration of the world even better. The level designs here also feel like they’re at their peak. This whole game only got better with the DLC and just expanded upon all the best parts of the base.",True,0,0
