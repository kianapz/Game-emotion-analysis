"Oh boy, where do I even start with Elden Ring? Imagine a game where the devs were like, ""Let's make every blade of grass deadly."" You step into this gorgeous world, thinking, ""This looks like a chill spot for a picnic,"" only to realize the picnic's actually your wake.

The graphics? Chef's kiss. It's like you're inside a Van Gogh painting, but every stroke wants to off you. The landscapes are so stunning, you'll forget to breathe – until you fall off a cliff.

Combat in Elden Ring isn't about skill; it's about how many times you can bash your head against a wall before you get it right. Every boss fight feels like they've got a personal beef with you. They're just there to mock your sad attempts at living. (git gud)

The lore? Man, it's deep. So deep you'd need a submarine to get to the bottom of it. And just when you think you've got it, some NPC comes along with a backstory that could be its own book. Good luck figuring out the story; it's like doing a puzzle blindfolded.

But here's the thing: despite all the pain, the frustration, the ""I'm uninstalling this"" moments, you can't help but love it. There's something about Elden Ring that pulls you back, like a moth to a flame, or a player to their doom.

100/10 for me - would die over and over again. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a way of life. A life of pain, beauty, and the occasional scream into the abyss. If you want something that'll test your patience, your skill, and your swear-word collection, this is it.",True,254,53,2025-01-29 12:45:13
"FYI- I finished the main game then I posted this review there is a lot of side content left

This is the most fun I ever had with a souls game its not super hard its not easy either... It took me 91 hours to beat the main story I did a lot of side stuff too.. I Think its a great entry point for someone who has never played a souls game before... This game guides you, humbles you and teaches you... The open world is beautiful and filled with Skyrim like dungeons with a boss waiting in the end.. I am gonna finish the side stuff now find awesome weapons and armour level them up and try different combinations  then i'll maybe get the expansion for the price its an amazing game YES! I would recommend it 9/10",True,82,6,2025-02-05 17:39:50
"[h3][i]ELDEN RING[/i] | Perfect Game Review [/h3] 
(100% Completion at 65.3 Hours)
[hr][/hr]
I went into [i]Elden Ring[/i] thinking it was just [i]Dark Souls[/i] on a horse. Instead, I experienced epic battles in breathtaking open worlds, my friend screaming every time we got invaded, and dying to gravity more than any actual enemy (I hate parkour).

I have a confession to make: I’ve never really played a [i]Dark Souls[/i] game, but having completed [i]Sekiro[/i], [i]Remnant[/i], and [i]Hollow Knight[/i], I still consider myself a souls-like gamer. So when my friend mentioned seamless co-op was possible in [i]Elden Ring[/i] thanks to a popular mod, I jumped in and experienced a masterpiece.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Whether you’re dodging tough bosses like a pro, getting knocked off your horse by a random minion, or spending hours customising your character’s face just for it to be hidden under a hideous headpiece (totally me), the possibilities are endless in this wonderfully crafted open world adventure ★★★★★

[b]Graphics:[/b] The world of [i]Elden Ring[/i] is absolutely breathtaking… but if you pause to admire the view, don’t be surprised if you get obliterated by a catapult or drop kicked into oblivion by a giant bird ★★★★★

[b]Sound:[/b] From beautiful melodies to thunderous battle themes, the orchestral score perfectly captures the world’s grandeur. Every swing, spell, and footstep adds to the immersion, making the Lands Between feel truly alive ★★★★★

[b]Story:[/b] The side stories and world-building can be captivating, and I enjoyed interacting with the game’s many fascinating characters. However, the main plot can feel vague and underwhelming at times. And unless you have a PhD in [i]Elden Ring[/i] lore, expect to piece things together slowly through item descriptions and cryptic NPC dialogue ★★★★☆

[b]Replayability:[/b] With multiple possible endings, new game plus, dozens of secrets, hundreds of bosses, and insane build variety, there’s plenty to explore in the Lands Between. And then just when you think you’ve seen it all, [i]Elden Ring[/i] whispers, “Have you tried dual-wielding great hammers?” ★★★★★

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] Like any souls-like game, expect to rage nonstop. The difference? This time, you get to decide whether to die miserably on foot, on horseback, or with your equally doomed friend by your side. Would I recommend [i]Elden Ring[/i]? Only if you're ready for a stunning but punishing adventure—and the chance to put a ring on a lunar princess, even if she immediately ghosts you.

[h3]Overall Rating: 10/10, would set a massive tree on fire and seize the throne again.[/h3]",True,41,0,2025-02-22 05:41:09
"    游戏本体设计90%都非常好，首先是非常耐玩，和之前的线性地图区别很大，风景也比之前的作品更丰富；第二就是boss的招式设计也比之前的作品要丰富很多；第三，主线中的地图也是延续了之前作品的特点，剧情的设计也比较吸引人。
    游戏本体的缺点主要就是最后几张地图，圣树天空城灰烬王城，怪的数值有点偏高，如果是正常游玩主线的话等级一般不够，去打周边的副本也提不起来兴趣，因为洞窟地牢这些玩到后面重复性也有点高，还有“米凯拉的锋刃”玛莲妮亚这个boss，对纯翻滚实在太不友好，摸索他的攻击判定点都要打几十遍。另外就是怪有点读指令，而且比较明显，一眼就能看出来的那种，不过这个可能也不完全能算缺点，可能是增加难度的一种方式。
    DLC就只能说好的地方和不好的地方都很多，先说坏的地方，我是二周目进去DLC，首先就是怪的数值实在是过于离谱，只要不是最垃圾的小怪，是个怪都能三下打死我，boss就更不用说了，只要两下。
    另外就是探索奖励太低，根本就没有探索欲望，也没有那种人物属性成长的快感，第一个boss双月跟最后一个米塔恩都差不多数值，打我都是两下，除了攻击频率米塔恩高一些，但是也高不到哪去，适应了这种难度之后都差不多，我三天就通了DLC，因为他这种过高的数值还有低探索奖励就会让人想赶紧玩完完事，本体我是花了比较长的时间去体验，大约有75h，但即使是这样，后面我还是愿意花时间去做一些收集，但DLC肯定不会了。
    DLC还有个最大的问题，怪的读指令过于严重，比本体还要严重不少，而且属于是那种恶性读指令，比如你离他远远的按一下攻击键，他就会条件反射一样的做出翻滚或者后撤的动作，甚至你背对着他攻击一下都会这样，这一点在游戏设计上就太偷工减料了，就算要读指令也完全可以做成例如，三个技能，每次读指令的时候随机发动。因为这种重复的复读而导致的打不过会让人感觉非常气愤。
    DLC也有好的地方，例如地下墓地的地图设计就比本体还要好，还有就是不谈boss难度的话，演出效果做的非常好，另外就是对于这种高难度的boss，拼尽全力战胜他之后，得到的成就感跟简单一些的boss还是有点区别的，会比简单的boss要多一些。
    总体这个游戏满分10分能给到9分，扣分就在本体后期和DLC数值过高-0.5还有读指令-0.5，已经算接近完美的大作了。",True,43,20,2025-01-30 16:42:11
"this game takes you back to old times when arcade and strategy games were a thing but also give you latest game play and open world RPG mechanics. The graphics are stunning, the combat feels awesome, the progression system is one of best in its class and many more. You will enjoy it, even if you'r not a SOULS fan.",True,2,0,2025-02-04 17:19:51
"Elden Ring is not merely a video game, but a transcendental experience—a masterwork woven with the threads of legend, artistry, and meticulous craftsmanship. From the moment one steps into the Lands Between, it becomes clear that this is a world of staggering depth and beauty, one that beckons players not merely to explore, but to immerse themselves in its very soul.

At the heart of Elden Ring lies a narrative that is both haunting and elusive, painted in the broad strokes of myth yet rich with subtle intricacies. The collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin has birthed a world filled with lore that never overpowers, but instead entices curiosity. The story unfolds not through overt exposition, but through atmospheric hints and environmental storytelling, compelling players to unearth secrets on their own. It is a tapestry of broken kingdoms, forgotten deities, and cosmic forces, where each discovery—whether in the form of a cryptic message, an abandoned structure, or a fleeting encounter—feels like a revelation.

The artistry in Elden Ring is breathtaking. From the serene grace of the golden trees in the liminal dusk to the oppressive, yawning voids of desolate catacombs, the game paints its landscapes with a brush that is both grand and intimate. Each area, no matter how bleak, feels alive—teeming with possibility, steeped in history, and imbued with a melancholic beauty that mirrors the world’s fall from grace. It is a visual feast, where even the most innocuous detail—the curvature of a shadow, the scattering of fallen petals—carries the weight of meaning.

The gameplay itself is an evolution of the meticulous design that FromSoftware has become synonymous with, refined and expanded into an open world that feels boundless yet intimately connected. Every encounter, whether against a towering boss or a subtle ambush in a field of flowers, is a testament to the precision of its mechanics. The difficulty, while legendary, is never unfair; it is an invitation to grow, to learn, to rise above adversity through patience, strategy, and resilience. And through it all, there is a profound sense of agency. The world does not hand you your path—it challenges you to carve your own.

Perhaps most remarkable of all is the game’s ability to evoke a feeling of quiet reverence. Elden Ring is not a game that rushes; it exists in its own deliberate pace. The slow, rhythmic exploration of its vast expanses—interrupted by fleeting moments of terror, triumph, and wonder—gives rise to a sense of time itself being altered. In a world that often demands constant motion, this game asks players to stop, to look, to feel.

In conclusion, Elden Ring stands as an unparalleled work of art. It is a testament to the enduring power of the medium, proving that video games are not mere diversions, but can be profound expressions of creativity, vision, and emotion. It is a world to be revered, a journey to be savored, and an experience that will linger long after its final chapter is written. To play it is to witness not just a game, but the unfolding of a masterpiece.",True,2,0,2025-02-23 21:20:38

"A World Like No Other
The Lands Between is Elden Ring’s crowning achievement. Unlike other open-world games that fill their maps with checklist-style activities, Elden Ring rewards true exploration. Every hilltop, ruin, and cave hides something mysterious—sometimes it’s a powerful weapon, sometimes a terrifying boss, or even an entire hidden city. The game never holds your hand, trusting players to carve their own path.

Combat: Brutal, Rewarding, and Deep
FromSoftware’s signature combat is here in full force, refined to perfection. Whether you’re a heavy-hitting Colossal Sword wielder, a dexterous katana master, or a spell-flinging sorcerer, Elden Ring offers more build variety than any Souls game before it. Every enemy encounter feels meaningful, and every boss fight is a spectacle—full of awe, terror, and satisfaction when you finally emerge victorious.

Storytelling & Lore: A Myth in Motion
Written in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, the lore of Elden Ring is dense, tragic, and utterly fascinating. It unfolds subtly, through cryptic item descriptions, NPC dialogue, and environmental storytelling. There are no forced cutscenes or expository dumps—just a world teeming with history, inviting the player to piece it together.

A Soundtrack That Elevates the Experience
The music in Elden Ring is nothing short of mesmerizing. Haunting choirs, bombastic orchestras, and eerie ambient tracks set the perfect mood for exploration and combat. Every boss has a theme that makes their fight feel like an event of mythic proportions.

Final Thoughts: A Timeless Legend
Rarely does a game come along that truly redefines its genre, but Elden Ring has done just that. It is challenging yet fair, vast yet focused, and deeply immersive in ways few games can match. It respects the player’s intelligence, offering freedom without sacrificing meaningful design.

It is not just one of the greatest games of its generation—it is a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.

"I had never played soulslike games before. My skepticism toward Elden Ring was mostly caused by stories of its difficulty, and I must admit — people weren’t lying. But I couldn't imagine where this difficulty comes from.
 
What I Loved 

Elden Ring looks incredible and is filled with a great amount of beautiful concepts. There are spiritual battle flags standing where massive battles once took place, mmm spiritual trees, spiritual spirits — you get it. The world of this game, despite sometimes feeling still and empty in certain aspects, gives you chills and makes you want to explore.

There are a few exploration caps that require fighting mighty foes to progress, and here lies the cornerstone of this game. Bosses are everywhere, and many of them are the same ones, just appearing in different locations or in a combination with others. They will make you die over and over again until you memorize their movesets and manage your timings almost perfectly. Unfortunately, in many cases, you'll feel happier that it's over rather than proud of your achievement.

Thankfully, Elden Ring offers ways to make things easier. You can explore its world to find better weapons and buffs or obtain summons — some of which can be received within the first 20 minutes of the game. You’ll still need to grind to stand a chance against certain bosses because, without good HP stats, you’ll be constantly one-shotted. If your strength and stamina are too low, you won’t be able to land effective hits in time to defeat a boss within a reasonable time. Eventually, you’ll find good farming spots, and I strongly recommend watching guides to locate them — especially if grinding bores you in other games. Otherwise, you risk burning out before experiencing some of the best and most entertaining parts of this world.

If you, like me, are new to this genre, you most likely will experience something incredible: a shift in mindset that will affect how you approach other games as well. Dying is the core of this game, and although it's sometimes incredibly frustrating, you will eventually learn to lower your expectations before each fight and accept death as a necessary part of the experience. In return, this will make you feel stronger — not because of your character's stats, but because of how much you’ve improved as a player. Your reaction time, adaptability, and skill in general will constantly increase, allowing you to perform well even if you start the game over.

What I Hated

As I mentioned, many bosses require a great amount of attempts to defeat, and some don’t have save points nearby. This means you’ll often have to run back through difficult areas, losing not only time but also valuable HP flasks. It’s time-consuming and frustrating.

Another complaint of mine is that the game barely teaches you anything. I read everything I could and explored every corner, yet after 70 hours, I still found myself confused about the story and how to progress through it. Many times, I stumbled upon the right location or NPC purely by accident. Some say that Elden Ring doesn’t hold your hand so you can experience it on your own, but I’d argue that it’s hard to be invested in the story when, by the time you reach the end, you barely remember where it all started. Many quests are easy to complete unintentionally, and there’s no quest journal - only a few of them even have map markers. There are some general routes to follow, but that doesn’t guarantee you won’t struggle with understanding what to do. I certainly did.

Because of this, while other games often make exploration feel unnecessary by giving you all the information right away, Elden Ring goes to the opposite extreme, offering almost no guidance. This leads to a lack of investment in both the side and main stories.

Final Thoughts

I love and hate this game. It sometimes throws frustrating design choices at you, but it also offers a unique experience — a hostile unforgiving sandbox where you often decide whether to fight or run away. While dying is the core Elden Ring, exploration is also its essence. I don’t think it’s the best game ever, as some claim — there are many flaws — but there is beauty in suffering, in learning through trial and error, and in in eventually overcoming your struggles.

I highly recommend at least trying this game, even if you’ve never played anything like it before. It will likely change how you perceive failing — not just in gaming, but maybe even in life.",True,4,0,2025-02-11 23:31:16
"Actually my first Fromsoft, or even soulslike title. Came from growing up with DOOM, Quake, Ratchet and Clank, etc, but eventually just phased out of enjoying games in my early 20s. Picked up this game after hearing about the difficulty on the ps4, and absolutely fell in love, just like I did when I was younger. It's a challenging, but fair, and Fromsoft makes beautiful, detailed games you can immerse in for months honestly. Most of the player base, minus that one group we all know, is super helpful, and kind as hell from my experience. Been my ps4, and steam accounts, I have at least 500 or so hours combined. I even went on to get a nice amount of love, and time in DS1, DS3, and Bloodborne. If you love a challenge, this game is perfect, along with all other Fromsoft titles. Just get used to watching everyone you protect die regardless lol.",True,2,0,2025-02-09 11:16:00
Without a doubt my number 1 favorite souls-borne game. The world building was impeccable as with any other souls-borne game but Elden ring has the addition of being absolutely gorgeous. Not even to mention the amazing DLC they created that was so good it got nominated as a game of the year without even being a game.,True,1,0,2025-02-13 04:34:17

"I just can't with Elden Ring. The first time I played I had fun in Limgrave, I really thought this was going to be amazing. All the way through Storm Veil Castle I was all for it. Then the game just slips. I started going through the lake and got lost, not like lost in adventure, I mean I was lost, directionless and unsure how to progress. I completely missed the lord of the lake and instead fought the Magic Horse Lady, I have no idea what her name was. I assumed I had finished lake then kept going and... uhh where do I go? The other side of the bridge led to a dead end and the enemy camps were starting to stomp me. I was going dex faith, which is supposedly really strong, and I had basic miracles, my weapon didn't seem to do anything and even with red fire enchantment I couldn't get bleed in any reasonable time to help me in fights. I just kept going, got up a cliff and killed the salamander only to fight tons of ogres I could barely one on one. I kept going, Dragon with red lightning one shoting me. I kept going I see a giant golden door, two of the Golden Tree Knights guarding it, I couldn't kill anything without hit and run tactics... I snuck past them, only to find more and more rediculous stuff that I couldn't hope to have gear for... 

I know a lot more now than I did then and honestly... I still have no idea what to do in this game. Builds? That's for other people who have somehow figured this game out. Items feel so disperate and all focused on hyper specific builds. Like I found the Winged Scythe which is dex faith and yet didn't like it... it felt slow and cluncky for something meant to be dex. I've never finished the game ligitimantly. I don't think I ever will because the game loses it's fun right around the lack area and I've played limgrave a lot... I'm gonna burn out on it entirly one of these days and just not come back to it, as I still try to extract the bits of fun I original payed to have and instead got pain and disatifaction.

Also horse combat sucks... alot. It feels like the game is pushing you to use the horse constantly. It isn't as refined or fun as the Dark Souls combat. 

And yet, every time I see someone like IronPinapple play this game, I ask myself, ""Why was I so hard on the game? This looks fun!"" I come back and get disappointed.",False,6,4,2025-02-23 22:46:35
"A nearly perfect game in many ways, and a world you will never forget. Ride through misty forests and dank swamps, explore castles and ancient ruins, and face foes out of your worst nightmares. The lore and story of this world are not spoon-fed to you, and it can be esoteric and strange at first glance, but it will open itself to any player who is willing to look for the details. Once you invest yourself into this experience, it will take over your gaming life for a very very long time.

The challenge in this game is top notch, and will test your abilities in many ways. Most encounters can be changed to make them more or less challenging, depending on how much you want to push yourself. Hundreds of different weapons and dozens of movesets are available, from small daggers to huge warhammers and everything in between (you can even do a hand-to-hand martial arts combat style if you'd like, with the DLC). And for those who appreciate armor and ""fashion-souls"", there are an overwhelming number of armor sets you can mix and match to customize your looks and stats.   

The multiplayer experience takes a few different forms ... you can join friends to go on quests together, invade other players to challenge and ambush them, or go to specialized arenas to match up in fights and tournaments. Some of the match-making for online play can be a little janky from time to time, but overall it's accessible for pretty much every play style. 

This is probably the easiest game from FromSoftware to get into, and it's the one that will give you the most freedom and choice. I honestly cannot recommend this game enough.",True,9,2,2025-02-14 16:03:28

"The quantity over quality game of the Souls games. I'm not sure I would be very positive about the game without its much better DLC, but I like Dark Souls 2 so I still wouldn't be able to justify a hard negative review. After all, one of the reasons people think Dark Souls 2 is the worst Souls game ever is because of the repeated and large number of bosses with the focus on quantity over quality.
I'm sorry to say it but the open world and scale feels detrimental to the game. Literally 90% of the bosses are weak and filler. There are over 200 bosses in this, and a lot of them are repeated and/or pushovers. The major bosses are great, but the entire experience becomes a highly diluted slog when the majority of your gameplay is exploring a somewhat empty world with largely lame bosses. I'm not excited for what comes next after pushing over my fourth crystalian boss. 
If you haven't played the Souls series, Bloodborne, or Sekiro, I would recommend you play those instead. They're much more finely crafted linear experiences compared to this flawed and unengaging open world. It's a slog, it gets dull, and it gets boring.
If you have played the others, then sure, there's no reason not to play Elden Ring as well. The DLC is definitely recommended. I wouldn't say the base game sucks, it just has glaring flaws that largely come down to a matter of quantity over quality.
Elden Ring PvP is the worst PvP has ever been, so if that's what you're looking for, you better get that out of your head.
The more I go on the more I want to give it a negative review, but I think that's too harsh for what you get. Dark Souls 3 just had its seamless co-op mod released. Maybe you should give that a try.

Now the only time I feel a sense of satisfaction is when I win a comp game in a multiplayer game. This would be nice however, playing with/against real people can get toxic and not fun real fast. I am a streamer and my friend recommended me this game. He talked very highly of it and said I should give it a shot. I was hesitant at first but decided why not. Playing the first 5 to 10 hours was okay but, beating more bosses made me feel a certain way. I kept playing and got hooked to the game. I did a full strength build and the feeling of reward I would feel after defeated a hard boss like Morgot was something I could not explain. I beat the game a couple days ago and I just have to say, I understand it now. This game is beautiful, challenging, and rewarding. The game is a combo of Skyrim and Darksouls! You do not have any right to judge this game unless you play a decent bit of it because it is truly an amazing game.

The base game and DLC are personally the best experiences I have had in games and they have lead me to try the other souls game and find my fondness for them. Overall, Elden Ring is an excellent game that i would recommend to everyone, with the precaution that they WILL die many many times, but that's just part of the experience/learning curve that a lot of people don't understand, and is the thing that originally made me not want to try the games.

Nothing else to say.

Playstyles I have tried:
- Mage (Gravity Sling Build/Ice Mage Greatsword) 5/10 Really easy world traversal, decent against early bosses, falls off hard later.
- Unga Bunga (Heaviest Armor/Flamberg Str Tank) 8/10 Super Easy, Easily tanks 5+ hits from bosses before healing, Mimic Tear alone almost solos bosses.
- Dragon Paladin (Still playing, Heaviest Armor/Dragon Incantations) 10/10 Easiest build so far. Rot breath clears hords of enemies with ease. Rot breath a boss and run it around. No need to play agressive, rot will kill the boss over time but getting some hit in will speed it up. Dragonmaw also does big damage.

"This game is massive and a total masterpiece - the world is extremely immersive with so many things to do, and so many ways to advance your character to prepare for the intense and difficult yet fun boss fights. I'm still on my first playthrough and am approaching 100 hours without even trying for completionist, and I still have quite a lot to do. This is also one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played without a doubt - every area, every boss fight and everything about Elden Ring's design is a pure work of art. 
What keeps this game from being a 10/10 for me though is that the design of multiple end-game bosses suffer, not because of their difficulty, but because of their mechanics. I've been playing souls games for about 11 years, and intense difficulty spikes/learning new strategies doesn't bother me at all, it's part of the experience - but some of the late-game bosses have designs that make them really frustrating to play through, beyond the normal amount of frustration to be expected, I suppose. Some are frustrating to the point that they aren't enjoyable. A few of these bosses use certain maneuvers over and over again that are extremely powerful, but you can learn and work with them, but the way they're done make so many of them battles of attrition, which is exhausting to do over and over again. Others have attacks that aren't dodgeable that would be in other fights, or are more easily completed with certain builds - and good souls boss fights just don't operate this way. With every other fight before the end game, and in other souls games as well, the difficulty, repetition, struggle, and frustration all feel fair and part of the experience, but these bosses just aren't pleasant, for me.

This is just my opinion though. Elden Ring's nothing short of incredible and everyone should play it. I'd give it a 9/10 :) .",True,0,0,2025-02-24 11:08:46

"A Masterpiece Worth Experiencing Again

I already completed Elden Ring on PlayStation, but I decided to give it another shot on PC—and I still had just as much fun. This game is a triumph in open-world design, blending FromSoftware’s signature challenge with a vast, beautifully crafted world. The Lands Between feel truly alive, filled with secrets, breathtaking landscapes, and hidden dangers at every turn.

Exploration is endlessly rewarding, with every corner offering new challenges, lore, and powerful rewards. The combat remains as satisfying as ever, offering deep customization through weapons, spells, and abilities. Whether you prefer aggressive melee combat, strategic magic, or a mix of both, Elden Ring gives you the freedom to play your way. The boss fights are unforgettable, each one demanding skill, patience, and strategy to overcome.

With its rich lore, stunning visuals, and nearly endless replayability, Elden Ring is a must-play—even for those who’ve already completed it once. An absolute masterpiece that sets a new standard for open-world RPGs!

My experience with Elden ring was entirely Co-op. I experienced 100+ hours of endless boss slaying and exploration on what seemed like an almost endless journey. I love how one minute you will be walking around a tree and then a few seconds later a boss approaches you. Lots of surprises. I will say- the Co-op mod itself had MANY bugs which are definitely game breaking, however there are ways around them (Definitely not ”seem-less”). 

In terms of style, the game is original and jaw dropping beautiful. The lands itself show the misery of the tarnished and the destruction caused by attempts of many to claim the Elden Lord throne. The mix of supernatural, magic, nature and royalty is such a beautiful mix to encounter…. Oh and the music of the game fits the vibe PERFECTLY. 

Aside from the main story bosses, there are no rules for which bosses to face and when. Although this doesn’t sound optimal, I actually found that the game progresses you at a great pace and allows you the ability to achieve anything as long as you keep it balanced. Take a break from story bosses and explore the lands, finish a side quest line or explore clues to solve puzzles.

I was honestly a bit disappointed with the mechanics of the game. I chose intelligence as my build and found SEVERAL limitations. These weapons were lack luster and you should definitely steer away from this class for this kind of game. Also, most of the main story bosses provide you with STR/DEX weapons. You could argue that the game leads you into trying different builds, but then why would they make you choose a class when you first start? This decision can punish you late game if you don’t grind for the extra levels you basically wasted. Aside from classes, movement is a nightmare. Most of my deaths were from falling off things and I don’t believe it was my fault even half the time. I will say, the main combat mechanics were very enjoyable once I switched builds late game. Likewise, Boss fights are very interesting and it takes time to learn the moves and get good- I love that about this game. It’s definitely the challenge that everyone is looking for.

The main story was pretty decent, although somewhat confusing if you are trying to connect it all together. I know the game was not intended to shove a bunch of story down your throat so honestly I’m not too upset. Definitely not my preferred story telling method though.

Overall, this game was a great experience and I do recommend playing if you are looking for something challenging and enjoy the thrill of seeking new bosses to takedown.",True,0,0,2025-02-22 16:14:36

"Finished this game with already knowlegde of how it the gameplay was because I watched a playthrough but fomo got the best of me. So now that I have played it for myself what do I think of it. This game makes u feel like the main character of your own story all while the other main characters are ending their own. It truly feels like a world where so much has happened and now you are a part of it. the start of the game is hard when u have no knowledge of where to go exactly on the map. Everyone has nightmares of the boss u encounter in the overworld. The tree sentinel and while u can run away. I am sure that there will be most of u who will do your very best to beat him no matter how hard it may be just like I did and that rush of adrenaline when u beat him will a high u chase this entire game. I have beaten all the main bosses. Because I did not want to miss out on anything because if u just follow the path the game gives u. U will miss out on so much of the story of the world. I did not even see everything and I would not even know where to go. The fighting itself and the different weapons are so goddamn cool, spells and much more make it so that this game is so replayable. I might replay it just for the fun of it. You can become as overpowered as u want to be. Did I feel despair fighting the hardest boss while refusing to get the OP weapons. Yes. Did it feel really good when I beat her my own way. Yes.

If you have good patience and determination then this game is amazing. Although some item collecting and quests take a bit the boss fights make up for it all with the cool move sets.

"I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a 120+ hour experience, I also would suggest not using any guides (although if you want to, that's fine as well) as I've found the fun comes from the trial and error nature of the souls genre in general. I found this game to be very enjoyable and the amount of time and effort put into this game is palpable. Probably should've mentioned this earlier, but by trial and error I mean every with every death/defeat you learn something, dodging that bosses attack slightly late or jumping over that attack rather than dodging. With that being said, following leveling guides and ""get OP early"" videos might not help you as much as you think it would, since you still have to know how to fight the boss, at least to a certain extent. I think that's what a lot of people who leave these negative reviews don't really get.

"Unequivocally one of the greatest games I have ever played. I sincerely wish I could re-experience Elden Ring for the first time all over again, especially when this was my first true gateway into the Souls-like genre that Fromsoft created.
From the sheer diversity of how you can create your character, the RIDICULOUS amount of weapons, spells, and incantations you can find and add to your arsenal, to the RAW, unapologetic challenge that this game offers, and to the vast, beautiful landscapes that the Lands Between offers.....
Elden Ring is more than just a game, it is truly a piece of art, that deserves every single bit of praise it gets.
Regardless if you are shy to the ""Souls-like"" genre, this game deserves the attempt to be played by everyone. You will find yourself tenacious, and headstrong, trying to beat every enemy and boss this game offers from its challenge of difficulty, and the end result will always be pride in overcoming difficulty.
I cannot recommend Elden Ring enough. Sincerely give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 02:04:40
"A fantastic Open World RPG Adventure game. The difficulty scaling is not obvious, however. You may have seen online complaints about the first story boss, Margit the Fell Omen, or even videos about the mounted knight near the beginning of the game. These two encounters are different ways the game tells you how difficult things will be.

If you go into an area and have trouble facing a boss, the ideal tactic is to leave and train elsewhere. Now, while the world is open, there are more difficult regions than others. The difficulty is both a test of your progress and a warning to mind your step. 

Combat is smooth, and you shouldn't have much trouble against an enemy or two. However, you can often find yourself surrounded by several enemies and they don't necessarily wait for their chance to fight like in a Superhero game. So you'll have to be careful with your Stamina and try to make your healing items last between checkpoints.

No strategy is perfect, however, you may find yourself against a challenge that you see no way out of. If that happens, you must find a way to retreat. I can offer a piece of advice to avoid being trapped, make sure to follow the Light of Grace and secure enough checkpoints. Once you secure a few checkpoints, you will be treated to a cutscene and obtain your trusty steed from the promotional videos. After that, you're pretty much good to go.

The game is a grind, you will fail, but you learn from your failures most of the time and success will be all the better for it. If you are curious about the DLC, don't buy it right away, it's more challenging than the main game. Beat the game first, and if you find yourself hungry for more, then by all means, take the plunge.

I may have made the game sound like quite the challenge, but it's all about one step at a time, or is it that the greatest journeys start with a single step? Either way, if you want to try a game with a challenge and enough content to keep you in the game even half as long as my playtime, then Elden Ring is a wonderful choice.

"I'm having quite a bit of fun with it after i started playing at the same time as a friend, its really demotivating to play by yourself in a genre of games youve never played before. This game is probably not good for a first dark souls game, it explains very little and a lot of mechanics can completely pass you by and you'll never know. I also wish i had at least some sort of questlog/tracking feature for tasks given by npc's - im 30 hours in and i have no idea where im supposed to be going rn. im trying to avoid google as much as possible but a few times its been unavoidable.

i will say though the game is clearly made for an xbox and nothing else. the control scheme is auto set to xbox controls even though all i have is a keyboard, and the keys mapping i had to completely redo myself to make it usable. it took quite a bit of trial and error since i was learning the mechanics and realizing i needed keys that were automapped to keys i assigned to actions. There is also occasionally moments where the game freezes for several seconds, but that may just be a  computer issue.

The co-op is miserable. it barely works, and unless you like invading other's worlds for some reason i dont really see the invasion mechanic as a positive point for the game. i want to play with my friend and fight bosses with them but people keep invading in the middle of those fights and killing us both, which is just frustrating, since neither of us are interested in pvp. the co-op system in this game is the most convoluted system ive ever encountered as well, the multiple password system that barely works, the summoning pools which dont really do anything (if you want to co-op with a specific person the pools do jack, you still have to be in the same spot) Since im not interested in co-oping with randoms the multiplayer system thats been implemented here is lackluster at best. (not to mention the terrible load times and random connection errors, we're in the same house so the disconnects make no sense)

despite my complaints though the game is very fun and im experiencing the learning curve of ""getting gud"" i just reached a point where im finally starting to do good dmg and its very satisfying. the bosses arent too difficult to telegraph the movements of and even with my previous low dmg output i could fight most bosses if i was patient and agile enough",True,0,0,2025-02-19 07:03:50

I had this game on PlayStation through game share and put 150 hours and got platinum on there. Then, I decided I wanted SOTE and to actually own the game so I got it on Steam. I started playing right after the worst time of my life and I genuinely think this game saved me. I don't even know what to say about the game itself, it continually leaves me speechless. I had never played a souls game before, I haven't played one since. I am awful at the game I use all the cheese and bs available and it still never fails to give me a sense of accomplishment. I think I could write a doctoral thesis on this game but I won't here. Thank you Elden Ring, thank you Miyazaki, thank you Dark Souls. Don't you dare go hollow.

"I don't know where to start, this is just one of the most beautiful, immersive, and intriguing open world RPGs I've ever experienced. I'm 122 hours into it and feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

The game puts more emphasis on exploration than hand holding with quest markers. It's very modern feeling, but also old school in the game's esoteric structure. It feels very similar to Shadow of the Colossus in it's cryptic approach to progression and story telling, but the world is much more dense. It's something you'll just have to experience to appreciate.

This is the first FromSoft game that I've ever played, and it definitely won't be my last. If you're looking to spend hours and hours getting lost in a incredibly crafted open world, look no further.

"It has been almost three years since this games released on 2/25/2022 and I still find myself playing it. From-software should be commended for how they always make their ""Souls"" games extremely re-playable. I think it is because they make their games really fun to slowly learn and explore on first playthrough but then really accessible on repeat playthroughs.

Even though some may argue that Elden Ring is the least re-playable game by From-software because of the sheer size of the open world and the tendency for repeat bosses (aka Erdtree avatar but red this time), I would raise a counterpoint that BECAUSE of this game is made like that I rarely feel the need to fight everything or go everywhere. The player can tackle the game in a variety of ways and at different paces. The developers also found a really good balance of when the player will fight repetitive enemies and mini-bosses versus when they will fight grand super-bosses like the god-like Shardbearers. 

Also, the sheer variety of spells and weapon types in this game is stellar and this is even true within a single build/character let alone across multiple characters.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 20:22:11
"Elden Ring is an enjoyable action and adventure game with an interesting story, memorable characters, and unique challenges to overcome, all set in a breathtaking open-world environment.

"From the moment I launched Elden Ring on my PC, I knew I was in for something truly special. This game has exceeded every expectation, blending stunning visuals, a vast, intricately designed world, and engaging combat in a way that few games can match.

The open world in Elden Ring is unlike anything I’ve experienced before. The environments are beautiful and varied, from eerie forests and sprawling castles to desolate, haunting plains. Each area is full of hidden secrets, tough enemies, and rewarding exploration. The map is massive, and there’s always something new to discover, which kept me engaged for hours on end.

The combat system is challenging but rewarding, staying true to FromSoftware’s legacy while offering new mechanics to keep things fresh. The variety of weapons, magic, and abilities allows for deep customization of playstyle, and every encounter feels meaningful. Boss fights are intense, with each one offering a unique challenge that keeps you on your toes.

The narrative is intriguing and mysterious, and while it doesn’t hand-feed you the story, it’s all the more satisfying to piece together the lore as you explore. The NPC interactions and side quests are well-crafted, making the world feel alive and rich with history.

Performance on PC has been smooth, with great optimization, even on mid-range hardware. The game looks gorgeous, and the sound design perfectly complements the atmosphere, enhancing every moment of tension or triumph.

Overall, Elden Ring is a stunning achievement in game design. It’s a must-play for fans of the Soulsborne games, as well as anyone who enjoys expansive worlds and deep, rewarding gameplay. FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves, and this is easily one of the best games of the decade. Highly recommended!

In terms of gameplay mechanics and sheer scale/ ambition this is certainly the greatest of the Souls series, but for me I wouldn't call it the best in the series due to several clear shortcomings; and I can see why Miyazaki-san aren't fully satisfied with it. The open world is too bloated in parts, some repetitive/ derivative and frustrating designs, bland music, weak overall narrative/ story telling and some wasted characters.
 
Overall though, Elden Ring was a fantastic game. Not a surprise many people consider this one of the greatest games ever made, and I honestly I sort of agree with them. Like with Dark Souls, the massive success of this game has definitely elevated Fromsoft's reputation to the next level.

"I recently immersed myself in Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, and I can confidently say it has captivated me like no other FromSoftware title before. In my opinion, it’s one of the best games ever made. While I’ve always appreciated FromSoftware’s work, I never delved too deeply into their previous titles until now.

The world of the Lands Between is jaw-dropping, with meticulously crafted environments that encourage exploration and discovery. Each area is filled with hidden secrets, making every moment feel rewarding.

The combat mechanics are fluid and diverse, allowing for various playstyles. Personally, I opted for an arcane dexterity build, which has been incredibly satisfying. The introduction of the jump mechanic and mounted combat adds fresh tactics to encounters.

What sets Elden Ring apart is its deep lore, seamlessly woven into the environment. I found myself engrossed in the narrative, eager to learn more about the characters and their stories.

While I'm still on my first playthrough and haven’t touched New Game Plus or fully completed the DLC yet, I’m excited to explore more. If you enjoy exploration, rich lore, and challenging gameplay, I highly recommend Elden Ring and its expansion. They’ve truly become modern classics in the action RPG genre. I give it a solid 5/5 Erdtree Blossoms.

"This is the closest I have ever seen to perfect.

From has once again redefined what an open-world action RPG can be. Elden Ring was already a masterpiece, yet Shadow of the Erdtree takes that foundation and elevates it to new heights, delivering an experience that is nothing short of breathtaking.

Every inch of this world is crafted with meticulous detail, from the hauntingly beautiful landscapes to the brutal boss design. The new map introduced in Shadow of the Erdtree has some of the most visually striking and mechanically engaging areas From has ever created.

The combat remains flawless—challenging, rewarding, and endlessly customizable. The new weapons, spells, and gear breathe fresh life into an already deep combat system. Elden Ring and its expansion provide an experience that adapts to your playstyle and pushes you to master its intricacies.

The storytelling—both environmental and direct—is masterful. Cryptic yet resonant, the lore of the Lands Between and the tragic figures within it are as captivating as ever. The expansion deepens the already intricate narrative, introducing new mysteries and revelations that will keep us theorizing for years.

Simply put, Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree are a triumph of game design. They represent the pinnacle of what an open-world game should be: an experience that respects the player's intelligence, rewards curiosity, and offers an unparalleled sense of adventure.

If you haven't played Elden Ring, there's never been a better time. And if you have, Shadow of the Erdtree will remind you why this world is worth losing yourself in all over again.

There is basically only a few people alive randomly placed in the world who are not trying to kill you. No village, no farms where people trying to stay alive, just a dead empty land. And most of them cleary have deep depressions and should visite a therapist.

To me this story is the most empty/soulless game i have played so far. 99% of the time I just run around clueless to discover places and try to find the mainbosses. 

If you look for a good story and introduction with the difficulty of Elden Ring, I would recommend ""Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order"" instead. There you have a proper intro, cinematics, and a freaking reason why you do what you do and why you go to whatever places. If you want to checkmark one of the most popular games in the world to have fun talks with friends - then have fun with this.

Oh but I love the unique way the people can leave messages for others in a unique way, either warn them / help them or fool them. I think that's an unique and awesome future i haven't seen in a game so far and i love it.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 10:39:28
"I enjoyed it for almost two hundred hours so it's a good game.
But!
It's very different from DS, as the open world kind of fight a bit against what I normally would do there.

In DS I found nice to make new characters and test new builds, as once you know what to do it's fairly easy to finish the game from beginning to end. This was extremely true for og DS, less true for DS2 and again relatively true for DS3.

Instead in Elden ring everything is scattered around, there is a lot of repetition that normally in DS you wouldn't see so it gets a bit more tiring running again with a new character.

But again, the world is very vast and finish the game is going to take a while anyway, so there is that :)

"Standard FROM game with fantastic exploration and challenges

Pros:
Fun open world with lots to explore, ton's of secrets 
an immersive story if you want to excavate it! 
Decent amount of build types

Cons: 
Every boss has a 1 hit kill combo - So if you don't co-op you better git gud! If that's not your idea of fun this game isn't for you! 
Re-skinned enemies // bosses // areas - big world but be prepared to see the same thing over and over
1000 useless craftable Items!
No cohesion for NPC stories - they're just kind of everywhere and you're expected to cross the map over and over again to find them all
Most fun items/armour are locked into late game 30+ hr

A decent attempt at an open world game - but do not mistake this for Dark souls and its intertwined world building - This is something entirely different, and that's ok!

"One of the best games ever made in my humble opinion. As somebody who had never experienced a game like ER before, i looked at this genre with confusion and disinterest. My friend group used to be really into the Dark Souls games and i never got it. After taking a chance on this game it has opened my mind to what a story game should be. It tells its story through not only cut scenes and character dialog, but also through the bosses you encounter and the items you run into. This game also doesn't care if you missed a side boss or not, it simply lets you play how you want to, After re-buying this game on pc(originally played my first run through on ps5) i have no regrets and have loved every second of this journey.

"Elden Ring is rightfully showered with praise and considered a masterpiece for good reason. Elden Ring is so good, in fact, that upon reaching Radahn I decided to go back to the earlier souls games and experience those before continuing. It's not perfect, however.

Rather than join the choir of those singing it's praises, I'll point out some shortcomings that you may or may not be aware of.

Elden Ring is like walking into a sweet shop of different weapons and fun goodies to choose from except for some reason the rigid upgrade system and respec roadblocks make it as difficult as possible to actually experiment with all of this without mods. Elden Ring feels like it actively punishes experimentation rather than reward it. This, for me, is easily the biggest frustration with the game, and it's something that was an issue in the Dark Souls trilogy, too.

The co-op system sucks, but this is entirely fixed with a simple to install mod. I have no idea why FromSoft has not just implemented this themselves. You may also need to install another mod to increase the difficulty of Co-op since having two players can make the game much easier.

To get an FPS above 60, you once again need to install a mod. 

A lot of bosses will come up repeatedly which can get a little boring after a while. This can be forgiven given the scale of the game, but you do end up rolling your eyes a bit when you see yet another Crucible Knight (I've seen three by the time I get to Radahn).

Put simply, to get the most out of Elden Ring i would highly suggest tweaking the experience slightly to get over some of these shortcomings. If you're willing to put in a little work, it will pay off.",True,0,0,2025-02-12 21:13:31

"What an amazing game,
I just finished it, I never played a From Soft before except Sekiro.
I don't have the words to begin to describe all the feelings that it gave my during this unique adventure.
It reconciled me with solo games, open worlds, exploration.
This game lit back the flame of my dying passion for gaming that has been slowly tarnished over the years because of bad experiences, too many multiplayer and adulthood.
If you ever sat in front of you PC looking at your hundreds of games library  you never played without any desire to play any. Nostalgic of your childhood gaming memories when it was simpler less overwhelming when gaming bringed you true joy and excitement.
That´s what this game did to me. It gave me back my childhood like memory of the wonders and magic of gaming at this time. Wanting to explore, go further push my limits, understand the game and this mechanics to get better and the reward of progressing in a new world.

But now that it is almost over (I fortunately still have the DLC to do) I can't shake the feeling that I will never be able to experience this ever again for the first time.
All of the exploration, the thrill of new enemy, environment or bosses. 
I'm already feeling nostalgic and a bit sad.

"Gameplay is amazing and is why you should get this.

Storytelling is horrendous and anyone saying otherwise is insane. Without searching things on the internet you could easily miss ~30% of the games content because of how terrible it is at instructing you what to do (because it doesn't).

For example, in a fairly hard to reach underground area, you find a doll. You are supposed to somehow know that you're supposed to rest at a specific site of grace, try to talk to the doll not once, not twice, but thrice, then it will talk back and tell you to kill an enemy that is somewhere in the region. After killing it, if drops a key and it doesn't tell you what it's for. You're supposed to know that it's to open a chest that's in the room of a boss you probably killed 30 hours ago. This chest gives you an item that opens a path for blocked area in a far away boss room. This path brings you to a part of the map, representing probably 5-10% of the total Elden Rings map surface area, for you to explore. 

I refuse to believe anyone was able to piece this all together in a vacuum, unless they spent thousands of hours trying every random ass thing to progress the questline.

The expected level of challenge and difficulty will keep avid players engaged and new players crying and wondering why you are so incapable (the learning curve we all must go through). A massive map leaves no shortage of interesting geography and secrets to explore. Online play functions well (mostly), and the amount of current players is more than adequate to either lend a helping hand or rend you of your expectations.

Visual and aesthetic is very on point and captures the atmosphere of the whole story line really well.

I loved every bit of The Elden Ring, since I have been a souls fan for years.

Amazing mechanics, massive confusing world but also very beautiful. Story was good but it could be better, but let's be honest it wasn't about story but the gameplay and becoming GUD. Every main boss is unique and hard to fight. A lot of enemies are also super annoying but this game makes it worthwhile, once you finish it and make it until the end then I hope you understand.

"while fromsoftware has earned a reputation for releasing difficult games, elden ring stands out for its relative accessibility. overall, it’s definitely one of the more welcoming titles in fromsoftware's catalog. for example, the generous checkpointing system cuts down on the tedious boss runbacks that plagued earlier fromsoftware games, making progression much smoother. its open-world design also means there are fewer rigid roadblocks, enabling players to explore freely and tackle challenges at their own pace. while the boss fights can be tough, the satisfaction of victory makes them all the more rewarding. overcoming challenges is a huge part of what makes soulslike games so compelling, and elden ring strikes a careful balance between punishing difficulty and fair progression, ensuring that players feel challenged without getting hopelessly stuck.

The game isn’t just an open world it’s an adventure that you will see and never forget.

I absolutely love this game and I wish I had realized that sooner. I've owned the game for about two years but really only have played it in these past few months. I had originally gotten the game after playing it at a friends house. I played it for a little while after that but quickly realized how hard it truly was and quit not too long after beating Renala. So after almost a full two years later I was inspired to get back on the game with  the announcement of Nightreign. And boy that was the best decision of my life. I had been in a spot of not having any games I wanted to play and nothing new seemed good. And this game was the saving grace of my boredom.

"What can I say about this game?

It's simply CINEMA!

It perfected all the elements of the previous games, getting the strong points right and fixing the mistakes that already existed. I believe that the addition of the Torrent and the jumping mechanics have greatly influenced the gameplay style of the game. In terms of additions, we can talk about the game's new facilitators, the summons and the war ashes, which I believe have helped a lot with the discussion about soulslike having an easy mode, so much so that a large part of the game's new fan base came about because of this addition of facilitators, showing that everyone can and should play games like this.
The artwork is wonderful, and the soundtrack as impeccable as ever, really conveying the feeling of the bosses and the new areas, which, by the way, are very different from most soulslike games.

The level design remains as immersive and detailed as ever, with the addition of new challenges, the dungeons, which create a good immersion with the game and help the player level up and upgrade very well. Another addition is the grace indicator on top of the bonfires, which helps the player's exploration a lot, even though the presence of Tervore already serves as a guide throughout the game.

The special thing about the game is that the Bosses, from start to finish, whether primary or secondary, are all incredible, both in cutscenes (when they exist) and in movesets, favorites aside, but Bosses like Maliketh and General Radahn totally steal the show and are much more striking than the final Boss himself, for example.
Finally, I got to play the DLC, not completely, defeating Mesmer and then taking a break, and I have to say that it's really very good, it's a bit expensive, but if you fell in love with the base game, you'll definitely like this expansion!

Just play it!",True,0,0,2025-02-07 02:41:33
"Fantastic stuff!
Elden Ring fixes the 1 thing that I could never defend in their other games : the damn walk back.

Cool soundtrack and a absolutely stunning map full of stuff to explore and see

"Never played a Souls like game after the original Dark Souls, which I never finished. I fell in love with this game, with its world, with its storytelling, with the sense of exploration, but most of all, what I love is how this game teaches you to think. Not every enemy in sight needs to be killed, what matters is how to achieve your objective. How to find paths, weaknesses, when to fight, how to fight, and when to come back later, stronger, with a different weapon, different items or summons, all rewards for natural exploration.

It isn't perfect, it reuses some themes and dungeons a lot (such as imp-filled catacombs), though they often come with a twist. Bosses are also recycled, again, with a twist, but recycled nonetheless. It feels as if its ambitions overstretched its resources, and there was not enough time and money to do it 100% justice. But they did it 90% justice, and that 90% is absolutely worth every hour, every death, every ragequit. It rewards you like few other games, both in terms of lore and worldbuilging, and with that sweet rush of figuring out a harsh boss or how to get through a tough area. Build diversity is immense, and replayability is substantial.

Highly recommend, 9/10",True,0,0,2025-02-06 21:04:51

"Probably my favorite game. The atmosphere and lore of the game is top notch. The gameplay is fun and exciting. If you are a Dark Souls it should feel familiar, but there were definitley some upgrades. The most notable one is the the array of spells and ecantations. Another notable difference is the multiplayer in the game. Though I still recommend the seamless co-op mod, you can mostly get by with the base multiplayer functions in the game. Also, a feature that is unique to Elden Ring is the plethora of dungeons that you get to adventure through while going through the map

There is so much to say about this game. For me it feels like skyrim and dark souls had a love child. It was the perfect balance of exploration for adventurer-type gamers, and hard-hitting action packed fights for sweaty gamers looking for an actual challenge.  Whether you are a souls veteran or a newcomer trying to start out in the sub-genre, I can vehemently recommend this game for anyone and everyone who wants a fun fantasy game to play.

"Elden Ring is the kind of game I just never wanted to play. What's the point of playing these insanely hard games that do nothing but beat you down over and over again? There has to be something about these games that is satisfying and enjoyable in them right? 

Theses are just a few of the questions I asked myself when I originally bought this game on Xbox. And boy did I ever find the answers to the questions. 

What I find most enjoyable about Elden Ring is the freedom it gives to let you play how you want. Sure that's an easy answer but its also true. This game challenges you to be better than you were before. It wants you to overcome the things you struggle to do. And once I played and beat my first ever soulsbourne boss, it clicked. No other game has given me the satisfaction of beating what lied ahead of me. it made sense as to why I see people struggle for hours to beat this game (my hours don't reflect my first ever play through). 

If FromSoft games seem intimidating its because they are. It isn't easy. But once you beat the first boss, nothing and I mean nothing, can stop you from continuing on and beating the game.

"I liked the gameplay.

I did not like the hassle of having to set up CRU to make Freesync Premium, HDR and AFMF play the game at 120hz on my TCLQ750 television.  In the end, I have been able to get it to work over HDMI 2.1 with Freesync, VRR, HDR10, HGIG and Dolby Vision, with this television.  It has a few issues with HDR; I have to patch it through to the TV directly and mess with a ton of EDID settings. And then it only runs well at 1440p with frame generation.  

I have made 120hz work WITHOUT the Elden Ring FPS unlocker, and 240hz work WITH the FPS unlocker. 4k over HDMI 2.1 seems to trigger the anti cheat even offline, and things like Hoarfrost stomp seem to stop rendering almost entirely.  Possibly because TMDS is too fast over HDMI 2.1.  I can get the game to work with Windows set to 8 and 10 bit colors, both RGB and YbCbR, but cannot confirm what color bitrate or colorimetry settings the game itself uses.

CRU custom EDIDs allow for the HDR in game to actually report to the television which is nice, and custom EDIDs are probably mandatory for 120hz frame gen with HDR anyways.  My TV supports both VRR and Freesync which is frustrating, and I am not sure Freesync itself is compatible entirely with HDMI 2.1, nor the game. There are loads of contrasting features that can go wrong and the entire system becomes more sensitive than scientific machinery, BUT, when it is working the HDR looks spectacular, especially at 1440p with frame generation. AFMF simply doubles the frames steam spits out, but the reporting back from the television to the game may be what is causing issues. 

Not that it NEEDS a 120hz solution, but at 1440p it is nice when my 1% lows are above 60fps, or even 120fps with the frame unlocker.  You literally have to hack the game for each different scene, and adjust colors for everything gaming on these TVs, and on top of that this television is barely functional compared to an LG television with secret HDR menus. 

Great game, and I wish I could play this online, but with how difficult it is to get HDR to work correctly in Windows, with its SDR to HDR scaling in Windows 11, or just plain not 100% functional in Windows 10 (which is much better to work with imo) due to colorimetry and shit having 8-way switches for every setting under the sun, I think it needs more attention from developers or maybe a multi-gpu solution or reshade to keep it stable at default 60fps settings everywhere.

"Having played over 500 hours on ps4 and now played over 70 hours on PC, I guess I recommend this game to others. This is a once of a lifetime gaming experience that I have ever had the pleasure of going through and my favourite game of all time as of its' release. I could write an entire essay about EVERYTHING that I liked about this Fromsoftwares' Magnum Opus, but I will try to keep it simple. Besides I doubt I can do it justice, unlike people who have made hour long videos explaining why it's so great.
From the world to the music, art, lore, bosses, environments is simply superb. If this is your first souls game, enjoy this religious experience, as I wish I could re-live it again back in 2022. Please do not spoil yourself. Have a fun ~160 hour journey through The Lands Between and become The Elden Lord.
PS - if you have a ps5, play the ps4 version on it for a steady 60fps. For this type of game you really need a stable framerate. Unfortunately, the PC version still has quite a few frame drops in wide shot places.

"So this is my second fromsoft game, the first being dark souls 1, & while this is no DS1, it's still overall a very fun experience for the most part. I know Lordran like the back of my hand, but especially considering just how large the lands between are, I've no interest in learning this game to the same degree. There are so many caves and catacombs that, while all a fun individual experience, the design for most of them don't stand out enough to make them very memorable. The story also is also something where I feel like it's lacking compared to their previous efforts. I feel like I have a very good grasp on the lore, world, etc of DS1. The game provides a lot of information about these things from cutscenes, npc dialogue, the flavor text in item descriptions, & even just the layout of lordran itself that paint the broad strokes of the history of the world & you can get really invested in this lore, creating theories and headcanons to flesh stuff out between the lines, & I assume Elden Ring is roughly going for the same approach, but I still have so many things I don't really understand yet, but I admit that this could be a skill issue on my part. I don't really get the motivation of the Tarnished. Like, yeag, the elden ring was shattered but, so what? Why does that matter? Like, the fire in the kiln of the first flame going out has consequences for its world & the people that live w/in it. As the chosen undead, you stand at an important point in history: will you succeed gwyn & continue the age of fire, which is realistically just buying time for the status quo to keep being upheld until the flame dims again & another person will take your place; or do you start the age of dark: where humans are the ones w/ power like the gods before them & the dragons before them. But what are the stakes in elden ring? why does it matter that godwyn was killed in the night of black knives? I understand what grafting is since we literally see godrick do it in his second phase cutscene, but like, how does he have that power? Is it just something gods or demigods can do? But like, why? Just to invoke some of the body horror of bloodborne? Why does the fire giant cutting off his leg activate the second face that's on his chest and make him more powerful? Marika is married to godfrey, the first elden lord, but then gets married to radagon instead but also she's radagon, and somehow radagon and marika despite being the same person but w/ exact oppostie goals, ideals, etc, give birth to miquella who is also st trina, and malenia & others, or w/e & I realize this sentence isn't really going anywhere but neither does elden ring. At least based on only 1 playthrough, the story feels like an excuse to just have something, anything, so that there's a world that can check off the requirements for the same game design that fromsoft has been doing for over a decade. & yet, I""m okay w/ that. The fromsoft formula is mostly fun & that is still true in elden ring. I had a lot of fun feeling my character grow stronger & fight the cool bosses (except for fire giant & elden beast, which I loathed on my first playthrough. boring ass fights that also take forever bc of way too large health pools). Did I need to fight some of the same bosses copy & pasted but w/ damage & health numbers adjusted to make them harder later into the game? No, but this isn't an issue unique to elden ring. For example, that's like, bethesda's entire game design philosophy for fallout & elder scrolls. Overall: fromsoft made a big open world game that has the usual flaws of big open word games.

It initially felt weird being able to jump for the first time, but I quickly got used to that.

The crafting system's neat as well, and it can come in a pinch if you need to make anything like consumables or arrows. A lot of the weapons are really interesting too, and I personally like to run a dual Uchigatana build with the Reduvia as a backup for my first/main build.
As of writing this, I'm not too far into the game's story (only about mid-game), but it's been a ton of fun and I'm enjoying every second; save from a few times where I got my ass beat by some specific bosses, however that's primarily because I suffer from skill issue.

The world is fun to explore with lots of things hidden in all the nooks and crannies. The endgame gets a little repetitive, without many new enemies in the very, very late areas, but I don't think that's a deal-breaker (it still far surpasses the later areas in Dark Souls 1, in my opinion).
The game also plays very differently from previous From Software titles (i.e. Dark Souls 3). The ""stance"" mechanic rewards you for using a mixture of attack types instead of just spamming light attacks. It adds a whole additional layer of strategy to the combat, which I really enjoy. That said, I do think there's a steep learning curve here, and the game could do more to teach the player about this brand new mechanic. The inner-workings of the mechanic are hidden from the player's view, so it can be difficult to know how to use it at first.

This actually in turn makes it more fun to explore more and enjoy the scenery and graphics since it's an open world. Honestly Elden Ring in a nutshell is - Fight die repeat. Choosing a specific class at the start does not restrict the playthrough as the stats can be played around with to explore different builds and be creative with boss fights and dungeons. Summoning players to help with dungeons made the game easier and enjoyable. In the end, the grind never stops :) Eat, sleep, Be Tarnished & repeat",True,0,0,2025-02-01 06:05:31

"The game runs better on console, but with a decent PC it runs well enough. Although I've only played 31 hours at the making of this comment, I've actually played well over 200 hours on console in addition to this. The replayability is great, with a great selection of viable builds. The open world can be a little annoying to ride through if you have a specific destination in mind, but if you're simply exploring, it's great. The world is packed to the brim with ruins, camps, churches, villages, catacombs, caves, forts, castles, and other weird but fun phenomena. However, the game also hides a lot of things away, which is both good and bad. On one hand, if you find those hidden spots, it's cool to go in and explore and find a new weapon or cool armor. On the other hand, it's mildly irritating when you look up a tutorial and realize that there was a whole area that you never found because you had to jump across half a dozen ledges that looked like they were not meant to be jumped on. My only other complaint would be a few bosses-specifically, Margit and Morgott, and the Fire Giant. These bosses are all cool, but they all have one or two attacks that make it more of a roll of the dice to see whether you die than something based off of your skills.",True,0,0,2025-02-01 05:07:37

The first thing you see when you step into the world is the beauty of the enviorments, stunning colorful visuals and outstanding sights.
Other standout thing is the soundtrack of the battles that plays during some of the fights, is it either intense and dramatic or slow melancholic sound that match the feeling.
Speaking of bosses they were breathtaking, with variety of different creatures like monsters, imps, dragons and etc., challenging to this point where you enjoy it.

The exploration is ginormous, after every time you feel that you got to the end, you realize how further you can actually go on.

This game is an experience!  The challenge is real, but the sense of accomplishment that comes after that is incredibly satisfying.

But in all honesty, this game is the pinnacle of action RPG's in so many ways, and I've only barely scratched the surface of what seems to be a rather large scale endeavor. The game world and lore is weird and unique enough to certainly be memorable (their fascination with fingers cracks me up).

The graphics are great enough to give you plenty of ""Whoa"" moments. Ray Tracing and HDR technologies are done well here. It also ran perfectly well on my non-RT GTX1070 and looked just fine on my non-HDR display.

Great sounds. Epic orchestral scores for music. Top Quality here with the audio.

"My very first souls game. I had friends try to introduce me to the previous titles, specifically Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. I only played with friends and never gave them a fair chance on my own. I, like many people, had the biased belief that these games were unnecessarily difficult and I didn't think I'd enjoy the worlds. Elden Ring proved me very wrong. 

The gameplay can be difficult but it is absolutely necessary. It is simply a challenge, and they give you many tools and methods to get over said challenge. Trial and error. The world and lore/story is beautiful and wonderful to explore and learn about. Many people say Elden Ring does not have a story, and I find that wildly insane. It has a very rich and engaging story, it's just told to you in a different way. It's easy to ignore the details and just try and run quickly through areas, but really taking a moment and analyzing the sounds and your surroundings can tell you so much about the area you're in and the people that inhabited it. But so much of the plot I feel is told directly to you. The dialogue can be confusing since they use almost a Shakespearean type dialogue. But I feel like it's pretty easy to figure out what they mean, and there's always google. 

I get how people don't like how co-op and PVP is integrated. It does take a lot of extra steps that other games stream line. Personally I think the extra steps are cool, because it applies lore reasons to how/why this is possible. But at the same time, that cool factor diminishes frequentlly. My same criticism applies for how you respec your character. Having a finite amount of the item required to respec is kinda silly. I get why they do it, but it was kind of a headache to go find all of them just so I could try this really cool weapon/spell/incantation I just got. 

All in all Elden Ring is one of the very few games I would say is a 10/10.

At times haunting, sad, thrilling, or funny, Elden ring is a game of truly impressive scale, that still manages a neat balance of level design and scope.

"Ah Elden Ring, a beautiful game that I can't help but have conflicted feelings on. I have 200ish hours on console and recently purchased on Steam. It is a game that has some fantastic moments, beautiful vistas, and extremely refined mechanics, but I cannot call the best From Software title. Many of the enemies have long combos and delayed attacks designed to catch the Soulsborne veteran off guard. Some of the level design also falls short due to the scale and open nature of the game so it does not have the same perfectionism found in other titles. Overall I highly recommend, but feel it is still only their third best game I have played, behind Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2.",True,0,0,2025-01-28 22:55:20

"As I’m gearing up to embark on my DLC journey, I thought there was no better time to review the game! And let me tell you, Elden Ring is a grueling, exhilarating, life-changing gaming experience. At first, it feels like you're being punished for simply existing in its world, but by the end, you’ll have transformed into someone who’s learned to embrace the chaos (or the frenzy for some of us).

In my years of gaming, I don’t remember a better feeling than beating Malenia after 80+ tries. I’ve never wanted to throw my controller out of a window so many times and still have it feel so incredibly rewarding when I finally saw her fall. I basically spent an entire week in a state of heightened anxiety, occasionally questioning my life choices.

This game made me improve as a gamer and gave me a new approach to Souls games. I remember giving up on both Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne because of the difficulty. But after finishing Elden Ring? Oh, I went back with a vengeance. (Still working on DS2, though... we're not on the best of terms, but I’m making progress.)

So, if you enjoy getting bonked, knocked down and embarassed, only to get up and realize you’ve become a better, more resilient gamer... Elden Ring is your ticket to an emotional rollercoaster that you won’t be able to get off of until you've seen the credits roll, then immediately cry as you start on New Game+.

I first purchased the game in June of 2024, completely new to the Souls-like genre, with no idea what I was getting into. Fast forward to January of 2025, and I decided to revisit it. What followed has been nothing short of a gaming obsession. Over the past 2.5 weeks, I’ve already logged over 40 hours, and I’m still nowhere near completing everything the game has to offer. There’s so much to explore, so many bosses to defeat, and an incredible amount of lore to uncover.

From the breathtaking world design to the challenging combat and unforgettable boss fights, every aspect of this game keeps pulling me back in. There’s a sense of satisfaction with every step, every battle, and every victory. If you’ve been on the fence about trying it out, I can’t recommend it enough - buy it.

"Of course, the first few hours are just about learning the basics of the game, especially when it comes to the scale of Elden Ring. Basically a completely new control system, and here is the first disappointment regarding the game. What's really annoying is that you have to manually change whether the game should show you keyboard or controller controls. Which is even more annoying and stupid after realizing that the entire Dark Souls trilogy had no problems with this and adapted to the chosen control device. So just starting the game wasn't very pleasant for me. I know every Soulsborne on PC has this, but damn it it's so hard to unlock frames in the game, finally add the ability to use alt tab normally, and fix how fucked up Elden Ring is when it comes to streaming this game. But after, let's say, ""getting over"" these two bugs that shouldn't even exist, I could move on to enjoying the game. It was definitely a big surprise for me how different this game is from my experience with Dark Souls, at this early stage of the game it seems very fairy-tale, open at a very early stage. And the openness of the world is something worth discussing in my opinion when it comes to this game. At a very early stage (before killing Margit), it seems to me that Fromsoftware seems to give too much freedom to an inexperienced player. The game simply opens up the world to the player, showing you in the tutorial how to kill a squire, only to encounter an elite knight thirty minutes later who has us two swings of his sword. Chaos is the word that was used to describe Elden Ring, sometimes senseless and unpredictable at the very beginning, because that's the only thing I experienced before my computer crashed. And I haven't mentioned much about purely technical problems. In addition, if I didn't have enough problems, the game has absolutely poor performance, maybe it's because the game doesn't work with the first processor core (Core 0), or maybe my specific processor settings, I don't know, I can't check it until I have a working computer . What's more, the game kept throwing me to the desktop every few dozen minutes, which was incredibly irritating, especially since I had to stream the entire screen, so I had to manually change scenes so that my more private things were not visible. The technical condition in which I played this game is an absolute joke, especially since the game is not an example of the graphic capabilities of modern games, but rather a sales hit with mediocre graphics at best and a terrible technical condition. So based on my impressions of the game so far, I rate it very negatively, especially since these are problems that I have never heard anyone talking about Elden Ring mention. I haven't had any time to get to know the game, but I know that when I play it and can play it normally (without the problems described above), I will be happy with it. But these shortcomings and technical problems prevent me from giving a positive rating to this game.

I would recommend if you do play, to look up a beginners guide because trying to figure out how to progress without some outside assistance requires trial and error and randomly stumbling upon major game mechanics that can make the new player experience easier.

"I love Souls Games and I got into them specifically after hearing about this game. I had DS3 for some reason and I told myself if I could beat that, I could justify getting this game. Unfortunately I really do not care for this game after playing it. (It lacks quite a bit when it comes to the things that really make a game for me such as interesting plot and fun gameplay). It hurts to say this but I really don't care for it. It has been the 1 soulslike experience i've disliked after playing DS1, DS3, and Bloodborne. Anyways lets start with the positives.

Pros:
-Beautiful
-Thought Out
-Build Variety
-Lots of shit to do

This game is incredibly pretty and detailed. It is an absolute marvel to look at. I loved looking at all of the landscapes and pretty colors. Fromsoft clearly took a lot of time to plan out this game and that is something I can really appreciate. While I don't care for the story, I can still appreciate all of its intricacies and complexities. Along this train of thought, the build variety is amazing. Most things are viable which is really how an RPG should approach things. The last big great thing about the game is its map. There is so much to do and it is really easy to sink a ton of time into it.

Cons:
-Uninteresting Story
-Unoriginal
-Atrocious Difficulty Scaling
-Repetitiveness

This may be a hot take but I really do not care for the story. It is told in such a way that without  prior knowledge (people telling you what is going on) it is pretty unclear. Even after looking into the plot multiple times, I keep forgetting it because I find it genuinely uninteresting. It can also be really hard to follow when everybodys name sounds the same although I get why its like this. It also feels a little unoriginal. It just feels like open world dark souls if the souls games had a bright atmosphere. This is probably just nitpicking but I wish we could get something that isn't just a medieval fantasy souls like. Now for the biggest problem. The difficulty scaling is absolutely ass. Beyond ass even. In all of the other games you feel the progression. The bosses typically get harder enough to pose a challenge that feels like it should. Naturally progressive. There are spikes here and there but it always feels perfectly paced. This game really struggles with that. It feels impossible to discover a challenge at the perfect time to fight it. Every encounter I was either severely underlevelled or overlevelled. There were no fights where I met my match. This left me with an incredibly unsatisfying feeling every time I beat a boss. It was either ""well that was a bore"", or ""i'm gonna go drop 50K on roulette because how the fuck"".  No kills felt like they were thanks to skill which is incredibly disappointing because I come to these games for the dopamine hit of getting gud. One of my other big gripes with the game is the constant reuse of bosses to fill the world. Night's cavalry was awesome the first time. The second time was still cool as I felt ready to take on the challenge. By the 10th time however.... This shit again? I would have much rather had a world less full of reused bosses.

In conclusion this is an opinion that few seem to hold, but I would not recommend this game, especially if it is your first soulslike. At least start off with something small. For now just watch videos on this game and go play something amazing like Bloodborne. Then maybe give this one a shot after reading some other reviews :).",False,1,0,2025-02-07 08:32:11

"This game is the epitome of dark souls 2s design philosophy: ""Make it as hard as possible regardless of fairness.""

In Dark Souls/Demon Souls when you died, it always felt like your fault. Very rarely would you think ""Well that's bullshit"". This game, however, is ALL bullshit. Input reading, delayed attacks to a ridiculous degree, HYPER agression, HUGE health pools, Attack combos that never seem to end. It's the apex bs tryhard game. 

In the past, fromsofts games were ""Tough but fair"". Elden ring is difficulty for difficulties sake to an absurd degree, and fairness is simply nowhere to be seen. The studio has gone hollow, and the worst part is that its mainstream popularity means it's never going to change.

And before anyone says ""git gud"" I've beaten every single boss except for radahn. After I beat Malenia (17 tries) I realized I was simply not having any fun, and that feeling of triumph was completely gone. When the DLC released I had no interest until a few months later when I saw they added martial arts. So I decided to give it a try and see what it was like. It was so much worse. I'm sorry I ever returned to this bs slog of a game.

On top of all of this, they absolutely ruined the pvp. No longer can I get invaded while playing the game. I have to use items to allow someone to invade, but EVEN THEN, multiplayer has priority so I don't get invaded at all anyway. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this trash fire of a game.

farm runes

stomp on everything
move to the next area
get crushed

it really puts things into perspective.

Despite saying that, I have to admit, the story is great. The problem is that it is more into the aspect of exploring yourself. The story telling in the game is minimal, with the least dialogues as possible, without much guidance, leaving the room for you to freely collect clues, small pieces of lore (which are usually very vague, and give minimal information) and glue everything together yourself. Some may argue this way of story telling is masterpiece, but personally I don't like it.
Due to these, it brings up another problem, to enjoy the story thoroughly, you have to go around and fight bosses. So if you are not good at action game and just want to enjoy the story, you will have a hard time to advance.
That is it about the story aspect of the game. If you are not into a ""vague style"" of story telling, and don't have patient collecting small pieces of information, or not into action-focus gameplay, this may not be suitable for you.",False,23,14,2025-02-16 11:02:26
"I want to like Elden Ring, it feels weird being in the odd 8% out of atleast steam reviews but if nothing else this'll be a personal subjective thing more than objectivity. [b]I don't personally own Erdtree, I don't plan to own erdtree, and I have no intentions of playing it instead of saving the money for another future title, this will just be my experiences with the basegame.[/b]

Going to also preface that objectively this game is actually pretty good, and more than worth atleast one playthrough's worth of an experience, though not at $60 or the 80 that SOTE edition is marked at.

A few pros for me: [olist]
[*]Game is pretty damn well optimized for what it is, something that's a rarity nowadays and can be beautified at your own risk using third party software.

[*]Combat is relatively pretty fun, but this is also going to be a con later in regards to Balancing, the overall scope of combat however is impressively flexible and offers more than what other games had before.

[*]The locations are varied and for the most part visually stunning, there is no denying that the art design team is the lead carry for what this series is and this has been proven time and time again in Fromsoft's history.

[*]It was functional on launch. Again. Huge for the year it released. Not just on optimizing but there's very few things that will break, crash, or outright cause anything negative to your PC like overheating or using more resources than it should to render things from halfway across the game world.
[/olist]

And now the part that'll lead to the searing backlash, the Cons, because yes this game has flaws and some are Glaring:[olist]
[*]The OST is probably the most disappointing in this game compared to any other modern release made by fromsoft. Where there's a good boss track, there's usually 3 filler tracks for other bosses and then an unnerving amount of silence while exploring that immediately follows. There isn't much any track that comes close to the titanic original boss tracks like for; Knight Artorias, Darkeater Midir, or Fume Knight. If we want to use base game comparisons only, there's still a lacking comparison in Elden Ring to tracks like; Dks2's The Rotten giving a true unnerving dark choir tune, Dks3's Soul of Cinder being a highlight capstone basegame final boss track, and Dks1's classic original ""Get filtered"" track of Ornstein and Smough.

[*]Balancing is a mess. Was a mess, still is not great. Where there's over 80+ weapons, spells, and combinations of weapon arts, there's bound to be parts that are bordering-if-not-entirely unusable. It's always been that way even with darksouls as a series, here it's arguably the worst it has ever been, even worse than SOTFS as you'll find yourself using maybe only 12 - 15 of these for all non challenge/non meme runs you find yourself in with very little flexibility for the harder bosses. I won't speak for PvP, that's not my wheelhouse and I won't lie about it.

[*]Meaningless Open World, where it's beautiful to look at there's a lot of distance to cover that feels empty, vapid, and all around pointless to have as a whole. I'm not asking for them to imitate other games and have my screen constantly flooded with new minigames, sidequest chains, and small encounters that derail the entire experience, I also don't want to praise an open world that doesn't make good use of the space. Very few bosses will ever use the open world as a setpiece, and even fewer will use a little more than what Sekiro did for Demon of Hatred, it's a missed opportunity to make the world feel [b]Alive[/b] in a good way for gameplay.

[*]Co-op here sucks. I said it. Where there was a lot of potential here, it's broken apart by being limited as the darksouls classic summoning system, right down to being mostly unable to go much farther than certain segments of the map and having to resummon constantly anytime there's a zone transition. Sure you can fix this with seamless co-op, you can also risk getting banned from the mainstream online experience just to fix what Fromsoft should have had already implemented by launch day for a game of this scale.
[/olist]


In a tl;dr here; I don't hate Elden Ring, but I think this is one of the weakest Souls-like entries that Fromsoft has presented, with weaknesses that made me revisit Dks2:SOTFS and praise some of its' design choices versus some of the half hearted choices that ER had given. Coupled with arguably the same level of flaws as there are praiseworthy points, I'd say the money is better off experiencing the classics - if you haven't already.


5/10 from me, I'm not upset with this game I'm just disappointed.",False,9,3,2025-02-13 13:49:25
Boring open world. 90% of it is meaningless. All you get are flowers and rocks you will never use.,False,1,0,2025-02-14 10:00:05
"this game is pretty terrible, played 120 hours and realized if u want to pvp on even terms u have to have the dlc weapons and items. everyone is using gimmicks like sleep arrows from short bow or ultra poise builds. basically unless u want to memorize every item and put in 1000 hours u wont have fun in pvp. this games fuckin gay compared to ds3",False,3,4,2025-02-05 09:53:48
"- A lot of copy and pasted fights.
- Not even sure if the game had a story, character side quests desperately need a quest guide to save you from needing the wiki open.
- Combat is pretty 1 dimensional, you have one real response to any boss attack, rolling. Didn't make for interesting fights if you have to respond in the exact same way to whatever is thrown at you.

If you're already into Dark Souls game you'll probably love it, but if they never clicked previously don't expect this one to either.",False,13,9,2025-02-02 16:03:01
Did not enjoy. Mostly a slash/dodge game. Extremely difficult. Found the constant deaths to be frustrating.,False,1,6,2025-02-19 18:12:25
"The art of this game is truly amazing, but there is too much AOE bullshit. I love souls games difficulties, but the amount of AOE attacks that can instantly one shot you is ridiculous which does not make for fun boss fights. Also, the amount of time to punish a boss for its 20 attack combo is too short. 

Please tell me how this game is very good in the comments, I am genuinely interested and would like to see what ya'll think of the game and why it's good.",False,0,1,2025-02-19 04:52:14
"unplayable, literally constantly crashes, I cannot play the game at all and i wasted my money on it, would not reccomend to anybody",False,1,2,2025-02-15 18:09:20
"Very good game. Except for the fact that Steam wants to close Elden Ring every time I reach somewhere of convenience. Such fucking bullshit, somehow enrages me more than dying to Godskin Noble 1000 times. Why must you make it so hard to play your game? It doesn't even give me an error window, and I've tried every fix. Absolutely ridiculous.",False,0,0,2025-02-08 07:23:23
