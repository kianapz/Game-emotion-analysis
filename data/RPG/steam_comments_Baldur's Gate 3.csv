RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"bnote this review came out very late because baldur's game 3 is something you just can't rush. i really wanted to know my final thoughts after not replaying it once, but trying different stories, paths, and modes like honour mode. this review is late but i feel i finally have gathered my thoughts.b h1ulegendary masterpieceuh1 just no other way of saying it. larian studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games i had the pleasure playing in. it is incredible on so many levels, i actually have a hard time believing it even exits. now there's definitely some flaws with it, not a true perfect game, but it's as close as you can imagine. h1ugameplayuh1 it really plays out like you're in a dnd 5e tabletop, but beyond what most would had expected. it didn't just make an adaption or inspiration it's a love letter to dnd 5e and i'm here for it. gameplay is very smooth, feels great with mouse and keyboard, plus so much to do both in and outside combat. sure the turn based combat is the main sell, but it's also got a lot more going for it, and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles, npcs, and finding secrets it's all here. it's probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market. h1ugraphics and storyuh1 game is breathtaking, and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go. all locations and settings in this world is brimming with life, and i love how the characters are designed too. so much effort went into how the game looks, and it's marvelous to behold seeing for yourself. the writing is straight up fire. every quest, every arc in acts 1, 2, and 3 were just immersive to delve into. never did i get tired or bored of any quests, no matter how small. the main story is also incredibly well crafted and i bet many dm's dungeon masters will take much inspiration from this game. such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers, going out of your way to learn more about the world, what you can learn from it, and completing quests just to hear more about this place baldur's gate 3 resides in. your choices very much matter here. there is no illusion or just going with the ride everything you do has either a small, significant or major impact on the story. no choice ever feels like it didn't matter, and even story bits can change depending on what you do first like a dm adapting to how you play and npcs can change entirely based on how successful, good, or horrible you are. h1ucharactersuh1 never had i imagined any game topping the mass effect trilogy in terms of developed characters. but wow, this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever, that i loved all the characters. the voice acting is just peak performance, the traits and personalities of each character is so developed, and they really feel like people. you always experience something new with an npc in this game, no matter what playthrough there's dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more. every opportunity i wanted to engage and talk to my companions, completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships. not a single npc was poorly written, not one. what a huge feat larian studios did here, this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it. some companions legit made me cry irl, just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep. what makes these characters even more amazing is unlike mass effect, they legit can leave you, hate you, or even want to fight  murder you depending on your choices. they don't just tag along, they have thoughts, views, morals, and goals. they do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say, which does have impact on how the journey goes. this aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with. h1ufreedomsuh1 so one of the strongest pros of this game besides the unbelievably well written characters is how much you can do outside the box. the game doesn't force you to play by the usual rules, you can get really creative in and out of combat. the game literally lets you cheese to your heart's content or do things even the game didn't expect you to do, but you're able to. with how the game is designed, any object can be used in numerous ways, you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal, and i keep seeing people on other sites and youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game. seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what you're doing. the game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesn't outright punish you sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons, but the game really does let you roam and do whatever, in almost any order you wish. the world is yours to roam, act to act. h1umodsuh1 larian studios didn't just give us the best game i had played in awhile, but they are fully supportive of mods. this is a major deal, because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years. like skyrim, they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want, and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod you're seeking. larian studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods that's just awesome. surprisingly most if not every mod i had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues, fully functional. again i can't stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with larian studios supporting all mods, this will make the game 200 better in the long run. h1uflawsuh1 so it seemed like i had nothing but praise for the game. but there are some flaws with it, and i won't be shy as to what these flaws are. if you really love something, you should be allowed to give critics. the biggest issue i have with this game is how the companion's ai acts when they follow you. they tend to get stuck often, and you have to manually move them to catch up. worse, if you come across traps or dangerous areas, your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise. sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks, but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem. i remember in tactical mode, i had my party stop onto an elevator, waited 5 seconds because i wanted to make sure they'd stop moving, then suddenly when the elevator moved all my party fell to their deaths, clipping from the bottom. many traps or shifting parts due to bugs, which speaking of another major issue is how glitchy, buggy, and unstable act 3 is entirely. the first two acts were solid, hardly any problems but act 3 is riddled with pugs. clipping through the floor, some cutscenes have missing npcs, dialogue has no sound, and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene, for no reason. h1uhonour modeuh1 so this one is my absolute pet peeve. while the other issues were 'worse' for general gameplay, this mode is just horrible. while i did like the challenge and legendary actions that bosses had, what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file, that's it. i understand why they did this, and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles, but the fact this game has some issues and especially act 3 being so buggy, it ruins a lot of runs in honour mode. i ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations. i don't mind dying and losing legit, but when it's outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug, glitch, or unexpected error that's when i decide enough is enough. h1uconclusionuh1 baldur's gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game. it's a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of. a game that will leave you remembering it for years to come. 9.5  10"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"i rarely say this, but this game is absolutely worth it's full price. i have never replayed single player games so many times, enjoying each and every one of them. i've never bothered with achievements so much, as in this game. hell, i'm not even a dnd fan or a fan of games of this genre, but i fell in love with baldur's gate 3. everything about this game is perfect the graphics, style, music, characters, voice acting, story. and you can have mods! so many mods for every taste. i recommend to do at least 1st play through with vanilla game though. one of the coolest things about this game is that larian studios keeps updating it and making it even better!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,"a very good game anyone who enjoys good story, turnbased strategy and a exciting adventure should play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"bnot a fan of rpgs? this game will change your mindb after a few sessions of idndi the tabletop game, i decided to check out the computer game based on its universe  ibaldur's gate 3i. and wow, it completely blew me away. the world feels alive and immersive, filled with rich characters and endless choices. the freedom to approach situations your way is incredible. from the stunning visuals to the deep combat and roleplaying, its clear this game was crafted with exceptional care and attention to detail. this game is a mustplay especially fun in coop. its a masterpiece that deserves all the love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,you know it's a genuinely fucking good game when after 105 hours of gameplay you are still like fucking hell i wanna do another run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,"probably one of the best, most in depth games of the century. the amount of content in this game is insane for a single player experience, and its rare that a 100 hour game would actually make me want to play the game through a second time. in fact i've beat the game twice solo and played it through far with friends multiple times. it's a true role playing experience and is almost sandboxlike, despite having such a massive established world already. the creative freedom is insane. you can sit there and read through the well written story with amazing characters, explore all the side content and really engage with the world, or you can play strictly for the fun gameplay, skipping over the story to spend time doing stupid, creative things, like stacking up boxes to set up for a skydiving owlbear or going on a murder rampage and killing everyone. it's amazing how the game has so many avenues of play that you can choose to engage with or not based on your own roleplaying experience. this game also has some of my favourite rpg mechanics of any game, drawing from dnd combat and their past games such as dos2. it translates excellently into the 3d format. you can pace the difficulty how you want, by taking rests when needed. multiclassing is awesome in this game and the gear you can find to augment your abilities opens up so much. i do miss the elemental combat of dos2, but there is many reasons that this game is better  namely the universal actions such as jumping and repositioning options, shoving, etc. add a lot of whismy to the game. you can go and blast things with a fireball, or you can throw your little gnome friend at the enemy, and then have him shove a guy off a cliff. there's a lot of potential for fun coop play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,prior to purchasing this i had no experience with tabletop in fact i was hesitant to pick this game because it seemed overwhelming at first. ultimately i'm grateful i decided to take the plunge. this game has so much personality and it really shows what a labor of love this game must have been to those who made it and it's made a deep impression on me. i don't think i can ever quite look at other games within the genre the same way now having played this. my only regret is that i can't rewind the clock to experience it for the first time again.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"best game i've ever played. the general goal of baldur's gate 3 is to get rid of your mindflayer parasite, but it evolves into so much more. the story exploration is perfect. other than being overwhelmed by general dnd stuff that you're unfamiliar with the game does a great job at slowly introducing and familiarizing players with the story, setting, and everything else. you are first placed in a world with a general task after the intro, and almost everything you do will inadvertently get you closer to that task. the player is the one to find the path to achieving their goal. it is not some todo list nor aimless pile of tasks. there is purpose, and you are motivated to pursue and explore due to that purpose."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"this is almost completely subjective the game has a legit claim on the title of greatest rpg ever made. i just don't like it. there are so many decisions in this game that bother me. i play tabletop rpgs for real, i don't need to watch virtual dice rolls. i don't like the constant narrator endlessly droning on about everything. there's a ton of other things i really dislike in this game, a lot of it baggage with modern dd. shit, why isn't karlach in the damn cover art? you hear endless tales of people doing crazy shit, juggling people off cliffs or throwing cursed fish or whatever, the game let's you do anything you want. i played a necromancer and 90 of dead people have absolutely nothing to say. the remaining 10 have nothing to say i can't already figure out. i'm not expecting full dialogue trees from every body in the game, even from the insane detail of this game, but it would have been nice to find a stash of loot or something now and then. never seen an rpg world with this much depth and verticallity, rather than flat planes with cliffs and plateaus. i dreaded the game being full of exploding barrels and that tactics revolved around throw shit at things, but there's so many things that interact in different ways along with solid movement and ability use. the characters are damn amazing. why isn't karlach on the cover? i want a mod to have everyone in the party at once so nobody gets left behind. it's a real pity asterion doesn't seem to have any real plot until the end of the game, when everyone else gets real moments to shine. it's really damn disappointing that alfira seems like she should have been the bard character but her role in the game is to get butchered by the dark urge. and yeah, looks like not playing the dark urge was the chump option, you've played the game incorrectly if you didn't pick it or an origin companion. dragonborn are so awesome looking it's basically a crime none appear until act 3. act three is messy. buggiest part of the game. the only major crash i had happened there and forced me to replay a long, complex encounter. the narrator crapped out and went silent which actually didn't bother me too much. and after 170 something hours of a campaign, i finished the game and basically got the modern equivalent of you get win!. i made a heroic sacrifice, watched a companion die, saw withers basically laugh at the previous games, and then credits rolled before being dumped to the main menu. so the worst bug i encountered was apparently lol, no ending for you, which is pretty fucking devastating. i'm so glad i'm finally done with the game and can stop playing it. i'll probably start another game in the future. i'm very much torn between love and hate with this game which unfortunately averages out to just knock it off already, dammit most of the time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,played dnd for the first time recently and got a hankering for it. i'm 35 and used to hate turnbased combat but this game is incredible. also really well written. also you get to have sex with green people.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"i finally finished my first playthrough, after 250 hours of gameplay  it is the longest time i have dedicated on a game and i was satisfied each and every time i play the game. i loved playing baldur's gate dark alliance when i was a kid and i never thought i would ever feel the same with another game. this game brought me back to those times. hours spent knowing the lore, talking to all characters, be it origin or npc, exploring every nooks and crannies, looting even the most irrelevant resources... it really is a world of its own and i'm so happy to have been in it. this will most likely not be my last gameplay because there's still so much to discover. i have so much appreciation to the creators of this game. they really did an amazing job with this game. this will hold a special place in my memories."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"have you ever looked at games that won a mountain of awards and thought, aww come on, some of those have to be bought, or they did the right industry handshake. put such cynicism aside and believe when i say larian crafted another absolutely incredible rpg experience. every award and accolade is earned, every actor gave spectacular performances, and larian has spent so much time post release adding everything from qol changes to additional free content to community mod support. bg3 is a fantastic game, a work of art, and proof that devs who love the project and the community can deliver, in a massive and resounding success."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"what an amazing game, what an amazing adventure. now that i've reached the end, with many nervewracking battles behind me, i'm sad that it's over. i'll miss it..miss my companions, the characters and the magical world around baldur's gate..thank you to the creators of the game, what a unique job you've done"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"there aren't many games made these days that are designed for player enjoyment. this is one of them, it is well designed. the dialogue is great! there is a ton of clickables, different scenes based on different choices, the loot makes sense.... just literally made well in every way. makes me look at sims and wonder wtf... why do i even buy you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,originally i was turned off by the dungeons and dragonsforgotten realms genre because i believed it was just played by exceedingly nerdy 30 year olds that didn't shower.....i still believe that but they make a pretty wicked rpg series and with exceptional storytelling.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"so many different choices, so many different paths. it's a good story on top of you also making it your own with the decisions you make and the characters you choose to befriend, betray or even romance. one of my most favorite games ever, and i'm someone who isn't normally into turn based games. this one definitely is one that stands out and has made me love them. love love love this game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"actual good gameplay and storytelling, and free dlc, big w, go f yourself ea and many others"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"a perfect game for all rpg lovers , finally managed to finish it after all of the life stuffs that happened. would love to played it with my ex but hey i finally moved on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"such an engaging game with an interesting story, including solid turnbased strategy and plenty of freedom to play however you want.... definitely worth a try!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"absolutely love this game so far. i have three play throughs currently a solo, and 2 group plays. i think about the game constantly when i'm not able to play, and i can't wait to get back to it. i'm so excited to learn more about the story, and the replayability as different characters is amazing. the character creation is one of my favorites i've ever used. thank you for good female hair. that is always one of my biggest grievances with games, the female hair is usually so bad. therefore i greatly appreciate having good options. so glad i got into this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,almost limitless options for builds and tactics to mess with the enemy like blowing them up or throwing them off cliffs and has more than enough content to be replayed over and over again for a few thousand hours. absolutely worth the price.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"h1this is a lovely game. however, divinity original sin 2 had better player interface. let me explainh1 h2the pro'sh2 h3i love the world of dnd. it's a great fantasy world, and this game reflects it really wellh3 list classes and races mesh well skills and abilities are usually useful and can turn the tide of battle every upgrade that adds to your primary stats, and damage output, is meaningful your narrative choices are reflected through the campaign list h2the con'sh2 h3as i mentioned before, there are some peculiar things that should be better. those mainly boil down to a few particular issuesh3 list how come am i able to melee attack thin air? in a turnbased battle, i have wasted numerous turns, because i have misclicked my mouse or the game does not register that my mouse hovers over an enemy, when i have an attack selected. there is no reason why this should be in the game. by default, this should only happen when i press a modifier hotkey to allow attacks at thin air. how come am i attacking a structure, but not moving behind it, by default? i have had few battles started because i wanted to move behind some object which has hp such as wooden structures. clicking on such object, by default means that i either want to interact or walk around. there's even a hotkey to attack. why is it in the game, if, without having it pressed down, my character attacks things that provoke conflicts? walkable areas are not marked clearly, and while that in itself is not an issue, i should be able to ckeck, if an aoe fire spell will cover the entire passage between me and the enemy, or not. as i said, these are usually not an issue in dos2. in that game, attack is not the default action. you have to trigger it by holding down a hotkey, else your character would simply do whatever is considered the second prioritised action in bg3. additionally, there is a hotkey to highlight walkable area, so that you could use the knowledge the game has, as intended. list h3i do realise that my conplaints are probably only unique to me. however i do have them, and for a review, they should be voicedh3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"great game. your choices actually matter, and boy do you get to make choices. tons of different options for most encounters. great graphics. the rest system is a little dated and annoying, and i thought the game was actually a little too long."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"a great game for those who want an rpg tabletop game experience on the virtual. the story is immersive, the characters have distinct personalities and motivations for the players to explore, and the array of options on how to proceed your adventure is just impressive. the gameplay is a delight from dialog to exploration and combat. highly recomend this experience, be it in solo play or with friends."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"amazing rpg, probably the best since dragon age origins. some awesome things were obviously cut, especially towards the 3rd act of the game where it feels rushed and not as amazing and open ended as the 1st and 2nd acts, but still great, especially the end. i'd give it a solid 910, easily. sucks larian, biowares spiritual successor imo, has opted not to make dlc for it or a sequel, they would have my money! not sure i would trust anyone else, please don't hand it off to bioware especially! thanks larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,"i was hesitant to buy this game because i've never played dnd, and so i thought there would be a big barrier to learningunderstanding the gameplay. i finally caved and, while there is a slight learning curve, the game has overall exceeded my expectations. it just feels like a more accessible way to engage in a traditionally tabletop rpg, and i've loved pretty much everything so far only about halfway through act one. i also recommend playing with your friends if you get a chance and you all can handle the cost, as its definitely more fun when nothing goes to plan! p"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,great game. there's so many different ways to play that multiple play through's are a must
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,this game should be the industry standard for games with massive development budgets. nothing else even comes close to how polished this game is in basically every aspect. larian studio is one of the few larger developerspublishers that continue to deliver good games when the rest of the aaa market has been on life support for years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,"play time is misleading as this game is so great i've bought it four times on three different platforms, one of the greatest games ever made and i will gladly die on that hill"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"haven't finished the game yet, but i played enough to solidify my opinion on it. baldur's gate 3 is a great game that is a bit held back by the dnd 5e mechanics. i won't spend too much time singing praises since bg3 broke into the mainstream and it was very welldeserved. larian studios had already proved they could make an amazing crpg with divinity original sin 2 and with the extra time they put into this game, their mastery shows. a lot of stuff to do, fun quests and dungeons, interesting characters to interact, great voice acting and good improvements from the ttrpg version of the mechanics. if you're looking for a fun, highfantasy, tactical combat rpg with a lot of dialogue choices, go for it. my two main complaints are with the multiplayer and the dnd 5e combatprogression mechanics. regarding the multiplayer, i think it's mostly my preferences. there are clear improvements in comparison to dos2 multiplayer in general, but i still feel like this is a game i'd rather enjoy on multiplayer coop, while it's clearly designed with singleplayer in mind. you can still have a lot of fun with it, but it will make you miss out on a lot of the characterdriven narratives and the general selfinsertion story that these rpgs tend to aim for. once again, i wouldn't say that that is necessarily bad, but it clashes with the way i prefer to play  and you can always play with each player using an origin character from the game. regarding the dnd mechanics, i think it's a straight downgrade from dos2. leveling up only in your class by default, action types instead of action points, daily and level up spell memorizing and all that, not fun in my book. these adaptations from dnd 5e add complexity that doesn't add tactical depth on one end and restrict choices and freedom on the other. like i said, a lot of good changes from the ttrpg mechanics were made, but it's still a flawed system for me. in conclusion, i very much do reccomend baldur's gate 3. i think it's more polished and approachable than dos 2 even though the general mechanics are less fun, in my opinion and deserves all the praise it has gotten. it's an awesome rpg adventure and clearly worth the price."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"this game is incredible... i am inexperienced with proper dd tabletop games, but i've always wanted to give it a try. i know this is somewhat different since you have saves you can load if you don't get an outcome you want, cause video game, but i find part of the fun for me is getting to play through this campaign over and over to experience the different paths and endings as you want to. no shame to people who don't want to save scum though, you live dangerously and i respect that, and i think this game is probably still rewarding to those who don't. that aside, larian really cooked with this, and are still in the kitchen even long after it's release. the game of the year award was so well deserved for this masterpiece. everything from the visuals, to the gameplay, to the characters  character customisation and the classes, to the music, and even to the changelog and community update posts your humour in them is fantastic and so onbrand, thank you for hiring whoever it is that does those. this is the work of a games studio who actually care about the individual game they and their employees put great amount of efforts into being an enjoyable experience and playable even beyond a single year from it's release date. not saying they are the only one's to do it, as there are plenty of other games out there that have achieved this feat, but rarely does it seem to apply to the vast majority of games that big game studios seem to churn out these days. even though my luck on rolls sucks when playing through this game at times, and i am an idiot who is still learning a lot of things about certain aspects thank you load save feature for these reasons in particular lol, i still just struggle to put into exact words how good this game is and how strongly i recommend this to anyone who has taken even the slightest bit of interest in this game and are unsure on whether to play or not. we are well over a year out from the game being released, so i would like to think most people have by now, but if you haven't, please do. i promise it will be worth your time. this game will reward you tenfold. good luck, soldier! sorry this review is not the most profoundly worded or formatted nearly as neatly as others are, i am not a professional critic or a good writer, i just like video games and want to share praise to those that deserve it d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,i'm sure i don't have to describe why this game is good. it deserves all the praise it has gotten. i have to give a shout out to the mod support though. the mod menu makes it very easy to download and manage mods. it might be the best mod support i have seen. it also means that i can have every character in my party at once and i can romance everyone. yes it does break the game. yes it is worth it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"this game is, bar none, the best rpg i've ever played and my favorite game i've ever played. truly endless content, the most immersive setting i've ever seen in a game, fantastic story and voice acting. if you haven't played it, you're missing out on the game of the decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"this game has a great story, gameplay is great, characters are pretty good. graphics are pretty nice. i think i could play this through again but with completely different approach. i am at 111 hrs. i am usually big on trying everything myself and following up on side quests. there seem to be more than one way to unlock things which allows for more open gameplay."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,"a few months ago i was talking with my son about video games and i said i'd love to play a game that was similar to skyrim but with story and realistic graphics like rdr2, and the next time i was browsing steam, there it was! i didn't know it would be the perfect game for me when i bought it, but i saw that it's from the dd realm and that sealed the deal for me. i'm now on my third playthrough and about 380 hours and don't plan on quitting any time soon! there is so much to the maps and storyline, and you can play it a different way every time and end up with completely different outcomes. you will definitely get your money's worth!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"h1 you put an rpg in my dating simulator h1 baldur's gate 3 is a roleplaying game set in the forgotten realms universe. if you don't know what this means, it is a campaign setting for dungeons and dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game reliant on dice roles, an overarching storyteller the dungeon master, and multiple npcs to interact with. bg3, therefore, may be a bit unconventional to those familiar to standard rpgs like skyrim or the witcher. it is played from a topdown perspective, where movement is realtime, but combat is turnbased. all encounters and item locations i believe are scripted, meaning the only difference between runs will be your choices we'll get to this later. and, of course, what determines your success are your stats. at points you wouldn't even think of, whether it be in conversations or wandering around, you will be making dice rolls based on various attributes like strength and dexterity to see if you will succeed or not, which can lead to numerous outcomes. you have the option to choose from 7 different origin characters, or create your own however, the 7th origin character is very similar to a custom character with a few nuances. they each have their own backgrounds, stories, and personal quests, which you will progress throughout the game to determine a unique ending. you will eventually get the opportunity to recruit four other companions later in the game, but their interactions are much less impactful i believe due to budget cuts. you will meet all of these origin characters in the main game, and can have three others with you during adventuring with you at one time. some may find this frustrating, as it limits personal quest opportunities, unique dialogue, and relationships, essentially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs. if you take the side characters along instead, you'll limit the opportunities even further. as for the origin characters, i think there's someone for everyone. i'm sure you've read online about people gushing over certain characters, but if you just care about stats or like them for their personality and don't like their stats, you can always respec them. the key component of using these characters is their combat skills, which, as mentioned, is turnbased. everyone has special abilities, which needs to be used strategically in freeform combat. i say freeform as in everything is game. you can use nearby objects to toss at enemies, combine liquids to deal more damage, climb rafters for a height advantage, push enemies off ledges, or use context clues for an encounter bonus for example, there's a section where you can talk to a spider if you have the ability to do so to convince them to fight for you. overall, the combat is nuanced and varied, but it can be very, very slow. there's four of you and sometimes dozens of enemies. you have to just sit there and wait for them to scuttle about and it can be a pain, making you consider nonaggressive tactics if even possible. as for the main quest itself, i'd ironically say it's the weakest part of the game. the game thrives in the world and the side quests, many of which you can have a deep impact upon based on your choices thus encouraging replay value. the main quest, though? you can actually skip a lot of it if you know what you're doing. i felt like the main quest was just there as a backdrop for the game to populate a world with side quests. even in the endgame, the main quest is split into three parts that can be tackled in such a way that they act like three side quests. this isn't necessarily a criticism, as the side quests have tons of choices and options to them, most of which are meaningful, which i believe is the main draw of the game. now, for the companion origin stories and their personal quests, i think it could have been done a tad better. your fate is practically sealed in the first part of the game, so if you mess up, or didn't build your relationship high enough because you had other companions follow you, you may get frustrated. the game also starts dragging as a result. there's so many options and you want to see them all, that the tedious sections start to become more apparent. you can't do everything in one run, and one run takes a long time. like, there's certain parts where you do just have to sit through inconsequential dialogue. or there's choices that will just kill you, no matter the dice roll outcome or lack there of. however, i can't really fault the game here for this, as larian set a standard for rpgs of this genre with bg3. h1 pros h1 list tactical combat that allows players to make use of the environment and a widerange of abilities, requiring individuals to always be aware of what can be used against enemies and against themselves. the origin characters are wellwritten and wellacted. they are fun to interact with and it's a joy to watch them grow as characters, for better or for worse depending on your choices. the side quests are a particular highlight, with you having the potential to miss more than half the game if you aim to just complete the main story. choices that matter and leave an impact, with both morally grey, good, and evil options. so many choices and options that you'd want to start a new playthrough right after you finish your first. larian studios has consistently made an effort to improve the game overtime, including adding mod support and listening to the community, a welcome change in today's gaming world. it should be stated that the environments, voice acting, and overall design of this game is excellent. create water is a level 1 transmutation spell. list h1 cons h1 list at the risk of being contradictory and hypocritical, i must say that, even though the game's sheer size and number of choices are wonderful, there is a fault to it. in the review, i keep mentioning runs. it is a strange rpg to me, having so many choices and options, but you're never going to see them all. you're never going to see that charm, because a fatigue will set in playing this very, very dialogueheavy game also, there is a lot of walking. some players may not even witness the game's title of baldur's gate because they'll be worn out by part ii, and i think that's a shame. in my opinion, i think the game should have a method to either skip combat, or start at specific parts with choices done for you, like dragon age inquisition did upon launch. branching from the combat complaint, it is is very slow when there are too many enemies. you have four members that you have to manage individually against a dozen enemies sometimes, each having their own special abilities, intricately moving around the nuanced environment. it can be painful, to say the least. as stated before, the limit on the companions following you is to the game's fault. their relationship should be able to change even if at camp. however, i am aware that the four nonorigin companions were cut down on content due to budget reasons, so i can't really fault the game for that. but the last companion especially just felt shoehorned in, you have next to nothing to do by the time you find them unless you blitz towards their location. again, the main story seems just like a background for all of the side content. also, for a game filled to the brim with so many choices, sometimes it deprives you of the ability to make them at key moments. romance with the companions can feel too superficial and lacks nuance, with particular favoritism being done against one that i noticed, as they had more dialogue options in regards to the relationship even though it's just repetitive blurbs. list b verdict 910 b"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"the replayability of this game is insane, larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. this game has taken over my life and i love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"this isn't really my cup of tea, but still it's a 1010. i struggle to get into crpgs, but this game is fire. one day it'll click for me, at least that's what i keep telling myself. buy this, then buy it again on a different platform, even if you never play it, give larian your money because they deserve it. that's it, i'm going to go back to playing some crappy 910 game that i really like."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,what can i say about this game that hasn't been said before. this game truly is revolutionary it does so much to suck you in to the world of dd to the point where replayability is uncommon to do. it has everything that people should look for in a game while giving people what they want. even if i don't like buying games for 70 this is one of those games that would be worth it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,"one of the greatest games ive ever played. i cant believe i missed it at launch, but im so glad i finally experienced it. a true masterpiece, thank you, larian studios!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"whew! finally finished the game. this is a masterpiece. even the oneline npcs are voiced! the effort. that went into this is insane. the writing is stier that pinch 2, holy shit, the pacing is fantastic, the characters dear sweet zombie jesus have set a new high bar for deep development. their backstories, their incredible voice acting, the variety of outcomes, are all just amazing beyond my ability to easily express in a format like this. this is one of those games where, were it not for the incredible replayability, i would feel empty for a while. the quest was accomplished. the story is over, and the characters all are going their own way, no longer united by purpose. the fellowship is dissolved. but this is one of those games where the end isn't really the end. rather, it's just one end. there are more to be seen, and now i have to go back and see what else there is. maybe it's time to try this dark urge everyone is talking about."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"went in thinking i was about to be the hero of an epic storysmiting and cleaving fiends left and right, saving every poor miserable soul in the forgotten realms. ended up playing a dating simulator, bending over backward to please a demon lady just to see her smile. 200 hours. one playthrough. feels like i barely scratched the surface. this is the kind of epic, storyrich rpg that will go down in history as peak gaming. even people born in 2023 will remember baldurs gate 3 with nostalgic warmth. a nearperfect game, and i already look forward to my next 200 hours with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"zesty aah vampire. it's pretty good, but the main story and plot is hardcoded and essentially always follows the same path, regardless of your choices. replayability loses almost all value after about 35 playthroughs unless you use mods, but even then those can only enhance or add to what's already there, they can't change much of the game itself. for me it's maybe an 710, would go straight to 1010 with a map editor, because then this game just becomes dnd the game. people able to make their own campaigns, rig the triggers, tags, and put in their own sounds and voice acting. it would be an extreme amount of effort to make a good bg3 campaign, but i imagine all the official dnd 5e staples would be recreated in record time. the idea of a different campaign in even half as much of scale as the main game's campaign, maybe with the dnd 5e ruleset mod, let alone multiple, just seems like such an insanely good idea that i'm peeved we don't have it yet."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"baldur's gate 3 is the new benchmark in rpgs. a game that blends rich storytelling, tactical combat, and immersive worldbuilding. with meaningful choices, deep characters, and strategic turnbased combat, it picks up the mantle from divinity 2 and refines the standards expected for rpgs. it is an 'absolute' mustplay excuse the pun  i couldn't resist."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,best game i've ever played. shocked by how much i love it. bard is best class btw. 1010 would tell someone they're mouthier than an arse and twice as full of shite again.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"really wanted to love this game. visuals, voice acting, character creation, plot, worldbuilding, all great. but the game felt tedious. just finished and won't replay. 1 combat would have been worlds better either as real time with pause bg1 and 2, iwd, nwn, pillars of eternity, tyranny, owlcat's pathfinder games or a more focused, tighter, turnbased with grids final fantasy tactics, banner saga, solasta. too many trash mobs, too much time spent waiting for 15 enemies to take their turns or to dash across huge landscapes, etc. more than anything, this game felt slow  not in the way a difficult thoughtful chess match is, but more just idly waiting. 2 disappointed by companions. bg1 from 1998 had 20, each unique and memorable. bg3 has far fewer, all but one elfhuman. their ancestry and appearance can't be changed, which is a waste of bg3's impressive character creation options. limited banter between them, and they are mostly kind of annoying jerks. 3 speaking of companions, shadowheart and laezel felt like dmpcs. playing as a nonorigin character, i was just along for their ride. 4 lack of pause drove me crazy. 5 noisy and bizarre flashy dice rolls were super annoying. very moodbreaking when a rogue would be stealthily sneaking, then roll to pick a lock with 95 change of success, only to be interrupted by what looks like a vegas slot machine minigame. 6 combat is oddly cartoonlike. firing a regular arrow that missed looks like a comet streaking. 7 lots of weird pixel hunting. 8 can't hide as a group, can't set up party formations. a lot of tasks just take too many clicks. overall, 710. i would recommend all of the crpgs named in my point 1 over bg3, unfortunately."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,this game let me bomb an entire civilization and have sex with a bear. i don't know how this is a recommendation.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,"i'm more of a pathfinder player, but i absolutely love this game. i hope future tabletop games push to this level of gameplay and presentation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,"pretty much the best tabletop game you could imagine, but with kick ass graphics and the ability to romance a bear."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"super fun and good looking game despite all the.... weird stuff and messaging for modern audiences. every character being a sexually ambiguous 5lu7 is something i could do without. my biggest complaint is the rejection of forgotten realms canon, as if the writers truly hate the sourcebooks. example tieflings and celestials are rare, and the prospect of many of them finding one another and creating a thriving breeding community is ridiculous even for a high fantasy game set in the realms. and they don't all have red skin and scales. basically the whole tiefling refugees thing was such a cringe and unnecessary thing trying to force a parallel with modern global politics. this may be a gripe with 5e and not the game itself, but truly concerning is the disappearance of moral good and evil, being replaced with arbitrary consequences of good and evil acts. in the real world and any fantasy world we are allowed to roleplay within, our choices aren't just guided by our selfish desire for certain future results. i won't kill this person because if i do i will miss out on the chance to purchase goods from them in a later act isn't how civilized humans make decisions. everyone knows there is good, and there is evil, and to pretend they don't exist reveals a very bad agenda from the development team. bad for everyone, whether it's a kid playing for the story or a group of friends playing for the lolz. either way the pretense that good and evil don't exist, only legal and social consequences, leads to a very watered down and sterile gaming experience. if i do murder, i want the game to treat me like a murderer. if i stop murder from happening, i want the game to treat me like a hero. this game seems to obfuscate both so that no matter what you do, nothing really happens and everything is just this grey area of excuses."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,"absolutely peak, i well and truly adore this game, every class is fun and does something different to the others. there are also ridiculous and strong interactions created by different items, the challenge runs reflect this you can beat the game by throwing underwear, just walking, through mocking your enemies, as a cat, etc. the game gives you choices other games wouldn't and always rewards exploration, the amount of effort that has been put into this game is unparalleled. it also now has mod support too the community is already making whole new campaigns, classes, items, and more. very very good game, don't miss this one unless you detest crpgs or dicebased games. 1010 without a doubt"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,"h1baldur's gate first playthrough review h1 h2 a one in a lifetime experienceh2 baldur's gate 3 is my first in a lot of case 1. its my first ever crpg 2. my first ever over the top crpg 3. first dd style game going into this game i had a lot of reservations, there was never any doubt that this is a once in generation game and the best this genre has ever seen. the question was, is this game for me. i was skeptical even through the mindflare section, it was o out of place for someone who has played and been in love with third person action since childhood. i have spent countless hours in rpgs but this seemed too complicated to start. controlling four characters seemed convoluted, but i was in a quest. my quest to complete all the gotys i had missed over the years and baldur's gate seemed too much of a challenge to take on. i am glad my stubborn mind pushed through these inhibitions. i am proud of myself for pushing through as baldur's gate 3 first playthrough will probably be one of the best gaming experiences in my life. my only regret would be i wont be be able to experience first playthrough ever again. when the credits roll bg3 left me with a sense of gloom that i probably didnt experience before. its a unique feeling that i hope more people should experience the first time. i genuinely and truly believe that the reception and global appeal this game has received doesnt do enough justice to the absurd feat that larian studios has pulled off and i am thankful to them for giving me something to cherish for the rest of my life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,"what i expected a vampire dating sim. what i got a genuinely incredible, story and characterrich, lovinglymade dd campaign with themes of spoilerabuse and manipulationspoiler, and overcoming trauma and becoming better for it. and all that in addition to a vampire dating sim. 1310, would hug astarion again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"i just didn't like it. the story was too dark for my tastes and way too focused on forcing you to pick between bad and worse options. almost all of the characters were self obsessed megalomaniacs wyll and karlack excluded. the characters also change their perspective on the pc way too quickly. looking at you lae'zel and shadowheart. i could look past all of that though, but the game itself just wasn't very enjoyable. i prefer 3.5e over 5e generally, but even within 5e, things felt stripped down. the level cap was also unexpected. nwn2 allowed you to go all the way to level 30, vs bg3 caps you at 12!! casters are only getting started at level 12. granted there are mods to fix that, but you only get more levels and still miss most of the class features. the available feats weren't great, and i often struggled to pick one that'd be useful, especially for caster classes. then there's the inability to backtrack after certain points, which was incredibility annoying. hit act 3 and two thirds of the world gets blocked off. wanna go buy back a thing you sold in the grove, too bad. lastly was the gear. i just quit caring about gear effects about half way through, as most of it just wasn't that useful. where was stat boosting gear? i know i'm in the minority here, but i really didn't like bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"engaging rpg experience! good big world to explore freedom interesting story and characters bad if you are not a dnd player, it might take a long time to understand mechanics if you don't like to read long text, you will lose a lot of fun"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,everything i could have asked for from an rpg. larian hit this one out of the park. every time i play it i find something new and approach solving situations in a different way. one of the best video game purchases i've ever made.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"play this is you've ever wanted to jump into dungeons and dragons. play is you're into deep storylines and nonlinear gameplay. enjoy the character development of your playable characters and see how your choices change the outcome of the main story. don't play this if you want hack n slash or action adventure play or expect to win because you're used to winning at everything and get upset at the idea of struggle. this is a fullon dd experience where you can use mkb or a controller and really enjoy a real rpg that doesn't go easy on you. you really have to think about your choices and are rewarded sometimes for your conquests. a game you can play multiple times with very different outcomes, even if you made similar choices. it's all up to the d20."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"as someone whos new to this style of game, the tutorial wasn't very helpful, and for my first few hours in the game i felt a bit lost, and struggled to figure out all the things i could do, or how i should even play this game. but once i did, dear god, i love this game, the world, the characters, the graphics. i love all the effort put into voice acting, i love how alive all the characters feel, i love how alive the world feels, especial in baldur's gate, i've never seen such a lively city in a game. the story is really good, though i do have a few gripes, the combat is fun, and the exploration is exciting. i can defiantly see this game not being for everyone, but as someone who loves a good story, this game does not disappoint."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,i absolutely love this game! with over 250 hours i am still discovering new content within it. mods make it even more replayable. the only downside is the serious lack of wyll content. he's a great character and good romance yet is so under developed it's insane.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"madly, deeply in love with this game. the graphics are beautiful, the characters and story are well thought through, and the many ways to play each scenario makes it super fun to play through multiple times. can't wait to see what they release next!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"one of the greatest games of all time. everything is fantastic. the characters, the world, the music, the story. replayability is off the charts. the dev's support the fanbase and mods, and even tho they've said they won't be putting out more dlc or anything else. they continue to put out new patches with new subclasses, crossplay etc. i could go on for days about how much i love this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"really good game! the turn base fighting is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it's an amazing game with fantastic story. the voice acting is grade a. the multiple choices of paths you can take makes playing the game unique each time if you wanted to. highly recommend this game if you have any interest in dd. even if you haven't played before, this is a good way to learn the basics and get used to the play style if you wish to eventually play tabletop."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,after 450 hrs into the game i'm still finding new things to do. this game deserves game of the year for many reasons and each one is totally valid.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,really captures that crippling decision paralysis you get when playing dd and it's time to level up and you don't want to mess up your build.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i enjoy the turnbased style of fighting, i like the capability to take my time in my decisions. i also love the companions and being able to either romance or just help them as friends along their stories."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"everyone has already sung their praises on this game, so i'll just say what has blown me away the most is the voice acting. every character and voice in this game is great, full of heart and emotion. i was not expecting for the va to be top of my list. i dont know how they managed to get top tier voicing out of everyone but hats off to them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i love the story, graphics, repeat play ability. this game holds a special place in my heart. definitely recommend if you love ttrpgs as a whole and if you love dnd this game is worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"absolutely fantastic game. the story is engaging though gets a little ridiculous as the plot develops. all the characters are compelling. they did my girl karlach dirty though and it always hurts me feelings thinking about it. the combat is refined and tactical. the freedom of choice is excellent. this is about as close to playing a real dnd game as you are going to get away from the tabletop. some things i didn't like though there are story threads that the game doesn't really wrap up that are a big deal to the characters and get you invested. the devs don't want to do anything more with the game regarding those things they set up. that's disappointing because there is a lot of potential there. there is also a rushed feel to the polish of the final conflict of the game. it has a vibe like they were getting tired of making it and wanted to wrap it up. there were also some substantial bugs during my play through, especially regarding playing coop with friends that were using mac. there were times we couldn't even play. it might be resolved though. i played this game so much that i need to take a break from it for a while. overalll i give the game 55 and it is worth every penny it costs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i'm normally not into turnbased games, but holy moly this is an exception. it's such a good game and anyone who enjoys a good story, turnbased strategy and a exciting adventure should definitely give this game a try. 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,a cocktail for a true masterpiece  start with a long and interesting story  put lots of paths to take that may or may not influence the rest of the story  add a some ncp you get attached to  put in a few drops of wisely used emotional scenes  don't forget a lot of fun things to do  shake it and voila ! better served with some good friends

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"what is there not to love, the characters, the story, the gameplay, the character creation, the build variety. it's all just so peak"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"yes, but install mods cautiously. i have had so many issues with this game even before installing mods, honestly turns me of playing the game because it will probably endstart with a headache. which is a real shame because it is such a fun game, and enjoyed playing it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i mean its just the best current iterations of the systems that larian have been building throughout divinity and they continue to do right by the consumer with updates and ease of mod use, its just genuinely the best deal that a consumer can get on a game as far as content and support per dollar are concerned."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"best game of recent years, i wish i can live inside this game. the depth of characters and the incredible amount of content is nothing short of miraculous. i love this game so much and i am sad that there are not many games as expansive, fun, innovative and wellcrafted as this. please make more games like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,what can i say that hasn't been said already? this was a labor of love and it shows. there are so many story choices that i will probably never experience them all. the characters are beautifully written and fantastically voiced. this is a game that will be remembered for years to come as a gold standard of gaming. it deserves every award it received.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"you need to play this. this like many others is my first experience with the world of dnd, and i cannot tell you how in love with the story i am. this game was created in the forge of the gods up on mount olympus that's the only explanation i can give for how amazing it is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,the voice acting and experience of this game is unmatched. never played dd before so was a bit intimidated to give this one a shot but so glad i did. highly recommend if you're a sucker for amazing story rpg's.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"a game where you and friends can enjoy a rich story, make morally questionable decisions and at least one person will forget it's their turn on a regular basis. 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"genuinely one of the best games out there. i adore how well the characters stories were done, the voice acting is amazing and it's for sure become a comfort game for me. you're also just never finished with the game, forever finding new things i missed the last time, it's such a good game. highly recommend to everyone that's thinking of buying it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,an amazing game that will supply you with hundreds of hours of amazing content. definetly worth the 60 price tag
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this game is perfect from my point of view, loving all the things you can possibily do and all the characters have their own charm. even the more unapealaing ones."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"i've been playing rpgs since the nes zelda first came out when i was 5 or 6 years old. this is the best rpg that anyone has ever made. i don't know that i will live long enough to see any other developer make a game that is as good as this one, but i sure hope that i do. it feels like a once in a lifetime game. my son is due any day now and i truly believe that someday, when he is old enough to handle the content, i will get to play this game with my son and relive the experience all over again. what a masterpiece of a game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this game is just amazing, the level of immersion is above expectations. even for someone that has not really been in dd sessions, this the perfect game for an rpg fan."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,i finished my first playthrough a few weeks ago now and i loved every bit of it. sometimes there was slight frustrations with character interactions or bad rolls but in a game with so many outcomes and options it makes sense for some to not mesh fully. all of the player characters are likeable with all of them able to synergize well in combat and in dialogue. it's an ambitious game with a lot of care put into it with updates for bug patching and public mods being added very recently. although it's more expensive then a lot of other games the hundreds of hours of fresh content makes it worth it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"great game. i love you story, characters, and mechanics. i can't wait for more quality single player content to make it to the market."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,it's pretty fun. i like dd 5e and this is a nice spin on that system that makes it better for a video game. story is great and the modding scene is turning out more adventures to play.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this is the peak of all gaming. i can't say enough about this game and the amazing people that made it. don't wait for a sale, buy this gem full price. show those devs some love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,an absolutly legendary and fantastical campaign following a dnd style sending you though a twisting and turning mission that gives you real choices that affect the events of your playthrough.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,dnd romance scenes good fighting mechanic and a lot of adventure
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,i loved playing this game. there are some bugs in act 3 but overall it was so fun to play something with good characters and story. it made me remember why i love to play good rpgs and putting in the extra effort of making the world believable makes a big difference. i wish there were more games like this out there but i know quality takes more time so i just enjoy the sht out of them when they come along.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"best crpg i ever played, amazing that everyone is voice acted. pillars of eternity brought the genre back but doesnt even come close to how finished and polished bg3 is. looking forward to a few play throughs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this is a game made with so much love and attention. even after its release, the developers are continuing to churn out major updates with gamechanging aspects that have made replaying the game a necessity. at its release, it was a phenomenal experience, and over time it has only further improved by the devs granted players additional ways to connect with the characters, such as the options to kiss and to have additional cutscenes and dialogue. there is always something new to experience, no matter how many times you play through. my first playthrough, i played as a durge and romanced astarion. it was something like a religious experience, seeing this love unfold, learning about astarion's traumas and seeing him rise above and understand his worth as a person who deserves to live. his story in particular was one i deeply related to, and i am so thankful to those that took part in creating him for depicting trauma in such a raw light, and also for making the story between him and the durge so beautiful in how the two of them can heal from their wounds together. thank you, larian, for this magical experience 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"with almost 200 hours i can say that i love this game. it's very diverse, and there are so many endings. i like the fact that you can make the combat easier, depending on how you want to play the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"great game to get lost in  highly recommend looking into dnd basics to understand what moves do. things to learn what spell slots are, what higher level spells are and do, what class suits your playstyle best, and also, be a loot goblin!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"one of the most storyrich, most immersive and prettiest games out there love combat mechanics too, once you get the hang of it and start leveling up it's really fun, makes you feel so smart if you plan ahead and strategize to get the advantage over the enemy 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"i like the dnd game. it is very nice. but please note this game will suck the life out of your cpu if you don't have a cooler. even playing it windowed with low graphical settings, my cpu climbed to 7585c on average while playing, even going dang near to 95100c at times. invest in a cooler or you'll kill your processor."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"i have always wanted to play dnd. i never had people to play it with and never knew of the games that are basically dnd. i always tried to play the tabletop online with people but never convinced anyone. playing this game as my first dnd solo experience was wonderful. i've played so many different rpgs throughout my life and i've always roleplayed the main character. having the freedom to do many different this as these characters is the best part, while having a fun combat system. it's a great game, deserving of all the praise."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this is simply the best role playing game that has ever been made. cons it is not a perfect game by any stretch. the writing was oftentimes immature, naive, and maybe even cringeworthy at times. if you aren't a fan of turnbased battles, you may not like much of the combat. pros story. it is very easy to set aside the juvenile writing and enjoy each and every character in the game not just your main party. side quests are fantastic. the main quest is cogent and epic. rpg development  you really can build whatever you want and develop into a powerhouse of whatever class you pick. the pacing of this is superb. they did a fine job not letting the game get too easy though it does by the time you get done with act 3 as your characters have a ton of power by then. soundtrack  i can't think of a game that sounded better than this game. the music is absolutely delightful, moving, and emotional. voice acting  having everything voice acted really does make a huge difference in immersion. this game was like playing out a dd campaign with your favorite friends and an excellent dungeon master. play this game. it is an alltime great."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,so many choices and so much content. perfect game to replay as every playthrough will be different.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,absolutely love this game! the fact it's like dd is really interesting and fun! characters are cool and i love the art!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"this game is so good, i'm on my second playthrough and i bought i less than a month ago. the storyline is genuinly interesting and it adapts just the right amount of dnd mechanics. also love that jaheira and minsc make a return 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"bg3 is a masterpiece. it is the greatest game i have ever played, and will likely be one of the greatest i will ever play. the depth of the story and characters took my breath away, as well as the thousands of different stories you can tell by making different branching choices. larian is a fantastic company that is still actively working to update and improve the game. no notes, just praise."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"this game is closer to divinity original sin 2 than the original baldur's gate games. as a fan of both i don't see that as an issue, but i think it's a good disclaimer to have. the dnd 5e rules have been adapted by larian to work better as a crpg, but they're still a bit weird when compared to the mechanics used in dos 2. in terms of story and presentation this is definitely an upgrade though. i do love this game, but i think my main takeaway from it is that i'm looking forward to dos 3, if it's going to combine dos 2 mechanics with bg3 levels of story and presentation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i've played since early access. the updates and patches since have done some incredible quality of life updates. this game blows you away. even with all my hours and playing the different modes, there is absolutely no way i've uncovered everything there is to know. if you haven't gave in and tried it, and love rpg's, do it, give in, try it. and, if you play dd, this is the most incredible visualization you'll find. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"the game is good, at first i was confused but after playing it a week. it got better. right now i am playing wiht friends for the first time. it going very well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,good game. could use more gale sex but other than that its peak
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"i never loved and hated a game so much at the same time! the game overall is fantastic and has an amazing sense of freedom while still keeps you connected to the main story. some battles the reason why i hate this game can be very challenging but the feeling of pure satisfaction you get after winning, more than makes up for it. the vas did a fantastic job at really bringing the characters to life and help the player connect with them and the rulles are simple for every player even if they are not familiar with dnd. at the end of the day baldurs gate 3 is worth every penny and was, is and will always be a game for anyone!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"amazing rpg with great character development. i was not used to turntaking fighting style, but quickly learned how to use it. i recommend watching some youtube videos to accustom yourself with the various game screens. after watching some tutorials about the fighting style and gameplay, the game became much more fun! 1010 would recommend!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,best game i have played in years! everything about it is amazing. never was into dnd or turn base combat but this game has really made me fall in love with it. over 500 hrs of gameplay on this and i don't plan on putting it down anytime soon.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"while majority of runs never make it out of act 1 for those who can stay committed to this fantastic game and story, there is so much more to do. from building insane characters for damage to crying from some character's stories, i cannot recommend this game enough. most of all, don't be scared of making decisions in this game, every choice leads to a unique situation or dialogue, so have fun!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"nice story, nice gameplay, nice game. i approve."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,very nice game and i reccomend adding mods after finishing vanila
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"great characters with great development through the story. this is a top notch game and a benchmark that all rpgs are compared to for a reason. if you like or even don't mind turn based gameplay, then pick this up and give it a play through."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"great game with near infinite replayability. if you love dd and fantasy strategy games, this is among the greatest of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"this game is the only reason i like rpgs right now. i've always been interested in them and would try them, but would find them boring early on and stop playing. this game changed that for me, i was hooked so fast. most of my hours on this game are on ps5, i recently haven't been able to stop playing it. this game has made me go back and play games like divnity and disco elysium and actually enjoy them now. if you don't like rpgs, still try this game. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"the game was a struggle at first. i had never played dnd before, so i had to spend the first few hours just trying to figure out a lot of things. despite the initial struggle, it turned out to be worth it. the story is great, the characters are amazing  especially astarion , and i don't regret the money i spent. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,one of the best games i've ever played. everything you do influences the story in unique ways. can't wait to see what larian will do next.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,the game that gamed all games starring sassy twink vampire and his band of angry monkeys
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"game so good bought it twice, played the first time on ps5 then built a pc and bought it again on steam. i don't rebuy games i already own but this one is worth buying again even not on sale just to support larian, act 1 alone is filled with so much content and a good story that much is already worth it for me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,this game is beautiful and the story is incredible. it is a wonderful combination of the shenanigans and chaos of dnd in a video game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"i would enjoy a sideways thumb for this. it is just a game. it to me just hits everything at a consistent level. i am not blown away by anything from characters to story to game play. it is just a well put together game that a lot of people obviously cared about enough to make, beyond that it is just a game. idk if i am being a homer for dd as i know it or if this game is just a game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"amazing game. i was in at the very start of early access and have done multiple play through's. it really gets dd, the forgotten realms, and how a high end rpg should be."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,the story line so far is pretty good and love the charector customization
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"way too much content, amazing graphics, and lots of choices that you can make to shape the world however you like it!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"it is a fun game, graphics are good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"best modern rpg simply because it emulates the classics. fuck you, if you like this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,super fun with friends and dozens of ways to play
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"it's good? really good? divinity 2, but in dd world? the hype is real, the reviews are real. if you like this genre of rpg, you'll love this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,great change of pace and for those who want to play dnd this is a good game to learn the mechanics
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,good game. solasta is better dnd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"40 hours in, still in act 1 i'm approaching the end i feel but still not done all the underdark or went to the mountain pass at all, probably will be like 4550 hours for the first act. act 1 is supposed to be 25 of the game... i have to travel a lot work and holidays starting in late september for like a month, i was expecting to be finished by then, but i'm not sure lol and i don't like taking breaks in the middle of a game. also starfield will likely not get playtime right at launch i think i was expecting to be able to do bg3 and finish it around early september for starfield time, would have liked to discover that galaxy with the community, will keep it for the december holidays now i think. because when i come back from my trip there's also spiderman 2 and ac mirage. have to squeeze shadow gambit somewhere there and i of course have some backlog and tears of the kingdom too but i guess that's becoming backlog now but i guess it won't move much in that time. have to squeeze another playthrough of cyberpunk with the expansion too. i guess it's a good problem to have lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"great game, love the stories and the game play. reminds me of some older games like kings quest back in the day. more story focused than fast paced action all the time. it's very refreshing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"almost as fun as playing an actual campaign with your friends. however, 98 less shenanigans than when you have actual control over the narrative"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,wicked good game. i keep coming back and its just one of the best games ive ever playes seriously. if you are a fan of dnd or even just open world exploration i would reccommend
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"lots of fun, the multiplayer is really fun too."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"baldurs gate 3 is a masterpiece. no other game comes close and i fear nothing ever will. the story, the characters, and the choices all pull you in and dont let go. the world is alive in a way that few games ever achieve and the bonds you form stay with you long after you stop playing. i almost wish i could erase my memory just to experience it for the first time again. if that ever happened, i would beg someone to bring me back to this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,combat is a little slow but other then that the rest of the game is perfect
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,it's game of the year for a reason. incredible depth. highly recommend it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,to have 5 concurrent playthroughs and each to feel distinctly unique is a testament to how outstanding this game is. for a game of this size and scope to have this much detail and complexity is nothing short of incredible. not to mention the continued support from larian years after release. i cannot say enough good things about this game. it is just one of the greatest games i have ever played period. it truly is a mustplay masterpiece and i eagerly look forward to larian studios's next game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"totally not just playing for the hot vampire oh wow, what a surprise. another totally normal rpg where i start out as a brave adventurer, full of hope, only to end up committing crimes, making morally bankrupt choices, and falling for a pale, knifehappy vampire who absolutely wants to kill me. astarion? oh, hes great. a real sweetheart. the kind of guy who flirts with you one second and then casually reminds you hed love to sink his teeth into your neck but like, in a cute way?. my character is fully aware this man is a walking red flag, but do i care? absolutely not. the game itself? oh yeah, its fine. the story is deep, the combat is strategic, and the world is full of immersive, meaningful choicesall of which i ignore in favor of trying to impress my undead boyfriend. i could be saving the world, but instead, im over here picking dialogue options that make astarion smirk at me. priorities. would i recommend this game? hmm, lets see. do you enjoy heartbreak? bad decisions? astarion whispering sweet threats in your ear? then yes, go ruin your life like i did. 1010, would get emotionally wrecked by a vampire again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"what is there to say that hasn't already been said? aside from that i am a villain protagonist enthusiast, this is probably the best villain protagonist experience i have had in an rpg game. it is unapologetic in the terror you inflict on others as a dark urge or just an unforgivably evil tav. the creative freedom for roleplay is boundless in both villain and hero roleplays that allow for great dynamic villain characters. i simply wished there was more content that was exclusive to evil routes as being evil does come at a cost of losing storylines, compainions, questlines and loot. i wish there was more exclusively evil route things to offset some of the things we lose but there is no doubt still a lot of evil exclusive content especially with the dark urge updates and i don't doubt my fellow villain protag enjoyers will still enjoy the content availible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"baldur's gate 3 is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. from the very first moments, i was captivated by its depth, rich storytelling, and the sheer amount of freedom it offers. the game perfectly blends classic rpg elements with modern mechanics, delivering an experience that feels both nostalgic and incredibly fresh. the worldbuilding is topnotch. the forgotten realms have never felt more alive, with every area filled with rich lore, dynamic characters, and meaningful choices that truly impact the story. the characters you meet along the way are some of the most compelling ive encountered in any gameeach with their own personalities, struggles, and motivations. it's the kind of game where you genuinely care about your companions, and their fates feel just as important as your own. what stands out the most, though, is the incredible freedom the game offers. the ability to make choices that truly matter, whether it's how you approach a conversation or the path you take through a dungeon, means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. the combat system is strategic and satisfying, offering a balance of tactical depth without feeling overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre. the level of detail in the game is astonishing. from the intricate character customization options to the beautifully crafted environments, its clear that larian studios poured their heart and soul into this project. the dialogue, voice acting, and cutscenes are stellar, making it easy to get lost in the game for hours at a time. overall, baldur's gate 3 is a triumph. its an rpg that not only meets but exceeds expectations, and it's a game that ill remember for a long time. i couldnt recommend it more highly to any fan of rpgs or anyone looking for an immersive, wellcrafted adventure. my time with baldurs gate 3 was an unforgettable experience, and ill be returning for many more playthroughs in the future!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"honestly its kinda just peak, you know? loyal to the original 5e ruleset though makes changes where necessary to help translate the dnd experience into a game. very well written characters and its very fun to watch the stories of all your companions play out. if you haven't seen any of this game yet or haven't played it, please do so before anything gets spoiled for you. its incredibly fun to play from the beginning fresh without any knowledge on what can happen without the fear of getting 'the best ending'. will say that act iii had simultaneously the most and least strong grip on me as while its still fun and primarily interesting to see your companion's stories wrapping up in mostly satisfying ways, it definitely feels like the two of the main bosses are shoehorned in too close to one another. perhaps the game would have benefited from a 4th act, though i know it was in development for a long time so chances are if they were able to add a 4th act i'd imagine they'd have done so. overall incredibly fun. didn't mention the mechanics but those as said are pretty similar to dnd5e so chances are that if you like games and you like dnd, you'll like bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"the best game i have ever played. i already love turnbased tabletop rpgs, but baldurs gate 3or rather, larianhas managed to capture the magic of classic pen and paper and translate it into a truly unique game. with this game, told through a threeact structure, larian has created a oneofakind gaming experience. i wish i could experience it again for the first time. for me, baldurs gate 3 is an 1110, and i cant wait to see what other bangers larian will release in the future. but no matter what comes next, baldurs gate 3 will always be my absolute favorite game of all time. thanks, larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"incredible game, great story, cinematics, really great world. love the assortment of enemies in the game, possible choices, as a dnd player, definitley a great way to spend time while not actually playing dnd, very very good game, would recommend 1110!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"phenomenal, the replay value alone is amazing, let alone the story and gameplay. i never thought i could enjoy a turn based game such as this, but i can't seem to get enough. i now know what all the hype was about!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"long time dnd player, and this game was excellent. so much to do, and a great deal of customizability. i haven't gotten into mods, but i understand it is very easy to do so. amazing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"pros  some of the best writing and voice acting i've ever experienced in a game  combat system is fantastically versatile, allowing you keep finding new ways to fight after hundreds of hours of play.  game rewards strategy and attention to detail.  i think i may be in love with shadowheart's voice actress. cons  may not be for everyone. level of choice is so great, people have complained of analysis paralysis.  can often feel like you are missing every attack. regularly landing blows is part of the previously mentioned learning curve.  requires patience during combat. especially when there are a large number of enemies. waiting for your turn can be stressful. for my piece, i consider it one of the most impressive games i've played in my lifetime, but i can totally understand where it wouldnt be for some."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"this game is the best rpg i have ever played. for the longest time i would tell everyone fallout new vegas is the best rpg game but then i bought this game. i thought it sucked due to the combat at first, but it grew on me and i began to love it. the story telling is amazing, the combat is amazing, and lastly the devs really do care."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"i'm totally new to dd but holy hell this game is good. i can't now look at other rpgs and consider them to be good when this is like a sevres meter of games. insane replayability, my next play through will be radically different, with different characters in my party, different class and totally different decisions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,its amazing the difference it makes when devs love their game. this is a reawakening for my 30s i didn't know i needed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"extremely fun probably one of the best games ive played with the repeatability, only issue i would say is sometimes some scenes can be missed without enough rests but thats probably just due to lack of resting"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"even though you level up slow, it has a good story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"never cared about this genre at all, but it is genuinely one of the best games if not the best i have ever played"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"what an amazing game. they thought of every little detail and possibility that can sometimes be forgotten or missed in rpg games such as this. my only gripe is that the combat system is a bit dumbed down, which is not very appealing coming from games such as pathfinder kingmaker  wrath of the righteous. overall, this is larian's masterpiece following the two great recent divinity games. 9.710"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"words cannot describe how utterly fantastic this game is. if you're up for a long and difficult ride, and it will be difficult, please consider getting this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"great game, just wish there were more options for subclasses."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"this is literally my favorite game! i had gotten my last pc lost in the mail 6 months ago and i kid you not ive thought about this game everyday. personally i love it as a dnd dating simulator but my other friends who actually play dnd can also enjoy it for the tactical game it can be, so no matter your background, theres something for everyone. also the fact that no matter how many times i play this and i can get different outcomes and story lines, i love it!!!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,i love dis game it's my fav because i can simp for all characters especially astaric mmm but pls add raphael romance dude is fire get it haha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"this game has set a new standard in the gaming industry and i for one won't be lowering my expectations for anybody! 1 gameplaycontrols is great. for such an open world game where you can do almost anything to have great controls on all consoles is really nice. although this may also be subjective because its based on dnd 5e rules. 910 2 story is amazing. it is such a gripping tale that you choose the outcome of! ever since da origins i have been in love with fantasy games where your choices matter. this game delivers. 1010 3 graphics. i have never seen or expected to see a crpg game with this good of graphics. it's seriously amazing. 1010 4 characters. the characters in this game are absolutely amazing they have so much depth and they can and do change throughout the story base don the choices you make or if you let them make their own choices! you can have a blank slate character with no special curse or whatever or you can be the durge a customer character with a background or any of the origin characters all with deep back grounds and personalities. i am giving it a 9.5 out of 10 only because i like the characters from dragon age a little better. 9.510 5 depth. this game is the most ambitious project ever. you can tell they ahd to cut some content, looking at you upper city, and it is still deeper than any other video game i've ever played with the only rivals being divinity 2 another larian game or maybe the dragon age games which still don't have the depth to match bg3. 1010 6 cinematics. this ties into graphics ut they are amazing and needed a direct mention. 1010. 7 customization. you can change the world, change your character, change your companions. enough said. 1010 8 romance. again the dragon age games have been my favorite ever and they are the standard. the romances in this game feel deep and meaningful and they change the characters around you. i still think da origins and da2 went a bit deeper here but not by much. 9.510 overall this game deserves every award its got and i absolutely love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,the best rpg ever made. a must play if you value games in which all your actions have consequences good and bad down the line.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"this is a beautifully cinematic and challenging. although, if like me you have never played this type of game before, don't be scared of the amount of stuff at the bottom, top, well everywhere on your monitor, because they hold your hand at the start, only getting more complicated with each level, but not so much that you notice it. the hardest part... obviously the choices you have to make and there consequences, but looking forward to next patch and going again. but please fix achievements!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"cool story, faster paced than similar games like this i have played. tons of options."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"so, hands down in the top 5 greatest rpg's ever made. like a newly renovated throwback to our rpg's of the early 2000's that had lore depth, voice acting, and world building as it's main attraction. throw in some modern quality of life enhancements like balanced power progression, stunning graphics, gratifying loot systems, hundreds of hours of content, and a general respect for the players time with a storyline that guides, but doesn't enslave you, and you have what amounts to easily the best rpg in the last decade, but also a definite favorite for perhaps the best dd themed rpg of all time i'm thinking of you, shadows of amn. people who don't even play rpg's love this game. it gave you diversity and didn't sacrifice the integrity of the game to do it. it was inclusive but not demanding it chased complex political themes without preaching it does all the things other game companies tried to, but couldn't manage to pull off, while still creating a world everyone loved. well done larian, they hate ya cus they ain't ya."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,as a beginner for playing pc games vs traditional systems  i would say so far this is my favorite game since transitioning into pc games!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"i'm pretty tired of fantasy games... i say as i finish my first play through after 190 hours and immediately start a dark urge campaign. great rpg, love the official mod support, really love the mechanics of the game that allow it to be a true 4 player game, even if you're the only one playing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,lots to do and details to find i'm at 325 hours across 3 concurrent playthroughs with different player characters and difficulties. i haven't even finished a run yet. has built in mod support!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"short answer. this game is a lot of fun. if you're into rpgs you should give it a try. longer answer. first play through i got a little into act 3, but had skipped so much that i was really under leveled and decided it was just easier to start over. i finally got a second run all the way to the final boss and one of the cutscenes crashed the game. i looked everywhere for answers and couldn't fix it. i think it was a mod, but even disabling the mods didn't fix it. that 60 hour run is just dead. then i just kept getting distracted making new characters and have about half a dozen runs somewhere in act 1 and 2. finally at about the 300 hour mark i finally got back to the end boss and didn't have a game ending bug. the fact that i just kept wanting to play the game after all the frustrations tells me all i need to know. this game is just a lot of fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"great game with great graphics and a great story. very detailed dialogue options that lead to different outcomes. a huge selection of spells and abilities  classes to choose from. coming here from dos2, i have to say that i still prefer dos2's combat  armor system. the dd rngdice roll in this game ruins a lot of the combat for me. imagine having to roll a dice to hit someone point blank and you miss. or roll a dice for dialogue options, or to picklock something...you get the point. but it is still a great game so far."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"absolutely love this game, it can be difficult at times, but it more than makes up for it with its vast world and gameplay options i do hope that larian improves dragonborns, though! they can be pretty basic with their race benefits"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"i never played a game like this before and i usually don't like this type of game. but let me tell you, the first time i tried this game at my friend's place, i played it for 2 hours straight and enjoyed it a lot. after that, i knew i had to buy the game. the game itself is amazing, fun, full of advanture and surprises. there is lore and something to explore at every nook and cranny. i have about 100 hours in total in my first playthrough it says 80 hours but it's wrong. and i never finished those 100 hours faster than this, this was amazing and if i could erase my memory and do it all again, i would. this is an unique game that you can see is a love child from larian studios. i recommend this game to anyone and everyone who considers themselves a gamer because this game was a perfect hidden gem for me, and it might be for you too."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"the real villain of ttrpgs is time. in ttrpgs, it's scheduling with players. in this game, it's the fact that i am addicted to eventually 100ing this game. it's so good, and i am hooked."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"seeing how this is my night wind down game. of course i love it. the mechanics are amazing, easy to learn, and the more you play the more you understand. it's almost always different everytime you play and it's amazing. though i keep romancing gale i can't say no to him."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"love it. studio is very proactive, game is beautiful and engaging with rich story."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"i dont think there is anything i can say for this game that has not been said at this point. it is simply the best rpg of these generation, simply as that, baldurs gate 3 is the game gamers deserve, and the game that other companies should be compared to, wether they like it or not"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"a very immersive game with lots of little secrets and pathways to find! i swear, i find something new with every playthrough i finish, and it just keeps pulling me back in for more. plus, with the added mod support, i really don't think you will grow bored of this game especially with all of the updates and patches. overall, its a great game, and i really enjoy playing it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"im glad that i could give this game a try with an open mind, because now i dont think i can live without it 1010"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"this should be game of the year every year. i start shaking if i'm not playing baldurs gate 3. the replayability is great, and so is the hot old man wizard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,1110 game it's just a fantastic game that's pretty much perfect in what it intends to do and tries to be. i'm leaving a review to feed the more than well deserved overwhelming positive reviews.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"this game, is honestly one of the best rpg's in my personal opinion out there. the only thing i can flaw, is i do wish that there was some more guidance. first time i played it, i did it in the wrong order. but i do understand, that it's more abut your characters different journey. the visuals for this game are beautiful, i've hardly had any glitches. compared to the other games, this does feel like it has some depth to your own character. creating a back story and becoming someone actually in the game and not a lifeless body. the stories of the characters are so in depth, that even if your not interested in their story. you will be. being able to play this game over and over again with hundreds of different choices you can make. not alot of games have that these days. but this one does. i can not recommend it more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"still some bugs which is unfortunate for a game that has such a large fanbase, but aside from that i loved it. complex game. i'm very grateful my partner could kind of help walk me through it because character creation and classing is quite confusing without prior dnd knowledge. but it was a great game, i recommend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"baldur's gate 3 has become my favorite game of all time! i have put over 400 hours into it on playstation, and when i built my first gaming pc, i knew it needed to be one of my first purchases. the story is very good, and offers a lot of player choice. gameplay is the tried and true dd combat, mixed with crpg exploration. there is a lot of player customization, and you will find yourself being sucked into the world, and planning your next playthroughs. this game is well worth the money, and i believe everyone should give it a try."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"oh boy, where to start... this is my favourite game since dragon age origins and easily ranks in my top 5 rpg's of all time and likely one of the best games released in the last decade, it deserves every ounce of praise and every award it's ever received, after multiple playthrough's to gather all the steam achievements and every ending, it just doesn't get old. the tactical combat is fun, intuitive, and it feels great to set up combo's and positions and you have complete freedom to set up whatever party composition and synergy you would like, it's really easy to make each playthrough feel unique and that freedom also applies to resolutions for quests and encounters, i've done 5 play throughs and i've never really resolved a situation the same way multiple times, i'm still figuring out and learning new ways to win and discovering things i hadn't in my prior playthroughs. the dialogue and story writing are excellent and this is all complimented by a great cast of voice actors, big shout outs to bae'zel, shadowheart and astarion on that front. it all feels natural and well put together, it doesn't feel gamey and written like hr was in the room subtle stab at another game you may or may not know about you will enjoy this game if you enjoy rpg's and story games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"super amazing game, the story line and quests are all so well thought out. genuinely a must play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"editing this review. i had previously given the game a reluctant do not recommend based on a frustration with the game becoming unplayable on act 3. i remain frustrated that this happened, but i have since determined that the issue was with one of the mods i had downloaded from the ingame mod list. i remain frustrated that i had to start over, but in all honesty i would have probably played the game multiple times anyways. i am now in act 3 with no issues. while no game is perfect, this game is beautiful both in graphics and in story. it is the most replayable game i have ever played due to how heavily your choices impact the story line. it is as true to dnd as any electronic game could be in my opinion. at least untilunless ai progresses to the point that it can truly take the place of a human dm"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"great game play, great graphics, truly feels like you're playing dnd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"foi de longe o melhor rpg que j joguei. nunca gostei de rpg de turnos, mas esse aqui mudou completamente minha viso sobre. e que histria tima!  o goty no tem jeito!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"an actual masterpiece. more of something akin to an art installation when you realise the level of detail and care put into this piece. you could look at it for hours, like me, and always continue to discover new things. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"game's good. good combat, good story, good sound, good graphics, good character design. can't put it down."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"soo cheap for what you get. buy whenever you can cuzz this game is soo good it should never go on sale. one of if not the best game of my lifetime, or ever for that matter. the freedom of play is soo overwhelming you can play the game 100 times and not see everything the game has to offer. literally worth the money, after playing i could see me paying almost double for it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"like game play, like mods play, dislike that how often game crashes, updates on its own where old mods and setup that worked well don't work at all, cant reset to run on older version. more pos and neg but dont want to take ore time since im not getting paid for this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,as a longtime skyrim player i can say this game is my new addiction. he game itself had me downloading the other games from developer so i could play them as well. even though it is not quite open world like skyrim its a huge game and has provided hours of fun.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"endless variations, amazing gameplay. an excellent rpg experience even at almost 400h"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"this is hands down one of the best games ever created. if you like fantasy style games buy this you will not regret it. on a side note the character reactions and facial expressions are super fine tuned and realistic, this is the first game i've ever played where i found myself laughing out loud at some of of the many responses and facial reactions your character will have. absolutely  beautifully developed game, and this is just the vanilla experience"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,this game will make you fall in love with shadow clerics all over again!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"that s the first time than i play a game like that. i don t know how is call. anyways. i really love this game, it deserve his high price. the landcape, graphism are really pretty. i don t forget character for sure they r really well made. thery are pretty and handsome well not handsome like they are attractive lmao, the voldemort's wife for sure lol. anyways. really pretty landscape and character. the story is really good. it s my frst time in game like that so... i don t really like dices. if u know what i mean. but i don t know if i choose always the wrong quest, this game is really hard. im in balanced. i always lose and die because my stupid character get bad dices. i hate gobelins.and this game is not optimise. tyhe game tell me than i can play in ultra, and when i play, my pc is turning down by overheated... i have to play this game in medium... that s a shame. that s absurdly hard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"lives up to the hype so far. very intense combat with a story that sucks you in, which to is to be expected of those at wizard coast."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"this is the best rpg and perhaps the best... game of the 21st century so far. i have never put so many hours into a game without feeling like i've wasted time, but this game never leaves me feeling like i've wasted time. it is gaming artistry."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"this game is amazing. between the wide customization options, the multiple story routes, and just how they listen to their fan base with each update. 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"this is a long game. it took my full 130ish hours of playing to complete one playthrough. at some point in the future, i will gladly invest that much time again to complete another playthrough with an entirely different build, but not right away i think. i loved the characters in this and, much like my time with persona 5, i found that the length of the game made the entire cast come to feel like friends by the end. the mechanics are solid and well implemented, and i had a lot of fun coming up with creative solutions to problems and seeing how the game would react to that. the amount of detail that's packed into a fully 3d world here is genuinely astonishing, and i'm so glad to have got to enjoy it spoiler free."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"plays great on steam deck. nothing bad to say about it but i do think the dd holds it back, i kinda wish it was divinity original sin 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"riveting adventure, wide range of playstyle options, and a superior story are what make baldur's gate 3 one of the best games i have ever played. be prepared to be engrossed in a narrative for hours on end  and for it to only feel like minutes. the voice actors, animation team, and game developers all deserve a standing ovation for the quality of work they put into this game. highly recommend for anyone looking for the perfect dd adventure."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"this is for sure one of the best games i've played. as for the character depth, game plots, surpising twists, character mimics and voicing, it is absolutely stunning. the pathing of the character can be sometimes clanky but that just a minor thing easy to forgive. as for the fighting itself, i did prefer dos 2 a bit with the usual cooldown system. anyways.... good.... gooooooooood job larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"i love this game. every character is unique, even the npcs you meet along the way that gives you side quest! i went having high expectations and when i finally finished it, expectations were still high!! i knew i was going to play it again the 2nd time . the story was wonderful, had every choice for almost everything which i like and the different endings to achieve, aaahh!! not to mention the secrets around the map and stuff, i'm yet to figure them all out. the combat was super fun too, but i'd admit it stressed me tf out at times hbdjhabjhbsaha but still, i loved it all!! this game was super worth it and i'm willing to play it all over again d"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"while the plot is contrived and full of macguffins, the acting is top notch and production value overall is stellar  it manages to invoke emotions despite poor writing. the best aspect however is the game mechanics. it's fun, allows for a multitude of playstyles, and every problem has multiple solutions. i was somewhat afraid that the game would indeed be woke, in the sense that diversity would be an excuse for poor writing and gameplay value overall. while writing is a definitive weakness, the so called woke aspect is not forced, makes sense in the contex, and it's a good game regardless."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"1010 game, loved everything about it. scratched an itch i have had for a long time, looked for so many games and this hit the nail on the head in so many ways. 100'd the game and still play it, can't say that about many games. still finding more and more areas and missed content after several play throughs."
