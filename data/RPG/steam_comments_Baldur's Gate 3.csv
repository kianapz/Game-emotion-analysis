"The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!",True,240,6
"I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head.",True,178,96

"At first, I was hesitant to buy this game because of its price, but after playing it twice for a total of 260 hours, I still want to come back for a third playthrough, I can confidently say it’s worth every penny and more.

[h3]The customization:[/h3]
The game offers a wide selection for customization, allowing you to choose your race, background, and class, with the option to multiclass. You can even customize your voice, body type and your wiener. Dialogues are influenced by your origin, race, and class. Wizards and sorcerers can make fun of each other, drows can intimidate others, and companions might banter with you about whose god is the better one.

If you don’t want to create your own character, you can play as one of the 7 Origin characters. I recommend creating your own character or trying ""The Dark Urge"". He is unique as he is the only Origin character who doesn’t appear in the story, offering a unique playthrough you won’t experience on a normal playthrough.

The animations and facial expressions are impressive as well, they bring life to both human and non-human races. Even characters like dragonborns have expressive facial expressions.

[h3]Companions:[/h3]
The game features a huge cast of companions (10), each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. Over time, these companions evolve from strangers in your party to allies, friends, or romantic interests. Companions dynamically react to your choices and to each other, leading to surprising dialogues and conflicts. Bringing specific companions to encounters can change how they unfold, and you can influence their fate—helping them stay on their path or stray away from it. The voice acting is also phenomenal. Romances also features options for polymorphic or same-sex relationships, (so no one missies out on Shadowheart or Halsin).

Spoiler Alert: If you don’t want to miss an easily missable companion:[spoiler]When you meet a drow named Minthara, and if you get into a fight, switch to non-lethal combat and knock her out instead of killing her.[/spoiler]

[h3]Open World and Exploration:[/h3]
The game does an amazing job with its story, covering a wide range of topics, with its central themes being trauma, trust, and personal growth. There are three acts, each offering many beautiful and memorable locations to explore. Its open-world design lets you roam freely, and NPCs dynamically react to your actions. 

The world feels alive, with consequences for your actions. After 200+ hours, I’m still finding hidden dialogues and secret details that surprise me, making me appreciate the developers’ attention to detail.

[h3]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/h3]
The game offers many difficulty options, from ""Explorer"" for those who just want to enjoy the story to ""Tactician"" for the min-maxers. You can also play the game solo or in co-op, giving you the opportunity to experience the story with your friends.

Combat is highly creative, with spells and abilities that interact with the environment. For example, you can set up explosive barrels before an ambush or use water to create electrified surfaces. Players can tackle obstacles in numerous ways—combat, stealth, magic, or conversation. This variety ensures you can tailor the story to your own playstyle.

[h3]Flaws:[/h3] 
[list]
[*]As with many open-world games, bugs can arise due to its complex and detailed structure. For example, after killing a character, NPCs might still refer to them as alive. In one instance, I exposed a thief disguised as a guard, only to have him arrest me for stealing. 
[*]The ""non-lethal combat"" system, while great for roleplay purposes, doesn’t change much regarding the story. Knocked-out characters are treated as dead in most cases, with only a few exceptions.
[*]Lastly, the game struggles to provide a meaningful ""evil"" playthrough. While you can roleplay as morally grey or chaotic, the ""evil with purpose"" path is underdeveloped. Choosing the evil route frequently locks you out of story content, companions, and loot, making it less rewarding compared to good or morally ambiguous paths.
[/list]

[h3]Modding:[/h3]
The game supports modding through its official tools. You can download mods for quality-of-life improvements, like new hairstyles or face shapes, to more substantial additions such as new classes or playable races. For those who enjoy customizing further, mods like the ""handsome Lae'zel"" option let you adjust her appearance (though Bae'zel is already pretty stunning as she is!).

[h3]Overall:[/h3]
Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece that combines rich storytelling, deep customization, and endless possibilities for creativity. Whether you like D&D or completely new to the genre, this game offers an unforgettable RPG experience that will keep you coming back for more.",True,39,0
"[b]Note: This review came out very late because Baldur's Game 3 is something you just can't rush. I really wanted to know my final thoughts after not replaying it once, but trying different stories, paths, and modes like Honour Mode. This review is late but I feel I finally have gathered my thoughts.[/b]

[h1][u]Legendary Masterpiece[/u][/h1]
Just no other way of saying it. Larian Studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games I had the pleasure playing in. It is incredible on so many levels, I actually have a hard time believing it even exits. Now there's definitely some flaws with it, not a true perfect game, but it's as close as you can imagine.

[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]
It really plays out like you're in a DND 5e tabletop, but beyond what most would had expected. It didn't just make an adaption or inspiration; it's a love letter to DND 5e and i'm here for it. Gameplay is very smooth, feels great with mouse and keyboard, plus so much to do both in and outside combat. Sure the turn based combat is the main sell, but it's also got a lot more going for it, and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles, npcs, and finding secrets- it's all here. It's probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market.

[h1][u]Graphics and Story[/u][/h1]
Game is breathtaking, and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go. All locations and settings in this world is brimming with life, and I love how the characters are designed too. So much effort went into how the game looks, and it's marvelous to behold seeing for yourself.

The writing is straight up fire. Every quest, every arc in Acts 1, 2, and 3 were just immersive to delve into. Never did I get tired or bored of any quests, no matter how small. The main story is also incredibly well crafted and I bet many DM's (Dungeon Masters) will take much inspiration from this game. Such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers, going out of your way to learn more about the world, what you can learn from it, and completing quests just to hear more about this place Baldur's Gate 3 resides in.

Your choices VERY much matter here. There is no illusion or just going with the ride- everything you do has either a small, significant or major impact on the story. No choice ever feels like it didn't matter, and even story bits can change depending on what you do first- like a DM adapting to how you play and NPCs can change entirely based on how successful, good, or horrible you are.

[h1][u]Characters[/u][/h1]
Never had I imagined any game topping the Mass Effect Trilogy in terms of developed characters. But wow, this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever, that I loved all the characters. The voice acting is just peak performance, the traits and personalities of each character is so developed, and they really feel like people. You always experience something new with an NPC in this game, no matter what playthrough there's dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more. Every opportunity I wanted to engage and talk to my companions, completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships. Not a single NPC was poorly written, not one. What a huge feat Larian Studios did here, this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it. Some companions legit made me cry irl, just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep.

What makes these characters even more amazing is unlike Mass Effect, they legit can leave you, hate you, or even want to fight / murder you depending on your choices. They don't just tag along, they have thoughts, views, morals, and goals. They do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say, which does have impact on how the journey goes. This aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with.

[h1][u]Freedoms[/u][/h1]
So one of the strongest pros of this game (besides the unbelievably well written characters) is how much you can do outside the box. The game doesn't force you to play by the usual rules, you can get really creative in and out of combat. The game literally lets you cheese to your heart's content or do things even the game didn't expect you to do, but you're able to. With how the game is designed, any object can be used in numerous ways, you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal, and I keep seeing people on other sites and Youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game. Seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what you're doing. The game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesn't outright punish you- sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons, but the game really does let you roam and do whatever, in almost any order you wish. The world is yours to roam, Act to Act.

[h1][u]Mods[/u][/h1]
Larian Studios didn't just give us the best game I had played in awhile, but they are fully supportive of mods. This is a MAJOR deal, because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years+. Like Skyrim, they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want, and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod you're seeking. Larian Studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods- that's just awesome. Surprisingly most if not every mod I had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues, fully functional. Again I can't stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with Larian Studios supporting all mods, this will make the game 200% better in the long run.

[h1][u]Flaws[/u][/h1]
So it seemed like I had nothing but praise for the game. But there are some flaws with it, and I won't be shy as to what these flaws are. If you really love something, you should be allowed to give critics.

The biggest issue I have with this game is how the companion's AI acts when they follow you. They tend to get stuck often, and you have to manually move them to catch up. Worse, if you come across traps or dangerous areas, your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise. Sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks, but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem.

I remember in Tactical Mode, I had my party stop onto an elevator, waited 5 seconds because I wanted to make sure they'd stop moving, then suddenly when the elevator moved- all my party fell to their deaths, clipping from the bottom. Many traps or shifting parts due to bugs, which speaking of-

Another major issue is how glitchy, buggy, and unstable Act 3 is entirely. The first two Acts were solid, hardly any problems but Act 3 is riddled with pugs. Clipping through the floor, some cutscenes have missing NPCs, dialogue has no sound, and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene, for no reason. 

[h1][u]Honour Mode[/u][/h1]
So this one is my absolute pet peeve. While the other issues were 'worse' for general gameplay, this mode is just horrible. While I did like the challenge and Legendary Actions that bosses had, what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file, that's it. I understand why they did this, and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles, but the fact this game has some issues and especially Act 3 being so buggy, it ruins a lot of runs in Honour Mode.

I ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations. I don't mind dying and losing legit, but when it's outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug, glitch, or unexpected error- that's when I decide enough is enough.

[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]
Baldur's Gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game. It's a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of. A game that will leave you remembering it for years to come. 9.5 / 10",True,16,0
"Baldur's Gate 3 has garnered widespread acclaim since its release, being hailed as one of the best RPGs in recent memory. Developed by Larian Studios, it is the third installment in the *Baldur's Gate* series and is heavily influenced by the *Dungeons & Dragons* (D&D) 5th edition ruleset.

The narrative is one of the game's strongest points. It combines deep, branching storytelling with the freedom of choice, which impacts both character development and the outcome of the game. The game features a vast cast of unique characters with whom players can form relationships, each with their own personalities, backstories, and quests.

The turn-based combat system closely follows the rules of D&D 5e, which means it's tactical, strategic, and offers a lot of room for creative solutions. Combat is deeply engaging, and the interplay between character classes, spells, and positioning adds layers of complexity.

The character creation system is extensive, offering a variety of races, classes, and backgrounds that give each playthrough a different flavor. Players can create characters that fit their desired playstyle, whether they want to engage in combat, magic, stealth, or diplomacy. Each class feels distinct, and the interaction with the world depends on the character's abilities and choices.

One of the standout features of Baldur’s Gate 3 is its cooperative multiplayer mode. Up to four players can join a campaign together, with each player controlling their own character. This mode allows for a dynamic and varied experience, as players can interact with one another, make joint decisions, or even go against each other in certain situations.

The game is extremely long, with many quests, side content, and ways to approach different situations. Some reviews mention that it can take 80-100 hours or more to complete, especially if players engage with everything the game has to offer. Given the branching storylines and multiple endings, *Baldur's Gate 3* has a high replayability value.

Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph in the RPG genre. Its deep, interactive story, engaging combat system, and focus on player choice make it a must-play for fans of *Dungeons & Dragons* and RPGs in general. Whether you're a solo player enjoying the rich narrative or a multiplayer enthusiast seeking cooperative adventures, it offers a rewarding and immersive experience. Its combination of strategic combat, rich world-building, and compelling character interactions has set a new benchmark for modern RPGs.

"[b]Not a Fan of RPGs? This Game Will Change Your Mind[/b]

After a few sessions of [i]DnD[/i] (the tabletop game), I decided to check out the computer game based on its universe — [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]. And wow, it completely blew me away. The world feels alive and immersive, filled with rich characters and endless choices. The freedom to approach situations your way is incredible. From the stunning visuals to the deep combat and roleplaying, it’s clear this game was crafted with exceptional care and attention to detail.

This game is a must-play (especially fun in co-op). It’s a masterpiece that deserves all the love.",True,3,1
"Baldur's Gate 3 is a monumental achievement in CRPG design, offering an astonishing amount of content that will keep players engaged for hundreds of hours.
The depth of choice is staggering—many decisions, from dialogue options to combat strategies, have a tangible impact on the world and its characters.
This level of agency, combined with a richly detailed setting, makes each playthrough feel uniquely personal.

I deliberately chose to wait a considerable amount of time before diving in, wanting to ensure the experience was fully feature-complete and polished enough to be truly enjoyable.
Thankfully, Larian Studios delivered. The final release feels like a proper, expansive RPG with an incredible level of depth and refinement.

The sheer variety of character builds and the branching narrative paths mean that replaying the game is not just an option but a necessity for those who want to experience what this game has to offer.
Experimenting with different race/class/subclass/multiclassing combinations, party compositions, moral choices, and even mods ensures that no two journeys through Faerûn are the same.
As a Dungeons & Dragons experience on computer, it's unparalleled—adapting the 5th Edition rules while delivering the most immersive digital take on tabletop roleplaying to date.

At times, Baldur's Gate 3 can feel more like a Larian Studios game in the vein of Divinity: Original Sin rather than a purebred Baldur's Gate sequel, and while this isn't inherently bad, it may not fully satisfy purists of the original games (i.e., Turn-Based combat vs. Real-Time with Pause combat).
Technical hiccups also persist, with some bugs—though relatively rare—being severe enough to force you to reload an earlier save game.

Perhaps the most frustrating downside in my opinion is that, despite the game's overwhelming success, we may never see a Baldur's Gate 4 since Larian Studios has already announced that the upcoming Patch 8 will be the last major update for the game, as they plan to move on to other projects in the future.
And it's understandable, since Wizards of the Coast controls the franchise's rights and has been leaning toward live-service models and monetization strategies, while Baldur's Gate 3 combines an old-school single-player (with optional co-op) RPG philosophy with modern graphics and cinematic presentation, creating an immersive experience that appeals to both veterans and new players alike.

All in all, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a landmark RPG, delivering an unparalleled role-playing experience—something that, these days, is about as rare as a miniature giant space hamster.",True,3,0
"I rarely say this, but this game is absolutely worth it's full price. I have never replayed single player games so many times, enjoying each and every one of them. I've never bothered with achievements so much, as in this game. Hell, I'm not even a DnD fan or a fan of games of this genre, but I fell in love with Baldur's Gate 3.

Everything about this game is perfect: the graphics, style, music, characters, voice acting, story. And you can have mods! So many mods for every taste. I recommend to do at least 1st play through with vanilla game though.

One of the coolest things about this game is that Larian Studios keeps updating it and making it even better!",True,5,0

"Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals talk about logistics (c) Jason Statham

Well, how does a review even start? With a sarcastic remark, a quote, or something else? I have so much to say about this game and yet so little I can put into words.

Context Matters
First of all, this game should be viewed in the context of the reality its developers live in. In a world where AAA studios burn through obscene budgets on P-O-O-P games, exploit crunch culture, and make feeble attempts at ""delivering a message,"" big companies somehow still fail to release good games.

So, let’s take a moment to thank Larian Studios—they actually did it. They made a massive, high-quality game without being shackled to EA, Microsoft, or any other corporate overlords. Turns out, it is possible.

Second, I extend my sincere gratitude to all the cowards who took to Twitter (sorry, X) to whine about the game setting ""unrealistic expectations"" for the industry. Their spinelessness turned out to be a priceless asset in BG3’s marketing campaign.

But Is It Worth It?
So, is this game truly worth it? Is it actually a good idea to spend 200+ hours on it? Will you make it through with a party of your comrades? Is there more to it than just bearshipping and the DnD license?

Yes. Yes, there is. What you’ll find here is an adventure.

After watching countless reviews and discussions about whether BG3 is a ""real RPG,"" I want to say one thing: there is no such thing as a 'real RPG'.

You are always limited in your choices.
Developers always leave plot holes.
They always fail to fully account for every possible roleplay scenario.

In Fallout, you can’t be truly evil.
In The Witcher, your choices rarely have any deep impact on the world.

But does that make these games any less enjoyable? Nope.
You simply accept the terms and conditions—and enjoy the ride.

Golden Standard vs. The Black Sheep
For our playthrough, we ran a three-character party. A golden (and somewhat boring) standard:

Paladin
Wizard
…And me, the black sheep—a Bard.
And let me tell you—it was glorious.

When my criminal Bard got arrested for attacking livestock, stealing apples, and rejecting Gut’s supremacy, we were happy.
When our Paladin stopped pretending and became an Illithid, we were happy.
When our Wizard kept calling us ""dust cleaners"" because we couldn’t resist looting every single item in sight, we were happy.
When we made two out of three Thorm’s children commit [CENSORED], we were happy.
When I disrobed our Paladin, sent all his clothes and weapons to my camp chest, and let that clumsy oaf throw a poor halfling Bard like a ragdoll, we were happy.
Then came the Counting House incident.

Due to a bug, the guards started attacking our Wizard for absolutely no reason. So, naturally, we decided to embrace the chaos and turn our playthrough into a Fast & Furious-style heist.

We slaughtered every guard in the Counting House.
We took over the place.
It took 90 minutes, all our spells, and every single metagaming trick we had.
It was glorious.
Our Paladin—bless his misguided soul—actually tried to act like a Paladin and spent the whole fight swearing at us. We almost lost him. We spent dozens of scrolls and clouds of nasty spells. But we pulled it off.

And we were happy.

The Priceless Moments
Kicking Raphael’s horns? Priceless.
Using arrows, scrolls, and telekinesis to cheese fights? Priceless.
Failing skill checks four times in a row and losing our second pet because of it? Priceless.
Reaching the final cutscene only to have it ruined because a companion decided to feed on Jaheira? Priceless.
200 Hours Later
This game gave us 200 hours of adventure,
200 hours of unexpected interactions,
200 hours of cringe moments,
and dozens upon dozens of fights.

Larian Studios, YOU BOW TO NO ONE.",True,11,0
"Probably one of the best, most in depth games of the century. The amount of content in this game is insane for a single player experience, and its rare that a 100+ hour game would actually make me want to play the game through a second time. In fact I've beat the game twice solo and played it through far with friends multiple times.

It's a true role playing experience and is almost sandbox-like, despite having such a massive established world already. The creative freedom is insane. You can sit there and read through the well written story with amazing characters, explore all the side content and really engage with the world, or you can play strictly for the fun gameplay, skipping over the story to spend time doing stupid, creative things, like stacking up boxes to set up for a skydiving owlbear or going on a murder rampage and killing everyone. It's amazing how the game has so many avenues of play that you can choose to engage with or not based on your own roleplaying experience.

This game also has some of my favourite RPG mechanics of any game, drawing from DND combat and their past games such as DOS2. It translates excellently into the 3D format. You can pace the difficulty how you want, by taking rests when needed. Multiclassing is awesome in this game and the gear you can find to augment your abilities opens up so much. I do miss the elemental combat of DOS2, but there is many reasons that this game is better - namely the universal actions such as jumping and repositioning options, shoving, etc. add a lot of whismy to the game. You can go and blast things with a fireball, or you can throw your little gnome friend at the enemy, and then have him shove a guy off a cliff. There's a lot of potential for fun co-op play.",True,9,0
"Play this is you've ever wanted to jump into Dungeons and Dragons.  Play is you're into deep storylines and nonlinear gameplay. Enjoy the character development of your playable characters and see how your choices change the outcome of the main story.
Don't play this if you want hack n slash or action adventure play or expect to win because you're used to winning at everything and get upset at the idea of struggle.
This is a full-on D&D experience where you can use M&KB or a controller and really enjoy a real RPG that doesn't go easy on you. You really have to think about your choices and are rewarded (sometimes) for your conquests. A game you can play multiple times with very different outcomes, even if you made similar choices.

"Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game to me—it's been a lifeline during one of the darkest periods of my life. Its rich world and incredible storytelling provided a refuge when I needed it most, and even now, on my 10th playthrough, it continues to amaze me with its endless depth and intricate details.

The dynamic characters are what make this game truly extraordinary. Each companion feels so alive, with unique personalities, compelling backstories, and complex motivations that evolve as the story unfolds. I’ve fallen in love with all of them for different reasons, and their interactions remind me of the nuances and shades of gray in real-life relationships.

The writing is simply masterful. The game doesn’t just tell a story—it draws you into a world where your choices genuinely matter. It challenges you to think critically, to see the nuance in every decision, and to empathize with perspectives you might not have considered before.

Even after hundreds of hours, there’s still so much to discover. The level of detail in Baldur's Gate 3 is mind-blowing. From hidden paths and secret dialogues to subtle character moments you might miss the first time around, it’s clear that this game was crafted with love and care by a team who poured their hearts into every pixel.

Baldur's Gate 3 has given me more than entertainment—it’s given me a space to heal, to explore, and to grow. It’s a masterpiece that has set a new standard for RPGs, and I can’t recommend it highly enough to anyone who loves immersive storytelling and unforgettable adventures.",True,3,1
"After a bit over a hundred hours of logged gameplay on my save I've finished my first playthrough.
I've yet to see everything the game has to offer but I did cover most of it, and if there's something to be said about the game is that it is one of the largest, fullest game-worlds I've ever had the pleasure of exploring. Along with that enormousness comes the option to do basically almost anything you'd think to do in any given situation with how the game systems and the story / dialogue options are so fleshed out. A hundred different ways to approach each fight and a dozen dialogue options to prevent that same fight in the first place. This kind of game comes once in a decade if not lifetime and I'm glad to have given it a chance. Larian Studios smashed it out of the park with this one. They deserve all the praise they're getting and more.

"Best game I've ever played.

The general goal of Baldur's Gate 3 is to get rid of your mindflayer parasite, but it evolves into so much more. The story exploration is perfect. Other than being overwhelmed by general DnD stuff that you're unfamiliar with; the game does a great job at slowly introducing and familiarizing players with the story, setting, and everything else. You are first placed in a world with a general task (after the intro), and almost everything you do will inadvertently get you closer to that task. The player is the one to find the path to achieving their goal. It is not some to-do list nor aimless pile of tasks.

Hours spent knowing the lore, talking to all characters, be it origin or NPC, exploring every nooks and crannies, looting even the most irrelevant resources... It really is a world of its own and I'm so happy to have been in it. This will most likely not be my last gameplay because there's still so much to discover. I have so much appreciation to the creators of this game. They really did an amazing job with this game. This will hold a special place in my memories.",True,2,0
"This game is incredible...
I am inexperienced with proper D&D tabletop games, but I've always wanted to give it a try. I know this is somewhat different since you have saves you can load if you don't get an outcome you want, cause video game, but I find part of the fun for me is getting to play through this campaign over and over to experience the different paths and endings as you want to. No shame to people who don't want to save scum though, you live dangerously and I respect that, and I think this game is probably still rewarding to those who don't.

That aside, Larian really cooked with this, and are STILL in the kitchen even long after it's release. 
The game of the year award was so well deserved for this masterpiece. Everything from the visuals, to the gameplay, to the characters + character customisation and the classes, to the music, and even to the changelog and community update posts (your humour in them is fantastic and  so on-brand, thank you for hiring whoever it is that does those). This is the work of a games studio who actually care about the individual game they and their employees put great amount of efforts into being an enjoyable experience and playable even beyond a single year from it's release date. Not saying they are the only one's to do it, as there are plenty of other games out there that have achieved this feat, but rarely does it seem to apply to the vast majority of games that big game studios seem to churn out these days.

Even though my luck on rolls sucks when playing through this game at times, and I am an idiot who is still learning a lot of things about certain aspects (thank you ""load save"" feature for these reasons in particular lol), I still just struggle to put into exact words how good this game is and how strongly I recommend this to anyone who has taken even the slightest bit of interest in this game and are unsure on whether to play or not. We are well over a year out from the game being released, so I would like to think most people have by now, but if you haven't, please do. I promise it will be worth your time. This game will reward you tenfold.
Good luck, soldier!

"[h1] You Put an RPG in My Dating Simulator [/h1]

Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing game set in the Forgotten Realms universe. If you don't know what this means, it is a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons, a table-top role-playing game reliant on dice roles, an overarching storyteller (the ""Dungeon Master""), and multiple NPCs to interact with. BG3, therefore, may be a bit unconventional to those familiar to standard RPGs like Skyrim or the Witcher. It is played from a top-down perspective, where movement is real-time, but combat is turn-based. All encounters and item locations (I believe) are scripted, meaning the only difference between ""runs"" will be your choices (we'll get to this later). And, of course, what determines your success are your stats. At points you wouldn't even think of, whether it be in conversations or wandering around, you will be making ""dice rolls"" based on various attributes like strength and dexterity to see if you will succeed or not, which can lead to numerous outcomes.

You have the option to choose from 7 different ""Origin"" characters, or create your own (however, the 7th Origin character is very similar to a custom character with a few nuances). They each have their own backgrounds, stories, and ""personal quests"", which you will progress throughout the game to determine a unique ending. You will eventually get the opportunity to recruit four other companions later in the game, but their interactions are much less impactful (I believe due to budget cuts). You will meet all of these Origin characters in the main game, and can have three others with you during ""adventuring"" with you at one time. Some may find this frustrating, as it limits personal quest opportunities, unique dialogue, and relationships, essentially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs. If you take the side characters along instead, you'll limit the opportunities even further. 

As for the Origin characters, I think there's someone for everyone. I'm sure you've read online about people gushing over certain characters, but if you just care about stats or like them for their personality and don't like their stats, you can always respec them. The key component of using these characters is their combat skills, which, as mentioned, is turn-based. Everyone has special abilities, which needs to be used strategically in free-form combat. I say free-form as in ""everything is game"". You can use nearby objects to toss at enemies, combine liquids to deal more damage, climb rafters for a height advantage, push enemies off ledges, or use context clues for an encounter bonus (for example, there's a section where you can talk to a spider if you have the ability to do so to convince them to fight for you). 

Overall, the combat is nuanced and varied, but it can be very, very slow. There's four of you and sometimes dozens of enemies. You have to just sit there and wait for them to scuttle about and it can be a pain, making you consider non-aggressive tactics (if even possible). As for the main quest itself, I'd ironically say it's the weakest part of the game. The game thrives in the world and the side quests, many of which you can have a deep impact upon based on your choices (thus encouraging replay value). The main quest, though? You can actually skip a lot of it if you know what you're doing. I felt like the main quest was just there as a backdrop for the game to populate a world with side quests. Even in the end-game, the ""main quest"" is split into three parts that can be tackled in such a way that they act like three side quests. This isn't necessarily a criticism, as the side quests have tons of choices and options to them, most of which are meaningful, which I believe is the main draw of the game. 

Now, for the companion Origin stories and their personal quests, I think it could have been done a tad better. Your fate is practically sealed in the first part of the game, so if you mess up, or didn't build your relationship high enough (because you had other companions follow you), you may get frustrated. The game also starts dragging as a result. There's so many options and you want to see them all, that the tedious sections start to become more apparent. You can't do everything in one run, and one run takes a long time. Like, there's certain parts where you do just have to sit through inconsequential dialogue. Or there's choices that will just kill you, no matter the dice roll outcome (or lack there of). However, I can't really fault the game here for this, as Larian set a standard for RPGs of this genre with BG3. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Tactical combat that allows players to make use of the environment and a wide-range of abilities, requiring individuals to always be aware of what can be used against enemies and against themselves.
[*]The Origin characters are well-written and well-acted. They are fun to interact with and it's a joy to watch them grow as characters, for better or for worse depending on your choices. 
[*]The side quests are a particular highlight, with you having the potential to miss more than half the game if you aim to just complete the main story.
[*]Choices that matter and leave an impact, with both morally grey, good, and evil options. So many choices and options that you'd want to start a new playthrough right after you finish your first.
[*]Larian Studios has consistently made an effort to improve the game overtime, including adding mod support and listening to the community, a welcome change in today's gaming world.  
[*]It should be stated that the environments, voice acting, and overall design of this game is excellent. 
[*]Create Water is a level 1 transmutation spell.
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]At the risk of being contradictory and hypocritical, I must say that, even though the game's sheer size and number of choices are wonderful, there is a fault to it. In the review, I keep mentioning ""runs"". It is a strange RPG to me, having so many choices and options, but you're never going to see them all. You're never going to see that charm, because a fatigue will set in playing this very, very dialogue-heavy game (also, there is A LOT of walking). Some players may not even witness the game's title of ""Baldur's Gate"" because they'll be worn out by Part II, and I think that's a shame. In my opinion, I think the game should have a method to either skip combat, or start at specific Parts with choices done for you, like Dragon Age: Inquisition did upon launch.
[*]Branching from the combat complaint, it is is very slow when there are too many enemies. You have four members that you have to manage individually against a dozen enemies sometimes, each having their own special abilities, intricately moving around the nuanced environment. It can be painful, to say the least.
[*]As stated before, the limit on the companions following you is to the game's fault. Their relationship should be able to change even if at camp. However, I am aware that the four ""non-Origin"" companions were cut down on content due to budget reasons, so I can't really fault the game for that. But the last companion especially just felt shoehorned in, you have next to nothing to do by the time you find them unless you blitz towards their location. 
[*]Again, the main story seems just like a background for all of the side content. Also, for a game filled to the brim with so many choices, sometimes it deprives you of the ability to make them at key moments. 
[*]Romance with the companions can feel too superficial and lacks nuance, with particular favoritism being done against one that I noticed, as they had more dialogue options in regards to the ""relationship"" (even though it's just repetitive blurbs).

[b] Verdict: 9/10 [/b]",True,1,0
"The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!",True,2,0
"This isn't really my cup of tea, but still it's a 10/10. I struggle to get into CRPGs, but this game is fire. One day it'll click for me, at least that's what I keep telling myself. Buy this, then buy it again on a different platform, even if you never play it, give Larian your money because they deserve it. That's it, I'm going to go back to playing some crappy 9/10 game that I really like.",True,1,0
What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before. This game truly is revolutionary it does so much to suck you in to the world of D&D to the point where replay-ability is uncommon to do. It has everything that people should look for in a game while giving people what they want. Even if I don't like buying games for $70 this is one of those games that would be worth it,True,1,0
"One of the greatest games I’ve ever played. I can’t believe I missed it at launch, but I’m so glad I finally experienced it. A true masterpiece, thank you, Larian Studios!",True,1,0
"Very solid game.
Still some bugs that require fixing (certain equipment), and slight nitpicks to where the game is certainly not perfect (Wyrm's Rock Fort drawbridge).
Some companions have better and deeper arcs than others, and there also being some... questionable external continuity decisions.
But either way, the pros certainly outweigh the cons.",True,1,0
"I really don't know how to review this game... it basically raised the standards for what gaming means for me, and gave me a whole new perspective of it. It may sound like I am exaggerating but I mean it. 
This is a masterpiece. A work of art. What else can you call something that can make you go through so many emotions for hours, and can make you be obsessed over their characters? 

Here you can be yourself (or whoever you want to be) in detail, and from there you start an unforgettable adventure where you meet wholesome characters and create your own path every single time you play. I strongly recommend you to start as Dark Urge because it makes the game even more interesting, Trust me. 

Even though I wasn't a fan of turn-based games, this one easily won me over.
It also has a great soundtrack that envelops the atmosphere, and keeps you company as you explore the beautiful world they created.
Another good thing is the great community it has. One that from the beginning quickly began creating mods that are now ""legally"" integrated into the game. Additionally, Larian Studios does an amazing job listening (or reading) what the community wants.

The only bad thing I can say about the game is that I wish it had badges and stuff in the Point Shop here on Steam; I would love to customize my profile with my FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ",True,1,0

"One of the best gaming experiences one can have in an RPG. Production quality and VA being top notch with some excellent writing and overall good pacing to the story, and side-quests. I am in act III now, so have yet to finish the game, but the quality is definitely here. Larian set a bar for gaming in of the last 10 years. A truly unique experience with no end in replay-ability value. I have three different campaigns and have gotten as far as Act 3 in all of them. I am nearly finished with Act 3 with my Lore Bard run, and I have played these campaigns wildly different to see how much new content I can discover, how differently events may occur, or campanions react, and what impact on the world choices can have.

"Here the larian RPG model peaks for me. DND5 Rules and background lore lay the setting to a more grounded and beliavable setting than the Original Sin series, where the DND dice rolling rules spell tiers make the game feel very balanced. In terms of gameplay its in absolute sweet spot. 

Story and characters hold great personalities quirks and stories. For me was definitely worth for more replays for the good guys just to see how different party comps would work together and of course the Durge ""evil/redemptive"" playthrough adds another thing to the replay value of this game.

Multiplayer is supported and is quite fun, however i would not recommend playing multiplayer when firr st playing through the game. Its quite easy for one player to miss vital parts of the story and be quite confused.

"After 270+ hours I can say that you start the game with big plans: be a hero, save the world, make wise choices…
5 minutes later: your naked barbarian yeets an enemy off a cliff, and a goblin calls you ""boss.""

✅ Pros:
✔ A massive world where every decision has consequences (even the ones you made by accident).
✔ Failing a quest with a bad dice roll has never felt so fun.
✔ The characters are so charismatic, you start caring about their emotions more than your own.
✔ Interaction level: ""If you can pick it up, you can throw it at someone.""

❌ Cons:
✖️ 100+ hours of gameplay, and you’ll still want to restart.
✖️ Sometimes, the dice personally hate you.
✖️ It’s not the story that betrays you—it’s your own desire to ""try one more option.""

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an unequivocal masterpiece that captivates players by seamlessly merging role-playing depth with critical decision-making, all set against a backdrop of compelling storylines and consequential moral choices. This game stands out as a pinnacle of narrative-driven gameplay, where every decision you make carries weight and significance, drawing you deeper into its intricately woven tales.

The game boasts a high level of replayability, thanks to its brilliantly crafted origin characters who are not only deeply beloved but whose fates can dramatically unfold within the game itself—often with fatal consequences. These characters enhance the richness of the experience, making each playthrough uniquely engaging.

The dialogue in Baldur's Gate 3 is both heart-tugging and wrenching, crafted to pull at the player’s emotions and challenge their moral compass. Coupled with skills that are as colourful and explosive as they are effective, the game delivers a sensory feast that is as visually stunning as it is emotionally stirring. The world itself is mesmerising and enchanting, filled with breathtaking vistas and environments that invite exploration and adventure.

Players are bound to fall in love with everything Baldur's Gate 3 offers. At the heart of its allure is the game's focus on choices and consequences. Each decision a player makes feels impactful, fostering a genuine sense of agency that few games achieve. This element of choice ensures that players are not merely passing through a story but actively shaping it, grappling with their conscience and the moral dilemmas that arise from their actions.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game; it's a profound interactive experience that resonates on multiple levels. Players are not only entertained but are also invited to reflect on the ramifications of their choices, making it a truly immersive and thought-provoking adventure.

Act 1 is mostly wilderness and the learning arc which is kinda hard if you are not familiar with dnd genre, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 is like urban adventuring ig. The game feels slow lots of times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation. 10/10 would recommend",True,1,1

Every time I'm faced with a new dialogue I wonder what it would be like in different circumstances. I'm certain I'll never see all of the many different options and details this game has to offer. You could play it over and over again, which is something really unusual for me as someone with ADHD. Highly recommend this game.",True,1,0

"One of my favourite games ever made. All the choices you make have an impact on the story, endings and characters. You can play as your own character, or one of the origin characters. There are tons of romance options. The environment and music is beautiful. Character customisation is great (although the heads are presets). All the classes are very fun too. 

Lots of things to do in this game, one playthrough of 100% (all quests, treasures etc) took me 120 hours, but the game has replayability and I have played it 5 times. The other characters have different stories so therefore they behave differently with the quests, environments and storylines. It has both good and bad moments, if you laugh like crazy or cry your eyes out within the span of 30 minutes while playing this game I would not be surprised. Amazing game.

"I'm surprised that such an overwhelmingly positive game, that has been out as long as it has been, has so many bugs in it. When selling it shows me different items, and sometimes different amounts of gold i could possibly receive for it. (not talking about what i will get, but the number on the item description). Iv also had an issue with the cut scenes where it would play for a bit, then go back about 10-30 seconds and play that portion again then continue and then go back 10-30 seconds again and continue... it was weird...

But my main issue with it is how clunky it is, and for the record i use a controller. I do have some issues with accidentally triggering the L3 button, which can be annoying, but I'll just write that off as user error, if not my controller.

I have been playing on the Tactician difficulty, and although i fully understand it's meant for a harder challenge... it just doesn't sit right when all of your opponents move first and wipe out half of the party before you get a turn even though your the same level... now when I'm one level higher then it's suddenly all gum drops and ice cream. lol

My only other issue is just with games like this where you can chose options for whats happening and I'm like... why the fuck would i choose any of these options? Maybe just a me thing though.",False,12,13

"The greatest game of all time, I waited a bit to write a review because I know my hours are gonna keep skyrocketing. I bought it originally on Xbox and had to get it on PC for more mods and the graphic upgrade. There are so many different things I've experienced in this game that no game has offered me, the music from the first time I started the game was iconic. I felt like I had heard Down By The River a million times the first time I heard it. Perfect atmosphere to start the game. So many great scenes with well made, sung, and timed songs. 
No game has ever offered the level of immersion this game gives between dialogue specific to your race, class, affiliation. When and if you've interacted with a character who seemed so minor could come back into play 12 hours later. Larian really outdid themselves in every regard with this game. The game is about to be releasing its final update so its about to be in its complete state, so new fans won't be aware of the love Larian put into this game from EA to the final update. Rewriting the least popular character, adding a new follower, giving us more endings that didn't need to exist for the game to be an all timer but do because in this game they should.
You can really feel the blood, sweat, and tears put into this game. It's a game for gamers. And in the age of companies discussing charging you for ""how many hours you played their game"" it's refreshing to see a company that isn't that way. My only wish is that we get a BG4, or some form of DLC(I read no more updates, that doesn't mean we cant get some DLC lmao).
Regardless I'm more than glad I played Baldur's Gate 3 and I cannot recommend it enough. And if you can't get enough content the Main 6 VA's have done playthroughs of the game and DnD sessions on YouTube.",True,1,0

I wanted to like this game.  It looks good.  It was just more like work than having fun.  I had no desire to continue to the second act.,False,34,11
"Larian made a beautiful, amazingly voice-acted game that bugs out constantly and has some baffling design decisions that suck the fun out of it for me. Having the game only have one proper town for the larian-sandbox type area in the whole game seems like a huge mistake when most of the fun in Larian for me is the running-around robbing a jewel store or any of the other non-combat silly moments with my friends. 


Deciding to cap your level towards the very start of Act 3 might be one of the most baffling design decisions in any game I've ever played and makes it where the only area I found fun to explore was worthless to explore at all. I've never played D&D before, and I honestly still don't understand half the concepts of basic combat or why numbers work the way they do, so combat isn't engaging or exciting to me in the slightest. Baldur's Gate 3 also uses really vague and non-concrete wording on abilities and spells so someone who's never played D&D has no idea if an interaction is going to favor him or not. 


Adding on to my frustrations in combat is that the game bugs out *constantly*. Between having allies get stuck in broken objects and lose their turns forever to having my entire character's kit not be able to be used after fast-traveling, it made progressing through the game and having to fix these problems constantly very frustrating. We would take a 15-minute detour to make the game function again every time this would happen and it got old very fast. Not being able to see my teammates die-rolls' every other dieroll also breaks the flow of every cutscene I'm in and takes me out of the scene completely (Especially when I want to Guidance them and I can't). Every boss felt the same with the exception of Orin to me because we cheesed every fight with Radiating Orbs. Also, having to stay incredibly close to each other in Act 2 during the Lantern sections is like the worst thing ever. 


I did have fun with some of the game, doing a bank heist in Baldur's Gate was super enjoyable. The displacer beast form was fun for me, filling the screen with panthers. I enjoyed the Steel Protector people's dungeon, but these sections are few and far between in the grand scheme of sitting through a 60 hour game.

"Haven't finished the game yet, but I played enough to solidify my opinion on it. Baldur's Gate 3 is a great game that is a bit held back by the DnD 5e mechanics. 

I won't spend too much time singing praises since BG3 broke into the mainstream and it was very well-deserved. Larian Studios had already proved they could make an amazing CRPG with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and with the extra time they put into this game, their mastery shows. A lot of stuff to do, fun quests and dungeons, interesting characters to interact, great voice acting and good improvements from the TTRPG version of the mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, high-fantasy, tactical combat RPG with a lot of dialogue choices, go for it.

My two main complaints are with the multiplayer and the DnD 5e combat/progression mechanics. 

Regarding the multiplayer, I think it's mostly my preferences. There are clear improvements in comparison to DOS2 multiplayer in general, but I still feel like this is a game I'd rather enjoy on multiplayer co-op, while it's clearly designed with single-player in mind. You can still have a lot of fun with it, but it will make you miss out on a lot of the character-driven narratives and the general self-insertion story that these RPGs tend to aim for. Once again, I wouldn't say that that is necessarily bad, but it clashes with the way I prefer to play - and you can always play with each player using an origin character from the game.

Regarding the DnD mechanics, I think it's a straight downgrade from DOS2. Leveling up only in your class by default, action types instead of action points, daily and level up spell memorizing and all that, not fun in my book. These adaptations from DnD 5e add complexity that doesn't add tactical depth on one end and restrict choices and freedom on the other. Like I said, a lot of good changes from the TTRPG mechanics were made, but it's still a flawed system for me. 

In conclusion, I very much do reccomend Baldur's Gate 3. I think it's more polished and approachable than DOS 2 (even though the general mechanics are less fun, in my opinion) and deserves all the praise it has gotten. It's an awesome RPG adventure and clearly worth the price.",True,0,0

The game rules! A crapload of decisions, consequences and roleplay options. A crapload of buildcraft and well made turn based combat. Well written story and companions that may not all be to your liking but certainly still good characters.

"There is likely nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said a hundred times over.  It is, simply, [b][u]THE[/u][/b] computer role playing game of this generation.  It will be the measuring stick used to judge everything that come after it for years to come.  It is a sublime gaming experience, with well over 100 hours of content, near-endless replayability, exquisite fully customizable starting character generation complemented by pre-crafted starting character options who come with their own stories and flaws and special abilities, and a myriad of possible endings influenced by nearly every decision your party of characters makes during their adventures.  It continues the story of the previous two prequels, referencing many of the characters and events in those stories, without requiring any knowledge of those stories to immerse yourself into this living world.
In short, if you've ever enjoyed turn-based CRPG's or wanted to delve into the the lore and histories of the Dungeons and Dragons world of the [b]Forgotten Realms[/b], then I cannot recommend this game enough.

"As a self-proclaimed cozy gamer, I had exactly zero experience with turn-based RPGs or even D&D when I first bought this game. Fast forward a few months and I'm now 300+ hrs in and already on my 2nd campaign! 

I wanted to leave a review for the gamers that may be intimidated to dip their toe into the Forgotten Realms as a noob like me, but after a few YouTube tutorials to get my bearings, I was completely sucked into the lore, the plot, the characters, the...everything really. When I say BG3 is everything I've ever wanted in a video game, it's not an exaggeration. Is there a fairly steep learning curve? Yes. Is the scale of the game a bit overwhelming at times? Sure. But if you're the kind of person who loves a good CYOA story on an epic scale, has to open every single crate and explore each nook and cranny of the map, enjoys coming up with clever approaches to fights, reads every found letter and book--this game is for you!!

On a final note, I was concerned about replayability, but I'm at the top of my 2nd campaign and have been really impressed so far! With so many different character build options, playing as a different class or race can unlock new dialogue options, leading to new choices, and new plot beats. My experience as a swords bard is already a vastly different than my 1st as a ranger. I may not be as good with a bow, but inflicting psychic damage on bad guys by absolutely roasting them in the heat of battle is hilariously satisfying.

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is nothing short of a triumph in modern RPG design. Larian Studios has crafted an experience that seamlessly blends deep storytelling, rich character development, and strategic turn-based combat, making it one of the most immersive RPGs in years.

The game’s narrative is gripping from the start, offering a branching storyline with meaningful choices that genuinely impact the world and its inhabitants. Whether you're forging alliances, romancing companions, or making morally complex decisions, every moment feels personal and weighty. The dialogue and voice acting are top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that few games manage.

Gameplay-wise, the turn-based combat is intuitive yet complex, rewarding creativity and tactical thinking. The Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition mechanics are faithfully adapted, allowing for endless customization and role-playing possibilities. With a vast world to explore, hidden secrets to uncover, and countless ways to approach encounters, the replay value is immense.

I highly recommend this adventure solo or with a friend so that the two of you can experience all that the companions' stories have to offer but if you're more inclined to play with three or four people just be prepared to make some of your own stories.

Pros: 
1. looks and plays great
2. fantastic story line
3. lots of fun class options 
4. many many ways to play, probably the closest thing to a ""True RPG"" I've ever played

Cons:
1. there is so much gd content its mind boggling, you will almost certainly need to google stuff frequently
2. there isn't really a meta way to play, so min maxing can be a bit annoying at times
3. the sheer amount of choices to be made and how they affect each other makes me really paranoid during every interaction... if you have FOMO this game is tough, something as small as the background you pick can and will lock you out of certain quests and rewards, so build planning can be really tricky especially if you're in a party with other players.

"In short, I would recommend this game to most players. I would say that the game is a great value for money. 

But, clearly, this game is anything but short, so the review also requires more meat on the bone.

Some history. I have played DOS and DOS2 prior to BG3. My first experience with D&D systems was WOTR (I know that it is not one-to-one with D&D). 

For me, there are several ways how to look at this game. 
If I consider the game ending at beating the first of the three at the end of the second act, I would rate the game rather highly, but if I add the third act, oh boy, it goes down rapidly.
The first two acts were pretty tight. Character development, growth, intrigue, story - everything was seemingly there. Then the third act just bloated it all away.

I spent some considerable time on thinking about the game, and it all came down to one phrase ""superficial, bloated, and in odds with itself"". There is simply too much of everything. You walk around, find a chest, find some loot and do it ad nauseam. The loot is meaningless; to find chests, you don`t even need to succeed in checks, just dig after failing. Exploration was fun in the beginning. Go of the beaten track, find a special location or loot. Then it all boiled down to: there is a house, the house has a hatch, down the hatch there is a secret lever, crumbling wall or something similar, and a again, and again, and again. 
And then there are the characters. My horny, horny party. Full of one-liners, sleezy comments, tragic backstories and so on. All this noise just made it very difficult to take them seriously. In the end I have to say that Lae'zel was the one true guiding light for me (no romance though). Of course, Scratch and friends.

The story tried to be serious, but the tone was all over the place. 

And then the others I met. Mostly, they made no sense. For example, a random guy who in span of the game goes from casting maybe one decent spell to becoming some uber-mench wizard - why, how, what? 

The list goes on and on. 

Even the leveling system had no depth to it. 12 levels for the entire game? DOS was half the length, but almost twice the levels. I mentioned my experience with d&d systems. Here, the peak of the systems were the resting/spell slot mechanics and the ever-present die. Just roll them dice, boys!

I could write and write, but I will try not to make the same mistakes as BG3.

I know, this sounds very negative, but the game is still a good game, just not as great as WOTR is.
Buy it, play it. Maybe your experience is better than mine, maybe I`m just not the target audience for the game.
I`m happy that BG3 did this well. CRPGs need to be out there, and this is a very streamlined way how to get into the genre.

"I overall recommend BG3. It has some prime-level production values. It falls short in some aspects of the gameplay.

Pros: 
-Masterful interweaving storylines and dialogue options
-Great characters
-Graphics
-Music and sound design
-Level design
-good controller support
-character creation customization options
-class depth


Cons: 
-Gameplay lacks z-axis aiming or positioning, e.g., free-aiming into the air a fireball or flying into a stationary position high up, floating in place, like in Solasta. This is a big con, and I have read this has something to do with the difficulty of implementing such things in Unreal.

-Dialogue options are sometimes frustratingly limited and unrealistic, particularly in a party context. One character might say something while everyone stands there as though they were not involved or couldn't possibly have anything to add, which sometimes took me out of the experience. 

-Sometimes you will be stuck with one person when a conversation begins, or you may be unprepared for the dialogue initiator to engage and then can't switch to the appropriate party member, e.g., you want to use your sorcerer to discuss an arcane topic with a lich, but your barbarian is the one stuck in conversation after initiating the conversation without warning. You may then need to reload the game.

"I typically don't like games like this, not a big singeplayer/rpg guy. Grew up playing cod, halo, etc. I can't rave about this game enough. It has a path for every play style given the different difficulties and class types. Also if you hate playing by yourself you can start a multiplayer campaign which can be vastly different from the solo story in ways. I also thought I would hate the turn based gameplay, but ended up getting used to it and came to love it. It feels like chess meets halo wars, a ton of fun. one of the few games that is worth full price without a question!

I also want to note how vast the game is. I started a solo campaign a long time ago and got to a certain point where I was severely under leveled and didn't have any other quests because I skipped too much. I started a new solo campaign and in the first few days of playing, without even trying to search every nook and cranny of the map, I have already found 4/5 ENTIRE towns/sections of the map that I did not ever come across in the first play through. Highly encourages playing again without repeating the same exact story. Even the main story line can completely change given your responses and/or play style.

It gets a lot better as you level up and get new abilities. Not only is combat more fun, but you can start to do things the way you want to instead of being railroaded into doing them a certain way like you are in the early game.

What makes it truly special is how you can create a story of your own, making every playthrough a deeply personal experience. On top of that, the main storyline is incredibly well-written and immersive.

"A Masterpiece of Modern RPGs – Baldur's Gate 3 Delivers on Every Front

Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of a triumph in the RPG genre. From the moment you dive into its richly detailed world, it’s clear that Larian Studios poured their heart and soul into this game. The storytelling is phenomenal, weaving intricate narratives with deep, meaningful choices that genuinely impact the world and your relationships with companions.

The graphics are stunning, bringing Faerûn to life with breathtaking landscapes, atmospheric dungeons, and expressive character models. The voice acting is top-tier, making every interaction feel authentic and immersive. Each companion is fleshed out with their own unique backstory and personality, making it hard to choose favorites when they’re all so well-written.

Combat is a perfect blend of strategic turn-based mechanics and D&D 5e rules, offering endless possibilities for creative problem-solving. Whether you're sneaking through shadows, unleashing powerful spells, or negotiating your way out of sticky situations, the gameplay keeps you hooked. The freedom to approach situations in multiple ways is truly refreshing.

What really sets Baldur's Gate 3 apart is its attention to detail and the sheer scope of player agency. It’s rare to find a game where your choices feel this impactful. The replayability is off the charts, with countless ways to shape your character’s journey.

If you're a fan of deep, story-driven RPGs, or even just curious about diving into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate 3 is an absolute must-play. It’s a game that respects your time, intelligence, and creativity, making it one of the best RPGs in recent years.

"*SPOILERS KINDA I ramble*





As I sat through the credits it took me back to a point in act 2 where I felt the story was clear cut enough that I could predict what would happen at the end. The end of the act 2 was rousing, however the start of act 3 was confusing as I had expected to actually traverse the entirety of a city that the game is named after instead of the outskirts. Contradicting the landscape at the start of the game, I was excited to see how far the party would travel from the middle of nowhere to cursed lands to a bustling city, all very diverse areas. Expectations and predictions are not always met well in the gaming industry (thanks to triple a gaming studios who have squandered their reputations in the name of greed), but I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of choice I had with branching pathways. 

Previous RPG games have taught, ingrained, within me that if I am approaching a dangerous situation rife with ""bad guys"" I should sneak for as long as possible before triggering the inevitable fight. BG3 gave me many opportunities to realize that despite, playing the *good* route for my first playthrough, I could still interact with others to achieve my goals. I've always been a fan of charisma and talking my way out of things rather than fighting so I was pleasantly surprised in Act 2 where several ""minibosses"" could just be persuaded to... end themselves. I actually did not need to waste time trying to persuade/deceive/manipulate  only to be forced to fight them. Granted I did make my skill checks with bonuses, but the flexibility in pathing despite choosing to be good was well received in my case. So much that is has inspired me to play again as Durge making different choices and siding with Bhaal (because I could do much better than Orin). Instead of relying more on charisma, I intend to rely on skills I rarely pick such as strength or wisdom. 

I suppose the point is my expectations were pleasantly subverted as time went on, moreso due to story direction as the writing was already phenomenal. For a game I sunk so many hours into (with 10+ afking and solely customizing characters) I am glad there are so many people working on such a masterpiece. Other game studios could learn from actually taking risks with proper thought and art direction to make an experience, not just a product rushed out to make money. Games should be games and not products meant to support companies. Yet when you have a large budget and plan to make a game, you can truly MAKE something. 

I am upset that I installed mods and lost the ability to get achievements for half of my game. I did a lot of things and its frustrating to see lost progress because of it.

"TLDR You might not like this if combat was your favourite thing in Divinity OS 1 and 2  but incredible roleplaying experience, huge game but combat feels a little jank pre level 5: 10/10 still imo.

I got this game going into it almost entirely blind because I loved Divinity OS 1 and 2, this game is nothing like either of those games. The combat in those games is incredible and is like the highlight of it where (imo) it's way less fun in this one because of the randomness and only (usually) being able to take one action per turn; however in my 27h of playing and having not even finished the first area I've found myself actually enjoying my character (a bard) being able to talk their way out of fights and things in a way that feels genuinely rewarding I haven't felt since Fallout New Vegas. There's so much genuinely engaging content just talking to characters it can feel incredibly overwhelming and overall I'd describe it less of a game and more of an experience to understand the story.

I think the story pacing is amazing, companions, dialogue and options are great. What makes this game even better for me is the fact that I can also play with my friends and divide some of the responsibilities, or just be plain silly like running around with 4 Bards. Patch 8 is coming soon but I couldn't keep my hands off this game. For those who even want MORE of a challenge with the story, Honor Mode is GREAT! Hard as heck but great nonetheless.

Not just in story, mechanics, and design; but also in the way Larian has reliably updated and improved the game. This game is 100% worth the sticker price. You can have four separate play-throughs and do it differently every time. The game is career endingly good because I could easily just play Baldur's Gate 3 all day instead of doing my job or raising my kids. 

Not only is the base game fun and awesome, but Larian dedicates a section of their company to adjusting fan developed mods for the game to make sure they're compatible. It's the easiest mod manager I've ever had to use. Every time something in the game gets stale for me, I can easily find a new mod to make it fun again,

"The in game story is different every time you play because you keep discovering more each time you explore.  I would recommend the easiest level to get in more details  of the character dialogues.

The characters you interact in the game with most a very flushed out like your companions and major villains.  However there is some major backstory information on minor characters, but those you really need to explore for.  You can play however you want with your character.  There will be consequences for what you say and do in the game that will change the outcome of you play through.  Larian has done so well with this game that I now have over 700 hours in and still have so much to explore especially with patch 8 coming out.  I have seen multiple videos on youtube to help me through puzzles that after 4 to 5 attempts needed some help and there were little bits of info that helped me in later play throughs.  I have loved this game so much that it has become my gateway into D&D itself.   Don't miss out on this game.

"I’m on my second playthrough of Baldur’s Gate 3, and it’s just as captivating as the first—if not more. What stands out the most this time around is how many different aspects of the story surface respect to the first run. The way choices shape not just the main plot but also the relationships and interactions between characters is remarkable. Decisions that seemed minor before now reveal entirely new layers of the world, and I keep finding new details that make the story even richer.

The characters feel incredibly real. Their motivations, their struggles, and even their moments of humor make them some of the best companions I’ve seen in an RPG. The writing is strong, but what really elevates the experience is the phenomenal voice acting. The actors bring so much personality to each character that I genuinely care about their stories.

If there’s one thing that slightly dampens my experience, though, it’s the camera management. In most situations, it’s fine, but during combat—especially when characters are fighting on different elevations—I often struggle to get the right angle. It can be frustrating when I just want to line up a spell or assess the battlefield properly but have to fight against the camera instead.

That said, this is a minor issue in an otherwise outstanding game. The level of detail, the weight of every choice, and the sheer depth of the world make Baldur’s Gate 3 a truly unforgettable RPG.

Wish they made Wyll a bit more complex + extended his story cuz frankly he's pretty bland (at least for me, compared to Astarion or Karlach).

"Something about ""DnD without any friends"" sounded very unappealing. I've never been a big fan of the 5e combat system nor have I loved the Forgotten Realms world building. All of this is to say that BG3 (for the most part) overcomes these shortcomings. It is pretty easy to get invested in your party as you traverse through the various acts, and while not all characters have the same amount of depth, each one feels unique and special in their own regard. As far as gameplay goes, the added 3rd dimension really makes the combat much more dynamic, although the ""cast fireball until it dies"" strategy is still viable if that is how you want to play. Spirit Guardians is also weirdly overpowered for some odd reason. Although the combat is largely improved, it still suffers from some shortcomings of 5e (spellcaster dominance, too many adds, etc.). As for the rest of the game, dialouge and character interactions are great, the rations system feels a little weird, but not unbearable, and it has J.K. Simmons so would reccomend.",True,0,0

"There's a million reviews for this game, but I still felt to add my own take on this game. I hope it helps you make a decision on whether or not you should purchase this game. I spent a lot of time with it, and I can recommend it, but only if you are somewhat new to the genre and to tabletop RPGs in general. If you're a veteran of the genre, I don't know if I'd wholeheartedly recommend the game. The game is very much carried by excellent production values and attention to detail, but I feel the source material is severely lacking.

I'll start with why this game is a recommend, especially for people new to games like D&D:
1. The production values are top-notch. It looks good graphically, the voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard and the environments are imaginative and interesting to explore. It's like every part of the game was iterated upon dozens of times, only to polish it further so the players can get maximum enjoyment out of every part of it.
2. The attention to detail is astounding. Apart from everything having voice lines, story arcs take long to unfold. Choices you make carry a lot of weight and it rewards playing the game a second or a third time. There's a lot of situational dialogue that is fun to discover. The creators have obsessed over every detail and it shows. It's like a work of art that you know took years of every waking hour of the artist to create.
3. The turn-based battles are such a breath of fresh air compared to the real-time-with-pause from earlier games and similar games in the genre. I don't understand how people (including me) put up with RTWP in the past.

Now for the long-winded and nuanced part, why I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game to veterans of the genre. Most of this has little to do with Larian.
1. The source material is weak. Forgotten Realms is stale and bland. The setting carries a lot of brand recognition, but playing the game and flipping through my old sourcebooks I found that time really has caught up with this setting, and there's just so much more interesting fantasy setting material out there. In the D&D sphere you have Dark Sun and Eberron that have way more interesting takes on the fantasy genre, in the Pathfinder sphere Golarion just surpasses almost everything FR has to offer. There's a reason the game revolves around mind flayers, and that is because you'd be hard-pressed to find good villains otherwise in the setting. Sorry for FR fans, but I feel the setting is terribly cliche.
2. I don't think 5th edition translates very well to a videogame. Combat is fun in the beginning, but the mess of an action economy makes it a chore. I found myself just tuning down the difficulty to make battles go faster. I found them to be boring and after a while I started to look for conversation options that would let me skip the battles instead of roleplaying my character.
3. This one does belong in Larian's camp: I found most of the companions unimaginative. Astarion is extremely predictable, so is Wyll's struggle. Karlach is a cool character but I cared little for her story. Lae'zel is OK, so is Gale, but it's not outstanding character development we're seeing there. It's all vampires, devils, tieflings, evil gods. It's like an angsty teenager's scrapbook.

I feel that, if you've played a lot of these games, BG3 will eventually bore you. But it will easily take 50 hours of fun before that happens. It will be a great ride until you do and for the outstanding production values alone it's well worth getting into.  Just be prepared to maybe grit your teeth at the end to get to the climax. For new players who are heavily into lore and crunch I feel this game is a good gateway to games that maybe less polished, but run much deeper. I can only imagine what Larian would accomplish with better source material. BG3 is one of the best games of the past 10 years, despite of the somewhat hollowed out husks of 5th edition D&D and Forgotten Realms. It's an astonishing accomplishment that's deserving of so much praise.",True,0,0

"I absolutely love this game.
I hadn't really heard of it until my best friend said I should get it after one of our 5e D&D games around the time the game released.  He convinced me and I ended up getting it not too long after and started my first game as a co-op with him.  We hadn't even done 2 gaming sessions before I started my own solo run.  My extensive knowledge of how D&D 5e works really helped me understand the mechanics of the game quickly and I was very quickly engrossed in the setting and the interactions you can have within it.  

I was fully engaged with the story by the time I finished Act 1.  It took me 150+ hours for my first run cause I was determined to do every side-quest and explore each corner of the map.  Even then I still missed things.  One of the biggest things I enjoy about the game is the rpg elements and the variety of ways you can engage with the plot.  Despite the hours I've put into it I still haven't experienced each ending and there's still a handful of achievements I still need to get (I'm working on it though).

The only complaint I can give is that it takes up a *lot* of space on the computer and can be pretty slow running if you don't have the best computer.",True,0,0
"It was hard to get into properly, but once the game clicked for me it was a lot of fun. Some of the quests and boss scenes are just incredible. Extremely pretty game, with deep mechanics. If you're someone who likes the idea of DnD, but could never really get into it, then is is a great way to get into it without having to worry about all the rules and roles that go into it. Everything is handled behind the scenes, and all the options available to you are more clearly listed.

One of the things that really helped me enjoy the game was when I understood how the class system worked and actually tried creating a cohesive build with multiclassing. It's easy to just keep clicking up whatever role you chose, but going to check out the wiki and spending a bit of time thinking about what I'd get at each level, and what I really wanted helped me feel more excited about each level up, and anticipate it before it came.",True,0,0

Ok, but seriously, if you are a fan of turn-based games, fantasy RPG's, D&D, or choice-filled story games you will want to play this. I was at least 50-60 hours into my first full game (after multiple characters in the beta version) before I even got to Baldur's Gate. Larian took the beloved rules of D&D 5E, altered them to better fit a video game and the inherent limitations therein (and some much needed love to certain classes/subclasses), and made a game that I feel brings you the closest to the feeling of sitting around a table with some friends playing a role playing game. Want to cast Grease so that it overlaps a fire to light an enemy up, you can. Want to ask that random corpse you found something, you can. Want to carry around a barrel of gunpowder for days before throwing it at an enemy and having your friend blow it up with a fire spell while shouting ""FLUFFERNUTTER!"", you can.
