"[b]Note: This review came out very late because Baldur's Game 3 is something you just can't rush. I really wanted to know my final thoughts after not replaying it once, but trying different stories, paths, and modes like Honour Mode. This review is late but I feel I finally have gathered my thoughts.[/b]

[h1][u]Legendary Masterpiece[/u][/h1]
Just no other way of saying it. Larian Studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games I had the pleasure playing in. It is incredible on so many levels, I actually have a hard time believing it even exits. Now there's definitely some flaws with it, not a true perfect game, but it's as close as you can imagine.

[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]
It really plays out like you're in a DND 5e tabletop, but beyond what most would had expected. It didn't just make an adaption or inspiration; it's a love letter to DND 5e and i'm here for it. Gameplay is very smooth, feels great with mouse and keyboard, plus so much to do both in and outside combat. Sure the turn based combat is the main sell, but it's also got a lot more going for it, and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles, npcs, and finding secrets- it's all here. It's probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market.

[h1][u]Graphics and Story[/u][/h1]
Game is breathtaking, and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go. All locations and settings in this world is brimming with life, and I love how the characters are designed too. So much effort went into how the game looks, and it's marvelous to behold seeing for yourself.

The writing is straight up fire. Every quest, every arc in Acts 1, 2, and 3 were just immersive to delve into. Never did I get tired or bored of any quests, no matter how small. The main story is also incredibly well crafted and I bet many DM's (Dungeon Masters) will take much inspiration from this game. Such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers, going out of your way to learn more about the world, what you can learn from it, and completing quests just to hear more about this place Baldur's Gate 3 resides in.

Your choices VERY much matter here. There is no illusion or just going with the ride- everything you do has either a small, significant or major impact on the story. No choice ever feels like it didn't matter, and even story bits can change depending on what you do first- like a DM adapting to how you play and NPCs can change entirely based on how successful, good, or horrible you are.

[h1][u]Characters[/u][/h1]
Never had I imagined any game topping the Mass Effect Trilogy in terms of developed characters. But wow, this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever, that I loved all the characters. The voice acting is just peak performance, the traits and personalities of each character is so developed, and they really feel like people. You always experience something new with an NPC in this game, no matter what playthrough there's dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more. Every opportunity I wanted to engage and talk to my companions, completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships. Not a single NPC was poorly written, not one. What a huge feat Larian Studios did here, this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it. Some companions legit made me cry irl, just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep.

What makes these characters even more amazing is unlike Mass Effect, they legit can leave you, hate you, or even want to fight / murder you depending on your choices. They don't just tag along, they have thoughts, views, morals, and goals. They do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say, which does have impact on how the journey goes. This aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with.

[h1][u]Freedoms[/u][/h1]
So one of the strongest pros of this game (besides the unbelievably well written characters) is how much you can do outside the box. The game doesn't force you to play by the usual rules, you can get really creative in and out of combat. The game literally lets you cheese to your heart's content or do things even the game didn't expect you to do, but you're able to. With how the game is designed, any object can be used in numerous ways, you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal, and I keep seeing people on other sites and Youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game. Seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what you're doing. The game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesn't outright punish you- sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons, but the game really does let you roam and do whatever, in almost any order you wish. The world is yours to roam, Act to Act.

[h1][u]Mods[/u][/h1]
Larian Studios didn't just give us the best game I had played in awhile, but they are fully supportive of mods. This is a MAJOR deal, because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years+. Like Skyrim, they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want, and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod you're seeking. Larian Studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods- that's just awesome. Surprisingly most if not every mod I had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues, fully functional. Again I can't stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with Larian Studios supporting all mods, this will make the game 200% better in the long run.

[h1][u]Flaws[/u][/h1]
So it seemed like I had nothing but praise for the game. But there are some flaws with it, and I won't be shy as to what these flaws are. If you really love something, you should be allowed to give critics.

The biggest issue I have with this game is how the companion's AI acts when they follow you. They tend to get stuck often, and you have to manually move them to catch up. Worse, if you come across traps or dangerous areas, your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise. Sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks, but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem.

I remember in Tactical Mode, I had my party stop onto an elevator, waited 5 seconds because I wanted to make sure they'd stop moving, then suddenly when the elevator moved- all my party fell to their deaths, clipping from the bottom. Many traps or shifting parts due to bugs, which speaking of-

Another major issue is how glitchy, buggy, and unstable Act 3 is entirely. The first two Acts were solid, hardly any problems but Act 3 is riddled with pugs. Clipping through the floor, some cutscenes have missing NPCs, dialogue has no sound, and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene, for no reason. 

[h1][u]Honour Mode[/u][/h1]
So this one is my absolute pet peeve. While the other issues were 'worse' for general gameplay, this mode is just horrible. While I did like the challenge and Legendary Actions that bosses had, what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file, that's it. I understand why they did this, and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles, but the fact this game has some issues and especially Act 3 being so buggy, it ruins a lot of runs in Honour Mode.

I ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations. I don't mind dying and losing legit, but when it's outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug, glitch, or unexpected error- that's when I decide enough is enough.

[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]
Baldur's Gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game. It's a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of. A game that will leave you remembering it for years to come. 9.5 / 10",True,41,0,2025-02-12 18:02:40

"This game just isn't for me. Even with all the praise its gotten and all of the good things I've heard from other people, it just completely loses me before even finishing act 1. The combat, which takes up a majority of the game, is a tedious slog as it seems every fight is insanely stacked against you. There is no joy I can derive from engaging with the same fight over and over again as I pray to have the RNG work in my favor so I can progress. Having recently beaten KOTOR (a month or two before this review), which has all of the same problems as Baldur's Gate 3, seems remarkably quick compared to the huge amount of tedium that exists in this game.

"I want to start by saying I don't necessarily think it's a bad game, just over-hyped. There aren't enough people mentioning how niche this game is and how it won't appeal to everyone's tastes. I was mostly convinced to try it by word of mouth, and I did, in good faith. Obviously, this game is great for those that enjoy D&D, a very specific type of turn-based combat, and/or this particular style of....fantasy story telling. I found the characters to be a little cringe-worthy and difficult to care about, and the story was only somewhat coherent. In addition, there are actually pretty limited options for character creation, which took me by surprise, as many people mentioned character creation being rather in depth. That said, I think anyone that is on the fence about this game should do a little research before purchasing. Don't just listen to everyone else, like I did. TT-TT",False,14,0,2025-02-18 02:33:23
"Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals talk about logistics (c) Jason Statham

Well, how does a review even start? With a sarcastic remark, a quote, or something else? I have so much to say about this game and yet so little I can put into words.

Context Matters
First of all, this game should be viewed in the context of the reality its developers live in. In a world where AAA studios burn through obscene budgets on P-O-O-P games, exploit crunch culture, and make feeble attempts at ""delivering a message,"" big companies somehow still fail to release good games.

So, let’s take a moment to thank Larian Studios—they actually did it. They made a massive, high-quality game without being shackled to EA, Microsoft, or any other corporate overlords. Turns out, it is possible.

Second, I extend my sincere gratitude to all the cowards who took to Twitter (sorry, X) to whine about the game setting ""unrealistic expectations"" for the industry. Their spinelessness turned out to be a priceless asset in BG3’s marketing campaign.

But Is It Worth It?
So, is this game truly worth it? Is it actually a good idea to spend 200+ hours on it? Will you make it through with a party of your comrades? Is there more to it than just bearshipping and the DnD license?

Yes. Yes, there is. What you’ll find here is an adventure.

After watching countless reviews and discussions about whether BG3 is a ""real RPG,"" I want to say one thing: there is no such thing as a 'real RPG'.

You are always limited in your choices.
Developers always leave plot holes.
They always fail to fully account for every possible roleplay scenario.

In Fallout, you can’t be truly evil.
In The Witcher, your choices rarely have any deep impact on the world.

But does that make these games any less enjoyable? Nope.
You simply accept the terms and conditions—and enjoy the ride.

Golden Standard vs. The Black Sheep
For our playthrough, we ran a three-character party. A golden (and somewhat boring) standard:

Paladin
Wizard
…And me, the black sheep—a Bard.
And let me tell you—it was glorious.

When my criminal Bard got arrested for attacking livestock, stealing apples, and rejecting Gut’s supremacy, we were happy.
When our Paladin stopped pretending and became an Illithid, we were happy.
When our Wizard kept calling us ""dust cleaners"" because we couldn’t resist looting every single item in sight, we were happy.
When we made two out of three Thorm’s children commit [CENSORED], we were happy.
When I disrobed our Paladin, sent all his clothes and weapons to my camp chest, and let that clumsy oaf throw a poor halfling Bard like a ragdoll, we were happy.
Then came the Counting House incident.

Due to a bug, the guards started attacking our Wizard for absolutely no reason. So, naturally, we decided to embrace the chaos and turn our playthrough into a Fast & Furious-style heist.

We slaughtered every guard in the Counting House.
We took over the place.
It took 90 minutes, all our spells, and every single metagaming trick we had.
It was glorious.
Our Paladin—bless his misguided soul—actually tried to act like a Paladin and spent the whole fight swearing at us. We almost lost him. We spent dozens of scrolls and clouds of nasty spells. But we pulled it off.

And we were happy.

The Priceless Moments
Kicking Raphael’s horns? Priceless.
Using arrows, scrolls, and telekinesis to cheese fights? Priceless.
Failing skill checks four times in a row and losing our second pet because of it? Priceless.
Reaching the final cutscene only to have it ruined because a companion decided to feed on Jaheira? Priceless.
200 Hours Later
This game gave us 200 hours of adventure,
200 hours of unexpected interactions,
200 hours of cringe moments,
and dozens upon dozens of fights.

"Probably one of the best, most in depth games of the century. The amount of content in this game is insane for a single player experience, and its rare that a 100+ hour game would actually make me want to play the game through a second time. In fact I've beat the game twice solo and played it through far with friends multiple times.

It's a true role playing experience and is almost sandbox-like, despite having such a massive established world already. The creative freedom is insane. You can sit there and read through the well written story with amazing characters, explore all the side content and really engage with the world, or you can play strictly for the fun gameplay, skipping over the story to spend time doing stupid, creative things, like stacking up boxes to set up for a skydiving owlbear or going on a murder rampage and killing everyone. It's amazing how the game has so many avenues of play that you can choose to engage with or not based on your own roleplaying experience.

This game also has some of my favourite RPG mechanics of any game, drawing from DND combat and their past games such as DOS2. It translates excellently into the 3D format. You can pace the difficulty how you want, by taking rests when needed. Multiclassing is awesome in this game and the gear you can find to augment your abilities opens up so much. I do miss the elemental combat of DOS2, but there is many reasons that this game is better - namely the universal actions such as jumping and repositioning options, shoving, etc. add a lot of whismy to the game. You can go and blast things with a fireball, or you can throw your little gnome friend at the enemy, and then have him shove a guy off a cliff. There's a lot of potential for fun co-op play.",True,9,0,2025-02-10 18:33:42

The general goal of Baldur's Gate 3 is to get rid of your mindflayer parasite, but it evolves into so much more. The story exploration is perfect. Other than being overwhelmed by general DnD stuff that you're unfamiliar with; the game does a great job at slowly introducing and familiarizing players with the story, setting, and everything else. You are first placed in a world with a general task (after the intro), and almost everything you do will inadvertently get you closer to that task. The player is the one to find the path to achieving their goal. It is not some to-do list nor aimless pile of tasks.

"Haven't finished the game yet, but I played enough to solidify my opinion on it. Baldur's Gate 3 is a great game that is a bit held back by the DnD 5e mechanics. 

I won't spend too much time singing praises since BG3 broke into the mainstream and it was very well-deserved. Larian Studios had already proved they could make an amazing CRPG with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and with the extra time they put into this game, their mastery shows. A lot of stuff to do, fun quests and dungeons, interesting characters to interact, great voice acting and good improvements from the TTRPG version of the mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, high-fantasy, tactical combat RPG with a lot of dialogue choices, go for it.

My two main complaints are with the multiplayer and the DnD 5e combat/progression mechanics. 

Regarding the multiplayer, I think it's mostly my preferences. There are clear improvements in comparison to DOS2 multiplayer in general, but I still feel like this is a game I'd rather enjoy on multiplayer co-op, while it's clearly designed with single-player in mind. You can still have a lot of fun with it, but it will make you miss out on a lot of the character-driven narratives and the general self-insertion story that these RPGs tend to aim for. Once again, I wouldn't say that that is necessarily bad, but it clashes with the way I prefer to play - and you can always play with each player using an origin character from the game.

Regarding the DnD mechanics, I think it's a straight downgrade from DOS2. Leveling up only in your class by default, action types instead of action points, daily and level up spell memorizing and all that, not fun in my book. These adaptations from DnD 5e add complexity that doesn't add tactical depth on one end and restrict choices and freedom on the other. Like I said, a lot of good changes from the TTRPG mechanics were made, but it's still a flawed system for me. 

In conclusion, I very much do reccomend Baldur's Gate 3. I think it's more polished and approachable than DOS 2 (even though the general mechanics are less fun, in my opinion) and deserves all the praise it has gotten. It's an awesome RPG adventure and clearly worth the price.",True,1,0,2025-02-18 00:14:04
"This game is incredible...
I am inexperienced with proper D&D tabletop games, but I've always wanted to give it a try. I know this is somewhat different since you have saves you can load if you don't get an outcome you want, cause video game, but I find part of the fun for me is getting to play through this campaign over and over to experience the different paths and endings as you want to. No shame to people who don't want to save scum though, you live dangerously and I respect that, and I think this game is probably still rewarding to those who don't.

That aside, Larian really cooked with this, and are STILL in the kitchen even long after it's release. 
The game of the year award was so well deserved for this masterpiece. Everything from the visuals, to the gameplay, to the characters + character customisation and the classes, to the music, and even to the changelog and community update posts (your humour in them is fantastic and  so on-brand, thank you for hiring whoever it is that does those). This is the work of a games studio who actually care about the individual game they and their employees put great amount of efforts into being an enjoyable experience and playable even beyond a single year from it's release date. Not saying they are the only one's to do it, as there are plenty of other games out there that have achieved this feat, but rarely does it seem to apply to the vast majority of games that big game studios seem to churn out these days.

Even though my luck on rolls sucks when playing through this game at times, and I am an idiot who is still learning a lot of things about certain aspects (thank you ""load save"" feature for these reasons in particular lol), I still just struggle to put into exact words how good this game is and how strongly I recommend this to anyone who has taken even the slightest bit of interest in this game and are unsure on whether to play or not. We are well over a year out from the game being released, so I would like to think most people have by now, but if you haven't, please do. I promise it will be worth your time. This game will reward you tenfold.

"[h1] You Put an RPG in My Dating Simulator [/h1]

Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing game set in the Forgotten Realms universe. If you don't know what this means, it is a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons, a table-top role-playing game reliant on dice roles, an overarching storyteller (the ""Dungeon Master""), and multiple NPCs to interact with. BG3, therefore, may be a bit unconventional to those familiar to standard RPGs like Skyrim or the Witcher. It is played from a top-down perspective, where movement is real-time, but combat is turn-based. All encounters and item locations (I believe) are scripted, meaning the only difference between ""runs"" will be your choices (we'll get to this later). And, of course, what determines your success are your stats. At points you wouldn't even think of, whether it be in conversations or wandering around, you will be making ""dice rolls"" based on various attributes like strength and dexterity to see if you will succeed or not, which can lead to numerous outcomes.

You have the option to choose from 7 different ""Origin"" characters, or create your own (however, the 7th Origin character is very similar to a custom character with a few nuances). They each have their own backgrounds, stories, and ""personal quests"", which you will progress throughout the game to determine a unique ending. You will eventually get the opportunity to recruit four other companions later in the game, but their interactions are much less impactful (I believe due to budget cuts). You will meet all of these Origin characters in the main game, and can have three others with you during ""adventuring"" with you at one time. Some may find this frustrating, as it limits personal quest opportunities, unique dialogue, and relationships, essentially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs. If you take the side characters along instead, you'll limit the opportunities even further. 

As for the Origin characters, I think there's someone for everyone. I'm sure you've read online about people gushing over certain characters, but if you just care about stats or like them for their personality and don't like their stats, you can always respec them. The key component of using these characters is their combat skills, which, as mentioned, is turn-based. Everyone has special abilities, which needs to be used strategically in free-form combat. I say free-form as in ""everything is game"". You can use nearby objects to toss at enemies, combine liquids to deal more damage, climb rafters for a height advantage, push enemies off ledges, or use context clues for an encounter bonus (for example, there's a section where you can talk to a spider if you have the ability to do so to convince them to fight for you). 

Overall, the combat is nuanced and varied, but it can be very, very slow. There's four of you and sometimes dozens of enemies. You have to just sit there and wait for them to scuttle about and it can be a pain, making you consider non-aggressive tactics (if even possible). As for the main quest itself, I'd ironically say it's the weakest part of the game. The game thrives in the world and the side quests, many of which you can have a deep impact upon based on your choices (thus encouraging replay value). The main quest, though? You can actually skip a lot of it if you know what you're doing. I felt like the main quest was just there as a backdrop for the game to populate a world with side quests. Even in the end-game, the ""main quest"" is split into three parts that can be tackled in such a way that they act like three side quests. This isn't necessarily a criticism, as the side quests have tons of choices and options to them, most of which are meaningful, which I believe is the main draw of the game. 

Now, for the companion Origin stories and their personal quests, I think it could have been done a tad better. Your fate is practically sealed in the first part of the game, so if you mess up, or didn't build your relationship high enough (because you had other companions follow you), you may get frustrated. The game also starts dragging as a result. There's so many options and you want to see them all, that the tedious sections start to become more apparent. You can't do everything in one run, and one run takes a long time. Like, there's certain parts where you do just have to sit through inconsequential dialogue. Or there's choices that will just kill you, no matter the dice roll outcome (or lack there of). However, I can't really fault the game here for this, as Larian set a standard for RPGs of this genre with BG3. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Tactical combat that allows players to make use of the environment and a wide-range of abilities, requiring individuals to always be aware of what can be used against enemies and against themselves.
[*]The Origin characters are well-written and well-acted. They are fun to interact with and it's a joy to watch them grow as characters, for better or for worse depending on your choices. 
[*]The side quests are a particular highlight, with you having the potential to miss more than half the game if you aim to just complete the main story.
[*]Choices that matter and leave an impact, with both morally grey, good, and evil options. So many choices and options that you'd want to start a new playthrough right after you finish your first.
[*]Larian Studios has consistently made an effort to improve the game overtime, including adding mod support and listening to the community, a welcome change in today's gaming world.  
[*]It should be stated that the environments, voice acting, and overall design of this game is excellent. 
[*]Create Water is a level 1 transmutation spell.
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]At the risk of being contradictory and hypocritical, I must say that, even though the game's sheer size and number of choices are wonderful, there is a fault to it. In the review, I keep mentioning ""runs"". It is a strange RPG to me, having so many choices and options, but you're never going to see them all. You're never going to see that charm, because a fatigue will set in playing this very, very dialogue-heavy game (also, there is A LOT of walking). Some players may not even witness the game's title of ""Baldur's Gate"" because they'll be worn out by Part II, and I think that's a shame. In my opinion, I think the game should have a method to either skip combat, or start at specific Parts with choices done for you, like Dragon Age: Inquisition did upon launch.
[*]Branching from the combat complaint, it is is very slow when there are too many enemies. You have four members that you have to manage individually against a dozen enemies sometimes, each having their own special abilities, intricately moving around the nuanced environment. It can be painful, to say the least.
[*]As stated before, the limit on the companions following you is to the game's fault. Their relationship should be able to change even if at camp. However, I am aware that the four ""non-Origin"" companions were cut down on content due to budget reasons, so I can't really fault the game for that. But the last companion especially just felt shoehorned in, you have next to nothing to do by the time you find them unless you blitz towards their location. 
[*]Again, the main story seems just like a background for all of the side content. Also, for a game filled to the brim with so many choices, sometimes it deprives you of the ability to make them at key moments. 
[*]Romance with the companions can feel too superficial and lacks nuance, with particular favoritism being done against one that I noticed, as they had more dialogue options in regards to the ""relationship"" (even though it's just repetitive blurbs).

"The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!",True,2,0,2025-02-12 16:26:46
"This isn't really my cup of tea, but still it's a 10/10. I struggle to get into CRPGs, but this game is fire. One day it'll click for me, at least that's what I keep telling myself. Buy this, then buy it again on a different platform, even if you never play it, give Larian your money because they deserve it. That's it, I'm going to go back to playing some crappy 9/10 game that I really like.",True,1,0,2025-02-12 01:31:44
What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before. This game truly is revolutionary it does so much to suck you in to the world of D&D to the point where replay-ability is uncommon to do. It has everything that people should look for in a game while giving people what they want. Even if I don't like buying games for $70 this is one of those games that would be worth it,True,1,0,2025-02-11 04:15:37

"Very solid game.
Still some bugs that require fixing (certain equipment), and slight nitpicks to where the game is certainly not perfect (Wyrm's Rock Fort drawbridge).
Some companions have better and deeper arcs than others, and there also being some... questionable external continuity decisions.
But either way, the pros certainly outweigh the cons.",True,1,0,2025-02-09 23:11:48
"I really don't know how to review this game... it basically raised the standards for what gaming means for me, and gave me a whole new perspective of it. It may sound like I am exaggerating but I mean it. 
This is a masterpiece. A work of art. What else can you call something that can make you go through so many emotions for hours, and can make you be obsessed over their characters? 

Here you can be yourself (or whoever you want to be) in detail, and from there you start an unforgettable adventure where you meet wholesome characters and create your own path every single time you play. I strongly recommend you to start as Dark Urge because it makes the game even more interesting, Trust me. 

Even though I wasn't a fan of turn-based games, this one easily won me over.
It also has a great soundtrack that envelops the atmosphere, and keeps you company as you explore the beautiful world they created.
Another good thing is the great community it has. One that from the beginning quickly began creating mods that are now ""legally"" integrated into the game. Additionally, Larian Studios does an amazing job listening (or reading) what the community wants.

The only bad thing I can say about the game is that I wish it had badges and stuff in the Point Shop here on Steam; I would love to customize my profile with my FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ",True,1,0,2025-02-09 04:52:58

I am in act III now, so have yet to finish the game, but the quality is definitely here. Larian set a bar for gaming in of the last 10 years. A truly unique experience with no end in replay-ability value. I have three different campaigns and have gotten as far as Act 3 in all of them. I am nearly finished with Act 3 with my Lore Bard run, and I have played these campaigns wildly different to see how much new content I can discover, how differently events may occur, or campanions react, and what impact on the world choices can have.

The devs did not try to revolutionize a genre or reinvent the wheel, they simply took what´s there (D&D) and built something great on top of it with incredible love for the game, genre and detail.

"Here the larian RPG model peaks for me. DND5 Rules and background lore lay the setting to a more grounded and beliavable setting than the Original Sin series, where the DND dice rolling rules spell tiers make the game feel very balanced. In terms of gameplay its in absolute sweet spot. 

Story and characters hold great personalities quirks and stories. For me was definitely worth for more replays for the good guys just to see how different party comps would work together and of course the Durge ""evil/redemptive"" playthrough adds another thing to the replay value of this game.

Multiplayer is supported and is quite fun, however i would not recommend playing multiplayer when firr st playing through the game. Its quite easy for one player to miss vital parts of the story and be quite confused. 

One of the few games I would be quite happy for the developer to make a DLC for this base game to expand on  the fate of the characters after ending the main story.",True,1,0,2025-02-02 08:34:14
"The best RPG ever made, the character development is sooooo good, the story is amazing, It looks beautiful, the modding community is wonderful and supported by the devs! It's a crime not to experience this for yourself because there are so many ways to experience it, alone or with friends, replaying with different builds, making different story choices, the list goes on and on. I can not recommend it enough! Larian Studios have outdone themselves.",True,1,0,2025-02-02 01:48:22

"After 270+ hours I can say that you start the game with big plans: be a hero, save the world, make wise choices…
5 minutes later: your naked barbarian yeets an enemy off a cliff, and a goblin calls you ""boss.""

✅ Pros:
✔ A massive world where every decision has consequences (even the ones you made by accident).
✔ Failing a quest with a bad dice roll has never felt so fun.
✔ The characters are so charismatic, you start caring about their emotions more than your own.
✔ Interaction level: ""If you can pick it up, you can throw it at someone.""

❌ Cons:
✖️ 100+ hours of gameplay, and you’ll still want to restart.
✖️ Sometimes, the dice personally hate you.
✖️ It’s not the story that betrays you—it’s your own desire to ""try one more option.""

Their backstories, their incredible voice acting, the variety of outcomes, are all just amazing beyond my ability to easily express in a format like this. 

This is one of those games where, were it not for the incredible replayability, I would feel empty for a while. The quest was accomplished. The story is over, and the characters all are going their own way, no longer united by purpose. The Fellowship is dissolved. 

But this is one of those games where the end isn't really *the* end. Rather, it's just one end. There are more to be seen, and now I have to go back and see what else there is. Maybe it's time to try this Dark Urge everyone is talking about.",True,1,0,2025-02-24 21:06:49

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a monumental achievement in CRPG design, offering an astonishing amount of content that will keep players engaged for hundreds of hours.
The depth of choice is staggering—many decisions, from dialogue options to combat strategies, have a tangible impact on the world and its characters.
This level of agency, combined with a richly detailed setting, makes each playthrough feel uniquely personal.

I deliberately chose to wait a considerable amount of time before diving in, wanting to ensure the experience was fully feature-complete and polished enough to be truly enjoyable.
Thankfully, Larian Studios delivered. The final release feels like a proper, expansive RPG with an incredible level of depth and refinement.

The sheer variety of character builds and the branching narrative paths mean that replaying the game is not just an option but a necessity for those who want to experience what this game has to offer.
Experimenting with different race/class/subclass/multiclassing combinations, party compositions, moral choices, and even mods ensures that no two journeys through Faerûn are the same.
As a Dungeons & Dragons experience on computer, it's unparalleled—adapting the 5th Edition rules while delivering the most immersive digital take on tabletop roleplaying to date.

At times, Baldur's Gate 3 can feel more like a Larian Studios game in the vein of Divinity: Original Sin rather than a purebred Baldur's Gate sequel, and while this isn't inherently bad, it may not fully satisfy purists of the original games (i.e., Turn-Based combat vs. Real-Time with Pause combat).
Technical hiccups also persist, with some bugs—though relatively rare—being severe enough to force you to reload an earlier save game.

Perhaps the most frustrating downside in my opinion is that, despite the game's overwhelming success, we may never see a Baldur's Gate 4 since Larian Studios has already announced that the upcoming Patch 8 will be the last major update for the game, as they plan to move on to other projects in the future.
And it's understandable, since Wizards of the Coast controls the franchise's rights and has been leaning toward live-service models and monetization strategies, while Baldur's Gate 3 combines an old-school single-player (with optional co-op) RPG philosophy with modern graphics and cinematic presentation, creating an immersive experience that appeals to both veterans and new players alike.

All in all, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a landmark RPG, delivering an unparalleled role-playing experience—something that, these days, is about as rare as a miniature giant space hamster.",True,6,0,2025-02-09 13:52:49

I have played this game from the day it came out but only finished it now and on a redeemed Durge play through of all things even though Durge is recommended for a second play through. First of all this game is in my top ten of all time; So much detail in everything and such compelling stakes and characters that once I sat down determined to finally fully play the game I couldn't put it down and now that I'm done I just want to play it again. This game (especially on a Redeemed Durge) is extremely emotionally impactful and always had its hooks in my brain. I know there are tons of ending possible and many different outcomes to a lot of quests and entire character arcs giving it insane replayability. Seeing this game grow from just the end of act 1 to the beautiful master work that it is has been an experience I can't quite put into words but it is one of my favorite games of all time and I will always love this game. I will also never be able to play a Tav again as Durge is so much more interesting and impactful to me as well as adding heaps of content unique to a Durge.

This is literally the king of RPG/CRPG. Slightly different than the original BG1 and BG2 because it is turn based rather than RTWP but the combat is still incredibly well-done nonetheless and it pays great respect to its predecessors.

"Yeah, its an amazing game. Playing this is the most excited and immersed I've been in a game since playing WoW over a decade ago. As others have said, the graphics here are amazing. A roommate saw me talking to Balthazar and thought it was live action, not animated. Not everything is totally photo-realistic, of course, but its a really good-looking game. The story is also well-written and compelling, although it does fall off a bit in Act Three - this is especially noticeable when held up against Act Two, which is the strongest part of the game story-wise (even though it's scary) - but unlike plenty of people I still really enjoy Act three and the game's core story is present throughout. 

This was my first experience with a game where my choices actually influenced the story. My biggest gaming experience previously was Assassin's Creed, where you're more or less locked into a set story, so it is really interesting to see how the NPCs and story respond to your choices. I would one day like to do a truly evil playthrough so I can get some really different interactions than I've had before, but I haven't had the heart to commit to that yet.

It was also my first experience with turn-based gameplay, something I hadn't even heard of before. It definitely took some getting used to, and I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but I ended up really enjoying the way it makes you think.

The game has, I think, excellent replay potential. I personally have completed two full runs - one Tav, one Durge. I am now about halfway through a Wyll origin run. I also put about 70 hours into completing Act One in early access. Every different player character option reveals different things about the story, so it's hard to get really bored even with multiple play-throughs. Trying to roleplay as the various origin characters and choose based on their own personalities varies the experience even more. I'll admit that the current political climate is making it a bit hard to enjoy a game about an evil war-mongering dictator taking over and brainwashing a violent cult at the moment, but I have far from lost interest in the game as a whole and I forsee playing it for a long time to come.

Systems-wise, since before the game ever came out people have been very negative about the possibility of playing this game on Mac. My entire play experience has been on my 2021 Apple M1 Pro, and I can say pretty definitely at this point that I have had no problems at all running this game at high to ultra settings. Does my computer get hot? Yes. Do I need to keep it plugged in? Sure. But the game runs smoothly and is a joy to play. So if all you have is a Mac, I say go for it - take this rare experience to play a good modern game on the platform you have available to you.",True,0,0,2025-02-26 17:59:40

"One of the greatest RPGs ive ever played. brings back the same genuine feeling from Skyrim and The Witcher. Ways to influence literally everything. Ways to cheese the game. Ways to enhance the game, Ways to bring a sense of challenge. Ive never played any kind of DnD game atall before and the mechanics are a delight to master and understand. So many learning moments and AHA and OOOOOH moments. Its story line and characters are beyond good. No rpg character or voice actings compare to the lvl of work they put into this game. Every character feels REAL. Feels like there a real part of the world the game created. Nothing feels like its just there to push the story along everything is so seemlessly crafted down to execute so perfectly. As someone who can easily recognize Phoning it in types of game work theres barely any of it here. What this is is a culmination of Baldurs Gates story telling executed masterfully thru Larian studios MASTERED gameplay style of turn based Dnd Style combat. Add in the feeling the Witcher brought which was genuinely using context clues and your own ideals to influence how all things go down. If you want watch choas happen you can choose to see it. If you want to try for the best possible outcome for all that is your freedom. If you want to murder everything that walks in your way that is your choice. and not only that but all 3 have extremely unique stories as well.

But my absolute favorite has to be that perky lizard lady, the blacksmith’s assistant with a weird name I can’t recall, who always offers me a spear. I bought it in early access, even though I wasn’t sure about the turn-based combat at first, but now I only play games with that style.

"Post game summary, made it to Act 2, starting with DOWNsides.
Massive issue is the mulitplayer, honestly don't know why its released since its not finished in the slightest.

 Zero communication aside from pinging the map, there is not a Language selection to, for example, filter in english servers only.

When joining a lobby and filtering 'Not Full' it does not count lobbies with full parties, just lobbies with full players. If the lobby has a full party then it exits you back to main menu (its a little aggrivating to select multiplayer AGAIN and click on all the options AGAIN to filter the correct servers you  want to play)


Which brings another topic up, everytime you fail to join a server it brings you to main menu, where you have to see a transition scene BEFORE you can select Multiplayer and then search for a server.
If the party in the lobby is full? (not counting players) it fails to connect and there is no way for you to know before hand.

They have a LONG modlist or third party mods you can't download? Fails to connect.

Move too far away from the player ingame? Disconnect.

This is NOT counting the other reasons such as but not limited to: Someone making a public lobby because they didn't know they could make a private/friend only lobby. Someone who somehow accidently clicked it while going through a menu.

There is not a 'Previosly Joined Servers' tab either, so you have to search for the server you joined if you think it was a technical issue and not them actually kicking you/logging off.

Also noticed SOME of the mods I download from multiplayer get bugged and need to be uninstalled multiple times before registering they are not installed or enabled, highly suggest AVOIDING modded playthroughs in multiplayer.

The Multiplayer is extremely unfinished, it needs a language filter, it needs the ability to see the difficulty you are on (you can't see it till INGAME), it needs a communication method, and it needs to include FULL parties when selecting 'Not Full Server' option.

When creating a character, players should see CURRENT created characters so its not ""four human fighters"" because that is a basic and easy to fall on option when you are unsure where to go.

Also when a player LEAVES THE GAME there should be a notification that allows you to vanish the character from the party, so when others join they can make their own character instead of using the previous character's build. There is NO way to communicate with the random host you joined to head to camp so you can fix or tweak things.


Moving on to the maingame, singleplayer, intended experience. I honestly do not need to tell you that its great. Its a fair price and the 100gb+ is worth it.

"I did enjoy this game very very much with my husband but I need to be clear. This game is very good especially in this era of gaming. The possibilities are soooo numerous! You can do so many things. If you can think it, there's a huge chance you can do it. Larian Studios has done a phenomenal job! However, it bothers me a great deal that people try to say that this game is better than the original Dragon Age Origins. it is not. DAO was an S tier game throughout the entire campaign. Baldur's Gate 3 falls short. 

BG3 has 3 parts before the final fight. The 1st part is amazing and the 2nd part is even better (best part of the game IMO). The 3rd part is where the game starts to slow down and just not live up to the gradual build the previous 2 parts had. It's strange because so much is going on due to you being in a major city but it is no where near as satisfying or important as the 1st two parts. It feels like the definition of quantity not quality. It doesn't have anywhere near the umph that the 2nd part has and don't even get me started on the final boss fight. That fight was just no where near as awesome as the final fight in DAO. I only compare the two because, in RPG circles, these two game are heavily compared. 

DAO is superior in my humble opinion, but please buy Baldur's Gate 3 because I really believe it will be one of the best in the 2020s. It is an amazing, wonderful game. Keep up the great work Larian Studios!",True,0,0,2025-02-26 05:51:20

"8/10 

A game that was truly made out of love. Love for D&D, love for the franchise, and love for old school RPGs. While I am not a fan of D&D or the Baldur’s Gate series, I couldn’t help but enjoy this game. When this game came out, I originally thought that the hype behind this game was mostly due to AAA live service fatigue. But after I finished this game, I realized that this will stand the test of time. Whatever small problems that I have with it are drowned out by the positives and it truly surprised me by how much I enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of RPGs or even if you have a passing interest in them as I believe this is a great introduction. 
The story and writing of this game is some of the best I have seen. All the characters are very well rounded and interesting. One thing that I really appreciate is that the members of your party interact and play off each other in interesting ways. Which I don’t think most party-based games do enough, apart from the occasional line in gameplay. The main problem that I have is that their relationship with the player is very “dating-sim” like, in that you are either in a state of “boning” or “not boning” and there is no in-between. Characters seem to be a little too swift to want to engage in a relationship, which makes things awkward when I just want to remain friends. I guess it shows how immersive the writing and characters are when I genuinely feel pain when rejecting them, but annoying non-the-less as well as unrealistic. It can be also hard to tell how characters will react to certain events. Multiple times I have done things specifically to gain the favor of certain characters, but either got no reaction or they actually disapproved of my action. Events like this lead to the temptation of save scumming or simply looking up what to do, which spoils the experience for me. 
The story of the game is very well done and kept me intrigued the whole time. As stated previously I never played a Baldur’s Gate game prior to 3. Despite this fact I was able to follow along the entire time and the main story is understandable even to a layman of the franchise. One of the aspects I love is that the choices affect the ending in a serious way. While many games claim this to be the case, this is one of the few games where it truly does matter. Where choices that you make in act 1 effect things in act 2 and come to a conclusion in act 3. While this is a good thing it does have its downsides as the game is quite long and I tend forget what decisions I have made in different parts. As they were hours or even days apart and multiple different quests have passed since then. And with the sea of characters this game has they can get lost in the noise. 
The gameplay is very fun and variant. This isn’t your modern-day RPG where you just end up being generally good at everything by the middle of the game. You truly have to focus and optimize your character and making sure you have a well rounded party. While the lack of tutorials makes things confusing at first, I did figure the mechanics out eventually. In an age where a majority of games take you through an 8-hour correspondence course talking you through every single gameplay mechanic until you die of boredom. It is refreshing that a game respects your intelligence and lets to figure things out eventually. As well as being more gratifying using a mechanic you figured out yourself. 
I was hesitant to play this game as it didn’t really seem like it was my style. Not being into D&D or IRL role playing but I am happy that I did. Not only did I enjoy my time with the game but is one of best game I have ever played.

From the story to side missions from evil to good by yourself or with friends this game has it all I love it!

I have over 500+ across all platforms (PS5 and Steam) and the graphics on both are insane the fps, raytracing, HDR, and more it looks beautiful. I personally run max graphics 60-115 fps and have never had a issue and even if you don't have the best set-up for gaming you could play this game at 30-60 fps and have no issue.

I love the story the original characters are awesome, and relatable plus they look soooo cool and the back stories are insanely in depth

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a great game to play casually or pour hours into, if you're like me and its your first time playing a game like this it is easy to understand and get the hang of but it does go deeper and you can easily go through not knowing anything and stumbling to success or you can research every little thing and become obsessive over the tiniest details because it all matters. Great game 10/10",True,0,0,2025-02-25 12:45:45

"The story sucks you in from the start, and the characters are so well-written that you actually care about what happens to them. The choices you make actually matter, which is rare in games these days. Combat is challenging and super satisfying once you get the hang of it—it’s not just mindless button-mashing.

The graphics are beautiful, and the world feels alive and full of secrets to discover. Plus, the voice acting is spot-on. It’s honestly one of the best RPGs I’ve played in years. If you’re into deep storytelling and tactical combat, you’ve got to play this game. It's worth every penny.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 11:09:11
"I normally hate games like this, but there's something about this game that makes it much more enjoyable than your typical DnD style game.

I would recommend turning the multiple saves off and sticking to one save so you don't load /reload all the time.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 10:54:38
It's pretty good. Every bit as janky and buggy as every crpg ever made (and the 5e combat does not help that situation) but you know what you're getting into with the genre. And wow did they go over and above with the voice acting and scripting for basically every possible choice you could make.,True,0,0,2025-02-25 09:05:51
"Finally got into it. It is so excellent. It is what I wish the original Dragon Age was like. I sadly got into that one a bit after it came out and it never quite got me to get past act one. This game, however, is hard to put down. I have dreamed of instances in BG3, so that tells you how engaged I have been. I love how many choices there are, and am playing three campaigns with thee warlocks at the moment, each different in the spells and approach, and also the people I play with. I play alone on the Xbox, and with friends on PC in two campaigns. Even just three warlocks is a wealth of difference and replay value. I will run a rogue next, and then some kind of warrior later. I suspect this could be a game I spend upwards of 1000 hours with, and I only have such with Hunt Showdown between Xbox and PC. Buy the game, full price or on sale, it's worth the weight of a Nautiloid in gold.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 08:21:51
Fantastic game that captures all the charm of dnd while adding a few key changes to make it perfectly adapted to playing as a video game. The acting really sells this though as the characters will really suck you into the relationships and plot,True,0,0,2025-02-25 06:57:25
"Very much a contender for Game of the Decade.

Larian Studios is easily one of the best studios in gaming at this period in time. After playing Divinity Original Sin 2 and hearing that they were working on Baldur's Gate 3, I immediately prepurchased this game. Even though I had to wait for several years, boy, was the wait worth it. 

This game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
 - The art style and graphics are breathtaking.
 - The OST is something I will turn on at work just to listen to. It never gets old.
 - The characters are fun and have personality. Their interactions with each other and you really add depth to the story.
 - The story is captivating and enjoyable. Plus, the plethora of choices you can make that cause tiny changes are unfathomable. 
 - The combat is engaging. It is hard enough to make you think and strategize before acting, but not difficult to the degree that you don't have fun.
 - The exploration is rewarding and enjoyable. Sometimes, you will find random new areas in places you never thought would be legitimate paths.

I already know that I will be buying Larian Studios' next game. Even if it somehow turns out to be flop, the money will be well spent, since this game is a steal at its price.

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is an awesome return to a classic RPG series that i myself love. Made by Larian Studios, this game mixes the original vibe with cool new gameplay and storytelling.

In this Dungeons & Dragons adventure, you kick things off on a mind flayer ship where everything goes sideways after you get infected by a parasite. The story is packed with rich lore, crazy twists, and important decisions that really count. Your choices shape the plot, making it a super immersive experience.

The turn-based combat is both strategic and fun. You really have to think about your moves, which adds depth to the fights. There are plenty of cool ways to interact with the environment—like tossing barrels or using the landscape to your advantage—making combat exciting every time.

Exploring Baldur’s Gate 3 is a blast! The world is beautifully crafted, filled with secrets, quests, and interesting characters to meet. The game encourages you to get creative when tackling challenges, whether you want to fight, talk your way out, or sneak around.

A standout feature is the character creation system. You can build your hero or pick from a bunch of pre-made characters, each with unique races and classes. There are tons of customization options, letting you shape your character’s abilities and personality, which adds a personal touch.

Visually, Baldur’s Gate 3 looks amazing. The vibrant environments and meticulous details really bring the Forgotten Realms to life. The character models are expressive, and the animations flow smoothly. Plus, the voice acting helps create a strong connection with the characters and the storyline.

The game also has multiplayer options, so you can team up with friends and experience the adventure together. With so many choices, you’ll want to replay the game to see different outcomes. Each playthrough can feel totally unique.

Overall, Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a throwback; it’s a well-made RPG that welcomes both longtime fans and newcomers. With an engaging story, deep gameplay, and stunning visuals, it stands out as one of the best RPGs out there right now. If you love Dungeons & Dragons or just enjoy solid RPGs, this game is definitely worth checking out. It sets a high bar for the genre, and you really can’t go wrong with it!",True,0,0,2025-02-24 18:46:23

"Compelling everything. I wish I could play Baldur's Gate 3 for the first time again, and it left me wanting more. Knowing there won't be a DLC or Baldur's Gate 4 by Larian saddens me, but simultaneously that tells me that Baldur's Gate 3 was incredibly well done. Whatever Larian does next, I know it's going to be worth playing.

Some of my personal high notes:
- There are no annoying fetch quests or other filler quest slop that some RPGs tend to have. All quests feel consequential, interesting and there is always something more to a quest than what you're initially told. Be it an alternative perspective, a twist, or additional points of intrigue. 
- This game doesn't tell you what the ""right"" options are; you have to decide that for yourself. This game doesn't hold your hand, because it respects you and your choices.
- Despite being a whole run being ~100 hours, this game has insane replayability. I got this game at a discount, and I feel like [i]I[/i] ripped the devs off.",True,0,0,2025-02-24 17:06:32

there is nothing like that with baldur's gate 3

also shadowheart might be my new favorite character ever
quite literally changed my perspective on life when it comes to ""ignorance is bliss""

i will probably bump the witcher 3 down to a 9.8/10 but phantom liberty will also stay a 10/10

one major thing bg3 does that the witcher 3 doesnt do is it fully allows the ending to sink in with the ending sequence, which i believe the witcher 3 does not

If you get stuck or on a second run, use a guide to find things you missed. More important than stats (within reason), abilities, spells, or weapons is positioning and knowledge of the game mechanics. If you maximize all your actions (within reason) such as movement, action, and bonus action the game is less challenging. ***Read enemy character sheets often (even after the first run).*** Overall, this game is a blast with a ton of replay-ability.

Story is three bads awaken three evil gods, three evil gods must be stopped. That is really it. Characters are a noble who is turned into a vampire and is sad, druid that loves nature and good, brainwashed cult girl, mercenary lady, paladin who lost her way, warrior from a tribe of killy peeps, demon woman who was breed to be a killing machine, selfish wizard, and a guy who made a deal with a demon to save his family and regrets it. All generic fantasy tropes but they try to disguise it as being more complex. People will try to say you can shape it however you want, but that isn't really true.

That being said, for me personally, Baldur’s Gate 1 & 2 still hold a special place as the ultimate RPG experience. While BG3 is a fantastic game in its own right, the classic Infinity Engine games had a unique atmosphere, pacing, and storytelling style that I prefer.

Spent well over 1000 hrs. playing it from beta testing to full release and after burning through the 2 Assassin's Creed RPG's and CP77 I had to come back now that I'm writing TTRPG campaigns as  narratives for my son's bedtime stories. Larian deserves so much praise beyond what they have received IMHO. Simply because they not only made it better than any AAA dev could, but because a ton of their current work has been enabling the players to mod it and make it our own. I enjoyed the second Divinity game and see where they used assets that they already created, that's perfect to me. Because where I enjoyed those games, I still choose to see this as the final dissertation that the prior games were rough drafts of. Everyone not only LOVEs this game on its own merit, but Loves it because it isn't like anything else coming out right now. All the problems that other developers make for themselves to generate more money via DLC's are the same reason that Larian decided to be better than. I don't just applaud the game.

"Baldur's gate 3 has some weaknesses that are genuinely frustrating, but its good qualities are so overwhelming that it's clearly a historic achievement in gaming history.

CONS:
1. Ludonarrative dissonance: 
The game's story will often tell you that things are one way when the gameplay actually bears out the opposite. A random bunch of insects in a cave may be as challenging in combat as a boss fight; a person who seems to have infinite cosmic power goes down in one hit; the story makes it seem that a quest has a time limit, so you shouldn't have any rest/downtime, but in fact you need to pass downtime in order to progress the quest. Then, in a different quest, there is actually a time limit, and resting means you fail.

2. Sandbox failures & Forced solutions
Many abilities and items are only useful in very obscure, specific situations that require a guide to know. It often has the forced logic of old adventure games. In one area, you shoot the bottom of a cage to release the prisoner out the bottom; for another cage, that does nothing. The game often has puzzles and mechanics that are extremely important in one area and don't work at all in others, when logically they should work in both.

PROS:
1. Ludicrous amounts of choice-driven story
There are probably 100+ npcs that each have deeper conversation trees than the deepest I've seen in any BioWare game or similar rpg; the amount of content you can easily miss in this game is greater than all the content of some AAA rpgs. If I didn't play through it myself, I wouldn't have believed that so much fully voice acted content could exist in a single game.

2. Variation of challenge
Combat is the main form of challenge in this game, and it can be very difficult at times. Fights require you to change your approach, though they often suffer from forced solutions/reasoning. What's nice about combat is that there are usually infinitely many approaches that can work (though sometimes you're forced to cheese a fight in a way you don't like). Many of the puzzles and social interactions are extremely gratifying to overcome.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 21:13:03

"This is definitely the greatest RPG I have ever played. As a long time fan of D&D, I knew that I had to play it as soon as I got a PC with the right specs (Did not work on my old laptop, beware if you don't have a powerful computer). 
The game is extremely similar to 5th edition D&D, with only a few minor differences, and I would say that it more effectively teaches the rules to that game than the actual rulebook does. 
The reason why I love tabletop RPGs like D&D is because it tells a unique story and gives players meaningful, personal choices. Although it does not have the same depth of possibility as D&D, this game has come closer to that feeling than any video game that I have ever seen or played. The story and characters kept me engaged and my choices actually mattered, showing me the huge range of possibilities based on my decisions.
The gameplay and combat are also fun and challenging, flowing much faster and more easily than actual D&D. The enemies (and possessed allies) are unexpectedly clever and resourceful, while the boss fights engage the player by introducing elements and objectives other than ""Reduce their hit points to 0.""
Almost all of my play time is dedicated to a single playthrough, because the world is absolutely brimming with content, and I felt compelled to do it all.
Overall, I would highly recommend this game, but more than that, I would recommend that any player accepts the events that happen naturally and don't just reload saves to get what you want. There were many times when I was surprised, thrown down chasms, tricked, lost friends and allies, or spent everything just to save my life, and these were by far the best, most memorable moments in the game, and they gave my victories meaning and value.

Has an extensive amount of character customization with 11 races, 31 sub races, 12 classes and 46 subclasses.

Has well written and interesting characters that you can choose to bring with you, leave at your camp or simply ignore at your own discretion.

Several alternative routes, options and methods for almost everything in the game ie act 1 you can sneak into the goblin camp, pretend to be one of their allies, go in guns blazing, trick them into an ambush at the grove, poison them among other things. 

Multiple different endings and encounters some of which are unique to certain characters you can choose to play as opposed to making a custom character for extra replayability.

Turn based combat that is quite well balanced, you play easy and its easy, you play a difficult mode and your punished for rushing in, not thinking or wasting skills in bad situations but, able to get along well by simply planning encounters and using spells and abilities in creative ways.

"Let's be honest, what can I say about this game that hasn't been said before yet?

I honestly struggle to think of any real flaws in the game. Is it 100% perfect? No, I don't think any game could. Even with beefy set-ups the performance can take a hit in the later acts of the game, and things like background-related dialogue options feel absent after act 1.

But this might be the closest the industry has ever gotten to the perfect game in my opinion.

The story, while sometimes a little basic, is still filled with intrigue, motivation, stakes and choices that honestly feel like you are changing the state of the world.

The writing is stellar and the across the board excellent voice acting lends to this as well. Not only is every line written expertly, the people performing the characters have been ingrained in my memory because every single one has an incredible range of emotions, reactions and personal conflicts that you want to uncover for yourself.

The gameplay, while somewhat traditionally CRPG, feels so much like a digital version of the tabletop DnD game that I feel like you could introduce your friends to the boardgame by playing Baldur's Gate 3 with them, and they would understand the board game almost immediately. As someone who has played 5th edition DnD for multiple years now, it clicked instantnly for me. The fact that the game is lore accurate to the Forgotten Realms for almost every single thing it says and does reinforces that feeling even more. 

I could honestly keep going, and in my head I definitely am. Music, acting, graphics, pace, content, replayability, flexibility, the encouragement of experimentation and exploration off the beaten path. While I am a little disappointed with the way they reincorporated things from the older titles in the series, the gripes I have with Baldur's Gate 3 are minimal and negligible. 

I bought the game at a 20% discount, but I feel like I should have bought it at full price because the passion, dedication and quality of the entire team at Larian Studio's is dripping from every aspect of this game. If you even have a passing interest in DnD and/or (C)RPG's, this is a must-play. No questions about it.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 10:00:31

"This game doesn't need my review as the awards, community, and various mediums of video media have fully set the expectations players can have of Baldur's Gate 3. However, Baldur's Gate 3 changed my life and I'd give almost anything to be able to experience the game again for the first time. I've played through time and time again, build after build, multiclass after multiclass, searching for every dialogue option, hidden gem, magical item, and enemy to defeat. The depth the characters have, the various ways you can interact with the world, and the amount of impactful endings you can have blow my mind. I'm at a point where I run mods simply to increase the difficulty (enemy health, armor class, saving throws, etc, as well as mods to give everything more actions, feats, etc) because the more you play, the more you uncover insanely powerful builds that are so fun and exciting to play. I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on about how much I love this game, but I'll stop here. If you haven't played this game earnestly, please do. Get into it genuinely and open your heart to it and there's a chance you'll come close to loving it the way I do. I want nothing more than for others to experience the same joy.

"It's impossible to say anything that hasn't been said before. Balder's Gate 3 is an incredible game: competently produced by skilled and diligent devs who have thoroughly tested the game, seemingly unlike every other title released: each update has been minor fixes only, and extra content mostly. 

The game itself is as close to a sandbox DnD campaign as you will ever get, but even then: the DnD part isn't what makes it so great. Whilst the Dungeons and Dragons part is nice, where BG3 shines through is in its open-ended approach to problem solving (why do a sidequest when you can just stack 50 crates and bypass a castle? Nice boss monster mechanics: how about I just drop an owlbear from orbit?), and its writing: every story, every character is so well written, and the writing is even flexible enough that, regardless of how you solve a problem, the game will handle it! Found a way to bypass objective B and jump straight to C? That's cool!

On top of it all, the game looks incredible: environments are wonderfully furnished, the landscapes look incredible and tell fantastic stories on their own: and the characters are all so wonderfully made that you can so easily loose yourself in this world. 

I would be negligent if I also didn't mention the soundtrack: each song is so wonderfully and lovingly made that there have been more than a few times that I've found myself just standing there in game and enjoying the music. From epic boss-battle ballads to secret companion songs, to just ambient environment music!

Whilst the format might not be for everyone (3d isometric/strategy with turn-based combat) the fact of the mater is that BG3 is the gold standard of what can be made by developers who are given the support and creativity to bring their vision to life. Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-have: it excels in every area, and the only criticism I can think of is that Act 3 is very busy: throwing ALOT of sidequests and new characters at you, that it feels a bit overwhelming. 

All that in mind: I give Baldur's Gate 3 5/5 stars. Go buy it.",True,0,0,2025-02-19 10:38:47
"Top tier CRPG and a great introduction to the D&D ruleset even for people that know nothing about it. I have only very tiny nitpicks with the game that I would have to criticize about it.

This is truly the culmination of all of Larian's experience in their field so far and I can't wait for what's going to come next from this studio.

Be ready to adjust to controls that are complex and intricate--I wouldn't change them, since so much is useful about them--but because they aren't *intuitive*, you'll find yourself running into the wrong hazard, or ending your turn instead of confirming the spell you were trying to cast, at least until you get through the learning curve.",True,0,0,2025-02-19 07:44:55

"The best RPG game made ever. 

Story, graphics, gameplay and everything is just amazing with this game, it lets you play D&D with awesomely enhanced story and decisions, every companion has its own story and they are not just some errands you need to do to learn about the character, they are just as deep as the main questline itself. The possibilities of events and outcomes in this game are near unlimited. If you are not so in-love with this genre still try it and you will be amazed. 10/10.",True,0,0,2025-02-18 13:49:44

"There is likely nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said a hundred times over.  It is, simply, [b][u]THE[/u][/b] computer role playing game of this generation.  It will be the measuring stick used to judge everything that come after it for years to come.  It is a sublime gaming experience, with well over 100 hours of content, near-endless replayability, exquisite fully customizable starting character generation complemented by pre-crafted starting character options who come with their own stories and flaws and special abilities, and a myriad of possible endings influenced by nearly every decision your party of characters makes during their adventures.  It continues the story of the previous two prequels, referencing many of the characters and events in those stories, without requiring any knowledge of those stories to immerse yourself into this living world.

"As a self-proclaimed cozy gamer, I had exactly zero experience with turn-based RPGs or even D&D when I first bought this game. Fast forward a few months and I'm now 300+ hrs in and already on my 2nd campaign! 

I wanted to leave a review for the gamers that may be intimidated to dip their toe into the Forgotten Realms as a noob like me, but after a few YouTube tutorials to get my bearings, I was completely sucked into the lore, the plot, the characters, the...everything really. When I say BG3 is everything I've ever wanted in a video game, it's not an exaggeration. Is there a fairly steep learning curve? Yes. Is the scale of the game a bit overwhelming at times? Sure. But if you're the kind of person who loves a good CYOA story on an epic scale, has to open every single crate and explore each nook and cranny of the map, enjoys coming up with clever approaches to fights, reads every found letter and book--this game is for you!!

On a final note, I was concerned about replayability, but I'm at the top of my 2nd campaign and have been really impressed so far! With so many different character build options, playing as a different class or race can unlock new dialogue options, leading to new choices, and new plot beats. My experience as a swords bard is already a vastly different than my 1st as a ranger. I may not be as good with a bow, but inflicting psychic damage on bad guys by absolutely roasting them in the heat of battle is hilariously satisfying.

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is nothing short of a triumph in modern RPG design. Larian Studios has crafted an experience that seamlessly blends deep storytelling, rich character development, and strategic turn-based combat, making it one of the most immersive RPGs in years.

The game’s narrative is gripping from the start, offering a branching storyline with meaningful choices that genuinely impact the world and its inhabitants. Whether you're forging alliances, romancing companions, or making morally complex decisions, every moment feels personal and weighty. The dialogue and voice acting are top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that few games manage.

Gameplay-wise, the turn-based combat is intuitive yet complex, rewarding creativity and tactical thinking. The Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition mechanics are faithfully adapted, allowing for endless customization and role-playing possibilities. With a vast world to explore, hidden secrets to uncover, and countless ways to approach encounters, the replay value is immense.

Visually stunning and packed with detail, Baldur’s Gate 3 sets a new standard for RPGs. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, this game is an unforgettable experience that delivers on every front. It’s a must-play for any RPG enthusiast.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 03:53:09

I highly recommend this adventure solo or with a friend so that the two of you can experience all that the companions' stories have to offer but if you're more inclined to play with three or four people just be prepared to make some of your own stories.

"100% subjective opinions here based on my personal experience
Pros: 
1. looks and plays great
2. fantastic story line
3. lots of fun class options 
4. many many ways to play, probably the closest thing to a ""True RPG"" I've ever played

Cons:
1. there is so much gd content its mind boggling, you will almost certainly need to google stuff frequently
2. there isn't really a meta way to play, so min maxing can be a bit annoying at times
3. the sheer amount of choices to be made and how they affect each other makes me really paranoid during every interaction... if you have FOMO this game is tough, something as small as the background you pick can and will lock you out of certain quests and rewards, so build planning can be really tricky especially if you're in a party with other players.

BG3 is an excellent introduction to Dungeons and Dragons for those who have no knowledge of it, and it's a great way for long-time D&D players to experience D&D when their party can't get together (which is all the time, lol). 

The replay value is exceptional. There are so many things to do, different paths to take, multiple endings, endless tactics you can employ to win fights. It's the best depiction of roleplaying within a video game I've experienced.

"In short, I would recommend this game to most players. I would say that the game is a great value for money. 

But, clearly, this game is anything but short, so the review also requires more meat on the bone.

Some history. I have played DOS and DOS2 prior to BG3. My first experience with D&D systems was WOTR (I know that it is not one-to-one with D&D). 

For me, there are several ways how to look at this game. 
If I consider the game ending at beating the first of the three at the end of the second act, I would rate the game rather highly, but if I add the third act, oh boy, it goes down rapidly.
The first two acts were pretty tight. Character development, growth, intrigue, story - everything was seemingly there. Then the third act just bloated it all away.

I spent some considerable time on thinking about the game, and it all came down to one phrase ""superficial, bloated, and in odds with itself"". There is simply too much of everything. You walk around, find a chest, find some loot and do it ad nauseam. The loot is meaningless; to find chests, you don`t even need to succeed in checks, just dig after failing. Exploration was fun in the beginning. Go of the beaten track, find a special location or loot. Then it all boiled down to: there is a house, the house has a hatch, down the hatch there is a secret lever, crumbling wall or something similar, and a again, and again, and again. 
And then there are the characters. My horny, horny party. Full of one-liners, sleezy comments, tragic backstories and so on. All this noise just made it very difficult to take them seriously. In the end I have to say that Lae'zel was the one true guiding light for me (no romance though). Of course, Scratch and friends.

The story tried to be serious, but the tone was all over the place. 

And then the others I met. Mostly, they made no sense. For example, a random guy who in span of the game goes from casting maybe one decent spell to becoming some uber-mench wizard - why, how, what? 

The list goes on and on. 

Even the leveling system had no depth to it. 12 levels for the entire game? DOS was half the length, but almost twice the levels. I mentioned my experience with d&d systems. Here, the peak of the systems were the resting/spell slot mechanics and the ever-present die. Just roll them dice, boys!

I could write and write, but I will try not to make the same mistakes as BG3.

I know, this sounds very negative, but the game is still a good game, just not as great as WOTR is.
Buy it, play it. Maybe your experience is better than mine, maybe I`m just not the target audience for the game.
I`m happy that BG3 did this well. CRPGs need to be out there, and this is a very streamlined way how to get into the genre.

"I overall recommend BG3. It has some prime-level production values. It falls short in some aspects of the gameplay.

Pros: 
-Masterful interweaving storylines and dialogue options
-Great characters
-Graphics
-Music and sound design
-Level design
-good controller support
-character creation customization options
-class depth


Cons: 
-Gameplay lacks z-axis aiming or positioning, e.g., free-aiming into the air a fireball or flying into a stationary position high up, floating in place, like in Solasta. This is a big con, and I have read this has something to do with the difficulty of implementing such things in Unreal.

-Dialogue options are sometimes frustratingly limited and unrealistic, particularly in a party context. One character might say something while everyone stands there as though they were not involved or couldn't possibly have anything to add, which sometimes took me out of the experience. 

-Sometimes you will be stuck with one person when a conversation begins, or you may be unprepared for the dialogue initiator to engage and then can't switch to the appropriate party member, e.g., you want to use your sorcerer to discuss an arcane topic with a lich, but your barbarian is the one stuck in conversation after initiating the conversation without warning. You may then need to reload the game.

Verdict: 
Overall, BG3 is a good game with some major shortfalls. I still readily give it an overall recommend, especially to fans of the genre. There are literally hundreds of hours of game here, and it is by far worth the money.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 03:46:47
