RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"absolute cinema in its own world. the art, the enemies, bosses, exploration and the tension of survival in this game will give you a spectecular experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"elden ring is just not a human made, fromsoft did what no one can do . the game is perfect with its endless world, combat style, bossfights, themes, graphics, literally everything. one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"overhyped af. graphics remind me of a 2010 game but it was released in 2022. if the gameplay is all about dodging, why do you input a 0,5 sec delay on the dodge? it doesn't make sense and is beyond frustrating. yes, the design of bosses is magnificent especially the lord of blasphemy but the stupid handicap on the gameplay and clunky movement is what, in my opinion, spoils the fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,it is a masterpiece that combines all knowhow of fromsoftware. it is the best game you must enjoy in your life.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"elden ring is not a gang of old people! back when this game came out in 2022, my son brian briney for short put this game on his christmas wishlist. when i asked briney if he really wanted it, he replied i say do yeah which i didnt quite understand, but it would make sense since my little brineywiney is only six years old. when i saw him play the game, i was shocked to see four big black men in the kitchen with my exwifebrineys mom i asked them what they were doing there, they simply replied were just making some cream pies. so in conclusion, sans undertale won tumblr sexyman for a reason, tootleloo. speggy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"elden ring is a jack of all trades, but master of none. a reskinned dark souls iii with the most boring world in a souls game to date. enormous and empty. cut and paste dungeons with no depth. no pacing and no balance. a new low of not explaining mechanics  locking you out of them. we've fallen so far from what made the series great."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"this was my first 'souls like' game. get past the learning curve, find decent farm spots and most definitely research how to upgrade weaponsspirit ashes and you'll be well on your way to one of the most memorable gaming experiences of your life. the game won't show you where to go or what to do. keep a browser open with the elden ring wiki to help guide you along the way. it's free and super helpful! you won't be ready to tackle every boss fight you encounter. learn what works and what doesn't. if you're banging your head against a wall for hours, you're probably under leveled or not packing enough fire power. button mashing won't work here. it's all about timing. remember that you won't take damage while dodging! george rr martin's influence is unmistakable. i really hope they make a movie of this game! not enough has been said about the absolute beauty of the landscapes and architecture in this game! mind blowing! however, this game is not respectful of the amount of gaming time that you have available. approach each session with a goal in mind in order to get your tiny increments towards becoming elden lord. look at the wiki and watch youtube videos for guidance. if i can do it, then so can you! ps malenia is optional, but worth it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"i found absolutely nothing appealing about this game, and honestly, its very boring and repetitive compared to the previous versions.what kind of lazy developer would sit down and think, 'lets make a game where everyone else gets stronger, and you just suffer instead.'from dark souls 1 to elden ring, at least make some changes to the  the most frustrating thing for me was that i chose the samurai class, and it made absolutely no difference compared to the other classes. what kind of logic is that? in other games, classes are designed properly, with clear differenceslike, okay, heres a magic or mage class that feels unique and actually makes the hero or character stand out compared to s reasons like this that make me dislike this game. if others enjoy it, good for them, but i didnt have a good time with it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,the combat and bosses in this game are addictive to an unhealthy degree  all the bosses in this game are so cool and welldesigned. the only thing wish however is that the story was more coherent it kind of felt like a boss rush with pseudo dungeoncrawling aspects in the open world. that's not to say that the open world is anything short of remarkable though.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"elden ring is easily the best entry to the soulslike genre for players that do not usually play games like it. the exploration and build variety in this game is top notch, there is no doubt it is an insanely replayable game. unfortunately elden ring is riddled with a lot of technical issues like 60fps lock or no ultrawide and questionable design decisions, like, although controversial, missable content and nonexistent story presentation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,pros vast open world filled with intricate lore and deep storytelling. challenging yet rewarding combat system. high level of player freedom in exploration and play style. cons difficulty may not be suitable for casual players. ul and menu system can feel clunky at times.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"if you've never played a fromsoftware game before, get ready to die a lot. elden ring takes the classic soulsborne formula and expands it into a vast open world full of incredible bosses, deep lore, and brutal difficulty. while the challenge can be frustrating, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched. if you have the patience, this is a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"this is the first fromsoft game i've played. the steep learning curve of their titles pushed me away from this game at first. but after giving it a second try a couple weeks later i became fully immersed in this surreal world. there is no instant gratification, you have to work for every single drop of dopamine, which makes it even more impactful and rewarding. it is a great entry point into the souls games thanks to it's lower difficulty than it's predecessors."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-11,"the lore is amazing, wathicng videos is a big part of the enjoyment. the feeling after beating some of these bosses is pure cocaine. but enemy repetition is annoying and i hated that you cant easily swap weapons because you have to invest so much resources into upgrades to make them viable."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-08,"good man the best game ever ever iast time, the greatest performer in at many years"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,"unglaublicher mll! ich frage mich ernsthaft, was mit den menschen heutzutage nicht stimmt, dass sie so ein dermaen schlechtes spiel feiern knnen. es sieht nicht nur aus wie der letzte mist, sondern stellt sich in den meisten fllen auch als genau das heraus absoluter schrott. die mglichkeit, das spiel zu pausieren? fehlanzeige. logisch durchdachte level? genauso wenig vorhanden. stattdessen bekommt man ein chaotisches durcheinander serviert, das weder spa noch sinn ergibt. wie kann so etwas ernsthaft positiv aufgenommen werden? das gameplay ist einfach nur frustrierend, die grafik eine absolute katastrophe, und von innovation fehlt jede spur. ich verstehe wirklich nicht, wie man bei so einem unterirdischen produkt auch nur einen funken begeisterung empfinden kann. es wirkt, als htte niemand wirklich herzblut oder mhe hineingesteckt, und trotzdem wird es gefeiert. unbegreiflich!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-05,i would say 9.7 because optimization is buns on pc but stil great game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"very good game but for me, isnt the best game ever, i liked it but i feel the hours passin while i was playing it and maybe too long, the snow part was unnecesary, the open world felt repetitive especially in catacombs, anyway i played 100 hours xd and the artistic section is perfect, 1010, as fromsoftware usually"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-25,"elden ring is the peak of what from software can offer but in an openworld s start with some clarifications first the game does not revolutionize the open world genre in any way, but is rather miyazakis take on the modern game's tendency and obsession with massive maps and games with dispersed content and emphasized players  obvious goods of the game are stunning scenery and some of the best bosses you will ever experience, even more, it builds diversity and crafting, tons and tons of content, and much muchneeded qualityoflife updates from previous  how does the soulsborne formula apply to big maps? some positives and some negativeslack of linearity can sometimes induce the player to progress in some areas not intended to be played at that stage of the playthrough, creating extreme difficulty spikes transitioning in uncannily easy content because you leveled up too quickly doing some harder content  the other hand, the player is free to approach the game and different areas at their own pace, bouncing from place to place with the joy of discovery and not chained to the strict linearity of a classic dark souls.there are two things that i found very annoying recycled bosses when it was not necessary  i would rather have fewer bosses, but all unique  and the horrendous job the game does at directing the player towards some of its best content. a bunch of the hardest and most iconic areas in the game are completely optional and hidden from the players main path. its a shame that content made with great effort can be missed without looking at guides and playthroughs by a good percentage of the casual player base. furthermore, miyazaki does not disappoint and keeps the lore of the game completely marginal and a mere side effect of playing, and side quests without a guide are 100 impossible to experience fully but i get it, fromsoftware games were never about the storytelling, but about the experience.last but not least, player accessibility was never more emphasized than in this game with ashes of war, easiertoplay longrange builds, and summons. these tools grant their fun to all players, even to those not interested in a challenge. ill let purists and casuals debate if the developers are going in the right direction with this choice.still, even with its flaws, the elden ring is a masterpiece that should be played not only by souls hardcore fans, but all gamers that can respond to the call to a challenge, an adventure, or simply the joy of exploration. play it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-25,simply the best game i have played in a very long time. it has captivated me and kept me glued to my chair day after day until i finished the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"i have been playing this game on and off ever since its release. i have poured hundreds of hours into challenge runs or special playthroughs and i can confidently say that its worth it. as for the difficulty it really depends.this game has a difficulty slider just not in the way most people imagine. depending on the build you choose it can be the easiest or the hardest of the soulsborne genre. the story honestly deserves a tv show or a book to be made of it for it is so rich and dense. the combat is perfected down to the smallest details,making any build feel exciting to try. however,i believe that it is unbalanced in certain moments, and that spoils the over all experience a little bit. i highly recommend it to anybody, as long as they can withstand an unfair at times challenge"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-22,"elden ring is a masterpiece of immersion. its stunning artistic design, paired with a breathtaking soundtrack, creates an unforgettable atmosphere. the games mechanics offer deep freedom, allowing for unique builds and playstyles, while its learning curve makes progress immensely rewarding.mastering boss patterns and mechanics feels satisfying and encourages attention to detail. elden ring is more than a gameits an extraordinary experience that blends challenge, beauty, and creativity seamlessly. a mustplay for fans of immersive and rewarding adventures."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,"my favorite game of all time! it can be challenging and frustrating at times but this game is a master piece. great lore, great world, awesome looking enemies and bosses. highly recommend!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,"absolute masterpiece, offers an insane amount of content for a very cheap price, everyone must play elden ring in their life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"este  um jogo muito bom com vrios desafios.  o meu jogo favorito. e recomendo para quem quiser jogar, escolhendo um jogo para jogar. porm, mesmo eu gostando do jogo, que so parecidos com ele e tambm so bons, eu acho. um pouco vazio."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"i only just got started 7 hours in! but so far, it has been an amazing, stutter free experience. looking forward to playing it for the next couple hundred hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"this game saved my life. 1010 visual style, lore, gameplay, rpg aspects. there were couple of things that aren't perfect, but 1110 moments compensate for all these little things."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,i can't understand those who say 2022 god of war was right. god of war is never a bad game but it is very faithful to its essence. elden ring is a game that feels both innovative and great.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"the first souls game ever that i had the nerves and energy to finish. it's not bad, that's for sure. but like all the souls games it is insanely overhyped in my opinion. for a 1010 open world game there are too many things missing. there might be a story, but after 60 hours of play time i have pretty much no idea of what was happening other than me becoming the elden lord after slaying about 40 bosses with the same jump attack strategy. it's still locked to 60fps which is a no go for me. no ps5 controller support on pc as well it works but you only see the xbox signs, why??. also i don't think it's an indicator  single player game when i have to read ten guides online and watch multiple youtube videos in order to understand the builds or basically how almost anything in this game even works on a basic level. would give this a 710 but will give it a 6 to counteract the crazy fanboyism and overhype from so many people here."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,a massive gorgeous game with an absurd amount of great content to explore ruined by clunky dated combat
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"hundreds of hours later, several runs and different builds this game is simply a masterpiece and there's nothing else that needs to be added."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,"elden ring is the quintessential open world soulslike experience. you can play thruugh this game and spend hundred of hours exploring every knook and cranny, getting every item, trying multiple builds. you can also play one build, blitzdungeons for the challenges and focus on beating bosses. no matter what elden ring delivers in droves."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,"combat 55 music 55 story 55 graphics 55 environment 55 the already perfect formula of the dark souls series but added to an open world, if there's 1 complaint it would be that it's by far the easiest of the games from fromsoft, the open world, the jump button  summoning's basically make it impossible to be stuck on boss. you can have most summoning's just kill the boss, you can train in a dozen different areas to level up  jumping around adds so much mobility that most of us are not use to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,"on the outside looking in this game is a stunning masterpiece however no game is perfect, and neither is elden ring sadly. i would recommend trying the game if you were on the fence about this genre in the past. however just know that the frame stutters become quite annoying during boss fights where you need quick actions to dispatch your foes. my only other gripe with the game is the abysmal coop experience. the dropped connections from the servers for either trying to invite friends to play, or even invaders not being able to fully connect is just mind numbingly painful to sit through. stop making coop a chore and just make it as fun as the rest of the game!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,"aps concluir e platinar elden ring, posso afirmar com convico que este , sem dvida, um dos melhores jogos que j tive a oportunidade de jogar. elden ring transcendeu minhas expectativas, especialmente ao demonstrar como uma histria pode ser narrada de maneira envolvente mesmo quando no  apresentada de forma convencional. a integrao entre narrativa e cenrios, seja no aspecto visual ou temtico, impacta diretamente a experincia de jogo, elevandoa a um nvel excepcional. cada batalha, escolha de estilo de jogo, e construo de personagens como builds e abordagens estratgicas foram projetadas para proporcionar uma experincia verdadeiramente nica. o aspecto que mais me impressionou foi a incrvel capacidade do jogo de combinar variedade e qualidade. no conheo outro ttulo que consiga executar essa integrao de maneira to magistral. a trilha sonora, direo artstica, design de cenrios, criaturas e personagens no jogveis npcs mantm um padro extraordinrio de excelncia. elden ring no apenas oferece diversidade em contedo, mas tambm assegura que cada elemento esteja  altura da qualidade esperada de uma obraprima.  uma experincia inesquecvel, que define novos padres para o gnero."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-01,the game is extremely well made with a fun and massive world. the game is the same as the other dark souls games but much more polished and have more variety.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,"trs bon, trs bien optimis et graphisme trs fin. monde ouvert top et dure de vie trs bonne"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"this game an absolutely cant miss for souls or soulslike lover, in fact it bring me to this world of souls and soulslike game and im hooked !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"i've never been a huge fan of souls and soulslike games, but i've always been intrigued by elden ring and i was genuinely interested to play it. to my disappointment though, it was really lacking to me in many aspects. first, the game play, very average and lacking any innovation  it's fine for a souls game but that's it, no new, interesting or cool mechanics anywhere, and no fun in discovering and mastering them, just lots of slowly dodging, parrying and hitting your foes  there are literally bugs in other games that are better than actual mechanics in this one it remains undetailed, boring, slow, heavy and just not fun i like to move and enjoy actionpacked and dynamic game play that implements well the game's mechanics, i don't want to roll for hours around a boss and sporadically trying to hit it that's boring. second, the open world, which is potentially beautiful, with wonderful scenarios, but unfortunately is held back by being very inorganic, inconsistent and lacking in design and inspiration, with many badly placed, outofcontext elements e. g. enemy fields and bossesminibosses and completely lacking basic features, like proper weather and nightday cycles which is kind of there but only when resting in checkpoints plus, the world lacks completely of any proper interactivity everything is extremely static and unexciting. third, the aesthetic and overall design, very monotone and extremely boring, with no differences whatsoever between the environments, which are very nice, but not at all outstanding everything is very grey and sad, which just makes this game all the more sad, boring and unfun. fourth, animations and details, which are fine, but also very rough and unrefined and are all the same. fifth, the features, ui, and lack thereof, are either needlessly complicated, like the crafting of weapons and potions, or completely absent, like any kind of quest tracking system which is fundamental in an openworld game, plus the game's ui is very badly designed, convoluted and unintuitive. the only point i view positively is the overall technical performance, which is good for a game this big. other points i didn't mention are good enough for me to not complain. overall, is it a good game? sure, but in my view it's far from being the huge masterpiece it's supposed to be, since it seriously lacks any meaningful innovation in game play, mechanics and aesthetics  if you like the souls series and soulslike genre, go for it, you'll likely be satisfied, but keep in mind that this game will never really get out of its niche and will never make it as a real icon and as one of videogame history's greatest."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-29,"short review. i have 65 hours on my playthrough. what a rulebreaking game this is! your expectations of games will be a little changed after experiencing the elden ring. i both love and hate this game, it requires patience, practice, and looking to others for help. the main game is puzzlingly massive map, enemies, and weapons although it is very difficult, this game is very rewarding when things go right. there is frustration and rage included in your playthrough, but after some time and a rethink you come back around and think of smarter and more sensible ways of progressing through the maze of bosses. this game is nothing like open worlds from ubisoft, bethesda, obsidian. it is more related to zelda botw but has a more serious darker setting. everyone should play this, and everyone will likely experience the highs and lows of this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-28,perhaps one of the best games of all time. only thing lacking is clear story telling but still has amazing world building. amazing game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-27,"i'm. so. tired. i'm exhausted. it doesn't end. i think it still hasn't ended. it's too long. yes, the game is amazing. there is not a bad thing that i can say about the gameplay, story, graphics... everything. but i am really tired. i am so tired of this game that i will wait a couple years before playing the dlc. atmosphere 910, story 810, gameplay 1010, graphics 810."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-20,"i absolutely love elden ring its the most fun ive ever had in a game. the open world is massive and full of secrets, with incredible bosses that keep me on the edge of my seat. the combat is fast, challenging, and so satisfying when you finally take down a tough enemy. i love exploring every corner, finding new weapons, and building my character. elden ring is pure excitementit's an adrenaline rush every time i play!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-18,"very good game, the exploration of the map and dungeons is really great, so many secrets, items, boss fight, it was an exciting experience 's too repetitive, after 5 dragons, 4 horsemens, etc... need to change !! and catacombs, i avoid them after finishing 56 of this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-12,"its game of the year for a reason. really enjoyed how this is made how it changed from the last fromsoftware game. i believe an open world souls game is a great idea and miyazaki realllyy knew how to do it. 1010 game for me. idk what would make me hate it. from the start of it to the end, there was nothing i hated. the rage that this game did to me was the funny rage, after i beat a boss i struggled on i get a sense of relief and accomplishment lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-10,"one of the best games ever made, any genre, any platform! no  ingame store, no micro transactions. just pure fun!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-04,elden ring is good and addicting and many build variation very playable story good no cap
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-07,"elden ring est certainement mon jeu de la dcennie et figure parmis les meilleurs jeux auxquels j'ai pu jouer dans ma vie. riche, intense, magnifique, un passage en monde ouvert ultra russi, mais tout gardant l'adn des souls de fromsoftware. elden ring et son dlc auront occup mon esprit pendants des centaines d'heures. le jeu le plus abouti du meilleurs studio au monde ! bravo fromsoftware !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-06,"i didn't finish it even after 80 hours of play because i'm so bad, but what artistic talent, what fantastic work, a must have."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-05,"elden ring has toptier music that makes you feel like you've been given one more chance, satisfying combat that you appreciate getting used to, one of the greatest openworld designs i have ever seen, and i can't name more than two games that match this masterpiece. the art direction is jawdropping and worth many screenshots. the boss battles are epic and extremely rewarding. i purposefully died on some of the bosses in my first playthrough because i didn't want it to end. the secrets, the loot, the messages other players leave on the side of cliffs encouraging you to jump off for a secret item, which eventually just leads to an unnecessary death, the live ghosts of players playing in real time running around letting you know that you're not alone, the caves, the dungeons, the castles, and so much more that i do not want to spoil."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-24,"very lowlevel pictures.boring explorationwithout guidance, it is easy to get lost.very repetitive bossthe combat angle is very bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-22,"i would give it a 10 if it was not for the technical issues fromsoft still have with their games, elden ring is capped at 60fps it has shader compilation stutters and some other less intrusive issues such a beautiful game should not have, i hope they improve on future releases there is only so much patience the pc gaming community can have no matter how good your game is which it is a freaking masterpiece"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-22,"gran juego, muy bueno grficamente,muy bueno en movimientos, en implementacin.... me cost el tema controles, ya que me cuesta adaptarme y tambin creo que es bastante dificil. sin duda lo recomiendo."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,quel chef d'oeuvre..premier souls like de ma part et quel bonheur de ce dpasser dans ce genre de  produit peut tre consommer sans modration. le jeu vous laisse l' immense bonheur de fouiller cette map gigantesque sans vous aidez a vous de tout dcouvrir il est mon jeu prfr tout jeu confondu tout simplement .si je devais avoir un point ngatifs c'est l'absence total d'info sur les qutes ou de ce que l'ont doit faire dans le jeu .
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,"it's a terrible game, the bosses are so poorly designed, and it's very torturous to play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,"the open world is boring, the graphics are outdated, the framerate is capped at 60 and many graphics and accessibility settings are missing. there should be difficulty settings for people with physical disabilities like me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,a keyboard alone can't capture the sheer beauty of this game. elden ring is a masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,"despite of some trivial issue with this game, such as game balance and almost meaningless crafting system, elden ring redefines soulike games. the gaming is astoundingly innovative and inspiring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,easily one of the greatest games fromsoftware has ever made! everything from the lore to the boss encounters to the gorgeous environment is top of the line i've come to expect nothing less from the legendary miyazaki! easily the greatest solo video game experience i've ever had!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,"it's a good game for me. the whole map can be walked around at will. there's also plenty of equipment and skills to keep the game interesting. but to be honest, this picture style is not what i can accept, and this plot, i did not understand much from the beginning to the end. they spread it all over the map. if you want to understand the whole story, you have to sort out the storyline yourself. but that's what i don't want to do. ignoring this is actually a good game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,"s no  10 pelo problema de desempenho, pois todo o resto  uma das melhores experiencias que tive com video game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,the best game of all time thanks fromsoftware for this amazing exprience. i recommand this game for anyone likes open world and rpg games for the best challenge adventure.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-18,"elden ring is great. havent encountered any performance issues or bugs. combat is generally great, but builds get insanely broken insanely easily. most of the bosses are super fun, but the open world gets bland quick and the bajillion boss reskins get annoying too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-17,
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-17,the best game i've ever played..i got the good ending also like the age of 't wait to play dlc erdtree shadow
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-14,best game ever only downside of the game is optimizations but even that can't get 1 point from this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-14,"this was my first souls gamei i ever played, and i fell in love in it so i even got platinium. i really enjoyed the great open world, lots of activities, variety of builds and the free will that fromsoft gave us. the bosses are enjoyable except the elden best because he was a bit underwhelming. i really think if anybody want to play but are scared of the game difficulty you can really do whatever you like and match the game to your playstyle. i enjoyed the learning process in the game and that almost each death gave me some knowledge about what to do. personally i recommend this game to anyone that want a bit of challenge and have a lot of great experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-13,"great replayability, this game gains a lot on subsequent playthroughs. completely unbalanced  can be the hardest or the easiest fromsoftware game ot there, which i find awsome  you can adjust difficulty however you like inside the game. it is underwhelming in some aspect, like boss variety or side dungeon quality, but it's awsome time nontheless."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-12,"truly a once in a lifetime experience, one that is going to simmer in our brains forever."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,"i've been a souls player for years. unfortunately, this game is nothing but  they built the game solely on the spam of the enemies and not to make you drink life pots. that's why there are no fair fights at all. the worst dogs, 2 or 3 of them came and you died. fs knows the players' hatred of dogs, so they talked nonsense here too. this isn't a difficulty thing, this is complete nonsense. this wasn't the case in other games, they tried to figure out how to distract the player from the game, how to drive him crazy, in the name of difficulty. i bought the main game, but if i had known i would have returned it straight away. i won't buy the dlc either. it seems that the game's scores were thanks to the hype."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,"this is how action rpgs are supposed to be, take notes everybody. this is the pinnacle of gameplay and worldbuilding. it really is miyazaki's magnum opus."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-06,"the result of compiling years of experience in making such perfect franchising is truly the embodiment of what a perfect soulslike openworld game would look like. not as allaround perfect as ds3 or bloodborne, but another masterpiece iconic title from fromsoftware. the perfect souls to introduce to a nonsouls player. truly amazing. 1010 when taking the dlc with the main game. it honors the names of ds3 and bb."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-06,"massively overrated and disappointing for any dark souls fan. i had high hopes but the dlc strengthens my opinion on this game. fromsoft took everything bad from the previous games mindlessly put it here. they absolutely didn't learn from their mistakes. the fairness of the bosses isn't a point anymore. they're far too fast, it's like they've tried to make another sekirolike with parry based combat but either forgot that halfway through or someone accidentally added any bosses past a certain point for a scrapped game here 1 of the bosses actually is a scrapped boss from sekiro which makes this theory that much believable. the worst part of the community is they will 100 avoid this criticism and just say git gud. and i have, i've loved every other fromsoft game for it's difficulty, here it's just  thrown together to make a hard game. some moves straightup cannot be dodged, mostly combos that are followed multiple times too fast for the mediumroll to work so you always end up getting hit 12 times no matter how good you are. some of the grab moves oneshot so you wait there for a good 510 seconds for the animation to end watching it eat through your health like nothing. they didn't bother playtesting. the moves are awfully telegraphed so you have absolutely no idea what the boss is doing until you get hit. the game is bloated to the point that it feels like a slog. stupidly large locations with no points of interests. reused bosses. if you see a boss in an open arena it has 5 versions somewhere elsewhere. reused dungeons. they all feel the same with maybe 4 different gimmicks that constantly repeat themself. reused enemies. because why would they bother making every location unique rather than favoring quantity over quality. the developers didn't even bother to not make this look like a cashgrab. quantity over quality is the best way to put it. disappointing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,"without a doubt, the best souls and best rpg i have played the last decade, i will never forget the amazing experience i had playingthis game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-24,"the game is frankly weak. can i start with the cons that outweigh the pros  empty open world copying bosses and mobs from dark souls, although this is a new universe and game it is very difficult to follow the path planned by the developers because if you find the boss later, you will be too strong for him and will kill him the first time, an open world is not suitable for this genre quests, as always, in the games of this studio are rubbish, if in ds they could be completed intuitively, then 0.1 percent of players will pass without guides, you probably need to get into the head of babadzaki and find out where the quest character is standing this time there are few good bosses, 8 bosses come to mind, and its funny to even call the rest bosses lack of a normal local plot and the presence of global  about gods and aliens advantages of the game  beautiful locations a sea of various interesting weapons and spells 8 good bosses and i especially liked the capital, unfortunately this is the only location that could impress me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-22,"incredible environment art and lot of new type of weapon and new boss, you must try!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-22,"i believe that this game will be a point of refference for the perfect game. this game is just so good, it will go into history as one of the absolute best game for the past 25 years."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-22,this rank is for final boss. worst experience of entire series. how can you make a boss more frustrating and disgusting?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-21,"an extraordinary experience in this game which is a souls like and from software are still strong for making games with such a universe, just a shame that on the pc version the optimization"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-19,i put in 143 hours in this game and i'm pretty sure i will put in more. just a masterpiece from every way you can look at it.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"very beautiful and interesting game. huge world, dozens of weapons and builds, amazing style. real dark souls in the open world. some bosses caused great difficulties. i was very pleased after finishing the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-11,this game is on whole different level its the best open world game in my opinion and the difficulty is balanced a must play in my book
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,the game is really good and the nine is only because of the fact that the game doesn't support ultrawide monitor
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-07,"it is not a game for everybody, so i suggest looking up the game style online before buying. but this is a mustbuy for fans of the genre and other fromsoftware's games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-07,"elden ring... acho que meu 5 jogo favorito, s atrs de gta v, gow 4, resident evil 4, red dead redemption 2 etc, e mano que jogo incrivel, sim eu gosto muito de souls, mas nem todos, s gostei mesmo de dark souls 1, dark souls 3, sekiro um pouco, lies of p, demon souls etc... mas elden ring fez historia, um bagulho simplesmente magico, o mundo aberto desse jogo  cinema, os bosses so surreais, os graficos impressionantes e muito, e a jogabilidade  perfeita. nota 1010 sem duvidas."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,so good. i can't stop playing elden ring. it feels so great to play and there is so much to discover. it's one of the greatest games i have ever played. by far. amazing. all time great.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-04,"peak gameplay, peak lore, peak game exploration, peak world, mid combat, mid optional bosses, peak sound design, peak osts, overall best game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-04,"stunning open world with a lot of options when it comes to builds. you can go super tanky or go for a high dps approach. amazing lore that you probably have to watch a couple videos to be able to follow. great overall, still in my first playthrough and working for that 100 in achievements. again, absolutely stunning."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-04,it's pretty good but i haven't got why people think it's the best ever. might change the review if i do
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-01,1010 all around. a fantastic rpg that does everything right from start to finish.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-30,"have to give it 910 because of npc endings, like please let them be happy, at least one of them... the jar guy is the goat btw"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-29,everyone saying this game is hard are complete losers who dont take the time to learn game mechanics like the mimic tear summon is completely overpowered it makes the game 10 times easier and realistically if you have a good build boss fights should take 2 hours at the most genuinely i'd read through most of these comments and all the negative comments are just complete sore losers who come here and say the game is too hard like what do you want a participation ribbon get the f out of here the game is supposed to be hard.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,"simply upgraded dark souls with very well designed open world. fantastic world settings and lore, great exploration, challenging enemies and boss battle. so much build customization and thus have very good replayability. one of the best game ever made. just masterpiece."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-25,"it showed me that i could play the soul game of fromsoftware, and the feeling of exhilaration as i defeated each boss was incredible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,it's just the best gaming experience i've ever had in years. i could play this game all day and not get tired of it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-22,no gameplay no quests ctrlc ctrcv from othe gamesthe same things people critic other games are praised here???
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-22,medicore. played 100 hours doing most content at launch. slow clunky combat. 60 fps locked. high end system cant play on anything higher than a highmedium mix or it wont hold 60 fps. weird map design. no enemy progression. wandering feels aimless and bad. almost no story replaced by lots of lore. items feel bad due to having to have a whole build to feel good. but it does have an extreme amount of content and lots of memorable enemies. not as hard as most people say.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"can't explain how good this game, it should have a rating of 100 out of 100, anyone hating on it just has a skill issue cause there is nothing to hate on this masterpiece, if the game is not your type then refund don't rate it that's the thing i hate about these stupid people."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-05,"elden ring is the most epic, most ambitious game i have ever played. i think this game goes beyond a recomendation. i beat this game and all of its bosses that didnt regard a secret quest line concerning a 4 handed person that i didnt find on my entire play through with a standard build without looking anything up. i did not use summons or take any help. i played through with a strength build like i always have. there has been some controversy around the games difficulty but i liked that it is the hardest of souls games. these games have always revolved around understanding enemy behavior and animations. this game takes that and cranks it up to 11. i never felt like anything was impossible and i even beat malenia at level 120 in 3.5 hours. which is a lot but its an optional boss so i never needed to get stuck this is the most beautiful game i have ever played. every place just feels like i am stepping into a whole new world. the exploration is insanely fun and rewarding. you explore for weapons and levels and then use that in the legacy dungeons. some people have said that the double battles are stupid and that reusing bosses is lazy. i have to agree with that to some extent but honestly you can always skip bosses like these. i know i did it a few times and i came back if i needed xp. this is true until you get to the godskin duo. godskin duo was not the worst thing it the world. you have to hide behind pillars and use the surroundings as well as you can. you can often posture break or get good hits in one of them while the other is behind. you always have to keep your guard up and be ready to dodge. it is harder but i dont believe its that bad. its like a ctier fight to me. just really basic and needs some good use of the arena. overall i dont agree with the many criticisms that the games difficulty has gotten and i also think that the games overall quality is exceptionally high. i know some wont agree with me but i am fine with that. i loved this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"i loved dark souls 1 and 3.i heard the great reviews of this game calling it the first half of ds1 combined with the base game of ds3 and open world of my favourite game botw, finally got it running on my pc and thought that this would be the best game i had ever played, its not. i am 17 hours in and just reached the main atlas plateau and cannot continue.i will first try to sing this game some praises. i love the art style, graphics, varying builds which i thought was lacking in ds3, the vast amount of weapon types, the boss runbacks and some bosses move sets, but i just don't like the game  biggest gripes i have of elden ring in descending order is the open world, repeating bosses enemies and the balances. to me elden rings open world lacks the same charm as botws does, it feels like dark souls 1 but bigger, this may sound like a good thing, but the scale just exacerbates the flaws. in ds1 i always felt like i knew where i was going and why i was going there and even if i went somewhere where i wasn't supposed to, i could do or learn something substantial. an example of this is where you may find yourself walking to the graveyard and then potentially further into the catacombs like i did but its completely obvious that you don't need to be there because of the fat ass in your face staircase leading to the undead burg infront of firelink shrine, in elden ring i had no idea where or why i was going anywhere after margit because of the massive scale and many paths. in ds1 it was either go to new londo or graveyard and realize you're too low level and go to undead burg yet because of the massive open world in elden ring there are so many alternative paths that can be taken leading to me just not knowing where to go at all and not being able to perfectly remember the interconnected map like in ds1, there is just so many places to go yet there is a defined way you must play the game to open gates to progress  unlike in breath of the wild where if you don't want to defeat the great divine beasts you can just fight ganon and finish the game in around an hour if you're good enough which i loved for me this makes it feel as if the overworld in elden ring is just a facilitator to farming and levelling up but there are some methods of farming that are just superior to all the others so why not just do that. i also don't particularly like the if you see it you can get to it approach of the game, whilst this might be true like in botw , the difficulty of souls type games less incentivises me to explore that much due to losing runes but that isn't particularly detrimental to the explorational experience as i can just git gud or run past the enemies. the bigger, probably needy and whiny, complaint i have about it is that there are places that i dont know how to get to. by this i mean that i will see something, for example the big mountain at liurnia, and try for so long to get to the top of it just to find out that apparently thats a late game area and i cant get there yet. so, what's the point of making it an open world game if i cant get somewhere? this is probably a really nitpicky critique, but i feel as if its a valuable one because the constant oh i need to get here but i cant situation is much more prevalent here than in botw or totk where i can just climb or make something to get somewhere making the zelda open world feel like a constant puzzle, but the elden ring feels like there are massive barriers. the repeating bosses also leads to a less magical experience when playing these games. just like ds1 this game has repeating bosses but where the bosses in ds1 become normal enemies to show you how powerful you have become taurus demon and capra demon in demon runes elden ring just puts them in again and again. i am no longer put in awe of seeing these large spectacles of huge dragons or terrifying beasts that i can learn i'm just bored and want to get to the next proper mainline boss, which i do admittedly think apart from some  1 shot moves do very well, margit being probably my 3rd favourite souls boss after sister friede and gael.i guess how i feel about this game is that i was promised the first half of ds1 with the boss quality of ds3 and open world of botw but so far, i feel as if i have gotten the 2nd half of ds1 with the open world of minecraft and a few amazing bosses"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"why should i sit on guides and replay a lot of time and waste time on empty running. dlc that requires guides. wasting a lot of time replaying. i can't beat the game, about half of the players can't beat the game or run the dlc, let alone beat it. this is equal to theft. games like this not about player's skills, it's about stupid learning timings. the game should be normal  smart, not lazy stupid amateur's product for fools. why there is people that buy games on ps or xbox? especially like this? what wrong with you? on pc you have 4k 60fps and all windows functions. do you play on 30 inch? don't you know that there are 506080 inch screens? on ps and xbox there is a regional restriction of access to the game to voice acting languages and even subtitles. i sincerely recommend that people read reviews where the ratings are lower than the enthusiastic critics, or even bribed, because they are real. this is already known and tested in the gaming community. even on steam there are a lot of purchased positive reviews. and there are players that simply like something in the game and don't want to look on the problems, they dont think about fair gameplay, balance and believability, plausibility and common sense, availability to people, they don't think about you. they see only one side. if you want to know exactly what awaits you in the game on which you are spending real time, real hardearned money, with which you could help someone, do something useful in life, then read reviews that write about problems. today's games are not at the 10 point level. for example, when i give 10 points, i explain why and this is very rare and you have to turn on your brain and decide if it's true reason and i try to write all the shortcomings and problems. moreover, take care of yourself and your children and not get caught up in the excitement of buying skins and any nonsense. the developers are not your friends, they are looking for ways to encourage you to spend money, they sit in the office and while you are playing with their toys, they come up with all sorts of tricks to make money from you with the most minimal effort. let the players sit on the guides, why try to make fair, interesting gameplay.. and if you have a problem, they won't care at all they won't help you, so don't be stupid. dont buy games at the time of release, you cant know whats in it and at that moment its not ready, it may have a lot of bugs and its probably not optimized."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"best souls game universally with the most replay ability. the lore , the map , the combat everything has been top notch"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"elden ring offers a captivating and immersive gaming experience that appeals to both fans of fromsoftware's previous titles and newcomers to the genre. the game's blend of challenging gameplay, exploration, storytelling, and worldbuilding sets a new standard for openworld rpgs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-20,"an absolute monument added to the videogame industry, the game is vast , epic , fun and yes often hard but it's what makes this game unique.a feeling that will be hard to get in another game. the story is amazing if you are looking forward to learn about the world, you are leaved in total freedom , nobody is here to tell you what to do or the way you do it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-19,"lame game that people hyped up way more than it should be. the story is borderline not there, and its just wandering around and fighting ridiculously looking monsters with no direction with terrible combat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,"the best souls like of all time, there has never been so much content. miyazaki is a genius of our time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-17,"meu ponto favorito de todo o jogo foi a explorao, terminei com 60hrs a histria principal com algumas poucas quest secundrias finalizadas, a melhor parte  eu vejo, logo posso ir"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-16,"i really love elden ring. the gameplay, especially with the greatsword, was fantastic. the world they've built is breathtaking, with so much to exploreit feels endless. the story is intriguing, although i found it challenging to fully grasp without watching lore videos or using guides. the only downside was the malenia fight, which felt impossible for my character. after many attempts, i got frustrated and ended up finishing the game using the mimic tear after beating her and the last three bosses. that fight really dampened my experience, but overall, elden ring is still a solid 10 out of 10 for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-15,"bad game. darksouls series is best frenchise ,but elden ring is . huge map with same mecanism. boring game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-15,mein erstes souls like game und ich liebe es!! die schnste open world die ich jemals gesehen habe und zudem auch keine langweilige checklisten open world aller ubisoft ect. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-13,"elden ring is an amazing game with steep learning curve to it. there's a lot to do and look for in the world of elden ring which will only have you coming back to look for more. my only real issue with the game are the bosses, many times bosses delay their swings which adds a fake level of difficulty."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,"it's terribly unoptimized for pc, just a low quality port. thank god i was able to refundit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,"la jugabilidad, graficos, lore, guion, todo increible. no le pongo 10 por el hecho de que muchos boses se repiten y a la hora 7080 se puede hacer repetitivo."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-10,"not just the best souls game, it's one of the best games! not to mention the gameplay and open world, you have to play and see."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-09,"this is my first game in the genre and i'm really impressed with the mechanics, the graphics and the difficulty of the bosses and enemies in general. i can really recommend the game to everyone, even if it is the first of the genre."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-09,just amazing! huge and detailed world  can't wait for dlc. 140h for platinum trophy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-08,"elden ring, the muchanticipated collaboration between fromsoftware and george r.r. martin has taken the gaming world by storm. as a longtime fan of the soulsborne series, i approached elden ring with both excitement and trepidation, wondering if it could possibly live up to the monumental expectations. what i found was a game that not only met those expectations but transcended them, delivering an experience that is as profoundly moving as it is challenging.from the moment you step into the lands between, its clear that elden ring is a labor of love. the world is vast and meticulously crafted, with every region telling its own story through environmental details and carefully placed lore items. george r.r. martins influence is palpable in the rich tapestry of history and mythology that underpins the game. the narrative unfolds in layers, encouraging players to explore and piece together the intricate puzzle of the worlds past and present. this method of storytelling, a hallmark of fromsoftwares games, reaches new heights here, blending mystery with revelation in a way that is deeply satisfying.elden rings gameplay is a masterful evolution of the soulsborne formula. the combat is as tight and demanding as ever, requiring precision, strategy, and adaptability. what sets elden ring apart is its openworld design, which offers unprecedented freedom and encourages exploration. the addition of the spectral steed, torrent, transforms traversal, allowing players to cover vast distances swiftly and engage in mounted combat. this innovation adds a dynamic layer to the already rich combat system, making encounters feel fresh and  games difficulty is a topic of much discussion, but its worth noting that elden ring provides a variety of tools to aid players. the summoning system, which allows for cooperative play, is more accessible than ever, and the inclusion of spirit ashes provides an additional layer of strategy. these elements make the game more approachable without sacrificing the core challenge that fans cherish.visually, elden ring is breathtaking. the art direction is nothing short of spectacular, with each area offering distinct and unforgettable aesthetics. from the hauntingly beautiful ruins of limgrave to the eerie majesty of the erdtree, the game is a feast for the eyes. the attention to detail is astounding, with every nook and cranny packed with secrets waiting to be  audio design is equally impressive. the score, composed by yuka kitamura and tsukasa saitoh, perfectly complements the games atmosphere, ranging from hauntingly melancholic to triumphantly epic. sound effects are meticulously crafted, enhancing the immersion and making every action feel weighty and significant.elden ring offers deep character customization, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle. the range of available weapons, spells, and abilities is vast, providing a level of flexibility that is unmatched. the character progression system is intuitive yet deep, rewarding experimentation and thoughtful planning. this depth extends to the games npcs, whose stories and quests add layers of meaning and consequence to the players  narrative of elden ring is a dark and captivating tale of ambition, loss, and redemption. it explores themes of power, corruption, and the cyclical nature of history with a poignancy that is rare in video games. the characters you meet are complex and multifaceted, their fates intertwined with the larger narrative in ways that are often surprising and moving. the games ending, or rather endings, are thoughtprovoking and offer a sense of closure that is both satisfying and open to interpretation.elden ring is a triumph, a game that pushes the boundaries of what an openworld rpg can be. it seamlessly blends fromsoftwares signature gameplay with a richly detailed world and a narrative that resonates on a deeply emotional level. the result is a game that is not only a joy to play but also a profound experience that stays with you long after the credits  an era where many games are content to follow established formulas, elden ring dares to innovate, to challenge, and to inspire. it is a testament to the power of video games as an art form and a reminder of why we fell in love with gaming in the first place. whether you are a veteran of the soulsborne series or a newcomer to fromsoftwares worlds, elden ring is a journey that you will not want to miss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-06,"i enjoyed a lot of sekiro's gameplay, bloodborne's ambiance and story, and ds3's overall vibe as a game. i had elden ring on my wishlist for almost two years, and when i finally got it, i was  combat in elden ring quickly becomes monotonous. once you acquire a good weapon, which requires some initial effort, you tend to stick with it for the rest of the game. this is because there are only a few truly effective weapons, and upgrading a weapon is such an investment that farming materials to level up another one feels  game features a wide variety of enemies, but unfortunately, about 70 of them share the same moveset and slow behavior, making them easy to defeat in 23 hits. the most interesting enemies are the faster and more aggressive ones, but even they become repetitive after the first  story is almost nonexistent unless you delve into secondary quests, which often feel like you're just running errands.i wish this game were as engaging as sekiro, bloodborne, or dark souls 3. those games reward exploration and provide a sense of progression through gameplay, rather than relying solely on character stats."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-05,"this game is not for everyone. its unforgiving and will kick your ass. but to anyone who genuinely thinks this game isn't unique and didn't set the bar for triple a game developers, you genuinely didn't get it. again, these types of games aren't for everyone, but if you can't admit at the bare minimum that this was one of the best games released in the last decade, you are either purposely faulting it because you weren't good, or like i said earlier, you just didn't get it. saying the game is bland just proves you couldn't bother to explore for more than an hour. this game is the literal opposite of bland. and to all the people who didn't get it, i'm sorry you missed out on the best action rpg game in the last 20 years. i'm really glad i'm not you. like a wise man once said..... git gud"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-04,"an incredibly long, beautiful, sad, and frustrating game. more lore than some real life countries, and an insane amount of build and player custamization. a must play for anyone"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-02,"this game uses the openworld souls game formula that i think is bad, but they implemented it the best they could.classic souls game with  nice."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-01,"i mean dude, it doesn't get better than this. this game has me thinking about it's world and lore all the damn time. when you slowly master the combat and then switch to a different playstyle it becomes a completely different beast, i have put about a 1000 hours in this game and it's just gonna get higher and higher."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-31,one of the best games ive played to this day. never in my 10 years of playing games have i hoped to forget about a game just to experience it again. what a masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-29,"it's like an openworld dark souls, with some additions to the gameplay. it's an awesome game with an epic world and enemies. however, i feel that the bosses in souls games are generally betterthey are not reused as in elden ring, are more streamlined, and have better soundtracks. i don't really care much for the game's vastness and added complexity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-29,"if this game had more development time, i truly believe it would be perfect. unfortunately due to what i assume are either poor creative descisions or pressure to release on time, there are some flaws that make it impossible to a rate 1010. my first issue is the multitude of poorly made, unfair and... for lack of a better term  duo boss fights. most of these involve two normal enemies or bosses being shoved into a room with no ai tweaks. this makes balancing the two while making your own attacks incredibly annoying and unfair. i believe this was due to lack of development time, so i fault the publishers more than the developers. my 2nd complaint is the performance i know, low hanging fruit. fromsoftware has a history of poor optimisation but elden ring is horrible in this regard. the only real way to get a consistent 60fps is to run on the lowest possible settings unless you're running a 4090ti. normally i don't mind a few little frame drops but the game also likes to crash... very frequently. especially at loading screens. and then they add ray tracing despite this? my 3rd complaint is easyanticheat. that is all. nobody likes easyanticheat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-28,"short version great game, just didn't get the same out of it as my previous dark souls experiences. long version this is a well made game with bookoos of content. my main thing is i went into this expecting another dark souls game, and that is not what i got. the dna is there, of course, but i constantly found just a little something missing. upon finishing the game my thought was have i become a dark souls purist? would i have had more fun without summons, etc. this is by far the easiest souls game that fromsoft have put out. i do think part of this stems from the fact that if you do practically any amount of exploring, you will get overleveled. the result of this was i never got any moment of triumph from killing a boss as i killed practically every boss i encountered in 13 tries, including the final boss. i also ran into the problem of doing most of my lore homework by reading descriptions and whatnot, but i still had little idea what was going on, and so this hurt my enjoyment of the game somewhat significantly. so while there's a ton of different builds to play with, plenty of places to explore, and lots of bosses to fight, i left this game feeling empty. i don't wish to review this as negative as it's still a solid game, i may have just inaccurately set my expectations, and was disappointed when they weren't met."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-27,"elden ring is a fantastic experience in a gigantic and very challenging world. it was the first soul's like i played, a genre i thought i didn't like but this game changed that perception. the only detail that bothers a little is that some bosses are reused, practically copies and in these cases the novelty factor disappears and the battle becomes a little repetitive, but i didn't discount any points for this reason since a game of this size with more than 150 bosses it is difficult to maintain 100 authenticity and reuse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-25,"elden ring is one of the greatest video games of all time and thats definitely not an understatement. elden ring is a massive game yet no area seems empty. exploring through the beautifully crafted world on your first play through is almost magical, with so much to explore and an infinite amount of things to do. tons of weapons and builds you can make in elden ring which just gives a huge amount of freedom to play the game however you like. elden ring has almost a hundred bosses and their main bosses are just amazing. gameplay is very fun and defeating a challenging boss is just so rewarding. visuals are some of the best in all of gaming. definitely a tough game but its one that anyone can pick up in my opinion and the freedom of being able to play through the game however you want is just perfect. would recommend this game to anyone as its a perfect souls game for anyone new to the genre."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-14,"game mechanics is very simple. people think open world and nice graphics makes a classic game. no. poor itemization, every item has little to no difference. too many useless skills. title should be elden roll, because to win you need to master the art of rolling. zero end game mechanic. character progression , missions, and npc interaction is all on rails. not worth the 80 for a 2010 designed type of game. expect more from the developers, they are milking this old formula that we have played since the 1990s minmax stats."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-11,"endless options, insane battles, unrelenting soundtrack. this game is peak dark souls. the damage balancing is rough in the final third of the game. if i could split this into 2 reviews i would say the first 23 of the game is a 10, and final 13 is a 7"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-10,"best game i've played ever, i wonder if it'll ever be topped. there are several moments in this game that cannot be replicated in any other media, and it never stops to amaze you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,"tutto meraviglioso,ogni passo  una fotografia,difficile il giusto,unica pecca sistema di combattimento un po vecchiotto"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-07,"i've played the souls games before, and every new souls game increases my doubts, and i wonder how a game that has so many things repeated succeeds. elden ring is a horribly repetitive game, from the way i play to the world that i saw 70 of the details in the world, another souls, and the repeated enemies and bosses make me feel like they came from other games and exploring the world. it bores you to no limits because you will do the same thing a thousand times, and if you talk to me about the story, you must search in the himalayas in order to know the story and its details, and the end of the game that i spent more than 60 hours in are just repeated endings from other games, and the method of playing that i do not remember seeing only in 6 souls games are few, aren't they? no"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-07,"world best soul style game. best game ever. bloodborne, dark souls 3, elden ring i think these three games are from's biggest hits."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-06,"while i do respect the details and lengths made in this game, i find it quite hard to enjoy this game due to the combat and openworld aspect. differences in difficulties could be very different one boss could seem easy while one could be astronomically hard. such imbalances causes friction while playing, erasing the sense of progression. in terms of being openworld, one thing that bothers me is the lands between itself is very cynical, with mostly enemies, dungeons, and forts on every corner. there are few friendly npcs that i've encountered and they are mostly there either for the sake of the story or trading, making it seem more of a battlefield rather than a world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,"my girlfriend just got an operation for cleft lip. she can now do some incredible things, like drink through a straw. watching her do these things is so much more rewarding than playing elden ring, which is a complete waste of life. do yourself a favor and don't buy this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-30,"130 hour spent on the game. quite a adventure for me but sadly i don't feel any connection to the characters, and the lore is a bit on the bs side to be honest. solid 8 online elements feels awkward and very distracting, but it's just me i guess."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-30,my favourite game of the last 2 years. lots to explore and discover. over 150 hours played and i still keep coming back to it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-25,amazing gameplay that don't hold you hand and you can essentially do whatever you want to do with multiple endings and many bosses to face which makes you think about how to tackle each boss differently which is why this game gets a 10
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-23,"i like this game. elden ring is a masterpiece of gaming. wether you are a die hard fan of the souls games or a newbie doesnt matter. although its challenging, its still playable by people who have never touched any souls games. it depends on your dedication and determination wether you succeed or fail."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-15,this game is the pinnacle of gaming. the world is filled with lots of things you can do and you never get bored of it. the combat is fun and engaging although a bit hard. you dont have to fight bosses if you are under leveled and if you struggle with them here are some tips 1.dodge every attack and look for the opportunity to strike only once dont get greedy 2.sometimes you can dodge bosses by rolling into their attack this game gives you invincibility midroll  shouldnt heal unless you know its safe 4.never panic dodge dodge when you need to i also never found any bugs while playing and the whole game screams quality.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-15,"the worst game ive played in a decade. the claims this developer bought a click farm and paid for awards seems warranted. even with 50 mods this game is just trash.  graphics are disgusting, ps3 level  hdr never functioned right and rtx does nothing in this game  you cant even wide screen res without bars  navigation is guesswork because of lazy dev design, not in order to make exploration fun. this bleeds truth after just an hour of playing.  without parries and iframes this game is a shallow shell. its made for jocks too dumb for a real rpg and are on a break from madden.  the music is omg the music. did they even try? sunoai can make better in 5 minutes. legit murder on the ears.  the mod community cant even package the folders the way theyre supposed to be packed  insanely boring grinding in the game and there is a lot of it. i can love me some grindy games but this ? its dumb as hell. you literally just die and respawn on purpose just to grind the same fort over n over the first 2 minutes into the game. for hours  loot is pointless even with goblin map. junk loot is still junk  punishing weight system for gear giving the game artificial difficulty instead of the real deal  every single piece of armor is horribly designed, not even modders have made any that are appealing  enemy ai has auto aim on melee attacks. meaning there is zero reason to do anything but parry or iframe out. aka jock strap gameplay dont buy this trash. its not even worthy of being up on cs rin."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-11,"elden ring is an absolutely amazing game. it is a fresh breath of air in an oversaturated open world rpg market. with hundreds of weapons and spells to use, as well as new mechanics such as the ability to perform a true jump, and guard countering, elden ring also feels incredibly fresh for returning souls players. when it comes to the enemy variety, elden ring is unmatched. with over 200 unique enemies to fight in the game, not even including the variations of those enemies, you will never run out of new things to fight. and when it comes to the world, elden ring is also one of the best. the world may be open, but it is not empty. there is always something new to do, or to fight, or to find. with secret bosses, caves, and weapons around every corner, you will be finding things for years to come. with all of this said, elden ring is a 1010 game, and i'd recommend it to everyone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-09,"the dark souls series are games that are built around a slowish and strategic gameplay style. they have tight level design whose purpose is to use and test the players abilities with a series of wellcurated levels ending in bosses. elden ring is a giant, dull open world where you faff about for an hour and maybe find a boss but maybe you're just accomplishing nothing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-09,"this game is the best open world game ever made the only ones that ive played that compare is red dead redemption 2 and ghost of tsushima. this game is the easiest out of the souls games that from soft have made but it's still a very hard game but 89 of people who play this game can beat it. but the boss battles make you feel something that most games i've played don't, u feel like ur there and the bosses are simply fun to fight. when u beat game and do journey 2 you should be at a point where the bosses feel like nothing. i'm not a soul's lover but now since i've played this i might just be a soul's lover. 1010 game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-05,"it's not one of the best games i've played so far. it is the best! i played elden ring about a year ago, and since then, i haven't been able to play any other game. from this perspective, yes, it's terrible because it raises the bar to a level that no other game can reach."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-31,i played 3 times again and again and again and again. played with mods which give opportunity play together
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-25,"a fantastic successor to the dark souls franchise, offering a huge open world, countless weapons, spells and incarnations, as well as the familiar great story, locations and boss encounters. a new addition is an optional ghost summon mechanic, that can assist in most boss fights and harder open world sections, so people who might struggle with the steep learning curve or looking for a more casual approach, might find themselve satisfied. sadly i was left feeling, that the game being published a few months to early. the damage and resistance mechanics can be inconsistent and confusing, some items drops appear to be placeholder locations, while dungeons and monsters are sometimes copypasted over the map without rhyme or reason. the typical fromsoftware approach to tell a story through vage npc dialogs without quest logs or map markers in an open world, can let you miss out on some great side journeys, especially by taking longer breaks mid playthrough. that being said, there is an active modding scene, that could offer solutions and the game is definitly worth its price!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-24,"a mystical, big open world game from the maker of dark souls.uncovering secrets, fighting epic bossfights and get beaten. a lot.everyone who says this game needs an easy mode doesnt know what a souls like is. the difficulty is a big selling point."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-23,"the game is perfect, great level design, great art direction, incredible inputs, rich in lore and no handhelding. if you're bad at it, just keep trying and get good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-22,"elden ring is yet another masterpiece created by fromsoftware. the game presents a world that's both serene and stunning, yet it can also be incredibly eerie and unsettling. the graphics are impressive, and i often found myself just standing and admiring the beautiful scenery. the combat system is deeply satisfying it's complex but in a rewarding way, where improving your skills feels fulfilling. while some bosses might seem similar to regular enemies or other bosses, the majority of them are unique and enjoyable to battle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-22,"i can't understand how this game got such good ratings, it  and after 3 times trying to get into it i deleted it again. i guess if you think that dark souls is a good game its for you because its not for any real gamer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,the most beautiful open world ever created. like playing a paintings. the best open world game ever made so far along side botw.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-19,"i spent about 150 hours with this game on ps5 when it originally released. i absolutely hate souls games, so elden ring had a steep learning curve which i fought through, and then eventually ended up thoroughly enjoying it. i saw the dlc was coming out, decided to give it a shot on my steam deck, and now i'm already 50 hours in a second time, just two years later. this game is a masterpiece. the gameplay itself is extremely hard to digest, especially at first, but once it connects, it makes for an experience that few other games pull off. my first time with the game i thought the combat was stupid, but i eventually just ended up accepting it as i ran through the rest of the game. my second time with the game, i am far more appreciative of the skill that combat requires out of you. the second time around, i am enjoying playing around with the builds a lot more. its a very thick combat and build system, but once you digest it, you appreciate the intricacy of it all. i still find the exploration of the game to be the defining characteristic. the game provides you with minimal guidance, and lets you loose into the world. due to the difficulty and learning curve, there is a lot of trial and error in the exploration as well. even on my second playthrough i stumble into an area that is way too difficult for me, so i am forced to either push through it or wander the other direction. i appreciate how there is little guidance, because it creates this feeling where you aren't in any hurry to experience the world  this is something that most games struggle with today. there is minimal hud, minimal dialogue, minimal direction, you just wander. there are times i wish the narrative was a little more concise and clear, but i do appreciate it for what it is. the visuals and atmosphere are another defining characteristic. the world is something unlike what you find in any other videogame. the art design is absolutely stunning, especially after you leave the initial area which is a bit bland. the creativity and imagination required to create a world like this must be impressive. there are no words for the atmosphere and visuals other than its something you have to experience yourself. there are areas that feel so much like you're in a dream state, yet they are fully explorable. overall, this game is fantastic. again, this is coming from someone who thinks souls games are terrible. this is among my favorite games of all time. i encourage anyone who gives this game a shot to really tough it out through the initial learning curve because the payoff is absolutely worth it. its a game that you are in no hurry to complete, and just experiencing the world is part of the enjoyment."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-18,not perfections but as close as gaming is ever going to get. unforgettable experience

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-26,"flawed, but even considering the issues this game is amazing. a great entry into the fromsoftware souls series."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-25,na minha humilde opinio s faltou um pequeno manual ou tutorial avanado para quem no possui familiaridade com este estilo de jogo afinal todos sabemos de sua dificuldade para mim foi uma tima experincia e foi muito intuitiva mas  apenas uma recomendao mas sobre o jogo em si timos grficos boa histria poderia ser mais imersivo e por fim a jogabilidade bem boa mas podiam ter melhorado na movimentao do cavalo.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-24,"dark souls iv open world. the keys of the souls saga are there greatly built bosses, enormous challenges, intriguing and dark plot, and rpg mechanics. it is great. i really like the gameplay, building my character the way i want and improving on the go. constantly learning and immersed in this beautiful and sad world. visuals and sound are spot on, the game feels great to play. i'm mostly always intrigued by what and who i will find and to see the semiopaque plot develop.i don't like it is too damn long, my full playthrough took 93 hours, and i was looking at the clock speedrunning a bit for the last 10. i also think it loses part of the souls charm in its massive open world, giving in to excessive repetition of challenges damn you catacombs and bosses. the greatest parts are its close spaces, the main areas where the big bosses are similar case to the last metro game. also, if i find a character and its sole response when i talk to him is hmmm i eventually give up on all of them. this is a major weakness of souls, obfuscating too much the story and quests to the point in which you either give in to the online wikis or completely ignore questlines. i've had a bit of both in this game. i'm okay with consulting a wiki from time to time to better make my decisions, but this is just too much.summary i'd rather have a semi openworld, featuring half the length of this one with the more trascendental and impactful moments and putting more thought in accessibility and better informing the players to help them take their decisions regarding build and quests. great game even with the mentioned flaws!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-23,"over 250 hours in this game, and it's my all time favourite. i'm so excited for the upcomming dlc. if you haven't played the game yet, i wish i was you. the way i was drawn into the universe, all the ways you can customize the character with the large variety of different weapons, armor and magic.. absolutely incredible! 1010!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-21,"this game is the best thing that has happened to me since the war in ukraine started. this game as well as other souls likes is a real antidepressant and a pill for gaming impotence. the world of ellen ring is exciting, all you need to do is to chop off your brain and just immerse yourself in this world. ellen ring is my first souls love game, i bought it on emotion in stima living in a country where there is a war and a bunch of other nagnitazhuyuschih problems at one point i just snapped and on emotion bought this game, i have not regretted. this world is stunningly beautiful, bosses are made velekopelno, this game literally pulled me into its world and made me forget about the problems for a while, even though russia shelled energy infrastructure and often i just could not play because of blackouts, but it did not prevent me from playing for 10 hours a day. in general, if you have bad thoughts in your head, you are bad morally, everything is annoying, just buy and pass the first boss, i assure you will feel better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-21,possibly the greatest game of all time for me. the game is enjoyable. its difficult but feels worthwhile. it is the culmination of the souls like games over time and just feels complete. i have play this game for more hours than i can count. even if each finger represented 100 hours i'd still not be able to count on both hands. i return to this game over and over and enjoy it just as much as the first time. it's an unbelievable marvel of gaming. i look forward to playing it for more time to come.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-21,"aunque muy influenciado por otros juegos como zelda breath of the wild el mundo de elden ring es uno de los mas fascinantes, y mas divertidos a la hora de explorar. esto y la dificultad de los combates contra bosses y algunos enemigos hacen de una experiencia totalmente enriquecedora para el jugador, no solo ofreciendo diversin, sino tambin un reto superador para cada quien que lo juegue. jkl"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-19,"as a fan of the souls series, i got into elden ring with much hype and excitement which, at first, was rewarded. it has the right atmosphere and the right feeling to be exactly what i wanted. but, for me, the open world formula did not really work for this kind of game. i found myself exploring areas that became tedious and unrewarding, having the story fragmented and less compelling. and the world overall seemed just too large. i like to play this kind of games by always defeating each enemy at least once in order to consider an area cleared. and in elden ring this was a sisyphean task, very unrewarding and it eventually ate away at my enjoyment. elden ring is probably a great game for people who wanted something different or, from what i've talked about with friends, for people ho haven't played previous souls games and had no expectations from it. but for me, as i said earlier, the open world formula did not really do it. i've played it for 100 hours and still didn't finish the story. but, by that point, i didn't really want to anymore."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-07,"no question this is the 2022 goty, its a fantastic open world rpg. but, it has issues with quest lines that you'll never find without looking up. just a tiny bit more quality of life changes, such as a quest log, would solve a lot of issue. no log for their other games was fine, but in something this big in scope needs it. having to remember 23 lines of dialog from a random npc that you can't play back that might be important 50 hours  might need a quest log for that."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-22,"elden ring is a breathtakingly ambitious collaboration between fromsoftware and george r.r. martin that exceeds all expectations. this actionpacked rpg is an absolute triumph, blending the unparalleled genius of hidetaka miyazaki's game design with martin's unparalleled storytelling prowess, creating an experience that is truly  its core, elden ring is a celebration of the very best aspects of the dark souls series, while also pushing boundaries to deliver an entirely new and captivating adventure. the worldbuilding is a work of pure art, with each intricate environment meticulously crafted to the finest detail. from the vast open fields to the foreboding dungeons, every corner of the map holds surprises and secrets that make exploration both thrilling and  combat in elden ring is as brutal and satisfying as one would expect from a fromsoftware game. each encounter is a dance of life and death, requiring precise timing, strategic thinking, and patience. the addition of mounted combat adds a new layer of excitement, allowing players to engage in epic battles with colossal enemies, creating moments that are nothing short of  of the standout features of elden ring is its engrossing narrative. george r.r. martin's involvement shines through, infusing the game with his signature mastery of storytelling. the lore is rich, mysterious, and filled with memorable characters that leave a lasting impact. the dialogue and worldbuilding are shakespearean, with every interaction feeling weighty and meaningful.furthermore, elden ring boasts an exceptional soundtrack that perfectly complements each moment, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene. the haunting melodies and thunderous orchestrations add an extra layer of immersion, making every triumph or setback feel all the more potent.while elden ring is undoubtedly a masterpiece, it does have a few minor flaws. occasionally, the game's difficulty can feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre. the learning curve may be steep, but the sense of accomplishment that comes with conquering these challenges is well worth the effort."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-10,"dark souls in an open world setting just does not work for me. i can understand people who like it in general, but all the 1010 best game ever reviews are just super fanboy levels of ridiculous, in my point of view. i really like ds games, but because they were more dense and linear, so a sense of purpose and achievement was felt throughout the games. and the cryptic npcs were also alright and added to the vibe as intended. but all of this falls flat in er. it looks pretty, but the world is dead and the cryptic npcs just add to the feeling of being lost and not knowing what to do and where. besides an open world, er adds nothing new. very bland, very rehashed, very disappointing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-09,"this game is so unbalanced. you will pass your first 20 hours trying to get equipment and build yourself just to beat the first boss. thing is the game wants you to beat the first boss first thing. even when exploring in the wild the game is super unbalanced, imagine the boss. the game is really pretty, just not fun to play for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-07,"i think this is probably the best action rpg of all time as of now, and i say this not as a enthusiast of other fromsoft game. but the souls formula works really well in this open world setting, the character is highly customizable and there are a ton of weapon, weapon skill, spells and gear that any other game pales in comparison. the only thing that frustates me so much is how badly optimized is the pc version. i get random freeze or framerate drop for no particular reasons and this can be frustrating. fortunately i'm not much into pvp so the impact of those is minimal"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-19,the best game you can start with in souls games is that only at the beginning you can get lost
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-18,"while arguably the peak of the fromsoftware's soulslike genre, the game presents a few weak spots absent from its spiritual predecessors such as repetitively in movesets, bossfight and regular enemy and a few unfair game phases. elden ring obviously outweighs these cons with everything that has always been good in fromsoft's game while also cleaning up errors and improving on these strengths."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-16,"an awesome game. with an awesome world to explore. elden ring was not as good for me as for most people apparently. i love the game, but there was a quite bunch of things that i wish were better. the open world is very good. especially in the first half of the game. the music is very good the combat is good. it has some good and some not so good additions. the visuals are very good. what annoys me is that a lot of things could easily be better if they changed little things. like not giving those laughable delayed attacks to margit. making malenia not heal or make waterfowl dance require a less specific way to avoid it. mogh not having a unavoidable damage that take 3 of your flasksyes i know you can avoid it but i don't think they did it in a good way the mountaintops are bad. farum azula is... okay i think. i just wish that those guysyou know who didn't existed theres the repetition of bosses too. but that doesnt annoy me that much since i consider them minibosses of some sort. all that makes me feel like the game should have been smaller. like 25 smaller. it might sound that i hate the game, but i dont, is one of my favorite games and i love it. the problem is that when you make three 1010 games in a roll. the next one being a 8 or 9 feels like a big quality drop. even though it's not."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-09,"najbardziej rozczarowujca gra, w jak graem. otwarty wiat absolutnie nie przysuy si formule soulsborne, jest nudny i pusty. bossowie nie zapadaj w pami, s poddawani leniwemu recyklingowi. niezmieniony tryb sieciowy jest kompletn porak, co pokaza fanowski mod umoliwiajcy granie w nieograniczonym coopie. mimo e sam gameplay i lore s podobnie dobre, co te w poprzednich czciach, reszta bdw, durnych rozwiza oraz bugi przymiewaj odbir gry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-03,"elden ring is a good game  period, but i feel it lost something compared to previous games from fromsoftware. first the good stuff, gorgeous art direction, snappy combat with a lot of playstyle to suit your fantasybut unfortunately not so balanced, breathtaking moments in vista discovery, and some of the best legacy dungeons. now for the bad stuff, this feels like a wikipedia game, i couldn't finish even a sidequest, and i missed a lot of content that felt too important in my first playthrough like malenia. i don't think that is good design. then there are the recycled bosses.. urgh, ds1 had a handful of bosses but they feel much more impactful and memorable. also final boss wasn't that memorable, and rather frustrating. the open world aspects offer a lot of awe and amazement but also can break the game due to over leveling, under leveling can be ok, sure, but damn defeating a story boss on your first time diminishes the importance of these mythical beings. and talking about some story aspects, i find it hard to connect. it's cryptic in a way that doesn't help it compared to the other souls likes. i felt like a psychopathic outsider who arrived in a world just to kill everything. i genuinely root for fromsoftware and i love their games that's why i am so critical of every detail in elden ring. i hope they learned a lot with their first open world and we will see even a better game with the sequel."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,goty 2022 and one of the best games ever created. a unique game tha needs to be experienced by anyone who calls .
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,"elden ring is an excellent game goty 2022 and possibly the best soulslike ever created. what i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on qtes in combat all the time. the game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. i mean, dark souls 3 and bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. the only 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo 910 and not 1010 are, first, the story is almost nonexistent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and musicsoundsost, could be better. i mean, i played hogwarts legacy and then came back immediately to play again elden ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something. nevertheless, a true mustbuy for every soulslike lover or action rpg gamer in general."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-01,"was never a fan of soulsborn games but the open world of elden ring had me hooked. its far from the let me grab you by your hand formula i usually prefer, but i was able to find my way by following guides online. it didnt ruin the find it yourself aspect of game, because guides only cover so much. you still gotta hustle to get to those places with the items you need. and even after utilizing a bunch of hacks i saw online, i hustled.i didnt particularly like the overly challenging aspect of the game, but allowing me to come up with different strategies, which sometimes means going all over the map just to get one item, put in hours straight of constant  game lacks a system that tells you what to do, which is good because it leaves the door open for exploration, however, without guidance, most players will simply miss on the best things this game has. hadnt i researched online id have missed on the coolest items and bosses.anyway, we all know elden ring is a masterpiece and thats it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-24,"for all the dark souls fans out there, the ultimate game has been made. and as for this being fromsofts first openworldgame, it's amazing. one could critique the random dungons around the map as a weak spot, but it feels more like extra than part of the main game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-22,"the difficulty level, a trademark of fromsoftware games, reaches new heights of frustration in elden ring. instead of offering a challenging but fair experience, the game revels in its sadistic design, punishing players relentlessly at every turn. the joy of overcoming obstacles is overshadowed by the sheer grind required to progress, turning what should be a rewarding experience into a tiresome exercise in repetition."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-21,"whoever says this game is a complete disappointment. you say the game is too hard you need to quit gaming i think. elden ring is not even difficult it's just learning the game's mechanics. the world is beautiful, the main bosses are amazing, the art is incredible and the legacy dungeons are some of the best level designed places to be ever created. get gud. it's an easy game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-20,"this game gave me suicide thoughts, took them away and gave them me again. this is the greatest open world masterpiece ever..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-20,"absolutely amazing visual art design, both for enemies and environments. although the environments are good, enemies got super repetitive in late game dungeon. filled with duos. combat is not very actionbased, most of the time spamming either ash of war or normal attackjump attack. dodge has crazy iframs and is most of the time the main or only solution to enemy attacks. not a combat design that is very indepth, just typical soul game combat i guess. questlines are hidden and very easy to break. will be very hard to finish quests without looking up guides."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-19,"uno de los mejores juegos de la historia y eso se ve reflejado en las lagrimas de los normies que se compraron el juego porque su youtuber favorito dijo que era un buen juego, si nunca jugaste un juego de from software no te recomiendo este juego, no es un juego apto para dbiles llorones que no son capaces de leer una descripcin de un tem o de andar por un mundo abierto sin que el juego te trate como un tonto y te lleve de la mano dicindote donde ir en cada momento, y menos si no controlas la frustracin por no poder matar un jefe, un juego hermoso que merece todos los reconocimientos que se le han dado."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-16,"elden ring steals a lot from breath of the wild  and that's a good thing! the locations are spectacular, bosses are visually stunning and the design of some locations remain best in the genre. everything is so massive, often even too massive. that's the one problem that i want to highlight  enemies and bosses start to repeat fairly early into the game, so i wasn't that excited to fight guy with sword for the 6th time,. the focus on the quantity over quality definitely had a huge impact on the bosses, that are one of the least memorable in from soft history. don't get me wrong  there are some really great mechanically complicated bosses  but i feel like that's not enough for a game of this scale."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-15,"obra de arte, uma nova porta de entrada para soulslikes e eu super recomendo para iniciantes"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-13,"this game already is nostalgic to me like 12 months after playing it. my first playthrough was one of the most rememberable time of my life, apart from taking acid. overall i love the cryptic story and hard gameplay we find in all souls games. 100 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-11,"as a new soulslike player, i'm in love. elden ring is my dream openworld game. i finished my first run within 40 hours, and i am excited for more runs. i keep seeing more bosses and areas on youtube, it feels infinite. however, there are some bosses that repeat themselves in other places. i wish they were all unique."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-11,"with a game so big you definitely make some mistakes, i would have wished they reused fewer bosses and made some dungeons more interesting or focused on fewer levels, the ice region directly infront of the fire giant could have definitely used more work. obviously this game had a very high ambition with the sheer scope and more often than not hits the mark, a couple bosses are not that great i'd argue, but overall it deserves all the praise it gets!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-10,best game i've ever played. these people who call it too hard probably haven't even played it because it's not true. elden ring was my first from software game
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-09,this game is big like really big. way bigger than what you would expect the game to be

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-28,"es un juego impresionante, una barbaridad en el apartado artstico, un mundo abierto gigantesco, por mucho que juegues hay cosas nuevas constantemente, y para nada se hace repetitivo. como rpg es sobresaliente ya que puedes subir de nivel tus armas sin temer que te vayas a encontrar un arma un poco mejor despus de hacerlo, sobre todo porque es un mundo abierto, pero es que encima tienes a elegir decenas de tipos de armas. en definitiva, todo en este juego es impresionante y sobresaliente, de verdad, es prcticamente perfecto en todo, lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda. bueno hay una cosa, y que su optimizacin no es la mejor, pero bueno, con un buen ordenador se puede jugar"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-27,"this game is  ridiculous, i love it, 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-24,"i have approximately 200 hours in elden ring, and it continues to surprise me, even after my second playthrough. it consistently introduces something new and beautiful to me. when i was playing elden ring during my first playthrough, it provided me with the best feelings that a game has ever given me stunning artwork, original npcs, an incredible story, unique lore, a vast arsenal with over 300 weapons, the ability to create diverse character builds, captivating world design, an original and immersive game world, multiple storyline endings, remarkable side questlines, excellent combat mechanics, and a wide range of skillset choices. i could continue praising it endlessly without getting tired. this game truly deserved the title of game of the year and stands as the most awarded game in the history."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-22,"the best game in the history of the genre. immersive artwork, combat, and exploration that you can play again and again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-21,it's my favorite game fromsoftware created a masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-20,its grate but not as good as people make it seam
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-19,if you die without playing this game then ur life means nothing
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-19,the best game i've ever played
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-18,the game is confusing for newbie players in the soulslike genre and it gets very repetitive and boring pretty fast. i dropped it 15 hours in.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-17,one of the best or probably the best soulsgame ever made coz being the 1st to have an open world for a soulslike type of game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-14,"one of the best game i ever played, this game will make you feel like you are a real adventurer in the land between ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-13,"best game have ever made so far from. the bosses, the open world, and the weapons the move sets of the bosses are just amazing the game has a lot of content."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-13,"i have never been one to like souls games. i honestly thought that just like the rest, elden ring would be another game with impressive level design and intricate story, for which you'd have to spend hours on youtube to just understand the plot. 10 min. into playing the game, i was absolutely in love with it. the way the game looks, the npcs, the story, the quest lines, the world of elden ring is amazing and beautiful beyond words. as someone who has spent hours and hours of playing the game, and has all the achievements on steam, i can say that this game is a treat for everyone who likes souls ike games and rpgs. highly recommended."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-12,"it is hard for me to even put into words how incredible this game is. as a huge dark souls fan and someone who loves open worldexploration focused game, this is perfection. stunningly beautiful landscapes. punishing and mechanically complex boss fights. this game has it all and even after 3 full playthroughs, i still find myself getting drawn back in to play a new way on a regular basis everyone experiences games differently, some people enjoy the punishment and others don't i do lol. you can go through the game without using your mount or a summon in tougher areas and get a true souls experience, but with a whole host of options for summoning and making your character more powerful leading up to boss fights, this is also the most accessible entry to date. if you have been on the fence about a souls game, this is the one to try. this game is a 10 for me and while it is my ideal game... its not without flaws and also is definitely not a game for everyone. i've tried really hard to find complaints about the game but most of them have been fixed by now and they're so nitpicky that its not even worth it to me. i waited for this game since they announced it in 2017 and it came through in every aspect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-12,"the most satisfying game i have ever played, perfect to the last minute detail"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-05,"i enjoyed this game so much. i have put around 300 hours on it now on pc ps4 and  game is so open and you can try so many different weapons and magic combinations. it is really fun to just play different playthroughs with different weapons and because the bosses are so well designed you can play all kinds of different ways with them.this is my favorite soul game with the boss design because you can stance break them and make that them fun to fight against.i just love using this spiked fist weapon , so i can use bleed and frost at the same time on the 's also because it is both strong and  the game's biggest problem is that it's a open world where if you are going for a certain build then most of the content is useless it just kind of sad to look at all there is and just saying to yourself. i don't need any of it.this game could very easy be at 10 out of ten if the dlc gets out and become good. just like the original dark soul dlc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-05,"wonder how much they paid the game awards to give them goty, this looks and plays like a year 2000 game, 60 fps cap, no widescreen, no fsrdlss,camera is like someone with parkinson holds it during combat, copy paste bosses because why bother, most of the word is empty, no story whatsoever just like remnant 2 its made to datamine to find out you need to do, combat is worst i ever saw in a game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-04,"60 hours in. just could not get a feel for this game. has no control, complete mess trying to do anything. couldn't get a refund after trying to make it work cause of game time. haven't touched since 2022."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-02,"i feel zero remorse for giving this game a 010. once out in the world, there were very few enemies to fight to gain experience. i was wandering around waiting for something interesting to happen  and it never came. i walked down into a dungeon, thinking i might farm some experience and level up  but the block button just stopped working? oh, but don't worry, it came back after i got stunlocked by an enemy for 5 seconds and lost 34 of my health. f off, this game is the worst from trash yet. i refunded immediately after seeing how emptybloated the world is and that it's just going to be a giant bugfest."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-23,"the state of western games had me borderline depressed thinking were never going to have good triple a games again, but looks like i should have been playing dark souls. there is no badly written story that gets in way of gameplay, no crappy dialogue and marvel quips, you can just enjoy killing and dying because there is some actual difficulty unlike those western games. i've heard some people complaining that its too hard and there is no easy mode. yes there is, its called magic and grinding levels, using magic makes the game around 50 easier. you do kinda need a coop mod for coop which is not perfect and makes the game too easy but i'm still giving it a 10 since there is nothing better."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"although many may complain that action wise, elden ring did not bring anything new to the table, there is no denying that action is still very much rewarding and fun. from software seems to have soften up on their stance, albeit in a much more clever way, of not including an easy mode. to be fair, over leveling can be considered an easy mode or having someone help you, which has always been available through the souls series can always be an easy mode. but now with the spirit bell, ashes of war, and tons of different op weapons, it can easily be said that fs has now incorporated an easy mode. now for the elephant in the room, the open world aspect. fantastically done and quite expansive. i have about 400 hours at the time of this review and in my 4th play through and i still find stuff i didn't find before. talk about bang for your buck. the best 60 i have spent in a longtime. my only complaints and nitpicks is something i have been crying about since all of the souls games and that is the lackluster facial talking animations. at least they are somewhat putting an effort in where the mouths actually move when the characters speak but it is so rudimentary that for a triple a studio, it is pretty embarrassing. i also thought that some of the dungeons were a bit repetitive, something miyazaki admitted was a failure on bloodborne's chalice dungeons which made it surprising that he repeated his mistake. they needed to have a bit more flair to them and something surprising but they were all pretty much the same. wonderful entry into the souls series and if you have never played a souls game i would suggest starting with this one as it is by far the most approachable for all of its easy mode options."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-14,"best dark souls game to date. my only gripe would be its plot, i never fully understand the lore in almost any dark souls game unless i watch a youtube video or look up articles. don't know if it just me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-13,"it's a bit expensive when you factor in the price of the extra controllers, but i guess it's definitely worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-04,"jogo sensacional, um dos melhores que j joguei at hoje"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-13,"finally, a game lives up to the hype! there were some minor stutter issues in the opening area limgrave at launch especially against the tree sentinel boss fight but it seems the more i play frame drops are becoming more stable. after patches, i am no longer facing any frame drop issues. i finished the game with my trusty old 1050ti which is lower than what the game needed but it was really good for the card i was really worried if i could even run it or not but it went out really well!4045 in open world and 60 in dungeons and catacombs indoor mid settingsother than that the world is so gorgeous with beautiful art style and doesn't feel repetitive like most other open world games rather addictive gameplay with so much variety in playstyle there's so many contents to enjoy with some of gaming's one of the best boss fights. and also has so many repeating bosses that i didn't like. the gameplay was refined from all previous games from the studio. finally, the hype was well delivered. can't wait to play dlc expansion! surely it is one of my top played games. personal rating 1010!a must play game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-13,"i played this game in early 2023, and it was my first fromsoftware game. i really enjoyed the main story, although i had to watch a lot of videos to fully grasp it. nevertheless, i appreciated the storytelling approach. the main bosses were all enjoyable to fight and had unique characteristics. the combat, while involving a lot of dodging and waiting for ripostes, still managed to maintain a distinct feel, although it could become somewhat repetitive at  game's world is visually stunning, and despite the graphics not being topnotch, i found the art style to be quite appealing. my primary criticism pertains to the repeated use of bosses in the dungeons. i understand the need to populate the world, preventing it from feeling empty, and i'm pretty sure no one has discovered all the dungeons on their first playthrough. however, i encountered a significant number of identical bosses, even within the main campaign.overall, it's a good game, especially if you're a fan of fromsoftware's previous works, and it also serves as a solid introduction if you're new to their games, as was the case in my experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-12,"muy buen juego de from software, aunque no sea el mejor debido a mltiples fallos, como los enemigos repetidos o que el mundo abierto se vuelve repetitivo a las 2030 horas de juego durando este 80 horas, abuso de dao en rea por parte de los enemigos o el gameplay ya sea anticuado en mi opinin sekiro le da mil vueltas a rodar y pegar. en general recomendable este juego y probablemente de los mejores juegos de from software."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-11,"foi minha primeiro experincia jogando algo da from software e no poderia estar mais feliz. pelo que vi,  o melhor de todos os jogos dela em um s lugar, com mais liberdade e um pouco de explorao. bosses nicos bem criativos, design impecvel e boa variedade de inimigos, apesar de alguns se repetirem um pouco. o que muitos reclamam de no ser intuitivo, pra mim  uma caracterstica fortssima que aumenta a vontade de explorar e descobrir as coisas. 1010"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-10,"a large open world, many bosses, an amazing atmosphere, and plenty of replayability. but in this game, in addition to all the previously described advantages, there are also a sufficient number of disadvantages, such as rather poor optimization, a large number of repeated bosses, and an almost empty open world."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-08,"absolutely loved this game, probably my favorite soulslike so far. the silmarillion vibe setting really topped it off. well done."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-08,"elden ring is definitely a great game. pros for me personally, i loved the lore of the game, the music was very good, the gameplay variety is very good, most of the bosses are very good, the landscapes in the game are great and many other things like this, but you can understand that there are some shortcomings because i gave this game a 9. first of all, the optimization is still not good, there were some lags mostly in leyndell, secondly, you have to research some things in the game on the internet and i think this undermines the game experience secret doors, progress paths, the lore in the game is mostly i understood it from the internet you learn from items and some npcs, but you talk to these npcs, then they go somewhere else but they don't tell you, and if you come across them, you talk to them, which causes you to research on the internet, as in the sentence i wrote before. it's not good at telling a story either. also, those who created malenia swear i died 56 times, 56 times. i died against godfrey 9 times and radagon 7 times. after completing the game, i searched the internet to see if there were any other bosses left. how could i know that malenia was so difficult? i knew the events of the aeonia war, but i killed radahn the second time, and if he is equal to him, he cannot be difficult. i was saying. my life is ruined, but no matter how much i hate the boss fight, the character's background story is the best in the game, perhaps even in souls. i hope he can meet his brother in shadow of erdtree. leaving malenia behind, i have completed the game and the last thing i will mention as bad is the endings of the game. the endings of the game are sooooo weak. i won't mention it to avoid spoilers i guess the above is not a complete spoiler but it disappointed me. i would put elden ring9.210 between red dead redemption 2810 and god of war ragnarok9.910. dont forget she is malenia, blade of miquella and she has never known defeat"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-08,best souls like game ever i think. art is better than every solslike game and its have so much different enemy styles
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-07,"good game with a bad pc launch. game is basically open world with the dark soulsbloodborne formula. some enemies are cool and interesting, many are just unimaginative, extremely repetitive and boring, terrible controls for pc setting up the keybinds, graphics are decent, but not great."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-07,"it's aiight. prefer the original souls formula over mixing the combat and questing in with a ubisoftlike sandbox didn't deserve the praise it got but glad to see fromsoftware finally get the recognition they have deserved in the past, just for one of their weakest games somehow. i guess because it's easier to grind for the casual market being open world like that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-07,"playing elden ring was a huge challenge as it was my first soulslike game experience. i would die a lot and probably way more times than a player who has played even just 1 souls game as this was completely unknown to me. i remember when i met margit, the fell omen and thought it was impossible to beat him... i didn't know what kind of bosses i would meet in this game. what's amazing is that 12 weeks after that i was on a completely different level and i felt like i was the one who was becoming a boss of the game. if you love soulslike games you'll definitely elden ring, one of the best in this genre if not the best!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-07,1010 game but not a 100100 from still has to evolve on the open world formula which is logical because its their first game in that genre
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-04,"elden ring marked my first foray into the challenging world of soulslike games, and it was a captivating journey from start to finish. from software, known for their prowess in creating punishing yet rewarding experiences, teamed up with george r.r. martin, the acclaimed author of a song of ice and fire, to craft this epic adventure. a novice in the soulslike realm as a newcomer to the soulslike genre, i was apprehensive about the notorious difficulty level. however, elden ring struck the perfect balance. it was challenging without being excessively punishing. the learning curve was steep but not insurmountable, encouraging gradual improvement rather than frustration. every defeat was a lesson, and every victory a triumph of perseverance. visual splendor beyond resolution elden rings visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. even without a 4k display, the games world oozes with artistic brilliance. from the sprawling landscapes to intricate character designs, every aspect is a testament to the developers dedication. the world of the lands between is a vast, interconnected realm filled with secrets, each corner a visual feast waiting to be explored. flawless execution one of the most striking aspects of elden ring was its nearflawless technical performance. bugs and glitches were almost nonexistent, a rarity in modern gaming. this attention to detail was evident in the fluid animations and precise hitboxes. combat felt responsive and fair, a crucial factor in a game where every swing of your weapon matters. a triumph from day one elden rings launch was a refreshing departure from the industrys recent trend of releasing unfinished, buggy games. from day one, it was a complete and polished experience. this speaks volumes about the dedication of from software and their commitment to delivering a topnotch product. in conclusion, elden ring is a masterpiece that transcends the soulslike genre. it caters to newcomers like myself while still challenging veterans. its visuals are a testament to the beauty of game design, and its technical prowess sets a standard for the industry. from software and george r.r. martins collaboration has given birth to a gaming experience that will be remembered for years to come. elden ring is not just a game its an unforgettable adventure into the lands between."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-02,"very nice game apart from some aspect thar could have been better, like recycling boss or too many dungeons and stuttering, this game is the ultimate evolution of the dark souls formula"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-01,"now cometh the age of stars i love this game, it is so much fun i have around 150 hours on the game with friends and i still havent found every secret but there are a few little things 9 10 chocos pros  you cant just run through you really dive into the game and have to think about what you're doing. actions have consequences and elden ring brings that across really well.  tactics required especially bosses have to be learned first, and you have to know where their weaknesses are, when to attack and when to keep your distance  the music is very well, the first time that i turn up the bgm  the movement is just addicting i cant stop using torrent  the map design is insane and the fact that everything around the map such as minor erdtree and dungeons are all so useful and travel more around and looking everywhere to find all kinds of secrets. all abillities, spells, incantations and ashes can be found, you get what you see! also from bosses cons  unchangeable difficulty especially concerning boss fights of abnormal dimension  no pause function  attacks blows change their direction during execution, arrows, spells etc. are like remote controlled  most of the time you win fights by mindless tactics like luring out, constantly riding to and fro  as a souls beginner, i have now completely found my way in and love the game very much. and the world offers exactly what makes a good open world in my eyes. the atmosphere and an insanely high exploration urge through varied worlds makes the game my game of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-01,the gameplay and world are outstanding. i personally found the ending underwhelming.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-01,"want to start off saying that i have 24 hrs into the game. i tried multiple times to get into it but every time i quit as i am simply lost in the game. the core of the souls game simply does not translate well into an open world game. with previous games as in all dark souls and demon soul, we were given a relatively linear experience. with a game being linear you can easily make a story that is more cryptic and you do not need to hold your players hand. sadly from software has not changed anything in regards of their quest and story telling making me feel completely lost with no goals to try to reach. characters telling you only parts of what you need to know works fine for a linear game, but when you have an open world and some character tells you to go north to find x thig then really that is as vague as it can get for open world. i am not asking for pointers or marker in the game but rather an option for characters to be more descriptive and precise on what they are talking about as wandering through the same areas over and over again gets boring pretty quickly when you cant figure out what to do next. the world has few unique locations, but a lot of times you will travel through empty fields, come across the same copy paste dungeon with slightly different bosses at the end and same enemy camps that will make you feel deja vu. my orientation in the game was completely broken as there has been very few landmarks through out the world to be able to navigate it properly. overall i wish from software returned to their old game design and scrap the open world as they are definitely not able to put the souls mechanics with it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-01,"without a doubt one of the best singleplayer rpg games. no nvidia dlss or amd fsr, so performance is poor on max settings even with a good pc in some areas ending was disappointing, but other than that incredible game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-31,"this was my gate to souls game and i'm glad. i played it for 190 hours, and i still think i didn't play it enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-31,"while i am not a darksouls fan. i gave this game a try. i am a pc gamer. i am giving this a 910 because the development and game was great overall. the 1 is due to the fact its a controller game at its core. the mouse and keyboard support for this game is abysmal. if they gave us better key bind choices for keyboard and mouse and not limit us to the controller style inputs of key binds this game would easily be a 1010 for me. that aside this game is awesome i didn't finish it completely, but i  at the game due to keyboard and mouse key bind issues and not liking how certain keys are prebound to other functions and not able to split those functions up across multiple keys is a buzzkill and makes the game to hard for me to play on keyboard as i kept mixing up functions that they do as directional but aren't directional on my keyboard. i refuse to use a controller as i don't like hand held controllers like xboxps5 etc. again this game though is amazing and still deserves my praise overall. add better keyboard support on pc port please!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-13,"formulaic storytelling that feels extremely derivative. it was acceptable to a point with the previous titles, but with elden ring, it feels like it's gone past that and now it just feels cheap and lazy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-29,worst of the souls games but still a good game i guess. play when you've already enjoyed the previous
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-26,rpg
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-25,elden ring is of of my favourite games of all time mixing the great soul formula into a almost perfect open world just makes one of the best games ever made
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-25,"this is the game that got me into souls like games. it has amazing exploration and combat, superb music and visuals, just an exceptional game overall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-24,pros  gameplay  graphicsartstyle  story  multiple endings  weapons  characters cons  caelid verdict worth it at first full price!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-24,"great game, amazing world and interesting story, fun combat. i was actually compelled to finish this game, which is rare these days."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-24,"all these one star reviews are from those who have lost grace. they've given up, refused to learn the game's mechanics because of ignorance and idiocy. believe them not they have gone mad. get the game. it's absolutely fantastic. it's flawed, but no game is perfect, but elden ring provides one of the most challenging, rewarding, and satisfying gaming experiences ever, and you deserve to experience this masterpiece. best of luck to you. stay safe, friend. and don't you dare lose grace."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-24,"this game manages to be more generic than the entire zelda franchise. and to be more generic than zeldas, it's enough to be a good soulslikes, that is, games made easy for players who only know how to press two buttons. the game has a universe 100 empty of content. the game simply boils down to killing monsters and repeating the same gameplay over and over again. game difficulty is absolutely 0 like any soulslike, learn the time to dodge rolling and the right time to hit the enemy. okay, that's the generic soulslike game. the story is nonexistent and the game only has a few minor rpg elements, but make no mistake, this is no rpg. graphics are average. the game takes place in the middle of 2022 and the character cannot just go into the water. unfortunately games have become too industrial and it seems that being industrial is overtaking goty for some journalists."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-22,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-21,best game i've ever played. the open world feels filled with things to explore. bosses are beatable by everyone regardless of skill level it just takes willpower.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-20,"talves seja o melhor soulslike ja feito. no sei se vo fazer algo melhor do que isso. from software so erra no boss final, parece q nao sabem fazer boss final. fiz todas as conquistas, vou jogar um dia novamente, talves em outra plataforma ou com uma build diferente."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-20,"great game. one thing i don't like is the world feels empty and lifeless, graphics is not great not bad. but who cares about the graphics? it's souls game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-18,very good game. i enjoyed playing this game a lot. i strongly recommend this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-18,"this game is almost perfect! we can explore the world, we have a lot of challenges to go through, a lot of itens to get and some amazing bosses to fight against. and, oh, i cant forget about the graphics, its really stunning. and as i said, its almost perfect because on pc we still have a lot o performance issues. the game has been released a long time ago, we dont have any patches nor fixes to those issues and thats something that upsets me a lot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-18,"graphics 910. one of the most visually stunning games i have laid my eyes upon. combat 810. a much improved redo of the janky combat from dark souls 3 and bloodborne. attacks feel like they have actual power behind them, and combat now feels much more open with the added jump and addition of a mount. world 1010. the lands between is an absolute joy to explore. every corner of the map has something to do. side characters with quests, secret areas that cover half of the overworld map, massive dungeons that exceed even anor londo in scope, not to mention the massive landmarks such as the erdtrees and divine towers that both serve as visual eye candy, and to point the player in the right direction. fromsoftware has created their most captivating world yet. balancing 510. this is my only complaint with the game. difficulty is all over the place. some late game enemies die in a single hit and give you unlimited runes while there are many early bosses that will wipe the floor with you but don't drop anything useful. strength and bleed builds are hilariously overpowered, while incantations are nearly useless except for pvp. every piece of equipment us fun to use but not all are created equal. story 7.510. gives you just enough information to let you get to know the world while still leaving some things up to interpretation. a strong improvement over bloodborne, which makes you pull up a wiki if you want to know anything about the story. bosses 710. although not the focus of the game, there are some incredible fights in elden ring. margit, rykard, godfrey, and rhadan to name a few. there are a few underwhelming bosses, but out of over 150, most of them are quite engaging fights. overall 910. one of the few recent titles that i am confident to label as one of the all time greatest. elden ring shows how a developer can go above and beyond to fix their mistakes, while still keeping their original vision alive."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-16,"if you persevere through this game and have the willingness to keep trying and keep going, it will be difficult to ever find a game better than this. must play with controller though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-16,gameplay good ai good balance normal graphic good optimization normal story poor characterization normal musicsound effect  good the worst for me is bad interaction between player and enemyies.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-15,"eu demorei mais de 200 horas pra avaliar porque no conseguia parar. facilmente, posso dizer que esse  o jogo da minha vida. desde 2011, com 15 anos, eu tentei jogar dark souls e sempre desistia porque, alm de no ter tempo, eu no tinha habilidade pra isso. achei muito difcil e punitivo, sentia que no conseguia evoluir, pois os dark souls so meio lineares se compararmos  elden ring. logo, passei o resto da adolescencia em outros jogos que me davam uma sensao tima de recompensa por explorar, lutar, fazer as quests, etc. achei que jamais voltaria a tentar jogar um souls like outra vez. porm, em 2022 minha surpresa foi grande ao saber que eu poderia explorar muito mais, sem ser to punido, poderia praticamente explorar quase o mapa todo antes de poder enfrentar o primeiro boss. as mecnicas de jogo, a curva de aprendizado, a ia dos inimigos, a variedade de armas, armaduras, talisms, magias, encantamentos e possibilidades de builds so gigantescas.  muito prazeroso jogar entendam que eu coloco essas classes clssicas do meu ponto de vista de mage, rogue, warrior, paladin, archer... enfim, no h como no se divertir. tem gente zerando com tocha como arma, por favor! depois de conseguir todas as conquistas, eu fui para os outros jogos da from software e consegui completar no s a trilogia dark souls, mas sekiro tambm que venha bllodbourne e demon souls para pc!. elden ring abriu novamente a porta dos rpgs de ao souls like para mim. posso dizer facilmente que o goty foi mais que merecido, o jogo no peca em nada na minha viso. facilmente vai ser um dos jogos, seno o, mais jogados da minha vida. e, sim, eu prefiro ele do que skyrim, podem me julgar."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-15,"sekiro was the first game i got for my gaming pc. i only knew of elden ring a month ot so before launch. pre ordered it instantly. currently stuck on fire giant. i've seen reviews saying you can't out smart bosses and you have to reach certain levels. that's true if you aren't good. there's tons of videos on youtube beating bosses at level one with level one weapons. you choose how you play this game. i've also seen reviews saying theres no side quest, well elden ring does have side quest it's just hidden in the dialogue. and the way i see it, if you play a blind playthrough missing quest just adds to the replay value once i starts new game plus. new gameplay mechanics slowlys get introdued at the start of the game. i've also seen people say the world is bland, well to each there own but fighting new locations in elden ring dropped my jaw so many times. my girlfriend just has fun watching me. the only negatives as is it's locked to 60 fps i used to get a stutter here and there but now i only get stutter if i have my bluetooth mouse on. believe it or not this game has only crashed once, in my over 300 hours of playing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-14,"although i haven't had as much time to play as i would like in order to provide a more precise review, i feel comfortable stating that it's a distinctive game. it builds upon the wellestablished qualities of the genre while also introducing new elements."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-14,"i bought it at release and even 18 months later i keep coming back to the lands between. one of the best games i've ever played, and my gateway drug to fromsoftware games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-14,my body hurt because so lost and nerve i had in game but this was a game i know it had to be 100 master peace
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-14,"it's just a soulslike game like every other, the same combat, same ui, the world and art are cool tho"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-13,"with a stunning and astonishing direction alone, this game is worthy of being hailed as a masterpiece. while the rest may be ordinary, the game's visual aesthetics, in a uniquely gaming way, leave lasting memories for the players."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-12,best game ever best voice over best art design best combat diversity best re playability best game in the world
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-11,"utter piece of trash clunky movement and slowpoke speed moving and attacking bad controls on keyboard and mouse can't rebind most keys no way to aim without auto aim dodge with the lightest armor doesn't give you enough distance coop is a piece of sht enemies ignore terrain and obstacles and jump like rabbits nothing is properly explained you're always starved for money money is used to upgrades everything even your skills upgrades feel pointless game forces you to die over and over to explore little by little very hard to find items to upgrade gear which is what matters the most graphics look underwelming mana prices are two heavy too hard and costly to respec game forces you to memorize every enemy pattern after dying to them, instead of giving you tools to evade getting killed in the first place death is cheap and common people will enter your game and murder you for fun and you have no control over this 30 euros in the garbage"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-11,one of the best open world games of all time. it's an instant classic and an absolute pleasure to explore. from the technical side it's pretty underwhelming though... performance is honestly terrible and the music isn't as good as ds3 or bloodborne.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-08,"clearly the best game of 2022. that being said, it is not perfect this pc port is standard from software quality that is not great, locked 60 fps, no dualshockdualsense support, there is a bit too much enemyboss recycling going on, some cavestombs are just copypaste and not that interesting, endgame turns enemies into frustrating health sponges... but still, what a world fromsoft managed to create! i mostly hate openworld games due to them always being full of boring filler content and boring collectibles, but from got their version of openworld formula almost exactly right."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-07,"this has been the best firstplaythrough of any game i ever had. the open world is beautiful and super fun to explore, easily the best open world we've seen so far. it's a challenging game, but never too difficult to master, and never frustrating because of the high amount of checkpoints. there are also plenty of tools in the game to make the combat much easier, such as summoning other players or npcs for help or doing a mage build. the story might be too difficult and complex to understand for the casual gamer, but it is very deep and interesting. the soundtrack is beautiful and fits the game perfectly. the art direction has never been better. you can look in any direction in the game and it looks like a painting. there are hundreds of weapons, pieces of armor, shields, spells and more, giving the player an insane amount of options for their builds and adding a lot of replay value to the game. bosses have very well telegraphed attacks, making it very fair to fight and learn them. gameplay 1010 combat 1010 music 1010 leveldesign 1010 performance 810 bossdesign 910 art direction 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-05,this game is the best game of my whole life.just play it i dont want to say anything else.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-03,"never played it, but i am excited to give it a try. i like a challenge and elden ring looks like a very, very cool one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-02,"elden ring is an ok game but what is all the hype about? combat is fairly well done but simple, graphics are functional but nothing special at all. adding the coop mod to the game breathes new life into the game. nothing about this game is new, it has been done numerous times before. i recommend it if you like coop and use the mod, otherwise no."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-31,it suffers from stutter and low fps even using highend configurations. it contains all the historical issues present in fromsoftware's past titles.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-30,"this game manages to surprise me over and over again. i've spent over 100 hours on the game, and haven't finished it because i just love taking my time exploring, trying out new charactercombat styles, and slowly revealing more of this absolutely beautiful world. every once in awhile i have to stop and take a screenshot when i find a magnificent view. the difficulty is a bit of a blessing and a curse. i honestly love the difficulty and the punishing gameplay means i'm fighting the same enemies over and over, learning their attack patterns until i can smash them, or just barely eek by. the problem is that my wife will never get to experience the game because she doesn't have the reflexes or perseverance to play through the game with this level of difficulty. since there's no easybeginner mode this will simply be a game that is out of her reach, possibly forever, and that's a shame. considering how just the exploration of the world can keep me engaged for hours, i don't know why it would be such a disservice to the more casual gaming community to just give them an easier option. by all means, leave the default difficulty exactly where it is, but a way to lower the difficulty would at least widen the audience of the game while still providing quite the challenge for those that want it. i've got friends that have avoided buying the game because they hear how punishing the gameplay is and won't even give it a chance."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-30,"anyone remember the end of dark souls 3? about letting the old cycles end and allowing a new era to begin? miyazaki doesn't. elden ring sounds the creative death knell for miyazaki. copying, reskinning, and garbling graphical assets, combat systems, story beats, and more popularized by his own games and past games made by other studios most of which are superior to this for a bethesdastyle cash grab is not what anyone expected, given their reputation. deliberately obfuscating a poorly recycled storyline wasn't enough for them they had to insert mangled vestiges of other games' combat systems via unoptimized code blocks to even claim any kind of innovation. let's not forget the recycled, sparse undead but really very dead open 'world' with next to no sense of physical geography, no internal logic, no emergent gameplay, and no relevant physics. bungling every unnecessary feature of openworlds was their last 'innovation'. map towers, random enemy camps, obvious area and level transitions, unnecessary, repetitive 'dungeons', an oddly ultramodern, but repetitive and tedious interface, a compass and map that handily remove exploration, an idiotic leveling 'system', unnecessary crafting, endless unnecessary fasttravel, a deliberately removed hub area, and an unnecessary mount that trivializes the entire 'world' are all among those features. even the closed areas that don't follow the above tropes are, at this stage, desperately lacking in unique mechanics and even visuals that distinguish them. speaking of visuals, the three dozen or so decent vistas and varied skies across middle earth do not compensate for the hideous 2d trees and grass textures, blurry rocks, poor fx, or the layout of all these contrasting elements in the game world. the flaws of the combat system include but are not limited to endless enemy recycling, enemies are routinely unassailable, lightningquick, and damage sponges, camera tracking, invisible poise, useless armor, recycled animations, unadjusted hitboxes, 'stealth', 'classes', the balancing of every item, ash of war, and spirit ash, the distribution of upgrade materials, only 5070 of the 238 boss encounters are unique, and more. want a better version of this game in all aspects? go for any souls game, or bloodborne, or sekiro. clearly, miyazaki forgot how to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-29,"a game with a very deep lore that you need to explore yourself. interesting and diverse mobs and locations, lots of weapons to choose from. the best part is that this game can be played repeatedly as if it were the first time, because it has many secrets. the downsides are not critical. sometimes the auto levelling is annoying. repetition of bosses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-28,"one of the best game of all time, from software expend the formula fine as hell."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-27,flawed masterpiece. the world is the best looking in gaming history really satisfying exploration and the way the dungeons are scattered really encourages exploration the main bosses are just too great and all legacy dungeons are awesome on the other hand ..reusing bosses a lot was really annoying and prevents me from calling this game the best in history
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-26,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-25,after waiting for so long it really was worth the wait. i've dumped several hundred hours in the game and wish i could replay it all over again for the first time. looking forward to the dlc later.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-24,"um jogo quase perfeito, grficos maravilhosos, bosses incrveis e muito bem pensados, variedade bizarra de inimigos e estilos diferentes de como voc pode moldar seu personagem, desde armas a magias! pra mim, o nico defeito, assim como os outros jogos desse estilo  a carncia enorme de explicao da histria,  muito ruim ter que pesquisar tudo sobre o jogo para poder entender o que est acontecendo! mas de resto, perfeito!!!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-23,every aspect of this experience is perfect in every way possible and this is one of the best games that someone can play. the music and art direction are particular standouts.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-23,"i'm rereviewing this game after originally giving it a 7 because i thought it was too frustratingly hard among other things and i didn't get my moneys worth. now that i played it with the coop mod, i can confirm that this is absolutely incredible and i'm extremely happy to have given it another shot!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-21,"i beat ds 1,2 and 3. i have bloobdorne platinum. bb it's the hardest souls, bosses made sense, there was a specific tactic to kill each boss. elden ring gameplay fails at making sense, bosses are too fast, too strong, they can one shot you at level 120. open world in a souls game is the worst decision fs ever made, you have to google all time where to go next, the world is massive and you are cluelesss about where to continue. invasions are a huge time wasting if you just want to proceeed with the story.  messages from players everywhere, often lies, i never seen it in any other souls game maybe too many zoomers playing er? graphics are impressive and the designs are beautiful. er is an open world grabbing flowers for crafting, pointless dungeons with same cloned bosses and very bad loots, caverns where the final reward is a .... muhsroom. this game style doesn't fit in the soulsborne genre. it is a really boring and disapointing game and the ost is very forgetable compared to previous fs games. definetly very overrated."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-21,"absolute masterpiece. haven't playing something this great for years. the world is insane, i just had to explore every inch, see what's behind the next turn. the way the world is designed with handholding left out, perfect, resulting in a genuine desire to explore. the enemy design and variety is insane, the amount of different enemies, all with their own movesets, design, backstory and place in this universe is hard to fathom. i have never seen a soo diverse set of enemy types. the visuals is insane, don't give people complaining about the graphics any thought, the visuals is off the chart. i don't know how many times i just stood there, looking at the views and vistas. the whole designfilosophy is so awesome, go wherever you want, do it any way you want, but if that fails  then maybe you should try another way, another tactic..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-21,so rare to see games with such a level of quality and detail these days. top tier open world rpg design. goty.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-20,"i'm going to  the people who made this game. how hard is it to add an easy mode? the game is very nice gameplay, graphics, but i can't have fun because of the difficulty"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-19,"like all fromsoft games, the more rewardingly difficult gameplay out there. the story is interesting but confusing, and the way to fill in missing pieces is read descriptions of items, or go watch youtuber's and their lore videos. graphics are solid, you can turn into the moon, 1010"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-11,"as good as they say it is elden ring is the latest entry in the soulslike series by fromsoft. as someone who has completed all of the souls games from demon's souls to now elden ring, i'd like to think i have a decent grasp on these games. elden ring plays like most souls games, the main difference is that the developers have managed to turn a zone based linear formula into an openworld setting and they've done this extremely well. the general gameplay loop is that you go through an area, explore side areasdungeons, level up and beat bosses to get more levels. the game has a lot of spells, weapons and armour sets which means you can play almost anything to your imagination similar to skyrim in that sense. i personally played the game as a spellblade, using a claymore but buffing it with magic and this build took me through the whole game. bosses in elden ring are where, in my opinion, the game shines but also falls a little short. the boss design is excellent visually, the developers have really outdone themselves but when i say they fall short i mean that they feel a little cheesy. what i mean by this is that if you've played previous souls titles, you'll notice that most bosses delay attacks in an absolutely absurd way to get you to dodge early so that they can strike you. i think a lot of the damage the bosses do, especially near the end, is way too high, to the point where it feels like levelling vigour feels a bit useless. it's like they're trying to subvert your expectations but not exactly in a great way. a lot of bosses in the game are fine but you'll know the ones i mean if you play it. exploring the world is where the game is near perfect, there's always something to find, a catacombs to enter, a person to invade, an npc questline to do. if you plan on doing most of the game, you'll be playing well upwards of 80 hours. multiple endings is always a plus, even if some of them are a bit convoluted. generally the game is very well made and deserved goty, with dlc on the horizon too i can't wait to return and see what else is in store. elden ring is definitely one of the greatest games ever made with some questionable boss mechanic choices. 910  endless replayability and a great world to play in."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-11,"eldenring!!!! what an experience i had playing this game! this is actually one of the rare games i missed playing while busy with something else. first souls like game i have ever beaten and the experience is so organic and makes me regain hope in the video game industry and reminds me time and time again that there are good video games that are worth your time. this game is like dark souls 456 all in one game, sure its hard and you die probably over 50000 times, but that is the gameplay. i truly enjoyed playing this masterpiece and i hope either this or god of war ragnarok wins goty 2022! excellent work fromsoftware my steam review elden ring is one of those games you really get involved in, you are fully immersed in the story and the amazing world has so much to offer. the game can be as hard as you want it to be, but the difficulty scaling of this game is a side show compared to the lore that this game brings. this game has revitalised the open world formula that we are so used to and i am so glad to have played this game as it is amazing. some repeat bosses, map could be clearer at some regions, but overall game of the year 2022. highly recommended to anyone who likes adventure games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-06,"fromsoftware just keeps getting better and more creative with their art style, but their bread and butter unnecessarily decreased in its quality and the difficulty feels powercreeped, which wouldnt be a problem were the gameplay perfectly balanced. people seem to love elder ring, but the lack of balance killed the joy in mastering melee combat for me. in dark souls 3, the fast attack is low risk low reward, strong attack is higher risk but still consistent and special attacks were usually tricky to pull of, but very rewarding if used correctly. in elder ring on the other hand, most melee weapons contain an attack that is both the safest and very strong, ruining the flow of combat. long gone are the days you interweaved different attacks, because jump attackspecial attack is always superior. from other complaints, the narration and writing refused to progress. some people love creating their own stories off small environmental details and the little information we get and i respect that, but there is no reason for the more exposed narration like dialogues and cutscenes to be this mediocre. some details or fragments are intriguing, but that is not close to enough when you try to have more of a focus on the story than in previous games. the flaws doesnt make this a bad game, but fromsoftware created an art peace inferior to their predecessors."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-04,one of the only games i got all achievements for. it is a masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-03,1010 one of the best open worlds we had in the past years. its more rpg than final fantasy these days xd
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-03,"actually game is very good, but it's not for everyone! it's not walk in a park with kill everything with few clicks. it's not for ppl. who don't like challenges. there is lot what can be said about this game. in my opinion there are more negativemixed reviews than should be. at first i was kind of frustrated to  mainly because of regular and unexpected deaths, especially at beginning started with level 1. but when you think about it, it's offer you experience like in reality, you should have balls for negative experience and step over it, train yourself and get better, understand how game world works. when you got that games gets better and better. we are used to be heroes in most of games from beginning, attack everything etc. here you need to think what to attack and do you need to attack at all. things that i dislike 1 key mapping 2 cross world notes  game allows you to set notes for other players, so there are tons of left notes and for me they are more interfering than helping, yes some notes probably can help you in some way, like boss ahead, treasure above, etc. but at same time there are tons of unnecessary or kind of spam notes and also almost duplicate notes. these notes, if you chose to read them, also kind of robs you from explorers moments, even if you choose not to read those nots they are there and you already assume something. and third thing about this  these note are illuminated, especially well visible in dark and there was already several situations where i see some light which can also be treasure from hard reachable places and when you get there there is simply illuminated not nothing here .. wtf. 3 impossible to run away from dungeon bosses  this would be ok for most of games, but in my opinion not for this game, not for setup of how this game works  meaning game is hard, you don't know how strong enemy is and how he will fight assumingly like in reality, but in reality you would have chance to run away, would be good and also kind of logic that you can try to run away up to your luck and skill and return more prepared. 4 for good experience big monitor is necessary  i play at 23 1080p and that's definitely to small  not shows everything necessary, especially in boss fights. 5 maybe not so important, but i cant understand why staff is necessary to learnstore spells.. mage without staff is dumb or what? mixed  fighting mechanics, no comments here  not much explanation about things, but i should probably put this in positive things.. you can explore, find out or just google for it  and things i like  beautiful, big world some here wrote that bad graphics.. idk, maybe, i am not so demanding, but for me game looks great, much of beautiful sceneries  open map, you can go explore as you like, there is walkthrough part and as i think it's impossible to get pass those steps, but exploringleveling in between is as kind of open .. anyway you will stay in zones where you can fight and win.. so this also kind oy limits you, but without fighting you can travel a lot  the need to think  open world bosses  etc., etc. it's always easier to mention what we dislike in summary  just for comparison, i would say imagine you are throw in the middle of amazon jungle not actual jungles in game, just for situation and you should get out and have just rough understanding what to do, where to go.. you don't know how strong, poisonous, etc. are monkeys, snakes, bugs, etc., what caves you can find, what will hide behind next tree etc. .. there will be deaths, there will be frustrations.  as i am not used to play games like this, first evening with game was not very positive, but, as for most of people, will to know and see more kept me in game and when you get stronger, get used to mechanics you just want to return and explore and try to overcome challenges that game offers. actually, i think, if start would be easier there would be more positive reviews, i think many gave not so high score just because of hardiness, hiding with other excuses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-02,my best open world game an amazing world that you can not believe how much detail and story is in it . perfect open world game
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-01,"this game is perfect! i give it a 95100 just because in lyndell, my nitro5 was struggling to run at minimum. in lyndell there is a lot of fps drop and you need to watch a video to understand the history, its a little confusing. but for the rest, combat is perfect, exploration is perfect man, exploration is not boring or tedious or repetitive, and each m2 of the map have something good especially items, weapons, sourcery or enchantment, price consistent with what they deliver, very good story if you see a video because it is confuse, wellelaborated and difficult bosses it's not that difficult impossible, it's a difficult that, if you are not prepared, you are nothing more than the boss and even so, you have a chance against the boss even without preparation and without equipment, there is no quest menu!!!! first open world game that doesn't have a quest menu lol! this is beautiful and the quests are excellent and you need to explore the world to do the quests and aren't stupid quests that is deliver a milk or take this for me, it is in the hand of the boss in stormveil castle. to know about things in the world, it is necessary to talk to the npcs and understand what they mean. colloquial brazilian portuguese well inserted in the game, perfect translation with complex words that not everyone knows the meaning in brazilian portuguese. it's very good, i recommend tarnished! i haven't finished yet but i intend to play with all classes. perfect game and deserved the goty!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-24,incredible game that beautifully takes all of the souls mechanics and puts them in good use. most of the pc issues are fixed at the time of writing this review.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-23,"ayoo, by far the best game fromsoftware has ever made. it takes everything good done in previous games and improves them, also an amazing open world and suberb boss fights. there are also so many weapons and spells, allowing you have so many different playstyles. indeed a masterpiece, yep."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-21,game might be fun for souls fans but i didn't like enemy types and punishing gameplay. i can't recommend for casual gamers. edit after two years i returned to give it another chance but no this game is not for everyone.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-21,"when i first played this game i didn't really get it. after buying it on pc and going through every nook and cranny of this insanely detailed, layered world with some of the most fascinating storytelling and means of nonlinear exploration ever  i think it's safe to say i get it now."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-14,"control, graphics, sound and atmosphere is top notch. difficulty scales with time the player dedicates to get more powerful. a richly filled clever built open world with stunning visuals and innovative ideas rounds up this epic journey you will never forget..."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-13,"elden ring is a masterpiece  that represents the pinnacle of the action rpg genre. from the moment you start playing, it's clear that the developers have poured their hearts and souls into creating a game that is both challenging and rewarding. the graphics are breathtaking, with detailed character models and environments that are a feast for the eyes. the story is equally impressive, with a rich and complex lore that draws you in and keeps you invested in the world of elden ring. the characters are wellwritten and memorable, with their own unique motivations and personalities that make you care about their fates. the voice acting is topnotch, with talented actors bringing the characters to life in a way that few games can match. the gameplay is where elden ring truly shines, with a deep and complex combat system that rewards skill and strategy. there are countless ways to approach each encounter, from melee fighters to spellcasters to archers and everything in between. the loot system is equally rewarding, with a seemingly endless supply of rare and unique items that can completely change the way you play the game. but what sets elden ring apart from other games in the genre is its dedication to its themes. the game explores complex topics such as the nature of power, the relationship between gods and mortals, and the importance of sacrifice. these themes are woven seamlessly into the gameplay and story, creating a cohesive and immersive experience that is truly impressive. in short, elden ring on pc is a game that deserves to be played by anyone who loves action rpgs. it's a game that is both challenging and rewarding, with a level of depth and complexity that is truly remarkable. if you're looking for a game that will test your skills and engage your mind, look no further than elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-11,"after fixes and patches is one of the best games ever made , amazing music , amazing boss battles and amazing world. this is all the right steps for fromsoftware"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-11,"elden ring is a true masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of the action rpg genre. with its breathtaking world, intricate lore, and challenging gameplay, it captivates players from start to finish. from the collaboration between hidetaka miyazaki and george r.r. martin to the seamless blend of exploration and combat, elden ring is an experience that shouldn't be missed by any gaming enthusiast."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-10,"it is a very satisfying game. the game's graphics aren't particularly good, but it doesn't hinder the immersion of the game. for firsttime players, the guiding elements of the game may feel unfriendly. however, the tense combat and wellorganized openworld completely offset these shortcomings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-09,the graphics are oldfashioned. dark souls series were really good as each of linear games but this one struggled to be an open world game as all other games do but it failed very badly since the game repeats itself and the ruins the atmosphere. the story is incredibly booring and foolish. mini bosses and dungeons repeat itself too much. very bad optimization the kiss of its death upon all these cons. the end of the story doesn't look interesting and pretty ordinary. it's hard to understand how those who like this game. looks like they have no clue about games or they're just teenagers playing these kind of games recently.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-09,"mind blowing game. the environments, music, monster and boss designs all come together in a modern masterpiece. it is like they combined all the soulsbourne games into a final product that just delivers a fantastic experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-08,"besides being visually stunning, from software stepped up and showed how full of crap the game development world was releasing games with issueslarge chunks of content missing and telling us that's normal. the game delivers on everything, from smooth gameplay to epic boss battles. and nothing is behind a paywall, not a single microtransaction implemented. completing a section of the story and connected boss really makes you feel like you accomplished something in a way most games have lost. there is countless ways to play, with having definite differences in weapons and skills to choose from and so many things hidden throughout the world that if you don't use a guide multiple playthroughs could still leave you missing things. a game that was well worth the money when released."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-08,"one of the best rpg games, dark fantasy, and also one of my favorite games all the time. it's perfect, details, boss fights, enemies, areas, skills, swords, everything. it's hard and if you are fan of soulsborn games you are gonna love it. if you haven't play it then what are you waiting for, go for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-07,"fromsoft has been making the exact same games, except seikiro, for a decade and the fanboys keep praising them for their horrendous design games. i have no idea what they been smoking while saying the game is fun, but the gameplay is utterly . the game is not hard because it is hard, it is hard because the gameplay is clunky and terribly designed. i've been playing it for 10 hours and find absolutely zero enjoyment out of it. the art direction is very nice, i'll give them that. in conclusion, this is the most overrated garbage i have ever played since monster hunter world. game of the year my ass."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-07,don't get baited by negative reviews. all of them are about the bad performance on launch. the game now runs more than adequate and it's easily the best souls game to have been released yet. the easiest 10 ever.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-05,i grow bored of most games after 10 or 20 hours. but these games ... i finished after 102 hours and explored nearly everything. i enjoyed every minute of it right up until the end. date completed 20230605 playtime 102h enjoyment 1010 recommendation so good
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-05,"man, this game made me watch countless videos, just for it's lore. the only soulslike that i have played before was a game called eldest souls and i started to really like the genre. when elden ring was announced, i decided to try it. after this, i just wanted to play and complete all of the soulsbourne franchise. my first soulsbourne game and it will not be the last. what a fantastic ride."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-01,94100 .
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-31,"amazing world and gameplay loop that falls apart in the last third of the game, leading to a disappointing sendoff to a truly amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-29,"rating 810 elden ring is an awesome game and has really polished what the soulsborne games have offered to players, a difficult adventure, with less handholding than most games, a solid combat system, and a promise that you can beat the challenge if you practice. i thoroughly enjoyed this game, from the more fleshed out story with cinematics and more npc dialogue than i remember in dark souls 1  2 the souls games i have played and the more user friendly design explaining various gameplay mechanics to players and the freedom of the open world to level up  come back to challenges later. i didn't love some of the enemies and thought some were pretty annoying, like the big dogs, big crows, the enemies with a bunch of arms, and some others. in general though, the game had a decent variety of enemies though i feel like dark souls 1 especially had more variety and more interesting enemies. fighting the 6th dragon of a different element was a little boring at one point. the standout bosses for me, like malenia, dragonlord placidusax, radagon, and morgott were pretty freaking fun. using the mimic tear summon was my clutch to not bang my head against malenia  lord mohg after 20 tries and i still had fun using it, as a last resort. i didn't really love one mechanic that got me killed a lot, the long amount of time you are on the ground after getting knocked off your horse. that enemies can hit you during the beginning parts of the long animation was cheap i felt and i thought the knockdown duration should be the same as not being on your horse. just a personal frustration. i thought the music wasn't as good as dark souls 1  3 and i couldn't really remember any theme after trying to think of one. the art style though is great and the graphics are amazing. just looking up at the erdtree and admiring it's grandeur always put a smirk on my face d i love that physical  magic combat is so well mixed in elden ring compared to all other soulsborne games. that you can use infusions  whetblades to give your weapons scaling with intelligence  faith opens up so many options for combat, i thought it was brilliant! lastly, the open world was fun for the most part but did seem a bit empty near the end, with little reason for me to explore once i got my best weapons fully upgraded  was above level 140. i explored pretty much everywhere just to see, but i think the developers had a hard time putting valuable rewards for exploration at a certain point, when i kept finding the highest level smithing stones when i already had 5 of each type normal  somber. the areas stayed engaging for the most part  very pretty to wonder through, but i wish the enemy variety stayed evolving to discover new enemies  some story or lore rewards were given in the late game for exploration. overall, this feels like the most polished version of soulsborne to introduce to new players of this series of games. i highly recommend trying the game and enjoying the combat experience  world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-29,"great game. playing on pc with ps5 controller, as i have disfunction in my hand. but it will only show xbox keys. as i'm not a pro gamer, this is very confusing. i wish i didn't purchase it"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-17,this game is awesome! most reviews complain about performance issues that got fixed a while ago. the mouse and keyboard input is bad to be fair. but if you have a controller that's no problem. to be fair i think most people are just frustrated by the difficulty
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-15,"overall a good experience worth the pricetag, but personally a disapointment for a longtime fromsoftware fan. after the release of bloodborne and sekiro, as well as some comments from miyazaki stating that the studio would expand it's portfolio beyond dark souls, people like me were naturally expecting new and innovative gameplay. instead the game meets you with the same familiar combat system from dark souls but in an open world with brighter colours. this has no right to be a new ip, it is even less discernible than bloodborne is to dark souls. on top of this, the trendy open world coupled with a myriad of accessibility features spirit summons, op magic, op status effect, op poise, op weapons, op shields and just generally op and broken minmaxing builds due to poor balancing, a hidden pause button, mixing flask physique, a horse to escape fights, fast travel, as well as the usual ways to help yourself avoid challenge like player summons, helpful items etc etc et al yeah well that just isn't it. people used to say if you used 'x' or 'y' you didn't really beat the game, now there is a whole alphabet of crutches that you can use simultaneously that anyone who tries to brag like this just comes across as newcomer and a clown. elden ring is, for all intents and purposes, baby's first souls game. clearly an attempt to cater to nonfans of their games, which works to make money but hurts your reputation with those loyal players. and here is where things cascade. the large amount of resources spent in developing this open world, that would have preferably been spent on 2 or 3 smaller, better designed games, result in lazy game design in other areas, e.g. reused assets, many identical bossfights, dungeons on par with ubisoft's outposts, an unnecessary crafting system, poor balancing, bosses designed around glass cannon builds that amount to lazer them in 3 seconds or be lazered within 3 seconds and not methodical back and forth rhythm combat, and level design that starts off well but falls head first down a cliff of frontloaded and barren areas. all of these factors, especially the copy pasting of bosses and minibosses, leave a bad memory of the experience, and due it it being a massive open world game, i just do not want to replay it because i know most of my time will be wasted traversing the vistas. on a more subjective note, i did not like the tone of this game as much as any of the previous installments, i get what they are going for but its too 'vanilla fantasy' for me and the art direction is a little mute and washed out with the erdtree being an eyesore that casts the dreaded 'piss filter' throughout many areas of the map. multiplayer leaves much to be desired in the way of covenants, seemless coop and oldschool invasions, open world isnt effectively utilised at all and adding the arenas was a good call but the gamemodes are not well made. they did a good job expanding magic and making it interesting i'll give them that, although it is completely broken and op. in conclusion, i never expected a huge and impossible game from fromsoftware. the long wait and enormous hype generated did not even meet the usual quality standards that they are known for with their previous games. instead our patience was rewarded with this huge hype chasing flavour of the month title that rests on the laurels of it's predecessors. very unnecessary, never underestimate a company's greed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-15,"maravilla audiovisual, grficos hermosos, jefes igual de bonitos y enemigos muy bien hechos, sin contar todas sus maravillosas mecnicas. si os quejis del rendimiento eso no forma parte del juego, comprare un mejor pc lol. y te lo dice una persona que ha jugado a 10 fps poco estables"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-13,"un trs bon jeu qui s'appuie sur un open world solide, avec un design des zones qui russit systmatiquement  crer un effet wahou ! pour moi, c'est a plus grande force, l'envie d'en dcouvrir toujours plus en voyageant d'un point a  un point b est toujours rcompens, et ceux de manire crative la plupart du temps, bravo. voil, sinon le combat system est horrible, non pas  cause de la difficult qui est assez quilibre, voir facile du moment o l'on ne fait que les boss. mais  cause des behaviors de la plupart des  apparemment le mot pe tit est censur ennemis qui sont illisibles aux possibles, certe il y a de la quantit, mais la qualit en empathie malheureusement... autre point noir, la camra. l'un de mes pires ennemis sur elden ring et je n'oserais mme pas parler du targeting system qui zoom au possible de sorte que l'on ne puisse plus voir ce qu'il se passe derrire notre personnage, ou encore la slection des ennemis un peu hasardeuse qui m'a tu plus d'une fois... en bref, c'est un excellent jeu trs immersif, mais qui possde malgr tout selon moi de gros dfauts qui sortent souvent le joueur du flow de manire injustifi et bien brutal. trs cratif et plein de surprise, il n'aurait pas manqu grandchose pour que ce titre me sduise. le moins n'tant pas toujours l'ennemi du mieux, la qualit est malheureusement manquante sur bien des aspects...  a very good game that relies on a solid open world, with a design of the areas that systematically manages to create a wow effect! for me, that's its greatest strength, the desire to discover more and more while travelling from point a to point b is always rewarded, and most of the time in a creative way, well done. so, otherwise the combat system is horrible, not because of the difficulty which is quite balanced, or even easy as long as you only do the bosses. but because of the behaviors of most of the small enemies that are unreadable , sure there is quantity, but quality in empathy unfortunately... another point, the camera behavior. one of my worst enemies on elden ring, and i wouldn't even dare to talk about the targeting system that zooms in so much that you can't see what's going on behind your character, or the random enemy selection that killed me more than once... to conclude, it's an excellent and immersive game, but it still has, in my opinion, big flaws that often take the player out of the flow in an unjustified and very brutal way. very creative and full of surprises, there would not have been much missing for this title to seduce me. less is not always the enemy of better, but unfortunately quality is lacking in many aspects..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-11,"beautiful landscapes  spectacular bosses  extra difficulty plus  the best game in history??? mmmmmm...sorry but nope. as strong points of elden ring, i can say that it is a fairly large world with spectacular bosses and demanding difficulty. it's a game for hardcore gamers or those with a lot of patience. the feeling of loneliness and emptiness in the game is palpable, surprising elements and curious secrets make it feel vast and deep, largely thanks to a visually powerful forgotten world. the truth is that the game's artistic aspect is its best feature. on the other hand, we have a mute and personalityless protagonist, a doll that walks, slashes, casts spells, and not much more. the story is incomprehensible to 99 of mortals. the game feeling is from 10 years ago with gameplay mechanics from 15 years ago, mediocre stealth mechanics, and overall, a technically very basic game. the graphics are not bad, but they don't boast anything extraordinary, and the performance is acceptable one year after its release. if you enjoy the feeling of solitude, isolation, and also like dying a lot, you might enjoy it. otherwise, it's going to be challenging because this game doesn't offer much more. the impact it has had is simply due to the spectacularity and difficulty of its bosses, that's it. i'm sorry, but for me, a game is much more than that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-10,one of the best games i have played. the open world takes a lot out of botw's book but implements it in an amazing way. the amount of content jam packed into this game is amazing and i can not wait for the dlc. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-10,masterpiece. absolute peak of from software games. the sheer amount of content available for the player to explore is absurd.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-08,a game that should have never been made. the fact that this title is so successful has shown how sad the human race is. the game is always punishing you because the whole uniqueness of the game is the difficulty. the open world feels extremely boring and i find myself frequently installing then uninstalling it. i don't want to devote my time to a game with crushing difficulty that might pay of when you win but who's got time for that. how is it possible i love dark souls 2 and 3 and bloodborne but hate this. maybe cause from soft saw how stupid people have become and were like hey let's just make dark souls but open world goty? this isn't even game of the month for me. the game makes you seem like your in control according to its lame story but your actually not. if you love repetition and fighting in the same area a hundred times then finally beating it and doing the same at the next area this game is for you. otherwise please stay away from this lazy cash grab . the gaming world's low standards for video games is why this game was such a hit.

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-05,"there is an incredible level of detail and depth in elden ring's worldbuilding, gameplay mechanics, and overall design. the gameplay itself is challenging and rewarding with a mix of melee combat, magic, and exploration. the world is filled with a rich variety of environments, from sprawling fields to dark and foreboding dungeons. overall, though... it's good, but nothing i would play over a longer period of time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-05,"game is too big, sometimes to a fault. some clunky animations, especially on the movement... and i think that are the only 2 flaws of the game. i'm not even gonna bother to explain all the positive. i think we all know at this point."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-02,"le jeu est incroyable un lore, des combats et les zones de la map de fou, juste dommage du ptit recyclage de boss qui en vrai gne pas"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-01,"elden ring was my first fromsoftware game so i came in without expectations. the game is extremely hard but that's what's makes it so much fun overcoming the challenges. also there are a lot of systems which help with the difficulty like the spirit summons and the npc summons. the world building is amazing. the design, feel, music and atmosphere are 1010. the game is extremely immersive and invites you to explore. i really liked the open world without minimap directions. this is what an open world is all about exploring for yourself instead of being constantly guided from one quest to the next. unfortunately though, this also leads to the point i disliked the most the game tells you so little about what to do and how to do it, that you end up constantly tabbing out and reading the elden ring wiki or youtube videos for explanations. there are entire npc questlines where you would never guess where to go next because the next location the npc goes in an open world is complelety random. i think in my first playthroughj, i spent just as much time reading guides as playing the game which to me is just bad game design. you should not be constantly guessing, there are game design principles for a reason. the other thing i didn't like is that you don't really understand the story as it is told in an extremely vague way. as i said the world building is great and oozes with little details and lore, but for understanding the actual story you again have to watch a half hour youtube video. so all in all it's a beautiful and captivating game which unfortunately explains too little. 810"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-25,"masterpiece! amazing combat, super immersive, amazingly designed open world with a shape that hides its true size. no boring dialogue, no cutscenes, no npcs talking about useless  just pure gameplay. i 100ed the game in a little under 100 hours, and had a blast for the first 90 hours or so. after 90 hours the game becomes a bit stale, especially in some endgame areas that could have used a bit more work. but definitely a worth for your money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-25,"a gloomy world, an amazing atmosphere, enchanting music, swamps and your plaintive cry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-20,"elden ring foi um dos jogos singleplayer que eu mais dediquei meu tempo para entender, explorar e aproveitar e  com certeza meu jogo preferido da fromsoftware.  claro pra mim como essa  ou era pra ser a obra suprema da empresa, e eu acho que de certa forma faltou muito pouco para isso. a direo de arte amassa em sua grandeza belssima mas mantendo a ateno aos pequenos detalhes de seus lindos cenrios. a trilha sonora possui musicas que me marcam at hoje quando escuto novamente. a narrativa do jogo  intrigante e faz um jogador que no gosta de muito texto ir atrs de ler descrio de item sem falar da historia que  muito boa tendo personagens que e fcil de se importar. mas infelizmente acho que a pressa e falta de cuidado ao preencher esse mundo grandioso fez com que algumas coisas sassem de qualquer jeito, oque  refletido nas dungeons e bosses repetidos que deixam a explorao um pouco fraca, sem falar que grande parte das animaes e golpes de armas so recicladas de dark souls 3 ainda sim o jogo  excelente e me marcou profundamente principalmente com a voz da malenia zombando de minha dificuldade em matala inclusive, sobre os problemas de lanamento que andam falando, meu computador na poca no atendia nem aos requisitos mnimos e rodou bem at"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-14,"amazing lore behind the game and good bosses but if you play the game blind you end up wandering around aimlessly and do  all for 2 hours finding  weapons and smithing stones that you already have hundreds of. most dungeons are small with weak and  enemies and minibosses that have been reused 3 or 4 times so that they can fill out a redundant number of 165 bosses. also the good bosses are optional and there is nothing in the game that ever tells you where they are, how to get to them or how to activate it. 80 of your playthrough the game feels soulless and has the personality of paintstripper with a side of a boiled towel. yum. most hype train shills will tell you that nothing tells you anything because its a true open world masterpiece and that you are actually free to do what you want because there is no quest marker and no npcs that even slightly hint at the next destination and how the arrows pointing around at the graces is genius because it does absolutely all. cope"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-09,"it's a solid game with nice looking graphics, even though some animations could be better. the gameplay is easy enough, which makes boss fights fun at first, but it gets boring rather fast, because they are very limited in their move set. the most important part for me however, the story... is rather lackluster. i don't know. i gave this game a try, but so far it's... idk.. meh. it's fine i guess, but it could be a lot better."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-05,"really good game! the combat is nice, and feels like dark souls 3 combat. the open world is detailed and well done because you get a rough direction, where you have to go but it is up to you how much you explore. really well done open world and combat. the story telling may be not the best but personally i liked the story even when it was confusing to me sometimes. the only downside of the game is the pc port but i can not complain because i have 3090 and with that the game kept running smooth but i saw performance issues on slightly older graphics card wich are still powerfull. this should be kept in mind when you buy the game. but this is the only real downside it is such a great game, and i can only recommend it to soulslike fans"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-28,"difficilmente dedico del tempo in una recensione ma stavolta il gioco lo merita. a differenza di quanto detto da molti haters, elden ring  un capolavoro videoludico mastodontico, di quelli che ti fanno riappassionare ai videogiochi. le ambientazioni, le musiche, il desiderio di scoprire nuovi luoghi nella mappa. nessun gioco come elden ring riesce in questo. oggi l'ho completato dopo svariati tentativi con il boss finale e il senso di soddisfazione per averlo completato  ineguagliabile. elden ring  giocabilit pura, poche cutscenes e tanta tanta azione. per chi ha amato i vecchi dark souls l'acquisto  d'obbligo. ma anche per i nuovi va sicuramente provato."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-27,"amazing game, i wish other developers would take note on how a modern aaa title game should be. so much detail, thought, and content is packed into every sq inch of this game its unbelievable. free dlc in 2022?? unheard of! boss battles are addicting and left me grinding for hours even after non stop failure. bravo fromsoft this game is well deserving of goty and deserves the praise it got."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-27,"elden ring is a massive iteration on what fromsoftware began with the souls series, bringing its relentlessly challenging combat to an incredible open world that gives us the freedom to choose our own path."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-26,"elden ring is the first souls like game i've ever played and it did not disappoint one bit. the gameplay is crisp and the game is filled with enormous content. the game does not feed you any forceful tutorials and rather lets you explore everything on your own. the game lets you discovered everything due to your own curiosity and you have to accept the consequences that come with it. elden ring has an amazing leveling up and inventory system in which all categories are equally important depending on the style you want to play with throughout the game. you can put 100's of hours into this game and not get bored. i hope we get more games like elden ring as time goes on because as of now i believe this game can make a case for the greatest video game of all time. i believe its flawless in its own way and if you enjoy open world games, you will not regret giving elden ring a try."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-24,"not just another hit for fromsfotware, but a stellar and somewhat perplexing evolution of the soulsborn formula. as someone who really enjoys exploration and deep combat systems elden ring really checks all my boxes with my only real complaints being regulated to the grindy rpg elements that are present in all rpgs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-20,how to define elden ring in one word?  beautiful good points   the world design is masterful  history and lore  the bosses not recycled are super stylish  the characters are super charismatic  very few bugs must be emphasized anyway  combat and exploration still fun  the rhythm of the game which reveals you little by little unlike a ubisoft game  the constant wonder negative points   recycling bosses  farfetched quest systems and secrets  difficulty too simple compared to another fs because of too many possibilities which allow to pass the too complicated obstacles elden ring is one of the biggest video game slaps i've eaten in a long time. this game is pure hard drugs
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-18,"no ultrawide support, they even went the extra mile to add black bars... that is bad practice if anything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-15,"this trash dark souls like games, nerds talk only about difficulty, but they never played for honor  lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-15,this game is crazy fun and addictive. it is hard. very hard. but it feels insanely rewarding when you beat a boss or a difficult area. the world is breathtaking and the soundtrack amazing. if you beatenjoyed breath of the wild you will enjoy this game too. i am 70 hours in and i am only about a third of the way done with the game. it will give you hundreds of hours of fun. edit i have not played this game in months due to how much i need to grind to be even close to progressing. i hadn't seen much of the grind before but now i do. still a magnificent game but do be aware of the grind.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-08,"realistically i'd give this game a 810 but since it got review bombed so bad, twice, im gonna give it a 10."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-08,good  best openworld on pc  best combat system  frustration and addiction in constant change  there is something to discover everywhere. every part of the open world has recognition value  even in the third run you experience new areas. simply huge!  massive enemy variation compared to other open world titles bad  quest system is not transparent without guides and very frustrating with the huge area and amount of content.  the incredibly good story is told too cryptically  so you have to do your own research here too.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-06,"i bought this game the day it released not knowing what to expect and i've been playing it for a whole year.. the world is mesmerizing. the game doesnt hold your hand like other rpg's, you have to explore and meet wacky characters.. i agree that quests can be a bit complicated but nothing extra hard.. this game really deserves a goty and i do believe that 30 of the people that gave this game a bad score got felled by margit the great"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-04,"this game has the worst combat of any game i have played. it's worse than the first witcher game. all the attack animations are slower than molasses in january. blocking animation takes forever. the game is designed to make grind to level your character, by going back to respawning enemies which has always been cheap and terrible game design. after finishing this trash in 120 mind numbing hours in this slog, i have no idea what the story is even about."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-02,best game ever! brilliant minds made a magnificent game! this is a must play game. this game include a huge range of content!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-28,"how did this win game of the year? firstly, the pc port is bad. secondly, this game is a fever dream. amazing story, gameplay and writing. goty? no. good pc port? maybe. good game? yeah."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-28,"great game. yes, this is the usual dark souls, but it is very large. and very detailed, it is insanely interesting to explore. the feeling of traveling through a beautiful unknown world for tens of hours. one small minus  repetitive bosses. everything else is perfect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-28,"a beautiful game for sure, though cruel sometimes. an interesting fantasy world, that takes much from many places, without making it apparent or dull. however it is a step down compared to previous games, which were undeniably better. the story wants to be played again and again before revealing to you some things, the world is too big, and in the open world the desing is often ambigous. even through the proclaimed westernization of fs's games, this remains a very interesting work that they've done."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-26,still no dlccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-26,"it is not the best game in the world. it's just one of the representatives of a cancerous game genre that appeals to a specific players. it's a game with its own unique genre and it's unique in its gameplay and storytelling. it doesn't appeal to everyone. it's not a game that even every rpg player can play. that being the case, it's impossible to say that elden ring is the best in the world when it's a game with such sharp boundaries, and it's impossible to match the reality of the soulslike genre. those who make such comments have never played another game in their lives and are pathetic enough to think that beating a boss in such games is an achievement. they are also stupid enough to characterize anyone who thinks differently about such games other than themselves as incompetent. stay away from such games and fan bases. waste of time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-26,"as the first openworld game from from software, it's pretty good. when it became clear that the game would be open world, there were doubts and not without reason as it turned out. the game is good and it will give you a lot of adventure, but the quality of that adventure is debatable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-26,a perfect title with immense size and fun packaged into the lands between. with various fine tuned weapons and spells elden ring creates a world that is worth exploring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-25,do not mind the negative reviews this game is wonderful and one of the best of the year if not the decade i platinumed the game and i think i can give my opinion because i beat the 3 dark souls and i say that this game is all the best in the others improved i never played sekiro or bloodborne but i'm sure that elden ring is the perfection of all the games from it doesn't need a quest on the screen saying what you have to do you do what you want without a list and the best open world game in history until so in my opinion
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-25,"elden ring was a real disappointment. it is advertised everywhere with 100100 scores. nowadays, everyone is playing it, everyone is praising it, and the praises won't even end on every youtube channels and game review site. i bought it because it was called as skyrim  breath of the wild many times. but the result is just frustration. it is obvious that it was made without thinking about the pc. it was designed exclusively with the ps4ps5 in mind. gameplay mechanics and combat dynamics did not go beyond the demon's souls game i played in 2009. there is no such thing as online coop. putting this game under the tag online coop is just scam. but hey, who pays money gets the hype marketing. yahtzee actually gave the best review it's a fromsoftware dark souls game, and therefore, good. it is just another dark souls game, nothing more. 5 below average  it may not appeal to everyone, but there are interesting ideas from time to time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-22,such a wow. great game i advise everyone. the free world is what this series of games lacked
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-17,"a great open world and amazing to play once or twice. since the world is so huge it isn't really fun to play more than once though, as it can be quite daunting to traverse the world from the beginning again. still an amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-14,"incredible quality game, interesting dungeons and bosses. not a bad constructed plot, i hope the series will develop and make games more than once every 5 years"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-13,"i am malenia, blade of miquella! bring it on, from software! best developers on the planet! all hope is for the japanese devs! i love u,  ,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-13,"one of the best game in the game history,congrats to the fromsoftware team."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-12,"in many ways the best fromsoft game, but there are some regressions. it plays absolutely beautiful, improvements to spell system, movement, etc. cons  way too big. too many reused bosses. makes those encounters way less special  i found the story to be genuinely completely uninteresting. even after reading up on it, it does not hold a candle compared to dark souls lore.  loot is often just useless for your build  balancing is rough. some parts are way overtuned despite these issues the game is really really good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-10,"absolutely unplayable garbage, and i don't mean the games technics. it runs fine. rather the game itself is bizarrely overhyped garbage. elden ring is a game of pure power leveling. you absolutely cannot improvise or out smart your enemies, you are either at a certain power level and will win, or you are at a certain power level and will lose regardless of what you do. the enemies are all stupid mindless trolls that just repeatedly run over you or are crushed by you, nothing else happens in combat. it is the dumbest combat i've ever experienced in a game, immensely stressful in its stolid, simplistic stupidity. as for the lore and supposed great story with grrm, it's a big nothing burger. there is literally no there there. everything in the narrative is an anomalous grab bag of emo fantasy cliches. the imbecile nature of the game's structure prevents anything remotely resembling fluidity in the narrative. it's a great empty hodgepodge. never before have i so baffled by the praise of something, not even mere videogames. this is the most wrongly hyped trash in history."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-09,"could have been one of the greatest fromsoftware games and greatest games in general. however, it is held back by bad balancing. in the early game you can make a build that completely breaks it but the late game gives enemies so much health and damage that you need one of those broken builds. frame rate and stuttering issues on pc still haven't been fixed making the game look better on a ps5 than on an rtx 3070 even almost a year after release. other than that is a game with incredible scale and even better quality. must be good if i've finished it 6 times"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-09,i have never played a souls like before and was allways scared of trying but this game inpressed me a lot the combat is really fun and the animations are dope and the world is amazing aswell truly a must play
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-08,"i love this game so far. it's exactly what i was waiting for with the next iteration of the fromsoft souls formula. i love the look, the story, and the innovation to the world and combat in a lot of ways. that being said, the openended nature of the game can get disorienting at times, and make it hard to know what to do next. i do have a few other minor gripes, but just like its predecessors except ds2 it feels like the game is fair and always balanced and just requires you to make the correct decisions in the heat of the moment.... until.... the frame rate stutters like crazy for no reason and then you die... maybe when they fix the pc performance issues, i would bump this up to a 9... but i'm taking off 1 due to these issues as, even though they aren't gamebreaking, they sure are dissappointing. for context im running a ryzen3700x and a gtx 1070, and it manages to hold 1080p 5060fps pretty much 95 of the time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-08,"it's really hard for a game to get a 1010... elden ring does everything right but i really feel like the armor designs are lacking as well as a lot of weapon designs, i also feel like there could be a wider variety of moves and combos for each class type side note classes are pointless. maybe i'm just a noob to the genre but its important to remember that this review is subjective and someone else might love the designs and class system because as a whole the game works perfectly and i believe that these cons that i mentioned are all intentional from the developer, it just comes down to a matter of preference. for my first souls game i loved it! trust me this game is amazing and all negative reviews should be ignored"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-07,a very solid 9 but there are many reasons why it isn't a 10 farming is complete bs and always has been. some quests are once again very difficult to follow and you can miss out on great items because of it. some npcs have no purpose in some quests and are a waste of time. crafting is mainly more farming. pvp is decent but there are too many one shot possibilities and mainly it is ash of war spam and not much else. we have the usual happy fromsoft mixture of some good boss fights and some awful. i could go on but overall it's still an excellent game and if you are a souls' fan you will almost certainly have a great time with it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-07,"es un juego que sin lugar a dudas tiene mucho trabajo detrs y que tiene algn boss y algn escenario ms o menos currado. no obstante el mundo abierto est repleto de relleno, misiones absurdas y jefes repetidos que arruinan completamente la experiencia. es una verdadera lstima que viniendo de autnticos juegazos emocionantes como sekiro y dark souls 3, elden ring se vuelva cada vez ms aburrido segn te vas acercando al final. es imposible jugar sin una gua del juego para saber por que camino hay que ir constantemente, que objeto tienes que coger, donde buscarlo, con que personaje tienes que hablar, que puerta tienes que abrir. en ocasiones teniendo que moverte de un extremo a otro del mapa, lo cual se hace insufrible. los bosses la mayora no suponen un gran reto gracias a la capacidad de invocar o farmear. en definitiva es un juego que sera recomendable de no ser porque lo han alargado artificialmente para que dure ms. 0 comentarios"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-05,"e' come giocare ad una versione open world di dark souls 3. mi piace? non proprio. la mappa  fin troppo piena di zone inutilmente vaste in cui si ripetono sempre gli stessi 23 tipi di nemici. zone che puntualmente supero velocemente col cavallo perch mi fanno passare la voglia gi solo a vederle come il lago intorno all'accademia di raya lucaria o la zona enorme della marcescenza. ovviamente c' qualche piccolo punto di interesse pi importante ogni tanto ma avrei preferito una mappa pi piccola e pi pregna di roba interessante. ogni tanto trovo delle catacombe e, ahim, anche queste non mi piacciono. sembrano una versione pi cheap dei chalice dungeon, e quella era la meccanica pi noiosa di bloodborne per me, con zone che erano estremamente simili e con mini boss che venivano riciclati pi e pi volte, qui  lo stesso, seppur le aree siano pi piccole. e c' anche la stessa identica meccanica del trovare l'ennesima leva che sbloccher l'ennesima porta che porter ad un altro boss probabilmente riciclato. il gioco da il meglio di s, a mio parere, in zone pi lineari come il castello di godrick e l'accademia di raya lucaria, con il consueto buon level design di from software e boss unici memorabili. ma la maggior parte del gioco  putroppo costituita dall'open world, un open world che poteva essere fatto meglio, ripeto, con una mappa pi piccola ma meglio studiata, per incentivare di pi l'esplorazione di ogni singolo angolo. il sistema di combattimento  simile a quello di dark souls 3, nel bene e nel male, con qualche aggiunta ovviamente. e' bello dover studiare bene ogni mossa e cercare di personalizzare il proprio stile di gioco ma, purtroppo, sono rimaste le orribili hit boxes dei giochi passati e soprattutto l'ingestibile telecamera che qui, pi che in qualunque altro souls, mi ha fatto morire pi e pi volte. perch? perch il numero di nemici enormi che qui si affrontano  pi alto che in passato, ma la telecamera resta troppo ravvicinata e in troppi contesti fa quel che le pare, per non parlare del solito sistema di lock on che a volte prende nemici pi lontani di quello che hai di fronte, oppure, invece di agganciare un nemico, ti resetta semplicemente la visuale facendoti perdere l'orientamento. inoltre ho notato la presenza di pi nemici, anche non boss, che bishottano rispetto a dark souls 3, il quale era certamente pi bilanciato in tal senso, anche nelle imboscate. tecnicamente il gioco  traballante, non ben ottimizzato. in pi, per quanto i dettagli rispetto al passato siano aumentati, il titolo sa comunque di vecchio, forse perch doveva girare sin dal principio anche su macchine di vecchia generazione. in definitiva sar probabilmente il secondo souls di from software che non finir il primo fu dark souls 2. in alternativa, se dovessi finirlo, passer comunque molto tempo, perch purtroppo non mi sta tenendo incollato al pc come mi aspettavo. peccato."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-05,this is the best souls yet. i love how to game focus on gameplay and you have to search if you want to understand the story.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-04,"i like exploring things and elden ring seems to have lots of stuff i can explore. probably one of the best open world games i've ever played. right next to breath of the wild for me. and i even got called maidenless, which i can relate to since i have no maidens irl although i do have friends, which is even better than maidens in my opinion. that plus you can fight a lobster in which i don't want to get pinched by one so this is a win win for me. so yeah, 910."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-04,"if you are a fan of soulslike genre, just go for it. for sure it has some minor fouls, but hey, it has 94 metascore. just go for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-03,"a great game in all aspects that continues and improves on the achievements of previous games ds1ds3 and so on. glad that the developers decided not to continue the limitation in character equip glory to souls fashions. graphical part of this game looks insanely good, except the fact that game doesn't support 219. the main plot as for same for all souls games is usual deep lore and think for yourself what really happened in main story. and core part of the game is gameplay one is perfect combat system which has been honed over the years. as conclusion every game of fromsoftware inc. became bigger better and complicated and this game brilliant example of this tesis."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-03,"this game is literally up there with zelda, botw and witcher 3. and the biggest compliment i can give to this game is i have beaten this game 3 times. pons  great story but not the best  addicting combat  huge openworld  full of content  amazing bossdesign  breathtaking visuals  so much replay value  vast variety of weapons and builds cons  the bosses postgame feel a lot harder than usual for example malenia this game absolutely deserved goty 2022"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-01,this game is so much fun that i beat it 3 times and there are so many things to do and routes to take that it feels like i have so much more to experience and to do in this game overall this is my favorite game.  great bossesenemy designs  exploring the open world is amazing  really great bosses  really great zones and areas  the buildup in the game  funny builds  really great music  wondrous physick  the pvp's a bit mid  some things are not balanced at all  the starting is a bit bad  mouse controls there is so much stuff in this game also they have a good reason for reusing things because there is so much in this game and it makes the game even better so it ends up being a positive. i have also played some of their other games too.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-01,"by far the best game fromsoftware has ever made. it takes everything good done in previous games and improves them, also an amazing open world and suberb boss fights. the levels are spectacular there are also so many weapons and spells, allowing you have so many different play styles and builds. the online plays are fun, with now arenas dedicated to pvps. truly a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-31,"people like me have wanted an open world dark souls game for a very long time and from software followed through. they did an amazing job with the gameplay mechanics, storytelling, and graphics. if this is your first from software game, please go play dark souls first because this game will slap a newcomer in the face with the difficulty. i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a true challenge and lots of hours for your buck."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-30,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-30,"disclaimer this is my first fromsoftware game, so i'm reviewing it from that perspective. i've played for about 90 hours but haven't finished it yet. i purchased it around christmas 2022, so my experience with bugs has likely been better than that of those who started playing earlier. what i like the world is huge. the legacy dungeons are well designed. the atmosphere is cool. you can tell there was a lot of attention to detail in the world design. the play style is fun even if the controls are a bit weird on pc. there are many ways to play with different builds. what i don't like the story and quests aren't easy to follow. i don't want a game to hold my hand, but this goes to far in the other direction. while some level of challenge is good, there are certain areas and bosses that go overboard. repeating the same section of dungeon or boss over and over until you learn what works gets boring and frustrating. ultimately, there have been too many times that this game has felt like work rather than entertainment. rating this game is overrated by critics. that doesn't mean it's a bad game, but when i scroll through the list of games with metascores in the mid90s, i see a lot of games that i enjoyed much more than this one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-28,"a fantastic player experience, couldn't have asked for more. does a great job raising the stakes compared to the souls series and bloodborne. great innovation opening the world to even more exploration."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-28,"the openworld formula does not improve the soulsgenre, and rather bogs it down."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-27,"my pc rtx 2080super, r7 3700x, 32gb ram, nvme ssd recommended system reqs for this game gtx 1070, r5 3600x, 16gb ram my pc simply cannot handle the game, the performance is awful, even worse than on ps5 while ps5 gpu is an equivalent of rtx 2070. so, there simply no optimization for pc players. issued a refund after 1.5 hours of playing since the game is technically unplayable for me 010"

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-27,"a masterpiece from from software. a new perspective of open world. amazing variability of combat, every weapon has a different skill, different animation, different feeling. besides weapons, there are few dozen of spells. i've played this game over 150 hours and still discover something new. as we know from previous soulsborne games, elden ring have a story telling like other soulsborne games too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-27,"despite the bad optimisation on launch, i absolutely fell in love with this game, i'm a huge fan of from software production and it didn't disappoint me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-26,"from software is raising the bar with every game it makes, this time to the lands between. elden ring, which was recently voted the best game of the year, offers us the unique breadth of zelda's openworld and the compelling atmosphere of the souls genre. even naysayers who are against it because of the difficulty reduction and dungeons that make you feel like you're doing the same thing as you wander through their depths, every one of the gamers will be amazed when they open their eyes in that glamorous land where the majestic erdtree reaches the vast sky. as you and torrent our mighty horse enter the misty forest following a wolf howl you hear, our curiosity will be piqued each time by something else. after defying a gigantic and grisly snake while trying not to be swallowed by the lava in volcano manor, we will be amazed by the sky in nokstella, which feels like a fairy tale. begin your journey tarnished, go and be an elden lord as you like."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-26,"the love that breathes in many of its aspects, compared to many modern games gone wrong, says a lot about this title. if you're a fan of fromsoftware, they've done a wonderful job."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-26,elden ring is of of my favourite games of all time mixing the great soul formula into a almost perfect open world just makes one of the best games ever made
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-26,the low user score is because of bad people who thought they buy a skyrim. but its different than that. its harder and you dont get hold by the hand the whole time. get good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-25,a very very very good game. gaming1010a very freedom open world game although its traveling is not as fun as zelda. its levels decide are very well just like other soulbrone game  story910
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-24,"i just don't get it, it is one of the worst game i have played for a while. performances and portability even with a rtx 4070 ti, there are fps drops! on a dedicated ssd not compatible with wide screen. my opinion the visual aspect and animations are really poor 60 fps cap wtf?? no dlss option menus are ps1 like gameplay i love hard games and complex gameplay, but if you like to be destroyed in chain the time to get some stuff and xp you will enjoy it. otherwise no..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-23,awesome game that has a lot to offer for both people coming from previous fromsoft games and people new to them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-22,"there was a huge amount of reused assets, which completely breaks the immersion. also, due to the open world, you're always underpowered or overpowered, there are only a few scenarios where you're actually playing on the difficulty that you're supposed to. the game is still very fun and the main levels are amazing. i also love the theme better than in ds3."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-22,"great game has great graphics and interesting story, you can go at your own pace and you set the difficulty you can over or under level if you want to make it challenging or just chill."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-20,i can say that this game looks great and i didn't want to kill myself while playing or dying dying dying.. there are some performance issues but i'm sure these problems will be fixed soon.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-19,"it doesn't slap ,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-17,"elden ring is essentially a witcher 3 without plot, lore, choices, developed characters, minigames and soul. it's just a simulator of sword wielding, roll and dodges on empty map with random npc's on it, remembering me of games that me and my friend in 2007 were making on fps creator  we were also taking a random map and also filling it with random enemies. the difference is that we weren't selling it for 70 bucks and we knew that a game requires a plot, and the studio that developed elden ring doesnt elden ring should be a mod of witcher 3 that removes all plot from the games and leaves only enemies."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-17,"there are almost no changes on the game, same thing over and over again. empty open world, there are no physics, does feel like a 2008 game. bad performance, old mechanics i don't even understand why anyone likes to play this game. almost no story telling, you don't even have a proper purpouse. it feels empty and shallow and actually it is easy to play for the open world part you can kill most of the enemies with just doing lapses with the horse. enemies are not clever you could trick them easlly i played 5 hours and killed every boss that i encounter at the first time. the only thing about this game that hard is the comand system and it's hard because it is clungy and slow most of the time and once you get use to it it is easy to kill anything. no impruvements since the first soul game, like i said same thing over and over again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-15,"seriously i do not understand the hype of this game. this is just a mediocrity in all areas. it's trying to be hardcore makes it lack in every other areas. it's graphics are just ok for current generation, it's story is extremely shallow a powerful item will make you a god, go kill some other gods to proove you are  a nutshell. there is no worldbuilding as there are no sidequests, the world is completely empty, there are only monsters with occasional trader wtf?!, the controls are out of this world. this is something that people should be fired for. character progression and scaling is a joke, for 30 hours youre a pigeon, and then suddenly you become a demigod, stupid as hell. there are myriad of weapons, which are not really unique, they fall into several categories and then they are the same, unless they have some special skill which completely changes how the game works, which is another stupid mechanic. i understand that some people might use this title to flex how good they are at difficult games, but this is just a modern super mario, yes, trust me, all bosses can and must be memorized, and then they are easy, exactly like arcade games from the 80ties. this game can feel really difficult at first like all souls games, but after hours of failing it suddenly becomes easy, where you one shot enemies and even bosses with some super build. stupid as hell. i finished it, but i suggest staying away from this game unless you want to become frustrated, it's not fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-15,im a souls like fan  played games like nioh dark souls 1 2 3  bloodborne sekiro ... but this game is super unbalanced even if u explore map  farm in dungen still u cant beat bosses like godskin  higher boss unless u have a unbalaced weapon like that ice staff ... u cant beat game with ur sword game is super unbalanced
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-15,"amazing game is amazing, it's sad to see such upset people, i dont think there gamers. anyways it's a really awesome experience everything should play it. it won game of the year after all!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-14,"in summary, i would like to say that it is a good game. no more, but also no less. the character animations look wooden like 10 years ago. the graphics engine is outdated. 169 only via external flawless widescreen tool and 60 fps lock. weak. the game itself is exhausting and demanding. it's not fun, a feat of strength to get through. a lot of running, horizontally and vertically. thank goodness i had help from the  walkthrough, otherwise i would probably still have been searching next year. the side quests are garbage. the main story is irrelevant. but the cool thing are all the bosses, the battle system, the control with gamepad great!, finding new armor pieces and leveling up is great. the crafting is completely superfluous. all in all a good game. 80 percent. no more, no less."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-12,"an incredible game and achievement. the scale and scope of which i didn't think was possible coming out of fromsoftware. i clocked in 170 hours traversing the lands between from start to finish. i have 2 minor complaints. max level summons made boss fights easier than they should have been. some of them were downright trivial with my summon. my second complaint was that this world is just too dang big with too much to explore. more than once i found myself saying, this has to be the last area. enough already. close to a perfect 10 but not quite."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-11,"truly a masterpiece, everything that worked on previous souls titles was brought here and it was improved greatly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-10,game was amazing. the open world is very big and interesting to explore. main bosses and locations in the game are great. i would definitely recommend to play this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-10,greatest of all. the perfect artwork from fromsoftware. an experience that will never be forgotten and last forever.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-09,"my favourite fromsoftware game after bloodborne. the fantasy and setting makes it like the dark souls games but grander and much more colourful. boss designs are more inspired, regions are fantastic and the general enjoyment is pretty high through out. the sense of wonder in exploration is only beat by breath of the wild. some tidbits really brought it down for me though. i explored this tough dungeon till the end and once i opened the final door i got a curse which removed a character from the game for me. no more interaction with this character, and no heads up as i had missed the interaction point with it. while the character was not important, game felt very lonely after that and i stopped playing for good 6 months. once i came back i was determined to break the curse that would have given me the worst ending and i did so, but this break inbetween over event that annoyed me does bring the enjoyment down a bit. in a world this grand i wish there were more lines of dialogue. malenia or whoever was your companion should have popped up much more often in my opinion or at least given us the option to have some extra narration on top. similairly how the head is at the back of kratos in god of war. i understand that it would break a bit the devastated immersion of the world, but still that's just my preference. all in all great game. bloodborne's aesthetic and gameplay was better though, would be great if they made that one as grand."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-08,"to me this game is just short of a masterpiece. a culmination of everything fromsoft has learned from all the previous soulslike games. i understand this game isn't for everyone, as the game hinges largely on its game play which as times can be legitimately unfair."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-08,"elden ring is a fantastic well written, well designed game that deserves a goty. the game is challenging which is great, hard and smart ai in a good way and combatgameplay is fluent and well responsive the story telling is unique and requires you to read and not be lazy and of course overall this isn't the type of game that holds your hand and spoonfeeds you like a baby which i think is great and much needed in more games ..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-08,"i'm really sorry, but i just can't manage to like this game. all i saw was a pretty world, and some npcs that got me really interested, just to disappoint me later with how poorly written they were. congratulations to the artists and composer, but that's mostly it. just like other souls games, it ironically felt very soulless to me personally."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-05,"the game just felt kind of boring, it looks great and controls well also but there wasn't ant real sense of progression beyond listening to new character talk like a reddit or discord mod tipping a fedora. it looks great and the boss fights are fun, the rest was meh."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-05,"i didn't enjoy elden ring at all. i found the story bland and soulless. the world was so empty and seemed more like an interactive level select screen than a living breathing world, and it had no soul. i don't play action games myself, but i watched my favorite streamer as xe did a playthrough, and the combat just looked bad  jank, over complicated, and i couldn't find any soul anywhere. arkham knight perfected combat almost a decade ago, its a wonder developers are still struggling with it today. the soundtrack was bad, and could have used some soul. you could tell the person who designed the ui has never even heard of soul. there doesn't seem to be any battle royal mod, in 2022, which is just...yeah. do not recommend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-05,"the best souls game i've played, the world is really large to explore, you don't have to defeat a boss to open the map, there are many character classes and many weapons and skills to choose. this is a really good game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-04,"unfortunately it's very bad pc port in terms of ui experience and mousekeyboard usability  hardcoded keys which you can't rebind eg eq in menus  can't use mouse to scroll the map  can't put bookmarks on the map by clicking the mouse  quite often moving the mouse over menus or clicking them isn't registered properly  when you have lock on the monster and want to look somewhere else with your mouse, the lock changes to different monster  multi button keys, which you can't remap to keyboard  inconsistency with menus  you close some menus with esc button, others can't be closed with it and you are forced to press q button  and much more on top of it essential quality of life features missing, like comparing stats of items in the shop with the ones you have equipped. fix your pc port, because it's unplayable with keyboard and mouse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-03,"it's a privilege to be a soul player. and this is the best soul game ever made. it's not a game for everyone, it's a game for those who understands the soul of elden ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-03,"this is definitely goty, a dark souls but open world it's simply perfect! if sonic frontiers is better than this game... i am a buzzy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-02,"story is completely lacking and without cohesion. the controls are terrible and the majority of keybinds cannot be changed. the gameplay and combat is worthless. unnecessarily hard. to the point that it feels like a punishment. i have never hated a game this much in my life. after 80 hours, decided i was stupid to keep playing. deleted. goodbye elden ring and from software can get stuffed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-02,very good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-01,"a great open world with a somewhat unbalanced gameplay and powerscaling still, a very good game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-29,"a masterpiece of soulslike formula. break the greatness of other games with the grinding and cheesy ways to pass through bosses. becomes a little repetitive in the end, even though still fun and playable even for the ones who's not on fromsoft games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-27,"a game that give you everything  challange and consequences , narative , gameplay , a vast open world. it deserves goty 10 times over."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-21,"it's a very delayed review because my monitor broke, but i see that fanboys and those who write reviews with money have raised this fiasco game to the level of unrivaled. anyway, let's move on to our real unbiased review. let's start with the mechanics as always, there is no innovation in mechanics, standard soul games, jumping is added and has almost no effect on the game. open world was added to the game, but mechanically is there such a thing, the answer is no. the game is very big, there are incredibly many castles and dungeons you can visit, but they are all flat and empty inside. let's start with the castles, when you start the game, you look around and see the incredible map and you start exploring, traveling and wandering around in castles that last a maximum of half an hour, yes, you did not hear wrong, the time you spend in castles is half an hour, including lyndell! all of those incredibly designed castles are just images, empty castles with no design inside, filled with creatures and left. when i look at the old souls games, designs like ds 1 anor londo, ds 2 drangleic castle are bigger and more detailed than all the castles in the elden ring game combined. ds 2 had this success despite being a halfopen world, elden ring is a huge empty world full of creatures. the only good thing about it is that it looks great artistically. i have explained the chapter and map designs together with the mechanics. now let's look at the small innovations and whether they have an effect on the game. let's start with the mount, we have a horselike mount in the game, this mount allows us to travel around the whole world, we can do combat and boss fights in some places and it has no mechanical effect on the game. the things we do with the mount are very limited, don't expect something like zelda or shadow of the colossus. when i say shadow of the colossus, they said that they were inspired by shadow of the colossus before the game came out, there is nothing about it in the game. since jumping was added, the platform was expected, which it should have been, but they didn't put it, the jumping mechanics look ridiculous even next to the games 30 years ago. let's talk about dungeons, there are dungeon designs that are so terrible that they compete with skyrim. you enter hundreds of dungeons throughout the game and except for a few, they are all similar designs. we have come to the end of our review and unfortunately elden ring is not a good game at all. the same mechanics, open world game mechanics and design are not reflected in the game, nothing good except for the improved spells. elden ring is the biggest fiasco of this year. 57100 if we come to the score"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-21,elden ring reminds me of silkroad on time! time flies... a great with game with rpg mechanics but i can't be geraldo del rivero. why? i deducted 1 point for this reason. that's too bad.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-20,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-13,i honestly didn't enjoy elden ring i'm kinds sick of souls games but ya no argument there definitely deserves game of the year although i don't see why they felt the need to call the game elden ring its just dark souls with a new coat of paint just call it dark souls 4 or whatever they probably changed the name because too many people would have been to intimidated by dark souls reputation and would have dismissed the game me personally i just don't have the patience for souls games anymore all the dodging and learning enemies moves sets its just a big headache for me i just want to kill the guy and be done with it just like doom eternal all this jumping and switching weapons and waiting for the marauder to flash green it's just a headache look at halo one on legendarythat was a hard game but fun and fair nowadays games are more like halo 2 on legendary jackal snipers everywhere and the moment they see master cheeks they light him up like its the forth of july its just a big headache i like hard games i just don't like the headache that come with them most of the time
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-12,"why is this game so much better then god of war? i notice how every negative review mentions it, and i think it deserved to beat it at the game awards. sorry kratos fanboys, you loose"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-11,"game is good, everything you can expect from a fromsoft game and more. however, after about 15 hours into the game, i can say it runs absolutely terrible on pc even after almost a month since release. i ran the game at mediumlow settings at 1440p and was still experiencing occasional stutters during my whole playthrough of 130 hours. this should not happen given the system i have, and i am able to run other graphically demanding aaa games at max settingsresolutions, so it is disappointing seeing how fromsoft seems to care little about pc performance ryzen 3600 rtx 3070 16gb"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-11,1. the advantage of making exploration fun because there is no marker on the map 2. battle of the soul series spicy taste 3. the unique art and atmosphere of from software 4. monsters' bizarre appearance that can feel the taste of the employees 5. map configuration and directions designed to feel the director's viciousness 6. open world this game quickly captivated me and became one of my life games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-11,"fantastic game. one of the best i've played. has everything you want, an amazing openworld, monsters to fight!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,"this game is skyrim for a new generation, it deserves all the praise it has gotten so far."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,"it's a shame god of war can't even compare to this game. what a shame, but oh well, we won game of the year!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,this game is amzing. one of the best games of all time. these people are insane who are lowing the review score. screw them
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,if you didn't like this game you're an npc normie and you got filtered. keep playing your goyslop jewstation games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,"caused me to finally get the dark souls formula. i've since beaten ds1, ds3, this game 3 times, and demon's souls up next. the build variety and combat in this game are simply unmatched. i can barely stand the mashy combat style of games like gow or spiderman anymore."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,this game is really bad i dont like the combat it is hard for the sake of being hard
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,"an ambitious, challenging, mysterious, and splendidly detailed swords  sorcery action adventure with an excessive variety of environments, monsters, characters, weapons, gadgets, and magical spells to experience. yet despite this variety, the adventure can occasionally feel tedious and repetitive if you insist on thoroughly exploring every single optional region in the certifiably immense open world. most of the technical bugs and irksome game balance issues have been properly addressed in game patches since initial release, so i can now recommend elden ring with full confidence."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,"a massive game that is only made massive by copypasted bosses, lazy design, lazy areas etc. the stuttering and lag on pc's even highend is a joke, terrible port of a terrible game, bordering cash grab territory."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,elden ring is a game that proves how much infulencers can effect people. making a hard game and try to make it look like a good game strategy is should have ended with darksouls 2 but here we are again at this point we should make a hard mario game and pick it as a best game of the year
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,"juega, muere, grindea mata. eso es elden ring. un juego dificil si no pierdes el tiempo, y facil si lo haces."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,"elden ring is a love letter to fromsoft and souls fans. it's combat is addicting. vast amount of choice to play how you want with tons of weapons, spells and items. while new players may struggle to get to grips with the difficulty. they do offer so many things to aid you if you are stuck. even leveling up you start to feel like you can handle something you couldnt even better. overall i'm expand"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,"terrible. no story, no voice acting, just cheap mechanics for edgy players."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-08,i literally don't get the hype around this game... it is so empty and boring. why have so much space with enemies so far and few between... it's like death stranding but somehow worse. how is this game so lauded as being so great?? literally mind blown.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-08,i really like not much in this empty game. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-08,"kill, die, repeat. bland....................................................."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-07,"a true breath of fresh air. not many singleplayer oriented games can warrant endless playthroughs. the amount of depth within this game is truly astonishing, not to mention the crazy amount of build possibilities. unfortunately the overall review score is hindered by inevitable review bombing on this site. i personally haven't had any issues with the pc port. highly recommend to anyone, especially people with prior soulsborne experience. fromsoftware does it again!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-07,elden ring is developed by from software and published by bandai namco games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-07,"elden ring foi uma experincia bem meme desde o seu lanamento. joguei no pc e o desempenho estava pssimo, nos consoles em alguns casos no foi muito diferente. o jogo no me prendeu em nada, um mundo aberto bem genrico e preguioso."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-07,"great game overall. great open world, great gameplay. the game is certainly not for everyone, but if you like souls games you will have a lot of fun playing elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-05,game stutters far to much even after patches. happens the most during fights and around every few minutes. would recommend waiting for issues to be resolved before buying unless you want to play on the hardest difficulty available...
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-02,"best souls game ever. amazing open world, extreme huge world ever seen in a game, astonishing bossesn graphics are extremely solid, incredible environment, despite performance issues even in high end.hardware, still the crown is for elden ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-01,"it was the best purchase i ever made. everything in this game is perfect. the difficulty isn't too high to die from every enemy fart, but it's not too easy either so you fly through the whole game with a weapon that's only half pumped and level 60. a difficulty that challenges you quite a bit. the visuals in this game are also great every time i use magic, weapons with ash that have visual effects i get maximum enjoyment. the bosses all look both beautiful and menacing at the same time. and even when you just travel around the map, your eyes rejoice watching all this beauty. the music in this game is also great. when you fight the boss or just with the enemies, all this is accompanied by great music, which keeps you in suspense until the end of the battle, but you never get bored. in general i give this game a 1010 rating and think it and only it deserves to be the game of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-01,"elden ring is assassins creed valhalla of souls games, bland. finished it 3 times, got platinum trophy and i have no interest to play it anymore unlike previous fromsoft games. pvp is straight up bad, netcode is terrible, lore is meh, bosses are mostly meh or reskins of previous cool bosses, performance is bad, there are bugs and glitches everywhere and balancing in this game was made by disabled chimpanzee."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-01,"very fun and challenging game! i like it, but sometime will rage because i ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-30,"i certainly didn't expect this... veteran dark souls player here and a longtime fan of fromsoft games. i thought that i was going to love this game and that it would occupy my time for many months. i was wrong. the joys of traversing and exploring the open world get old very fast. i was bored of it after only a few days. it takes forever to accomplish anything. essential items are scattered across this massive map and it's such a slog to travel around and collect everything. i really miss the linear level design of dark souls. and for what it's worth, i loved breath of the wild and assassin's creed valhalla. i am not a stranger to open world games but an open world version of dark souls just didn't do it for me. i made it to quite late in the game. i was only a couple hours of gameplay away from the final boss battle. eventually it just hit me like a train and i told myself that i don't want to do this anymore. i just don't. this game just didn't click with me and i would much rather play dark souls 3 over elden ring. edit editing this review many months later. i did go back and complete the game, including the optional bosses. yes, i beat malenia and no i didn't use summons or spirit ashes. i've seen everything the game has to offer and my opinion remains the same. 610. dark souls 3 is a better game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-29,"one of the best gaming experience out there. one of the few 1010 game in my opinion. its a must have! amazing graphics, beautiful scenery, good writing, great combat, memorable characters, intense boss fights, ton of exploration and no bugs at launch at least i havent found one. one minor issue is the performance issues. i played on a highend laptop and i couldnt run it in 60 frames and it was constantly dropping. laptops are probably not the best platform for elden ring! conclusion one of the best gaming experience out there. one of the few 1010 game in my opinion. its a must have!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-29,","
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-29,"elden ring doesn't innovate enough, like the original dark souls, to merit the shower of praise it has received from critics. and it doesn't excel in atmosphere and storytelling in its genre like bloodborne does. without these things, i cannot consider it a masterpiece. what it does do really well is introduce a stunning open world that is filled to the brim with content. not all the content is great, but most of it is of such high quality that it boggles the mind. a lot of people might see a reused boss or animation and immediately rage and give this game a 510, but that doesn't bother me and shouldn't bother you, cause theres more than enough unique content here for anyone who is being sane and level headed. at the end of the day, i can't give this any more than an 8 because once again, by playing it too safe, from software has simply failed to produce something at the quality level of the original dark souls."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-28,"another souls game i tried to get into. its' strong points is a interesting story. weak points is everything else, especially considering how many soullike games are out there. the control scheme is weird, and i don't see why i have to go through this. when i can play any action rpg on hard mode, and go through the exact same pain, but have more fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-27,"elden ring es una joya de la cual supera a la saga soul es perfecto mercancas difciles pero satisfactorias al dominar los controles cosas como la subida de nivel que haces al ganar a un jefe te sientes muy apremiado por tus esfuerzos y decir que es perfecto los es en todo musica,diseos,escenarios,build y historia que se cuenta de forma interesante si se averigua muy a detalle las builds son muy amplias de personalizar lo que lo hace rejugable ms que solo 3 partidas."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-27,"brilliant world building, gameplay, story and exploration. not much else to be said."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-27,bons jeux mais sans plus le jeux on trouve un donjon on entre on tue tout le monde on rcupre a rcompense et on continue
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-26,i love this game. i struggled at first and almost gave up after 2 hours...i watched some youtube videos and saw how many different ways enemies could be brought down and started a new character and ended up playing through the game twice. i am actually excited for dlc.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-24,"incredible game! i'd say it's the best game i've ever played. there is so much to discover and if you thaught you've seen everything, there still might be some secret spots you left out. great combat, beautiful and huge map, interesting and well designed npcs and an overall challanging experience. great choice to spend your next 150 hours with."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-23,at last... an open world game that doesn't hold your hand while ramming exposition down your throat and throwing a bunch of objectives at you. goat 1110 gotta love the dad of war shills review bombing this game lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-23,best game ever game of the year and it is way better than any other open world games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-23,"best souls game i played! the combat, world, level design, bosses, everything so perfect!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-23,"if you rush you can make it the hardest souls game you've ever played. if you take it a bit slower, it will be similar in difficulty to the old games. if you take it very slow and outlevel content it also fits the bit more casual player, although don't think it will be easy. the open world and questing system are the new benchmark for the entire genre. for me it's one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-23,game is unbelievably perfect unfortunately had a rough launch with bugs but those have since gone away this is so close to peak gaming the innovation here is incredible and a great sign for what is to come.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-21,"another impeccable game by fromsoft what can i say, an absolute 1010 in every category, only complaint is more pvp development and better pc port"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-21,"sony's trying to monopolize metacritics via buying user reviews to destroy er reputation and praise ridiculously bad part of gow. i'll judge fairly and hate sony for doing it forever. great game, deserves at least 810"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-21,deserves game of the year better than god of war ragnarok. if this doesnt win game of the year i will kms
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-20,the 2nd best game i've played in my life
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-20,"honestly i wish that they would go back to linear world next time. open world didn't benefit this game at all, at some point there was too much stuff reused just to fill the map. ds3 is overall better but gameplaywise this one wins"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-20,"i'm not a fan of the soulstype games and i vividly remember how bad the dark souls port was, but i thought i'd give it a chance since there was so much praise for elden ring. the result i've spent more time in the character generator than in the actual game, because the controls are so atrocious on pc that it's simply no fun to play at all. you can't rebind all keys and i couldn't even increase the mouse sensitivity to a level where i could properly move the camera. it's absolutely laughable. the thing is, i've learned to live with bad controls and other shortcomings of other games, because the story and overall feel of the game was gripping me. elden ring didn't. the story as it was presented was so ridiculously generic that it didn't motivate me to spend another minute."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-20,"hell yeah, maybe the best game ive ever played haha, but i think a lot of games are a 10 and this game is wide wide over 10 !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-19,"a mi parecer es la cspide de los juegos de fromsoftware. todo es excelente el mundo abierto, el combate, el diseo de niveles, los jefes, los elementos rpg del juego, la direccin de arte, todo. si no les gust el juego y nunca antes haban jugado un souls les recomiendo que le den otra oportunidad. cuando yo jugu dark souls aos atrs no me gust la primera vez, el sistema de combate lo encontraba incomodo, estaba perdido en un mundo que no te deca a donde ir, y encontraba el juego injusto. pero una vez que entiendes el sistema de combate, y logras pasar el primer filtro de dificultad, el juego te engancha de una manera increble. el juego no es malo, solo es distinto a la mayora de los juegos que uno suele estar acostumbrado a jugar, y s, es difcil, pero rara vez injusto. si mueres en algn momento del juego suele ser por culpa tuya, y no por un error de diseo. respecto a los problemas de bugs tengo entendido que ya fueron solucionados, as que no hay razn para que no puedan disfrutar de esta joya."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-19,"sin palabras, un mundo que no tiene comparacin con ningn otro juego, primera vez que siento que estoy dentro de un mundo de fantasa real y no un videojuego"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-19,"i looked forward to playing this game for quite a long time, so in order to be fair i needed first to dedicate a good amount of time to the gameplay. to begin with the graphics and textures are well polished, in a demon's souls manner. however there's a general feeling that some things feel seen already... again, in a demon's souls manner i concluded that's because it's the same engine, which is just natural. designs are just mind blowing! simply find some spots and enjoy the view of characters, scenery and landscapes, it's gorgeous. there are gamers who buy fromsoftware products just for their art and there's a reason for it. mechanics here's a milestone where critics and users differ. they're fabulously implemented, it's another of its strengths. but a few times they feel recycled from previous fromsoftware games, even sekiro, both in the main characters as in npc's. the new ones i loved to see and interact with them, there's so much effort and dedication in them. this contrast kind of begins to weight against the game since their previous games are well known and letting users note this as soon as the first miniboss appears that knight on the horse does add against it, since you feel there's a prequelsequel relationship, which as authors advised, there's not c'mon guys just go with it, let the gamers have their fanlore. nevertheless after some hours of gameplay you realize this is not the trend of the game. which is why it is to be forgiven. lore amazing of course. but we need to draw a line to make different points. the background, as it's obvious for everyone, feels again a fusion of older concepts and newer. but the plot is massiver, dark and sad... classic fromsoftware, classic soulslike, classic miyazaki. here's the signature of the author. conclusion just like in artworks like paintings, poems or sculptures there're points that are alike, that's the style of the author. it's the world in his head that he is showing us. the disheartening feeling, the death mechanics being part of the life itself and the game experience against frustration to direct the player towards resilience. that's the plus you get after playing this game. it makes you grow through the gameplay. the word game is something that begins to feel out of context here. it's not about fun even though its really fun, it's about the interactive experience of being inside the world in the head of the artist. imagine exploring a painting, a song or a poem."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-18,"great game, fun to explore massive world, combats amazing souls combat, and plenty of animals labeled dog."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-17,"if you like dark fantasy, souls games in general, or are a fan of it's granddaddy berserk anyway... why are you even reading this? it's a great game, one of the best. it has it's flaws, surely had them in the beginning and it's absolutely against current mainstream in all ways possible, but this just makes it even more unique. and it's better than ds2, so 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-15,"una obra maestra digno de todo los souls, hablamos del primer souls mundo abierto de fromsoftware y es brutal tanto en diseo como difcultad"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-15,it's literally just a walking simulator except you might have a hammer sometimes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"absolutely brilliant game. not the normal dark souls that i love, but it's damn close."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"masterpiece 9.510 pros everything cons in last few hours, side activities dosnt have new stuff so i rushed throw last hours"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"hikaye anlatmnn olmad bir oyun asla dnyann en iyi oyunu  oyun zorluu ile vnemez samalktan ibarettir.grafik ve mekan tasarm konusunda oyun ok iyi, boss tasarmlar var fakat orda varlar yani baka bir ey yok ne iin gittiini neden ldrdn bile bazen bilmiyorsun.bana gre bu oyun lmekten zevk alan ve 724 oyun oynayp evden kmayanlar iin yaplm bir oyundur.gnde 4 saat oynayan bir insan 2 saatini lerek ve keif yaparak geirmek istemez, geri kalan 2 saatte neden ldrdn bilmediin bir bossa dalmak ile geiyor zaten."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"what fromsoftware did here will be very difficult to beat in the future. you can clearly see that they cared for every single small detail be it the music, the lore, the level design, the gameplay and even the graphics they're just at point considering it's a truly open world. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"10 ,    10.   .  .  .   100   ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"very good, its a soulsgame just improved upon with bigger lore and more broad gameplay opportunity also that its open world which makes it fun to explore and get better equipment use on the bosses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"best game of the past decade. exceptional graphics, very replayable and fun with any build. exploration feels unrewarding enough and some fights feel tedious. but none of that is comparable to the overall experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"elden ring is by far the most innovative game produced by from software in the last decade, culminating all the things they've learned along the way. popping out of the linear game design of the previous titles gives the player base more play on the way they approach the game, alleviating the notorious difficulty the previous titles have had."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-14,"melhor jogo q ja joguei na vida, perfeito em todos os requisitos, super recomendo"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"probably the greatest game i've ever played, and i've been playing for over 30 years. so much joy in exploration and satisfaction in combat. like the perfect synthesis of medieval fantasy and lore in an epic rpg. all the negative reviews are either bots or nongamers who have no clue about what constitutes excellence and can't get past margit or stormveil. the art design is absolutely breathtaking, the soundtrack enthralling, the gameplay is superb. love love love this brilliant work of art!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,it's hilarious watching people trying to review bomb a game as good as elden ring. keep crying horizon fans
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"2022 goty. fromsoftware lo vuelve hacer esta vez suprandose a si mismos mejorando en todo los apartados de la formula souls, una lastima que el fanatismo ciego de unos fans tenga que estropear las puntuaciones de tan buen juego."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"master piece  no other games has presented at this scale and beauty. were vastly drawn into the world once i started playing. in a age where aaa games are filled with micro transactions this game with lesser content, this truly was the holy grace for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"elden ring starts out slowly and painfully especially for newcomers to the souls games. but stick it out and you will be rewarded with a game that is incredibly satisfying to progress in, unlike most other games today. the world design is also just incredible  the further in the game you come, the more amazing world design becomes. it is an incredible game that stands out above everything else made in many years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"from software bestowed upon us a brand new dating simulator where we the tarnished look for a maiden and on our travels we encounter some of the most terrifying, godlike beings in the lands between this game is one of the few games that actually made me cry, suffer and pray. the story is a lonely tarnished10 gameplay 810 visuals 810 music 1010 quality and polish 810. this is a game with an acquired taste, players new to the soulsborne formula will either hate this game or love it, it really depends on their perseverance and your mind and soul's endurance. elden ring is a game that shows that you do not need fancy mechanics, and cinematics for an experience, it's all about how it feels and how the player responds. while it does make use of current technology in the cinematic and gameplay department it is however a little outdated. so i expect the next game to double down on producing a soulsborne game that is purely nextgen, something greater than demon souls remake and elden ring combined. i have played 200hours of this game, and at first, i was sceptical about elden ring as i only played dark souls remastered in the past but when i kept playing i was pulled into a world that i am glad to have experienced and stuck with. this is a 910 game even with early performance issues, and some crashes i encountered, it did not stop me from reloading and playing. good luck fighting gow ragnarok for goty."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,very enjoyable. played 200 hours so far and still a lot of content. amazing boss design with great soundtrack and world building. combat system is fair and diverse. very good game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"artisticamente insuperable, el juego tiene un apartado artstico inmaculado, incluso sus paisajes nos recuerdan a pinturas romanticistas. tiene adems ms variedad de armamento que ningn otro juego de fromsoftware. una experiencia inolvidable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,"in my opinion, this is goty. sekiro was my first ever fromsoft game, after which came elden ring, and i had never played through an entire game with this little handholding before. i understand that's not everyone's cup of tea, and it wasn't necessarily mine either, but i have come to love and appreciate it. the story, soundtrack and extremely versatile gameplay was exactly what i needed, and it's currently tied for my favourite game of all time alongside the witcher 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-12,pc version of the game is as good as the console counterparts but with some performance issues depending on how good your pc is. i played on a rtx2070 and countered only some freezes every 10 hours of play. still a must play on pc or console.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-12,one of the worst games i have ever played in my life and trust me i have played some
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-12,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-12,as a player who got all achievements in this awesome game can assure you that it worth your time. absolutely great new babadzaki  r. r. martin world!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-12,"everything about the game feels wrong. not even a single thing makes me think it is right. multiplayer is buggy as hell, all the functions work clunky, the mount gets in bug, the server connection gets in bug, there are tons of visual bugs, teleporting doesn't work right, quests are not functioning right, etc. some classes are op while some others are weak asf, such as the blade of bandit hits only 15 while the mage skill hits 350 and the scaling makes no sense at all while leveling up. even some little mob can 2 hit you in this game, which is not the problem, but the problem is that these little mobs are coming so often and they have very terrible hitting animations that makes it almost impossible to dodge, block blocking is terrible anyways, and every time you die that makes you walk 3 more minutes to the little mob you died and you repeat that sometimes over 10 times. you walk that reasonless checkpointmob way for 30 minutes in a run. playing archer is over pointless, where you have to get your arrows by buying for an expensive price, since you mostly need around 1520 arrows to kill one weak mob 7545 damage per arrow that only gives you 100 points, which you waste almost 300  600 points to buy those arrows, or you have to grind some 1015 minutes of mobs to replenish those arrows with crafting, which is waste of time while you can do 350 damage with a little portion of your mana. most of the items found in the wilderness give no clue about how to use them, and even if they do they are useless most of the time that feels like just cosmetic roleplaying consumable stuff that wastes your time even more. story stinks from the beginning, is very boring, nonsense, nonclear, chaotic, and it even makes you consider why this game does have a story for real. in my opinion, it could be better if there was no forcing it to storytelling in this game. map design is very complex, it doesn't show anything really, you don't know where you should be or are going. animations are... no comment, really. bosses or mobs don't have a clear attacking pattern, they are attacking very randomly that is hitting you 12 of or the whole of your health which makes you run another 3 more minutes. which is already impossible to dodge or block which doesn't need to be added into the game if it was going to work this poorly. only thing good about this game might be the graphics, the graphics are good, but only graphics doesn't make the game fun while it is suffering from mechanic, engine, and gameplay aspects. conclusion the game is exaggerated after i played and experienced it. this game is for people who probably like suffering, hardcore mental grind, and a game that is unpolished and broken all the way. this game started a genre and popularity that drove lots of indie or developer corporations to make soulslike games more and not even one of them was successful for god's sake. they need to stop doing these terrible gamesetdriven games where they don't success at all. only the fromsoftware games about soulslike were successful, not all of them of course, and yet they were all probably rigged or exaggerated in my opinion. i played all of the dark souls or its copies, and they were suffering my enjoyment, a game was meant to make me enjoy while these were making me get frustrated and wanted me to leave the game immediately."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,one of the best plots i've ever seen! miyazaki is a genius! the most interest gameplay
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"elden ring is another excellent work by fromsoftware, arguably their best game to date, despite the fact that the pc launch performance was rather poor, though it was addressed and fixed soon after."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,story mid gameplay mid graphics mid and honestly if you enjoyed this game idk how its just wasnt appealing and i genuinely like open world games but this one just isnt it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"i love the world art, i love the adventure, i love the boss designs, i love the weapons, i love the customization, i love the challenge but i can hardly know the lore because it's so confusing but still it's a 1010 for me. i played for 150 hours yet still there are things that i want to do."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,the most beautiful game i have played in the last few years. great experience!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,fromsoft continues making the best games of all time. i don't know how they do it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"the game is a masterpiece, like it or not. of course it's difficult, but that's just part of the game. the thing is you level yourself not only your character. but of course that isn't for everyone. don't buy it if you are scared of challenges or like to blame everything but yourself for your lack of skill."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,just made an account on this site because i saw how many bots and subhumans reviewbomb this game. it's a shame. they clearly have to be held by the hand and babysited in the games they play. go play gow ragnarok u filthy casuals! git gud!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"amazing world and combat and enemies. story is sparse and hidden mostly in item descriptions which takes getting used to. ui is a little clunky, but the experience and pvp make up for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"i'm not a gamer, before this game i would only play things like farming simulators and very simple rpgs. after 300 hours in this game, and three different save files with different builds, i can say this is the most fun i've ever had with a videogame. the game can feel difficult, sure. but it constantly gives you options to overcome this difficulty. you can keep trying until you learn your opponents patterns, you can create a super strong build, you can use your summon ashes, or request the help of other players. it's a grand adventure and the sense of accomplishment after you defeat bosses is addictive. beautiful game to look at, too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,best game of the from soft series. gameplay 1010 difficulty 1010 story 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,simply an amazing game and easily goty material. a culmination of everything that makes souls great. magic is more fun and satisfying than ever with great weapon variety to match for melee focused characters. it expands on dark souls iii's weapon arts system and is satisfying to use.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"i was not previously a fromsoftware fan i just didn't get the appeal. after being gifted elden ring, and giving it a try, it finally clicked. this game was such a masterpiece that it caused me to go back and play the souls games. i got all steam achievements for this game and platinumed bloodborne. also just here to counter the review bombers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,"a masterpiece. it took me quite some time to finish it but didn't feel bored ever. i wouldn't place it as high on my list as sekiro which is my favourite but er definitely is high on the list. er is quite different from the usual open worlds, because no hand holding which i quite enjoy.. would play it again with a new character as soon as my exams are over."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,fantastic game worthy of game of the year. other people that are rating it low do not understand from soft games. it's like asking a person that doesn't like seafood to rate sushi. you will never understand the nuances and the masterfully crafted world if you expect easy mode handholding. once you embrace it you will then appreciate its majesty
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,only bad side is it makes other games feel incomplete. it will take game of the year and nothing will change that.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-10,"this game made me feel like a kid again. i had gotten to a point where i enjoyed playing video games but they didn't hit in the way that ocarina of time or majora's mask did when i was younger. the sheer awe and wonder i felt exploring new areas, and the fear and anticipation of not knowing what you'd face next. it's a game you know is going to be hard, but is so fun you run straight into danger."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-10,"pros   combat is top notch  the art style is very impressive  the world is absolutely beautiful  the world is huge. there are several big areas and also subterranean areas which are also huge!  coop is extremely fun  unique, dark and mysterious atmosphere cons   story , actually it is really poor and 95 of the time you will be fighting and dont care about the story. also, the story is very confusing  open world feels like empty filler sometimes and serves no purpose in many areas  copypaste bosses  basically dark souls 4 but with other item names. there is nothing really new here  game is extremely long with reused assets. half the size and less copypaste would have been beeter  there is quite a number of unfair cheap bosses, unfortunately also the last bosses malenia, elden beast. boss design was better in ds3 overall a very good game, but it is not groundbreaking or innovative."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-08,"i started playing with my friends at launch but we quickly lost interest in the game which weird because all of us are big soulsborne fans. however i recently found myself bored during quarantine and tried it again and was shocked. now i don't get why we dropped the game. i played trough it three times now and got one of my mates to finish it as well. i believe what turned us off the first time was the open world aspect but now it is one of the strongest points in my opinion. i particularly enjoyed the bosses in the later half of the game, when  really starts picking up. i get that some people are annoyed at the amount of recycled bosses and areas, and i get it. but i also dont mind it, as it makes sense in the context of the world of elden ring. the music is awesome, the amount of variety is great and the combat system is once again top notch. i gotta admit however that the pvp which was the most enjoyable thing in past souls games to me is really not my cup of tea. the netcode is bad to a point where some weapons are almost unusable in pvp i played with rogiers rapier for almost the entire game but its not made for pvp the open world and the fact that torrent becomes unavailable in pvp means people can hide in almost unreachable places, which makes invasions incredibly frustrating and a few more minor issues stopped me from pvping altogether. however overall it is one of the best games fromsoft ever made and an absolute recommendation from me. especially to people who are new to fromsoft games, as i found it very beginner friendly. crafting seemed useless to me at first but proved to come in handy from time to time. plus the fact that there are crafting materials everywhere made exploring the world feel more rewarding. its definitely game of the year contender and one of the best singleplayer games of all time."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-07,one of the most incredible games ive ever played. source i have over 300 hours.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-06,"this game deserves to be called a masterpiece. i had no technical difficulties what so ever. i do understand that this is definitely a big problem for some, but i can only speak for myself and i had no performance issues at all. sure the formula of the game itself stays the same, it sure feels like and open world darksouls just with some new and refreshing features. but those features are great. the world itself is awesome and just invites you to explore it. the music, the graphics, the boss fights are so immersive. the whole world is, it just sinks you in. and there is so much to discover. hidden worlds and areas, secrets, different endings. completed it within 80 hours. a must play for every rpg and soulslike fan!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-05,"un juego excelente en casi todo lo que propone, uno pensara que el mundo abierto no le caera bien a la saga, pero a decir verdad han sabido adaptarlo muy bien. como en todos los souls lanzados en pc el rendimiento no suele ser del todo consistente, pero son contadas las ocasiones en las que falla. si tuviera que darle un punto negativo ese sera el reciclaje de jefes, hay varios de estos que se repiten demasiadas veces. fuera de eso es un juego casi perfecto y un absoluto imprescindible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-04,"equipo i7, 8gb ram ddr4, gtx 1050 2gb, ssd. 1900x1080 medioalto. rendimiento bastante bueno y fluido a excepcin de las zonas ms exigentes donde se dieron puntuales cadas a 20 fps slo en calidad alta. horas en completar la primera partida 50 horas. dificultad es al mismo tiempo el ms fcil y el ms difcil de todos los juegos de from software. incluye zonas de dificultad irrisoria frente a enemigos absurdamente difciles e injustos comparado con los estndares de from software. bugs y fallos en toda la partida slo encontr un fallo cuando el caballo se qued atascado en un sitio. en 50 horas el juego se sali al escritorio un total de 15 o 20 veces situaciones al azar. ninguna accin en concreto provocaba errores. seguramente problema del pc. el error ms comn era que el caballo y algunos enemigos se volvan invisibles en algunos momentos. no muy molesto y nunca con jefes o enemigos nicos. elden ring coge toda la experiencia acumulada por from software hasta la fecha y lo combina en un juego titnico con guios e inspiracin tomados de los juegos anteriores de la compaa. al que ms se parece en mecnicas y desarrollo del pj, a mi modo de ver, es a ds3. sin embargo, ms es menos en este caso. el vasto mundo se hace abrumador y pesado por momentos y al estar tan lleno de contenido pierde la pica nica de los juegos anteriores. en elden ring no encontraremos enemigos capaces de dejar huella como father gascoigne, lady butterfly o sister friede. por el contrario elden ring incluye enemigos difciles pero planos barras de vida enormes, dao absurdo, demasiados ataques ineludibles, de rea o capaces de matar de un golpe cualidades que a mi modo de ver no hacen un buen combate. en sekiro, por ejemplo, los combates eran endiabladamente difciles pero a la vez brindaban un duelo justo donde lo nico que influa era la habilidad del jugador. elden ring sin embargo est plagado de muertes injustas y absurdas incluso para el mundo al que nos tiene acostumbrados miyazaki. se recomienda su compra s, incluso por 40 o 50 euros pero matizando que antes de comprar elden ring considero que ds3, sekiro o bloodborne son mejores inversiones en caso de no haberlos jugado con anterioridad. por ltimo para aquellos que encontris los juegos de fs muy difciles o queris trastear y probar diferentes personajes o armas siempre podis utilizar wemod y cheat engine importante nunca uses cheats o mods en una partida real de un juego de from software o sers baneado. si utilizas herramientas de modificacin o trucos crea siempre una partida nueva, haz un backup de tus saves antiguas y juega siempre offline. antes de regresar al online elimina todos los datos guardados sobre las partidas modificadas. de esta manera no incurriremos en una infraccin y mantendremos el juego limpio de trampas y ventajas en la comunidad online."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-03,same combat mechanics for 13 years already 2009 just added with a open world more like open field...
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-03,"if you are new to souls like games or not its simple the top 3 souls like game for sure, but you need the minimum requirements to play the game to have a good experience"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-03,overhyped game that feels the same like previous souls demos bloodborne games just add an open world and throw bosses and quests randomly.....
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-02,the only souls game i have played and it is a great experience. the open world is crazy looking too.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-31,"this game pretty much defined what users should expect from aaa games. no microtransactions, no lootboxes. everything about this game is near perfect. we need to expect this level of quality from devs from now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-29,"it's the most fun open world game ever played, the ultimate embodiment of the dark souls series"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-29,no ultrawide support on a 2022 pc game and still no patch to give ultrawide support! wtf were they thinking to release with no ultrawide support for a pc game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-28,there's a huge amount of bosses that look amazing and creepy but the gameplay  inconsistency of the bosses gets a bit annoying overtime.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-27,"it is not a souls game. what a souls game for fans of the series is? it is a neverending sense of constant threat, claustrophobic feeling of imminent danger around the corner, sense of loneliness, a permanent mazelike feeling and happiness when finding a shortcut. there is nothing lake that in er. in bloodborne i wanted to open every door and pick into every window in every location, in er i just want to the open world to end and find a castle, or a village or something to explore. souls games are know for insane amount of details concentrated in average sized locations. when you transfer these details to an open world they are non existent anymore. elden ring also lacks music and atmosphere. do you remember the goosebumps moonlit melody gave you when visiting hunters dream in bb? do you remember the incredible atmosphere in sekiro created by music? you will not hear anything like that masterpiece in er. lets be honest alright? turn the music off in witcher 3, any elder scrolls game, rdr2 etc etc...half of your joy and pleasure from playing the game will vanish. creating an open world for er which is mostly empty btw they totally forgot to add decent music to it and therefore no atmosphere is in the game. bosses are dull, sidequests are almost impossible to start or finish without checking on internet, insane amount of items just brings confusion and does not really add diversity to gameplay. overall it could have been a veryvery good game if devs just made it 2 times smaller, removed fast travel mechanics made us travel only from bonfires. and dear devs, please, stop adding grotesque british accent to every npc in the game. it really does not do any good to your games anymore."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-22,"excellent game. it's maybe the only open world i love. it's the only one i can travel anywhere without a map because every place is unique and exploration is so rewarding you put many hours into it. have you tried gta, the witcher, cyberpunk or skyrim without a marker, gps or minimap, even after beating the game? on top of that, level design and art is beautiful gameplay wise, it's varied with lots of cool weapons and differents playstyles. i prefer games with simple controls where you need good reflexes and game knowledge than just farming for better gear until you can tank more hits than your opponent. these type of games are usually unbalanced and too easy in late game or too hard early game. story is cool but, like sekiro or dark soul, the lore is what makes it very interesting. this is the type of game where you question yourself about everything and you go online to look for answers and you realise that you barely touched the depth of the lore just like lords of the ring, for exemple i'm just sad that it's locked to 60 fps on pc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-22,"exceptional game, exceptional future a game that deserves to be tested and enjoyed. the atmosphere, the music, the gameplay, the bosses, the open world... everything is perfect and with an appreciable difficulty that will not leave anyone indifferent"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-20,"jogo maravilhoso em vrios aspectos sejam eles ambientao, jogabilidade, grficos e histria."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-20,"one of the best open world games. the visuals, the enemy designs, the combat, and difficulty is really good!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-18,"basically, this game is dark souls 3 in openworld. idk why so many people flattered this game like it was revolutionary. story 210  it has the same flaws as ds3, it has a story too subjective and i think elden ring's story managed to be even worse than ds because at least in dark souls the story was more philosophical and it gave meaning to certain things like why the ashen one and the enemies don't really die. also, there is no sense of progression, i don't even know why the character want to be the elden ring and why he need to fight so many enemies in the way. surely my biggest disappointment about elden ring was the story since george r martin helped in the story production, i was expecting a story like sekiro, not a ds3 story copy but way worse. combat and gameplay 810  it is the same way as ds3 but with more weapons, spells, and items and more elements like your horse. i felt that the open world was very cool at first but after 1520 hours of gameplay i didn't like it so much anymore, i rather play in the closed maps but well designed and the game has many maps like that so it is fine too. one thing that keeps the same  is that you obtain dozens of cool weapons with unique ash of war but you can't use 90 of them because you need to redo your whole build and that is so difficult for no reason. overall, it is a great game, it is really really long it took me 107 hours to finish it and with almost endless maps, secrets, enemies and bosses. i can see the devs really put their heart into this game. so my final score is 710."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-17,"un chef d'oeuvre ! elden ring est plus accessible que les dark souls, tout en restant trs exigeant, mais garde tout ce qui  t fait de mieux auparavant et l'amliore encore ! de plus dans un monde ouvert sublime. tellement de choses  faire c'est poustouflant. des donjons, des items  rcuprer, des boss  battre etc... on a du challenge, de l'aventure, de l'exploration, une grande varit de builds diffrents, que demander de plus ? je le conseil fortement"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-16,"yikes, definitely listen to the few and not the many when it comes to reviews of this game. i pirated this trash and still felt ripped off. the revolutionary open world is one of the most empty, devoid of life maps i have ever spent time on in my 25 year career as a gamer. it literally feels like they had an entirely different company make the map and then fromsoft just went in and randomly placed mobs and bosses since i guess we're calling anything with 500 hp a boss now and decided they were done. fights are extremely lazy and predictable, i was actually falling asleep during boss fights just evading and waiting for my little windows to attack, which has never happened to me in any souls game. at this point i'm convinced the fanbase for this game is just degenerate weeb garbage people that have convinced themselves their precious cult leader can do no wrong, when he very, very clearly can."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-16,"eu joguei o jogo todo reclamando. eu reclamava da stamina, da dificuldade, do dano de queda, dos chefes, das dungeons, de tudo. mas depois de terminar elden ring, eu finalmente tive a realizao do quo bom aquele jogo era. no estou dizendo que o jogo vai melhorando, na verdade  o contrrio, mas cada hora a mais que voc passa jogando faz elden ring crescer em voc. eu demorei 130 horas pra terminar, e quando eu percebi que no tinha mais nada pra fazer, me deu uma puta vontade de esquecer tudo pra poder jogar de novo. os elementos separados de elden ring no so os melhores individualmente, mas o conjunto da obra  simplesmente maravilhoso."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-16,"great way to adapt the souls like games with their gameplay loop to the open world format. outstanding story, graphics, gameplay, and everything, as is such with from software games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-15,"overhyped and overrated. after milking dry the demon's souls formula for 13 years, from software has created a frankenstein's monster by slapping together a whole bunch of elements from other games, without perfecting any of them, while using a severely outdated game engine. they have combined combat mechanics from sekiro and of course the souls games, but it feels neither as fastpaced and dynamic as sekiro, nor as strategic, punishing and claustrophobic as souls. the difficulty stems from lazy and unfair enemy combos, as well as new enemy movesets that are simply frustrating and annoying. one boss is too easy? just put two of them into the same room then! add a cheap areaofeffect move to every large enemy, as well as a thrust attack with insane range, with infinite stamina of course!. the open world was obviously created in botw's image, except that it's much less beautiful, much less lively, much less fun to explore and navigate. from a technical standpoint, the game is a disaster. from soft have rested on their laurels for too long and fell behind big time. time to catch up before they go the way of bethesda. that's unlikely though, seeing how the deluded fan cultists have turned this game into perhaps the most overrated title of all time. next up elden ring 2, with the same clunky gameplay mechanics, same outdated graphics, same lore and no plot to speak of."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-13,"super fantastic game but what else can you expect when george rr. martin and miyazaki work together. the only downside is that the game occasionally has fps drops and crashes. otherwise, one of the few games where you can not go wrong if you buy it at full price. especially if you are into the souls genre."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-13,"probably the best game i've ever played. as a dark souls veteran this is the game i was always wishing for. if you are looking for a game that will give you hundreds of hours of fun, an insane story and one of the best open worlds ever, this is it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-11,"un juego bastante dificil como todos los souls pero a diferencia de los otros souls, si en este te trabas en algun boss puedes dar media vuelta e intentar con otros 30 que puedes encontrar en el mapa. la jugabilidad es bastante buena, tiene mucha variedad en cuanto a builds por lo cual tu decides si quieres ir mago, samurai o algo mas tanque. lamentablemente al inicio estaba mal optimizado para pc, vamos que ni con una 3070 tenias fps estables, pero en las ultimas actualizaciones ya han ido arreglando eso. sin duda no me arrepiento de haberlo jugado en su salida, pase buenos momentos jugandolo con amigos y en solitario. una de las mejores experiencias que tuve este 2022"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-11,open world fits in the soulsborne games perfectly. you can see people say it's dark souls 3 with mount and jumping. you can be sure about jumping and mount really matters in the soulsborne games and that caused with level designs considering to these mechanics. so that two mechanics aren't minor  or sth. it is one of the best games you can ever play and best game of 2022 since feb for now
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-09,"this game is a masterpiece. it's one of the most beautiful and well rounded adventure games i've ever played. it is very difficult at times, but usually fair. there are a huge variety of ways to play, giving the game aot of replayability. the game systems are great. the world is really compelling."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-04,"elden ring strips down the core aspects of gaming combat, platforming, exploration and hones them into near perfection. the result is a remarkably tight hack and slash adventure that provides near endless replayability. the art direction is often jawdropping, as seen both in the open world such as nokron and liurnia and in the imaginative menagerie of bosses ancestor spirit, mohg. not to mention tsukasa saito's score punctuates all the dramatic moments and landscapes with a stirring, ethereal aura. the learning curve is doubtlessly massive and punishing. however, i found this challenge to be a refreshing source of fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-28,i didn't like any of the soul games but this one is an exception because it gives players options to summons and find good gears when they are stuck with a hard boss. this alone makes the game so much more enjoyable for me.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-26,"worth it everybody must buy it goty   80180 hours long have alot alot of contents unoptimized and reharshed bosses awesome main bosses,game have alot of skills and magics. now will design open world souls game and goat da best have doable jump."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-26,"this is a harder than average rpg. it's possible to play with other players, but the bosses will increase their difficulty to compensate for the extra players. the trash mobs, especially when they have to be fought in groups, can be overwhelming. the interface is very complex and not very intuitive, so it takes a lot of study to advance your skills. the mood is overwhelmingly dark and there are few areas where you could enjoy a walk in the country with a friend. in any given area, difficulty may range from straightforward to catastrophic without warning. dying resets all the enemies plus you lose your wealth unless you can make it back to where you died and then exit safely. i could recommend this game for hardcore players, and would discourage novice rpg learners from attempting it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-26,"even with the latest patches as of 092022 there are some glithes when changing video modes and no widescreen support! seriously, from software? this is cheap, lazy and lame port from console. you sell this game for pc for 5060 and don't bother at least do some effort to make it right for this platform!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-23,"playing elden ring is a really intense experience. the game is capable of keeping you alert and aware of what is around you at all times. i must also highlight its intricate and outstanding scene design, which encourages you to explore every nook and cranny. its visual section makes the game a piece of video game art. as a negative point, i would say that a diary or similar is missing with which to follow the missions. also, the animations of the character to get up or drink potions are very slow and it is somewhat frustrating not to have control over him for so long. full review in spanish analisisanalisiseldenring"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-18,"the atmosphere and artistry of this game is out of this world, like all soulsbornsekiro games by from software. the only cons for me is the performance of this game and technical aspect of graphics, the textures, shadows etc. looks like its game from the early times of ps4. however, the art aspect of graphics is amazing. the last drawback for me is the vibe of the rainy location in south of the limegrave, and often the game feels too much rainy and foggy for me, its of course entirely subjective. i rarely gives higher scores than 7, but this masterpiece own it, for sure."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-08,"goodlooking and detailed enemies placed in a empty halfcooked world with basically zero content. enemies cheat since they can read your inputs, and your time and patience gets severely wasted with checkpoints so far away and respawning enemies and bosses with absolutely zero droprates. its a mess and its bad. the story is barebones at best and never picks up any speed or even builds any signs of sensical storyarc. the dialogues  as scarse as they are  are often nonsensical and lacking any kind of information or lore. the world is filled with nothing but minibosses. its empty and void. you can explore just to find maybe some more minibosses some of them get recycled a lot!, but their droprates are insulting so you'll ask yourself why even bother? why even bother backtracking half the time or killing the same enemies over and over again in a pretty comical way no dismemberment, every fight is more or less the same, you have practically zero wiggleroom or alternative ways of disposing your foes? the leveldesign is interesting at times, but then other times its extremely bad. empty rooms with nothing to do, misplaced usetriggers, huge ruins to explore with lifeless backtracking or missing checkpoints. to add insult to injury many keys can't get rebind ! and the whole layout is for controllers by default!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-07,the best game i ever played the bosses are all so good and the magics are so good the all stuff is so much fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-07,"this game deserves it's 10 more than any other. an amazing masterpiece of game design with a ton of playability. it took me 150 hrs to beat the game the first time and i enjoyed them all. it was a real adventure and my first time playing a souls game to completion. it's challenging but in a wonderful way that really rewards you for figuring things out. only weak point was the quests which often had me going on wiki to figure out where the hell someone was hiding lol. but, that's also because i did not sit and read the item loredescriptions if you want to know the lore, i recommend it. 1010, best game ever made imo. trend setter that shames all big budget companies not making things to this level."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-04,"hands down goty, probably top10 games released in the last 10 years. also the game is a little hard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-03,my first dark souls game. best open world game ive ever played. better than botw in many ways.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-03,"the game is pure art and joy to play with challenging and awarding combat, big open world that isnt boring and you are maidenless"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-02,"the game is very good, i just wish they paid more attention to the pc version. for exemple the witcher 3 a game from 7 years ago has much better graphics and twice the performance."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-02,"pc kbm janky  you have to come up with your own keybinds because the stock ones require two hands and a mouse. frame lags in a timing game. how's that supposed to work? 10 year old graphics and 20 year old interface intended for a console. copy and paste bosses. am i fighting astel naturalborn of the void or astel stars of darkess? mohg the omen or mohg the blood lord? margit or morgott? godrick the grafted or godefoy the grafted? which dragonkin soldier is this? in the end you just don't care. exploration? open world? eff that. you'll lose your progress if you don't play it extremely safe, because there's ambushes everywhere. putting the player at a marked disadvantage doesn't make the game harder or more challenging, just more annoying. in the end it's just another unload on the boss and go on your way game. muscle memory wins, not brains."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-27,"it was my first real go at a souls game, tried the older ones but got around them too late and they felt a bit aged to me. honestly one of the best gaming experiences i've had, i was always pulled to the easier way to do things and being forced to play the way it's intended really made it that much better for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-26,"no, elden ring is not a masterpiece, it is just ok. basically it's dark souls 3.5 with the only real improvement being an open world. what i like about the open world is that there are no quest markers, no question marks, no icon overkill on the map. elden ring still retains all the annoying souls mechanics, like resting at insert souls resting point restores enemies, getting killed drops insert souls currency with you getting one shot at retaining them and of course the ridiculous difficulty that manages to exclude a huge amount of gamers. it also is guilty of reusing assets and animations graphics have not really been upgraded from ds3, sound effects remain 100 identical. worst offender however are the controls after all these games fromsoft is either incompetent or unwilling to make functioning keyboard  mouse controls. if you release a game on pc then you have no excuse whatsoever to make it unplayable on mouse  keyboard."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-25,genuinely one of the best games i have ever played. i recommend it for it everyone.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-24,"first things first it's 2020 and i still have to use the flawless wide screen to get ultrawide support which could lead to a ban because of anticheat won't allow any thirdparty fixes. the second thing the stuttering is unbelievable it's supposed to be a game that need precise movement but when it stops for a second or two, you're dead. third thing the performance are so bad in some area's that led to frame drops and it's not because of my specs i have 2070 super and tried to lower all the graphic setting but it's still the same. the fourth thing keyboard layout why the hell they didn't implant that in the game before releasing it it's confusing as hell to see press y every damn time. lastly bugs the game has its fair share of bugs like enemy's can hit you while you're behind a wall, the ai of your summons sometimes act dumb, you can get stuck under some large enemy, the high which can you jump from isn't the same in the open world and the dungeon's, lastly good luck trying to hit an animal without the lock on mechanics. the game isn't bad it's enjoyable when it's playable but not at this time wait for them to release bug and performance issue then go for it otherwise, you're stuck playing it in a  state."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-24,"elden ring is without question the best game using the dark souls formula. after a pretty shaky pc launch, the issues were resolved within a week and i had some of the most fun in my life playing this game for hours at a time. high points include the graphics, scale, formulaic story, and challenge, and low points include high system requirements, somewhat confusing openworld objectives, and brutal difficulty for newcomers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-24,"the best game i've ever played. fromsoft really outdid themselves. the story is amazing and while there are valid critiques of the game, from it's poor handling of npc questlines to the buggy pc launch. but honestly, it wouldn't really be a fromsoft game without requiring you to scour the internet for how to find an npc. this is very much a biased opinion and i know that, but i can't help myself. the art direction is something i absolutely fell in love with, the npc's while hard to find, were worth finding in my opinion, if only too see this gorgeous world through them. exploration has been my favorite thing since this game's launch and finding the many many many secret areas in the game has been a blast. the combat is amazing, fighting and overcoming a hard enemy or boss was just muah chef's kiss. i'd recommend this game to everyone an absolute mastapiece"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,one of the best games i have ever played i couldn't resist playing other souls and it was a really good experience not for everyone but it was a great experience
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,"without talking about the amazing story... essentially the main problem is that when you start this game for the first time, even as a long term veteran souls player, you are bad, very bad. after 5 hours you understand that this isn't dark souls 3 and you start enjoying it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,definitely one of the best games ive played. a lot of time has obviously been invested into giving the game world a dark feel with lots and lots of small bits of information that when puzzled together tells a lot about the lore. and the fist game ive played using a controller and being confident about it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,gameplay 1010 online 810 crash..... 1010 it has a lot of things to improve but it is still one of the best games that came out this year.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,"ok, a lot of people here seem  for not appreciating a good game, it is true that it is not the best game in history or something like that but it is a very excellent game. i play on xbox but i have also tried it on pc and although it gives lag at certain times it is very playable, the fact that many people say that many reusable things from the previous dark souls are used is because all the original ideas of elden ring were from dark souls 2 and some from 3, since they couldn't be implemented there, they ended up putting it in elden ring, but that's good, they don't know how happy i felt when i went through the hanging chains on the mountain of the giants reminding me of the ds2 chains of the mountain of dragons that i do not remember its name, it is a game that recycles a lot but that is good and does not ruin the experience, what if it is just the damage that the special enemies do in the final part of the game, they do too much and not even the heaviest armor protects you as they should, but it's a game with the best soundtrack i've heard just being passed through ds1 and majula from ds2, the fights are also original and good, those of the gargoyles that many you could complain, they were perfect for me and one of the best in the game and to finish... maliker peels me off"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-22,easly one of the best game ever with an endless open world with tons of exploration. you can play finish this game 5 times and in the sixth time you find new bosses and places. only problem in this game is some performance issues and camera problems in big bosses.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-21,"elden ring is the game of the year for me. its incredible masterpiece. crown of the souls games. i want more games like this or just dlcs. i recommend everyone who wanna meet a souls game, but didnt do yet and for sure must play for any souls fan."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-20,"the world is boring, magic is boring, and all the factors that add artificial difficulty get old real quick, such as the enemies reading your inputs so they know your actions before you even take them. not to mention the fact that the game tells you very little about its mechanics like how spells scale and the damage of spells or the quests why is there not a real quest tracker. this would be acceptable for an snes game, but we're far past that point. there are plenty of bugs, too i have issues locking on vs certain enemies routinely. and last but certainly not least the ui loves to get in your way. oh sure don't tell me anything about how damage is calculated or what a spell actually does, but go ahead and lock me out of reacting in combat with a prompt that takes up a quarter of the screen and prevents me from making any meaningful actions in the middle of combat. don't waste your time unless you enjoy getting tortured by mediocrity and artificial difficulty."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-20,"it's just a perfect game, the plot, gameplay, and everything i can't play any other games right now cuz u know how a perfect game can change your mind"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-20,"it's basically dark souls 4, with slightly above average openworld mechanics. i enjoy it but would say that there is some obvious recycling from previous titles and even within the game itself. a smaller, more consciously designed world might have been better. also, the pc release is just unapologetically bad in terms of bugs and performance. update i finished the game and most of the bugs have been ironed out since then. my opinions on the world size and recycling of ideas definitely still stand though. it's a bit sad as from software clearly put a lot of work into the game, but they bit off more than they can chew."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-18,"very few games have left a lasting impression on me as elden ring has. the sheer size and scope of what is on offer here plus the incredible visualaudio design makes this an epic adventure that i will never forget. while it is not quite perfect,for me it's close enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-16,"my first time to the soul genre game. story, design, and the volume are amazing to enjoy. but i still hate that the game was not intuitive and very hard to get through. i still feel like the game is made for those soul genre fanboys."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-15,"conceptually, elden ring disappointed me, too much content and too little quality, the bosses are not interesting, the gameplay is boring, a huge number of bosses are used at least 2 times and a maximum of about 5  6, i think this is the worst game of from software all time  elden ring  ,       ,   ,  ,      2     5  6,     from software.           ,    .     ,   3        ,     .         ,      ,                                    .                     ,         , ,         3      ,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-14,"biggest scam in gaming history. outdated game in a shiny wrap. you must never trust not only critics, but even real players who leaves a reviews. i'm truly amazed by society literally game from 201618 with nothing new and yet another terrible pc port is now considered as worlds masterpiece. i guess everyone got exited because of open world, but there is a surprise  it is not an open world at all. i keep saying  if you want truly open world  go play some elder scrolls games. game is boring, abnormally long and everything is essentially the same. the only thing i liked is music and boss design. that is all. from such big game. incredible. bosses and enemies are the same  unfair cringe with up to nine combo attacks with almost no window for your hit! im a dark souls veteran and im truly amazed how strong those foes are! 9hits combo, 0.5 seconds delay, jump and another combo attack, repeat. i wonder how it is explained in lore. okay i wont go into details that much, there is plethora of very good red and yellow reviews with explanation. please, do not be blinded."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-12,"its the only one big open world game that has over 100 hrs, that i play second time, and it feels almost as amazing as first playtrouth, and im sure that it wont be the last, there are so many builds, so many items ,spells, ways to play. everithing u find and explore is important, the difficulty is a bit easier that previus from soft games, but for this scale its perfect ,so to it not to be a drag. the story is great, there are tons uf interesting and suprising lore. graphics are beutiful , textures are a bit outdated but the landscapes are jaw dropping. the only small comlane is the are some copy paste bosses, but i understand that it would be probably too hard to make 165 different bosses, but no matter thei still have a lot more different bosses ,than alot of other games. it is the best action rpg open world game ever period. thank u from software"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-10,"really boring game. slow, very repetitive. too dificult, so you have to restart every boss 1015 times until you beat him. a pity. only for hardcoregames that don't search for a good history, only hack  slash."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-09,"yeah, miyazaki and from starting to eats their own tail. i mean it's still a great game, but stylistics it's just another dark fantasy, with fallen kings, heroes and that stuff we saw million timies in other souls games, and the gameplay is really nothing new or fresh in this formula. bringing open world to dusty mechanics doesn't make a new game guys. it is shame, because sekrio shows that this team have fresh ideas to improve gameplay. but this is just one big step backwards."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-09,"by far the worst souls game ever made, the open world is extremely boring and full of copypaste content. there is no fun way to traverse the open world. boss fights are low quality and again a lot of them are copypaste, i am talking about big story bosses that get shamelessly reused! it shows that fromsoftware didn't have enough time to develop this game properly. the boring empty open world is filled with wannabe pokemon summons called spirit ashe summons, you like collecting pokemons in your souls games? i don't. there is no meaningful reward, the game is too big for its own good, next time provide less quantity and more quality, like previous souls games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-08,one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. thank you from software for this masterpiece!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-07,for me i've using a ryzen 3700x and radeon rx 570 8gb nitro version. i've using it in medium. i've faced some stuttering and it's tolerable. average fps for me is 49  52. i'm happy with the experience. there isn't a single place in the open world that didn't peaked my interest. best 200 hours spent on a video game and still more to come.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-02,"storytelling, mechanics, animations, most bosses, goat keeper  are the same. site of grace  bonfire, which means  reset all killed mobs in the area, again.  spells can only be changed here. again. world seems big, right. but most of the places are closed, and you'll spend time on finding a glintstone key as an example. but the dungeons are hilariously just ctrlcv. dungeon 1 a basement dungeon, or erwin smith dungeon. just a hole in the ground, so basically locationlocationchesttrap. and the locations are the same. a long trap that goes down, a room with 4 corners, enemies, a little room further with chest or trap. done. another one in the mountain open the doorgo downsite of gracego furtheryou see a closed dooryou search everywhere a lever armactivate itsomewhere a heavy door has opened. so you basically go back to that door in the beginning and fight a silly boss. optimization and community even on my pc 5900x, 32gb, m.2 980 pro, 3090 the game stutters. sometimes it even freezes in dungeons. why did i put optimization and community together? first off, i am not the only one with this problem, but the whole community will convince you that you are the problem, you are the only one to blame here, not the developers, when in reality there are digital foundry, critics, players, steam who kinda fixed it on steam deck that confirm the bad optimization. the community is the worst, toxic and blind. they regard any criticism as a personal insult to them. not made for pc they didn't make a good port for the best gaming platform? there is no dlss, no widescreen, no fps unlock. graphics settings only affect fps, you can barely notice the image. when you plug in your controller xbox you have to change the interface, when even transformers 2009 game did it automatically, while it's a piece of sh... 30 fps console experience, elden ring just can't handle this one. imagine if transformers 2009 did something simple that elden ring 2022 can't. you can't move the map with your mouse cursor, while skyrim and witcher 3 do well. multiplayer for the multiplayer you need  right place where your friend can be summoned.  you must have the furcalling finger remedy, which you can actually buy, but the stock is limited.  but you can make it, grind specified flowers. so you are connected? all right, now you two have  50 less flasks  less hp depends on your friend's hp  100 difficulty for your enemies  you can't use a goat  you can't use the spirits  you can't change the spells  you are constantly attacked by other players. user support for example, if you have a problem, someone has hacked you, and you can't continue with your saves, the support will give a cap advice start a new game. even genshin support gives you more help. total i complain about the 100 boss boost in multiplayer because it gets boring. you need to attack him 23 times more often than usual. but solo okay. the only aspect i really like about this game is the location design, the architecture is huge. so for the newbies who have never played soulsborne, the game is 610 4 just for the bad optimization. it doesn't matter if the game doesn't run well. for me, definitely 410 because it's dark souls 4. if you ever thought fallout was just skyrim with guns or starfield was just fallout in space, then remember that there are still soulsborne fans out there who laughs at bethesda games for being mediocre, while literally eating a copypaste game, lol."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-25,"game, previous dark souls games and bloodborne were much better lots of brainless casual players and dumb boring bosses maybe malenia is the hardest boss, but also it's the worst boss ever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-25,"110 just cuz i respect fromsoft.strayed too far from original souls games,bland and easy.heavily crippled world of warcraft with poor optimizations.gimme four devs,two graphic designers and coffee guy i would do better in two months."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-25,"before the gow5 i would give this game goty 2022, cause it was an amazing experience for gaming community, considering this is still one of the most selling games 5 months after its release. it has good skillbased gameplay, some really amusing and imaginative locations and bosses, yet it lacks narrative and story, which made me take a break in my playthrough for a while. the balancing at this game is really something which should have been taken more seriously, because some bosses are just not fun at all for their stupidly high difficulty. and you also can't ignore numerous bugs and glitches which may be annoying at some times. the open world for this game is something which is working not that well, however it has something for you to explore. considering ubisoftlike openworld games, elden ring makes you feel like you are actually discovering something new, which you are not forced to explore. nevertheless, it is still the best game of 2022 for me and it deserves this hype and attention"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-24,"why only 710 you shall ask? this game have some disadvantages that pissed me off a lot of times while playing i don't like multiplayer from from software games a lot of connection errors even on bossfights, signs doesn't shows up properly. secondly, poor game optimalization. really? on rtx 2060 i gained same fps on low and high settings"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-23,"while there are legitimate issues with the performance of the pc version, i think this is a very solid game with plenty of content and interesting lore and world building to explore, not to mention memorable boss fights."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-23,"i tried dark souls back in the day and it wasn't really my type of game. with how few good games have come out lately i felt like maybe this franchise deserves a second chance. after my taste has changed over the past 20 years as well. sadly it left me disappointed again. the controls are clunky, the graphics mediocre, the story telling isn't very good yes i get it, it has deep lore but if you fanboys calm down for a sec and think about it, the delivery of that story isn't very good. especially for a game in this day and age. it would have been fine in the 90's but now it's simply not. the gameplay aside from the cluncky controls is just learning the pattern of enemies and once you do it becomes quite doable. sure it is a challenge sometimes to learn the pattern of bosses and their various forms but in my opinion the story isn't good enough, and the rewards for killing a boss aren't great enough to feel like it is worth all that effort. i pumped about 4 hours into the game and it simply felt like a waste of time. my job is more rewarding on its bad days than this game and without any reason to do it i just dropped the game. then the performance. the game was a stuttery mess from time to time on my pc which granted isn't the best but my old i77700k, rtx 2070 super and 3200 mhz ddr4 should be more than enough. sadly the performance on 1440p simply wasn't there. is my review harsh, sure but for a game series with some ch high renown it simply doesn't even meet the bare minimum requirements. hell cyberpunk at launch felt better to me because at least it had good gameplay, story and graphics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-23,"an open world game that is based on repeating bosses and also becomes tedious to investigate should never be a goty. it is entertaining? yes. is it one of the best fs games? no, definitely."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-22,absolutely amazing. a true gem . never played a souls game before without rage quitting and never coming back. this drew me in and  hundreds of hours from me. phenomenal experience all around.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-22,"except for some annoying features, this game is a mindblowing journey that kept me addicted for 150 straight hours. froms collected all their lore and gameplay specifics in this one huge piece of art, but i think this time they didn't beat dark souls 1 in atmosphere and story, neither the did beat sekiro in gameplay sharpness and fluidity. p.s. thanks let me solo her dude, it was fun to sit there and see you dancing with the red head butterfly."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-18,one of the best games of all time. except for technical problems. it looks like the ds game engine couldn't handle the open world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-15,"game is terrible in pc. with ryzen 5 5600h and rx 5500m, in low settings i got 5060fps. i experienced fps drops in bosses and crowded enemy groups. some lightning effects disappears and looks fancy. trees and grasses disappears and appears again. if you call the horse when you next to a tree, you just hang on the tree and die. there is a bug that makes all enemies invisible. effects really ruins my pc's performance. controls and phyics are still playstation 3 quality. not a single change since old ds games. didn't get a thing from story and people who made this game is lazy af. just try to listening to community at once."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-14,"excelente el mejor juego que he jugado en mi vida,una obra maestra,desde la direccin de arte. hasta la jugabilidad,todo brilla en este juego"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-14,"this game is everything fans loved about the series but brought to the open world. the combat feels as good as ever, with quick responses to your inputs and nice flow and feeling of weight overall. with a variety of classes to choose from, and playstyles that suit every player this game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. from summons to spirit npc ashes, you can choose whether to fight solo or with an ally. there is one bossfight where i definitely recommend using summons and that's the godskin duo. now on the story side of 's mindblownlingly epic! overall it makes you feel like you're rising up to the top becoming stronger and stronger, culminating in an epic final showdown. on the negatives now...some classes and builds are way better than others, making fights hilariously easy but again that's up to the player. i didn't involve myself in the pvp so no comments on that. a lot of assets are reused but i kind of expected that in a game as massive as this. lastly, a lot of the bosses in the late game are really hard, not allowing the player with a window of opportunity for a counter attack and with endgame damage stats, the fights become really hard and are a matter of patience. but overall i don't have anything major to say in regard to the bad aspects of the game. tldr yes the game is amazing, with epic fights, a larger scale to its story and with really tough endgame bosses! ps the music in certain bossfights just gives me chillsmohg, lord of blood cough cough"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-14,"now that the casuals have got bored of angrily hammering in 110 reviews because they died a few times rather than achieving instant gratification, hopefully the reviews will become a little more representative."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-13,amazing game if you like souls games then you have to try this its my goty
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-13,"i had toyed with the idea of scoring this low to counteract the utterly exaggerated 10 out of 10 scores, but in the end i scored it as i feel is fair. first of all the combat against most enemies is fun and challenging. you do get a sense that you are improving as you level up and begin to take on those knights and other creatures easier. unfortunately the world itself is large but has no feel of life to it. maybe that is the design direction the devs wanted to take but the entire place feels lifeless with no sense of meaning to it. where the problems start arise is the lack of variety. kill enemies, die lots, confront boss, die lots, kill boss, move to next level and start again. each time you move to a new area you feel woefully underpowered again and it feels cheap and makes the entire exprience a grind. the lack of interaction also impacts gameplay negatively and makes for a very shallow experience. there is almost nothing to do but kill enemies and beat bosses and the only intercations are minor and trivial and delivered in a characterless and underwhelming way. what is really bad though, are the main boss fights. they feel hard because the enemy cheat or react to your keybutton presses and they rarely run out of stamina. so you get destroyed over and over and over again until you figure out how to cheese them. or you finally figure out the weapon and or character class you had been levelling up is worhtless against them. melania or radagon is a perfect example. my mage build at level 170 was getting destryoed as they could teleport across the room instantly dealing two or three shots that i could not counter and that killed me. it felt like i had wasted hundreds of hours building a character that was just for nothing. the only way i could beat both of them was to respec multiple times. i eventually found out that 45 dex and 50 arcane with rivers of blood at level 10 was the only way i could beat them. i beat both stages of melania in less than two minutes doing the corpse piler skill. despite doing exactly the same thing with the same build and weapon dozens of times before. it just feels the main boss fights are not down to skill, but random number generation. you could do the same thing dozens, scores or even hundreds of times and finally it just works. overall a decent game, but nowhere near a 10 out of 10 because 10 out of 10 impies perfect and there are too many issues for that to be accurate."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-12,"i loved this game the whole way through. i'm a sort of fan of the dark souls games, but have never finished one before because i would get lost or lose interest. elden ring kept me engaged the whole time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-12,"sin duda esta en los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida, reviviendo asi lo mejor de sus anteriores juegos, con una gran banda sonora y una historia unica, lo unico negativo, es que considero que no es juego que se pueda jugar demasiado, ya que tras conseguir el platino del juego ya no quedaba nada por hacer, pero no quita que su historia sea de las mejores que he probado en mi vida, su merecido 10 y de corazon, espero que sea el goty este ao."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-11,"the game was medium quality at best. no significant changes were made to the graphics and the atmosphere was not intense enough. ingame music and boss fight music were good. the battle mechanics were the same as the previous games and did not fit the open world atmosphere. the story of the game was very empty, but i can't judge the developers on that, the only good game story in this game series was the story of dark souls 2. exploring, finding materials and equipment is enjoyable and manageable until the first 20 hours of the game, but after that it starts to get boring and repetitive. this is a very bad thing because this type of games are where you play for 100200 hours and starting to get bored early means you can't finish the game and get your money's worth. as for ingame performance, i didn't have any major fps drops or game crashes or bugs. the keyboard and mouse compatibility of the game is a complete disaster, a 0.5 second delay in such games will result in your death and in this game the delays oh my god. if you look at it in general, the attention to the marketing and hype budget does not seem to be devoted to the game, and the game looks and feels like an average aaa game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-10,it is one of the best games i've ever played great combat great bosses and great 't mind the noobs who can't kill bosses this game is so good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-10,"elden ring is pure art. but it's not for everyone. from soft tried to make it more friendly to the newcomer by increasing the frequency of bonfires, adding the ability to summon, and so on but as well as the whole dark souls series, elden ring still in some ways is a niche product. people who've never played ds and came from skyrim and assassin's creed just because they've seen a open world game tag are highly likely to be disappointed that they didn't find what they were used to and not wanting what the game has to offer. so 6.9 user score is expected."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-09,"extremely boring, hack and slash, with quite a bit of attention on combat mechanics. but i can't be bothered with the challenge. die, farm lower level enemies , upgrade, die, castle, dungeon, big boss battle, die, dungeon, meaningless cinematic dialogue, die, uninstall. cyberpunk is about 40 times more engaging than this. performance was ok for me, after a few patches, but i have a 2080ti in the living room and a 3090 on my gaming rig. i didn't count the frames but there were no noticeable problems apart from the fact that the game is dreadful."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-09,"i wish miyazaki very pleasantful meeting with a truck with a drunk truck driver, on a rainy night so the breaks won't work in time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-09,"es un videojuego de sobresaliente el nico que de verdad exige de una dificultad encima predeterminada por el juego en s. su apartado artstico de todos los biomas es excelente para la mayora que lo ha jugado, exige un desafo para el jugador, yo nada ms lo veo barato me lo comprar ya que no quiero gastarme el dinero en su precio de salida, si no el del nivel de dificultad que verdaderamente contiene, es decir unos 20 o 30 eurillos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-07,0
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-07,"one of the best soulslike games i've ever played. does not get bored even after the second pass. separately, you can highlight a chic open world filled with different enemies and secrets, it is very interesting to explore it. there have never been any problems with killing bosses, there has always been enough level, the game has a wellthoughtout balance and quality of game mechanics. the game is interesting and exciting in all aspects, i advise everyone!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-06,"stunning graphics, voice over work is amazing. a game you'll likely play more than once."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-04,"my first fromsoft game. i heard all of stuff about their games being incredibly hard. and to be honest, i was overwhelmed at first, struggling to fight even basic enemies. however, little by little you begin to realize how many tools you have at your disposal. it isn't just about getting good. learning how to use those tools, through exploration and experience, are just as important. i eventually hit a point where i understood the game, and suddenly i felt like i understood the entire appeal of this franchise. only downside exploration gets a little boring towards the end of the game, especially when you already have all the gear you really need. overall though, excellent."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-04,a classic fromsoftware game you will love it or you will hate  me the game is a masterpieace but with poor optimization. the game runs awfull considering the specs i have amd ryzen 5800x and a rtx 2080 super other than that if you are playing on a conlose i think is a better experience for sure. lets hope so for further update fix the optimization problems..
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-04,"elden ring has been my first fromsoftware game. at first i was overwhelmed by the massive open world and for the first 23 days i was just running around, leveling up and did not know exactly what to do and where to do it. but after a while i grew more and more into it and yes, since i am a trophy hunter, i checked some locations online here and there but it is just an amazing feeling to defeat a difficult boss fight. melania... boy oh boy!   a very suprising thing and probably a good sign of enjoyment is that usually i uninstall games as soon as the platinum trophy pops up. but elden ring is just the third game after god of war and witcher 3 where i said i'm wanna play that game again soon even though there is nothing left to achieve anymore. the game is really fun and still challenging. if you do not like a difficult challenge in your video games, this game is probably just not for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-02,"this is how little you can trust online reviews publications who get paid by these game companies to gush over these games ranked it a 94. users give it a 6.9 probably a much more accurate evaluation. i stopped reading game reviews years ago because of this. another example wow shadowlands grabbed an 84. that game was a literal waltz into hell. it's one of the worst big name games i've ever played. users correctly panned it at a 3.0, a much more accurate portrait. the internet is corporate. when you read online gaming publication reviews for something like elden ring, you're basically reading what the makers of elden ring thought of elden ring. even some of the user reviews were paid, and you can tell this is so. so here is a real review the graphics on this game are beautiful. the music is beautiful. you'll have some fantastic moments. overall, though, the gameplay is wooden, and it's a world of warcraft fever dream where someone imagined what a 2022 warcraft would look like. some of the backgrounds are 2006 wow scene reimagined in 2022. this doesn't make it a bad game. lots of people will like this. and just as many people will flip it off and not be able to finish it because it's a flashback. and some people get bored with those. if you want to read accurate reviews of any game, ignore 0. ignore 10. and read every review listing it as something inbetween. some of the most classic games in history aren't a 10. and even some of the worst games in history still have some value to them, ranking above a 0. just keep the golden rule in mind zeros are competitors. tens are paid reviewers.  sincerely, someone who gets offers for positive or negative reviews all the time and never, ever takes companies up on their offers"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-01,absolutely stunning game. first game of fromsoftware that i played and opened doors for other titles. goty
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-01,another horribly optimized game on pc port. it's been 4 months since release. still not fixed. not worth buying.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-28,"in my opinion, the best game of 2022. they have combined the structure of other souls games into one game perfectly. although it is a longterm game, i played it with pleasure without getting bored for a second. give this game a chance without being fooled by other reviews. a complete masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-27,"terrible pc port lack of native ultrawide support, coop is very unstable, performance issues, online issues, balance issues, 60 fps cap in 2022, button prompts altho you can set them manually it should really detect when you pressing buttons on mouse keyboard to also give button prompts for mouse and keyboard and switch automaticly to mouse and keyboard prompts. things that annoy me the most tho is the lack of native ultrawide support and 60 fps lock, normally in a single player game this is not much of a problem but with easy anti cheat added in a singleplayer game you are now locked out to only play offline, you may not see the issue here but if you consider that dark souls remastered has better ultrawide support right now then elden ring then this is a big issue, not to mention its 2022 why do we still have no native ultrawide support or unlocked framerate, the game plays fine with fixes in offline, but due easy anti cheat im forced to play offline or seemless coop mod that has a worse coop experience then original vanilla, not only that it more and more feels like my feedback is ignored, we are now on patch 1.05 and all the issues still exist, not cool from software perhaps you should let another one handle the pc port and stick on just making the game, while letting some one profesional handle pc ports, dark souls remastered has better ultrawide support oke not perfect, but least it has no black bars."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-26,"after 100 hours of playing, i can say this game was a different experience for me. exploring the vast map and slaying monsters was so fun for me, yes there were some hard things but overall once you figure out the game and its idea it becomes fun. the most challenging point for me was the bosses. the cutscenes were fantastic and after that, you're facing the boss, figuring out its moves and patterns. after memorizing patterns, it's time to take action and take down the boss. with lore, gameplay and progress were awesome. 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-25,"elden ring o' elden ring, undeniably the most fine tuned and well thought out project that fromsoftware has ever released. after spending nearly 200 hours in this game i can say with confidence that it is some of the most challenging fun i have ever had with a video game. it took my breathe away from start to finish with its landscape, well thought out characters, deep and interesting lore, and most importantly insanely brutal boss encounters. of course i have some issues with the game however, the biggest one being that i feel it pushes you to play specific builds as the most powerful items in the game favour single playstyles but if your willing to go without the op weapons and spells and trudge through insanely fast and strong boss combos all the while spam rolling and using your final bit of stamina to swing your giant hammer for that final hit! then you shall be rewarded with some of the most satisfying feelings of accomplishment you can receive from any video game. if you are interested in elden ring you owe it to yourself to persevere and explore, don't quit after 4 or even 10 hours in because to truly appreciate this masterpiece you must first allow it time to show you all it has to offer. to me the cons the game has are so easily trumped by all the good and this game remains imo a 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-25,"don't be fooled by who calls elden ring a masterpiece. at its best it's competent and it isn't even constant at being so. the game mechanically is literally ds3, no less and no more. clunkiness included. speaking of world design, even if it is capable of giving some good landscape to the eye ends up being much better at boring you too much space for too little content. is the carnival of recycle and scarcity recycled enemies, 70 of the time exploration gives you at best consumables, the dungeons are literally the same modular 2 type of structures repeated over and over and let's not even start with the repeated bosses. so called legacy dungeons are too short and seem half baked. don't be fooled by the mere numbers the problem is not how much fat there's in elden ring but how much more should have been there to keep meaningful a journey so stretched in terms of time of completion and map space. balance is non existent. extend this to everything you can think of from bosses to player's weapons and spells passing trough also one hit kill random mobs. it is clearly not player tested and half of the interactions end up being tedious for being or unreasonably hard or unreasonably trivial. the lore is there. if only the game was compelling to play for sure i'd tell how much i appreciate it. but some nice ideas can't patch something that bores you to death before getting to them. what makes up a souls experience is uniqueness elden ring for sure has a serious lack of it. some things are cool, sure, but most the time it isn't worth it to go trough it. a lot of empty or palliative spaces, not enough variety just kill the journey. you'll soon wish the game to end before the game has the humbleness on cutting short with itself. not gonna start with the stuttering, we all know is there"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-25,elden ring is a good game that has some technical flaws here and there. i love the sense of discovery and the combat.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-24,"i'm not a huge fan of soulslike games, but this one was extraordinary. if you like role playing games, you owe it to yourself to try this one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-24,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-23,"first thing i said when i played elden ring for the first time was big, its one of the biggest games i have played in my life, even bigger then red dead redemption2 and its perfect, its pure fan service in terms of maps, enemies, and everything else."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-23,one of the best game i have played. period. so much to explore and challenging boss encounters.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-22,"despite the effort to make it unplayable for pc, from software still managed to make a great game, where a good part of the dark souls saga spirit gets into an open world, even though doesn't have the same magic. i've been playing for 110 hours and explored almost each and every secret. the experience is huge and epic. i am a bit disappointed by the final bosses and the endings they are poorly written, there is also some boring repetition of the content. the witcher and skyrim remain unmatched."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-21,still a great game but with a lot of ctrl cctrl v bosses. with a lot of bad mechanics and useless open world
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-20,"incredible game with decent replayability, excellent game mechanics and hitboxes. the feeling of finally beating a boss is incredibly rewarding"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-19,"one of the most boring, overrated, overhyped and meaningless video game i have ever forced myself to play. they took dark souls idea and made it open world. literally whole game is like that. boss after boss. pointlessly difficult combat, hardly any reward or story progression, because there is hardly any story to care about. quests you do are meaningless and you forget about by the end, because there is no quest log. awful game, overhyped by people who hate ubisoft and think that now, ubisoft should start making games with souls combat, or some nonsense. ironically these people never even cared for ubisoft games. ubisoft has obviously gone downhill in recent years and who knows, if they even make a comeback, but at least ubisoft has solid selection of great games they have made in past and valhalla was decent as well, nothing special, but still better game overall than elden ring or cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-19,"this game is sooooooooo underrated, it must be higher. here my pros and cons pros  fun game with great mechanics  keeps you entertained for hours on end  lore is big and good  good story  easy to learn, hard to master cons  frames, the frames in this game are pretty crappy, even on good computers like mine! i run fortnite at 144 fps but i can barely run elden ring at 50."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-19,"masterpiece. had lots of fun with it and i still have. it has a lot of ways to make the difficulty harder or easier so you can play it, even if you never played a souls game before."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-19,"dark souls with a hourse and jump buttom, same combat, same cheap game design. but there is empty open world which is basicaly a huge landscape with nothing. there is no plot like in previous from software games deep meaning of what is going on in the game exists only on internet forums and fandom . games terrible ui and clunky unresponsible controlls make it frustrating, playing 6th installment of dark souls not giving me that much joy overcoming the same game design ideas that i overcome 5 games earlyer. on top of this game runs like crap on pc rtx 2070r73800x with frame rate dipping below 60 no matter ettings i used. i believe critics if you can say so are really biased and the big name of miyadzaki sold them this game and thats not right you need to be objective as a journalist you need to tell people the truth about the product that they are buing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,"i was just wasting my time. by the end of the game it was so boring that i ran past the loot. boss fight are the apogee of stupidity. you fight with the heel or the boss jumps all over the arena or the boss 2. as a result, the disappointment of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,redefining the mainstream open world designs and merging it with the souls formula maintaining his essence
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,its not bad game with no quest guide but why enemies spamming attack ? i feel like they are playing they have to enjoy the game not me. better next game they let players enjoy the game. its so cringe because literally they are spamming and its annoying too much
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,"no gostei do mundo aberto, pois tem muito lugares vazios no mapa, diferente de dark souls, onde as mapas se ligam entre si, o que achei muito legal. mas o gameplay  melhor que outros jogos da sries souls. o grfico no  de nova gerao e h muitas quedar de fps, para poder rodar sempre a 60 fps no mdio, deve se ter um pc muito caro pra isso, o que a maioria no tem hoje em dia, parece que at dark souls 3 tem um grafico melhor e mais fluido. mas  um jogo bom e viciante e gostoso de jogar por causa da variedade de chefes e inimigos, pois isso dei uma nota boa pra ele."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-18,"this is king of all souls like games, i play all of souls and souls like egames this is the true king."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-17,despite what people say this game is not a masterpiece it is really good but has issues
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-17,"aunque la optimizacin en pc es psima, el juego en si es una obra maestra en cada aspecto posible, una gran obra de miyazaki."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-17,wahrscheinlich das beste spiel der letzten jahre ! keine langweilige ubisoft openworld in welcher man nur punkte auf der karte abluft. fordernd und ohne easymode oder ingame kufe um sich einen vorteil zu verschaffen wie in 95 aller anderen spiele heutzutage
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,"elden ring is a game so good, it makes other games bad just by existing. yes, i had my share of issues on the pc but i was more than willing to put up with them in order to keep playing this game. i was enjoying it so much, i just powered through the frame rate stuttering and kept playing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,top 3 open world games of all time. my first soulslike game and i must say this game is master peace and super addictive only hate couple things  map ui hard to spot your own marks and places you clear should be marked as done sign  items and skills quick access management also . wheel ui would be much better imo. no compare window then you buy armor or weapons
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,"dark souls 4   ,      .   250"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,"it's the only game i played that has actually meaningful, not copypasted, openworld where you can find interesting things to do. yes, the game isn't without flaws, but they are irrelevant when you see how much passion was put into the design of the world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,"the open world is amazing, there is so much detail to this game. but i cant really call elden ring a game, because games are fun. elden ring is not fun. its very simple why it is terrible. elden ring punishes you in more ways than just charging you 70, by giving you reused bosses, lots of dead ends, terrible game logic, zero fun, and a broken controller. its mainly the terrible boss design, i get killed at full health in two hits while taking 30 minutes to recover from the last attack! and to just arrive at the boss fight, you have to deal with a plethora of nuisances that deal unreasonable amounts of damage. and by late game, you can only really level up your character and weapons by killing the bosses that kill you in less that 10 seconds. what really aggravated me and lots of other elden ring players was the godskin duo, the most annoying boss in the entire game. they are near impossible to fight without dying immediately. i know elden ring has one of the largest and most detailed maps, good graphics, and is a great challenge, but it all comes down to how much fun and joy you can have. there is no fun and joy in this. zero. it is mentally draining to play. you should only buy elden ring if you have an absurd amount of time on your hands and if you hate yourself."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-15,let's hope more aaa games will try to be like this a perfect completes game on release with no glitches perfect story perfect gameplay !
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-15,1010 game of the year. this is what you should get in a video game with a 60 price tag. massive open world countless boss fights multiple different playstyles  classes great story  lore great replayability great sense of achievement when you play  defeat bosses that give you trouble. long live from software
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-15,what a masterpiece. it's been a long time since i've played such a beautiful game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-14,"first, the positives you will definitely be astounded by the open world. anywhere you can see, you can go. the art direction is brilliant, the graphics themselves being just fine. i've never focused on them that much though the music itself is pretty good, too. if you like normal souls combat, you'll probably like some parts of the combat as well. now, the negatives are a lot more apparent in this game, overshadowing the positives in basically every way. first and foremost, the performance is awful. most people can't run this game. i can run it okay on manjaro linux with proton with 3040 fps most of the time, but my friend, who's rig is much more powerful, can't even get out of the first area before the game crashes or freezes. the anticheat is awful too, not only does it spy on you like every other anticheat out there. it's just a given at this point. it slows your game down even more. i got sick of it and tried disabling it, which made my game run at a smooth 60 fps. which is also the highest in this engine for some reason, even though we're already in 2022 with 144hz monitors the open world, being so large, gives you the illusion of it being full of stuff to do, but sadly there's just not that much to get. you'll explore an area for around an hour or so, scouring every corner for anything interesting, just to get a spell or weapon that you can't use, or something that's just plain inferior to your existing set up. you'll think at first that there are a lot of items to pick up, but most of them are just useless crafting materials that can be farmed anyway. the dungeons are also awful. it's funny that even bloodborne's chalice dungeons, which are disliked by many, put elden ring's dungeons to shame. the combat is just souls combat. it has all of your standard souls combat woes, like input buffering queuing and the camera and lockon system. it's like dark souls 3 combat, but slower, while the enemies are faster. your character is this clunky ass guy, while the bosses and even normal enemies just do 9 hit anime combos without any limit, since the enemies don't have stamina anymore. you'll just press dodge for the whole fight, hit the boss once, which usually results in a miss, since the boss just jumps away if you use anything slower than a katana and then keep pressing dodge again until the boss creates on opening for you, which, again, almost never happens, since they have infinite stamina now, can animation cancel every attack and stagger, combo combos into combos into combos into combos, etc.. usually you just sit back and watch the boss do their version of waterfowl dance, while wishing you could do the same with their weapon, after you kill them and get it from the remembrance hag. also everything does ng2 damage so you die in two hits one even in heavy armor with 80 vigor and an hp great rune. why? whyyyyyy?? the bosses are also all basically the same hypermobile stat checks. every time you beat one you don't feel good, you just feel wow, i'd rather cut my balls of with a hammer, than fight this thing again. don't worry though, the world was so empty, fromsoft decided to reuse a bunch of the bosses, meaning you'll fight every boss at least thrice. at worst 13 times duo bosses also exist in this and most of the time it just feels like they we're randomly spat out by a generator, because they don't fit together at all. oh and godskin duo they fit thematically, but their combat design is still ass. this game is a waste of time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-13,"elden ring showed me how an open world can be renewed and make you shine for every dungeon or new location you encounter. usually open world is repetitive and soon it gets easy because your character gets over power. besides bringing all the hallmarks like difficulty and strategy, elden gives you the opportunity to build your gameplay the way you prefer, in every way. it's worth every secondpenny in this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-13,"amazing game, world design is stunning, fights are challenging and the eldritch horrors this game offers are out of this world, the lore of the game is as deep as all previous from software games. in short a masterpiece in gaming"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-13,"not dark souls 2 level but close. fromsoft went to far and didnt deliver. a game this big was a challange and the fail miserably. something smaller and more conatined might have been better. lots of reused content and i dont mean like once or twice i mean like 2530  is reapeated. difficulty is incredibly uneven, probably the hardest game in series without summons but with summons is by far the easiest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-12,"the first thing you should pay attention to is how the game works technically. many bloggers complained about extremely poor optimization and constant fps drops, i played on a patched version and noticed such moments infrequently, well, literally 3 times in the whole game, the fps is quite adequate at high graphics settings more than 70 mostly rtx 2070 s, however, there is one thing in the game there is vertical synchronization, which cannot be removed physically at all such a function is simply not available in the settings, and i had to download a mod that fixes this case, for the 2022 game, this is simply unacceptable,in my opinion. cons of the game the balance is dead, if you are underpumped, you  hard, if you are overpumped, then your opponents , the map is divided in its complexity extremely strangely and even counterintuitively in places, there are no hints on the complexity of the regions and where to go next. the only chance to understand the complexity of the area is to personally experience it on your own skin, if they  too much, then most likely you will have to come here a little later. but the main disadvantage of such a design is not even situations where you come to a certain region and they write out the rules for you there, but situations where you easily pass the plot boss for 1 try, due to the fact that you came to him too late in my case, it was with rennala. there are also just very strong builds and frankly weak builds, playing with a magician or through katanas on the bloodstream, you will make your life very much easier, yes, you can pump it, but the dominance of blood, frost and any magical stuff is too prevalent, and as a result we see that despite the huge variety of clothes, ashes, weapons, prayers, amulets, most play  the same. the plot, as for me, it's not here at all there is some semblance of it, purely for show, in order to justify the gameplay itself. quests are finally a separate topic, in order to fulfill them, you need to be superintelligent and think like babazaki, no quest magazines for you, purely developing memory, kids, no question marks either , as a result, for the whole game i completed 2 quests, rennie and someones else, the witch quest itself was interesting, but it was hard to pass without guides , like all the other quests, and imagine if there was a cool plot in this game and the quests are more intuitive, it would probably be 10 out of 10 game. melancholy and despondency in the second half of the game. you spend the first ten hours in the game with pure buzz and excitement, then, when you already understand everything that is here and how it works, when you start meeting the same bosses in almost identical dungeons, when you are already tired of running around with the same blades half the game, you start to get bored... i was able to remove this boredom only by finding a new katana. i found a bunch of weapons and cool things for magicians there, strongmen, but not for my build bosses almost all the story bosses are cool, even the stuffy bastard elden beast, for whom i'm sick of running around the arena, optional bosses, with rare exceptions, are rather a waste of your time, the same type of  knights, different crystal guys, divine skin guys, guardians of the tree, and the fact that they are constantly mixedmade double doesnt make it more fun. crafting system what for? i literally used it a couple of times pros of the game art design, there are a lot of very beautiful and sticky locations in the game, the time of day also brings something special to the atmosphere, this is basically one of the most beautiful games that i've been through. as already mentioned earlier about bosses, for the most part they are still very cool, in any case, you will need to learn the moveset, some other features of the boss. the only thing of course, almost all the bosses in the game seem to be on some kind of speed, they are super aggressive, i don't even know how to survive here in heavy armor, so it's sometimes difficult to do without calling dust, which will take the boss on itself. gameplay a very skilldependent game, which i, of course, like many, really like it. there are a lot of different options for how to split up this or that mob  boss, a lot of builds, etc.,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"average by the numbers dark souls like, not much new here besides the horse riding and the open world nature of the game which at times did make the whole experience a bit unfocused. overall a decent game bogged down by poor performance and asset recycling that to my knowledge never got this egregiously transparent in any of the previous from software games"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"honestly, i don't understand it. the souls games just don't appeal to me. this is probably the best one of the bunch, and yet, it did not do anything for me. nice world design and atmosphere though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"elden ring isn't just a game, it's a work of art. it is certainly one of the best games ever created by mankind. i understand that it doesn't suit all players, but no game does. in its niche, elden ring is king. challenging combat level, it is necessary to learn and master the controls, you can create your build as you see fit for your style of gameplay. as for exploration, you are rewarded every 40 seconds walking or riding around the map hidden items, unique enemies, bosses, spells, materials... your experience will be unique when playing this game, because the possibilities are endless. my wish and dream is for all arpg games to use elden ring as the basis for their development. all in all, the best game i've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"great worldbuilding, great music and amazing boss design, but too easy in comparison to the dsseries. do not play any soulsborne on mouse and keyboard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,there is one word that can describe this game in all the glory masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"souls.     ,     .     ,     ! ,    ... ,           ?    ! , from software!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"first soulslike ive played and first game in a while, wich was worth being completed. cant remember the last game that was as fun as elden ring. and very important point it is a finished game. you dont buy ingame via microtransactions or dlc expansions. you buy the game  you get the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,"i am not good at it, but it has the feeling of a truly hand crafted master work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,sure it has its issues but they are easily patched and nothing like others that are coming out recently. this was the first from software title that i have thoroughly enjoyed i don't see myself putting any less than 500 hours into this game it is a brilliant masterpiece and i'm looking forward to what's next from them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-11,2022ea
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-10,"absolute masterpiece. the performance on pc has improved since launch, though it's not perfect yet. my only critique is the multiplayer feature. if you're expecting a good coop experience, you'll be disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-10,"3 months after the launch and the game hasn't been properly patched. not even close. that's just sad  disappointing. i'm will try to make it short and understandable 1. the game is build on the same engine as ds3 which was released in 2016. game should not run with glitches, frame drops and crashes. but it does. 2. fromsoft always had problems with camera but this time they managed to make it worse. mindblowing talent. in er when you lockon to enemy and turn camera your lockon will switch to whatever it wants even though autolockon is off. sometimes this garbage can lockon to enemies behind the walls. sometimes it straight out will refuse to lockon to a target that is in front of your face. 3. fromsoft made huge world but had no idea how to fill it. so they just started copypasting enemies and bosses. especially bosses. some of them you can kill more than 5 times. if you think that bosses change somehow  no. their hp and dmg just get an increase. 4. exploration becomes really tedious and boring. because you either get no rewards for it or reward is absolute garbage. repetitive dungeons with repetitive bosses. 5. starting areas almost have no armor and no weapons. only after 4050 hours i started getting weaponry for my stats. huge specific area was riddled with it. by that time i settled for specific weapon and had no desire to try new ones, nor i had upgrade materials to invest in new toys. 6. end game is an epitome of unbalance. your stats mean  copypasted enemies from startgame locations which can kill you in three hits with bloated health. absolutely bs bosses with endless combo attacks which can kill you in 23 hits with several phases. fromsoft definitely  the bed with this one. i still have hopes that all these issues will be resolved in coming year. if not  it's gonna be the worst soulsborne game to date. ds2 will be removed from its throne. this review comes from a person who spent more than 1k hours between ds1, ds3 and bb. cheers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,"don't know why all the pcgamer community is whining. elden ring took the botw formula, extended and perfected it. best boss fights in any from software game with adaptive difficulty, sprawling, bustling landscapes with secrets in every corner. picked up the game and couldn't stop playing for 3 days."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,"it's a solid game but it has a few serious flaws that stop me from enjoying the game. first of all, i don't think the framerate drop is as bad as others say. my average fps is 5060 fps, sometimes dropping to 3040 fps. although, the fps hiccup during the boss fight is seriously annoying. however, elden ring's pc port is honestly terrible, what i can't stand is the user interface, especially as a mouse and keyboard player. for example 1. some functions can't rebind, ex the map can only be opened by pressing g. 2. you can't use the mouse on the map, the mouse is useless why?. 3. can't change the camera with a mouse when talking, can only use a keyboard. weird 4. the mounted combat, why the  is the left mouse attacking the right side, and vice visa. did they even test the game before release? why i can't rebind the key? where is the god damn patch? what frustrated me the most is that they improve the user interface on the dark souls iii and sekiro pc port, but then go backward to the dark souls ii. sadly, just like the dark souls ii pc port and its many issues, it will most likely never get fixed. sadly, you just need to get used to it. update one major issue, please bring back the old dark souls covenant system, the world is empty and lifeless without invasion. you can't really be a good guy if there is no bad guy, the blue cipher ring the new darkmoon is broken because no one really bothers to invade anymore. update 2  the developer fixes some serious pvp glitches and skipdialogue glitches in the new patch. good.  now we have npc marker, but it's still  you have to talk to npc first, and it disappears after they move. therefore, most of this game's content is impossible to complete without closely following with the wiki because sometimes npc would randomly and permanently die for no reason just because you explore other places. the side quest design is so ty that you would wonder if it's bugged because npc would just randomly disappear and die, and it's worse especially because it's an openworld game.  i realize a lot of the content is just copied and pasted, sometimes even thoughtlessly put two random bosses together, resulting in crappy gameplay. also, the game is very unbalanced, some gimmick bosses have an unreasonably big hitbox, extremely fast moves, very long combo literally keep iframe rolling until run out of stamina, 360 degrees 100 autoaim. i wonder if the designer really tests plays this game themselves. did they seriously throw away the dark souls online server for this halfbaked crap?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,"probably the best game i have ever played. the overall experience is very enjoyable, even after beating the game, i still want to keep playing for new game. some of the boss themes are very awesome, e.g. mohg  final boss, and other background soundtrack too, e.g. frenzied flame merchant."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,".         ..    ..  ,   ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,"this is how a game is done. no mts, no battlepass, you pay for a fuill game and you actualy get a full game! holy  gaming company's take note!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-08,"a game like a trap to catch beginners with hype. the game is unbalanced, the variety of bugs, the large field, the slow bug fixes, everything is terrible! i recommend not to buy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-08,best game of all time? yes gimme more pls mr fromsoft pls yes more characters? ok fine now
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-08,"storyline is something strange. i dont understand why miyazaki needed george martin help to make a plot for this game. miyazaki wrote bloodborne, sekiro and darks souls. they had great story. but in this game it something not that good. gameplay is done very good. i enjoy this kind of combat and rpg elements."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-07,"sekiro is my favorite game in the world, was hoping something like that but i didnt like any of this game, i took a lot of time on margit, and then i killed all the bosses of the game at the first try, unbalanced as hell. and the open world  rly hard in my opinion, not enjoyable and all the dungeons was the same."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-07,"definitely the best game to come out in the past 5 years. i think it's in the top 5 games of all time. amazing story, gameplay, music and ai. played over 200 hours and played all day every day in the release week. it's a hard game and it is supposed to be, it is fun in that sense itself, no microtransactions and only grinding ingame which keeps everything fair for everyone. amazing start, midgame and every ending, 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,yes this game was not made for everyone. elder ring creator keep up the good work.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,"incredible graphics! the npc, monsters, bosses are visually amazing! plunges you in such a great medieval atmosphere. the game is hard! but thats bringing you back to when games were games, not easy rewards loop generators! totally recommend it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,"this is the pinnacle fromsoft experience, from demon souls to dark souls to bloodborne they have distilled everything that makes their previous games special and put it into elden ring. if you are only going play one of their titles, let it be this one. in my opinion they struck a perfect balance between modernizing aspects of the game and staying true to their roots. my only two gripes about the game is 60 fps lock on pc i was pretty much expecting it at this point, but unlocked fps wouldve been a welcome break from tradition and the pvp being lackluster compared to dark souls 2 or even 3. the only people who shouldnt play this game are diehard soulsbornes fans who wont be able to accept that fromsoft is changing up their formula slightly, and people who would never consider playing any of fromsofts other titles due to the difficulty. while elden ring was much more approachable than any of the dark souls titles, its still a fromsoft game  if you cant accept that youre going to die hundreds of times to a stupid imp with a hatchet you wont ever enjoy this game. im not going full completionist with my first playthrough but ive already clocked 80 hours, and it feels like theres still so much left to discover. 910 recommending to everyone whos not a demon souls cultist or afraid of getting gud"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,esse e o jogo do ano. vai ser muito dificil algum jogo chegar no nivel para disputar com a qualidade maravilhosa do jogo.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,"i am not a souls quote on quote fan. i had the briefest of experiences with dark souls 3. fully admit i never made it past the tutorial boss. i probably was playing late and it wore on my patience and i never returned to it. elden ring then must be doing something right for me to have put 100 hours into the game so far, but that is not to say that it is flawless. going into the game i already kind of knew that it would be essentially another dark souls. but the open world intrigued me as did the art styleaesthetic. i understood that souls games can be hard, and i expected elden ring to be no different. so my expectations largely did prove correct. but there are a few areas where elden ring differs in that it makes this game more accessible to folks like me without sacrificing the difficulty the series is known for. if you have played a dark souls game before you already know what to expect here. combat is more nuanced and tactical. you have to keep an eye on not only your hp but your stamina as well as guarding and blocking are vital in avoiding getting punished by tougher enemies. i can't really speak to casting yet but my friends who are familiar with the series have noted that casting seems more fleshed out this go around. as you defeat enemies you earn runes which can then be spent to level up and improve your stats or to buy various equipment, etc. there is a robust crafting system to make use of all the materials you find out in the world. i did mention that elden ring is perhaps the best entry point for newcomers like me. if you get stuck? elden ring gives you a lot of options. you can farm some runes or go exploring and come back later. you don't have to feel like your hitting a brick wall. sometimes however that is where the fun really lies when you are at a sliver of health and you manage to land that killing blow on a tough boss. the feeling of satisfaction and the difficulty are as much a part of the game's content as the other elements that comprise it. there's a good assortment of field bosses too to test your skill and patience against. that tree sentinel will wreck you which makes killing him later so satisfying. perhaps more integral is just how expertly crafted the open world is. there are tons of things to find and do. maybe you stumble across a tree and follow a ghostly image to a secluded cave. maybe you find a chest and in trying to open it? you fall through the floor to a pit of rats. while the game has an abundance of finger and hole messages. there are a fair number of helpful messages tipping you off to devious traps. these offer up a sense of community to the game beyond just it's coop. so where does elden ring fall short? to start it's not a very well optimized game. performance can be unwieldy at times with the game dropping frames inexplicably which can lead to some unfortunate deaths. if there is another area where elden ring struggles it is it's coop. not the coop itself but how it's initiated. using a finger or what have you to hostsummon a friend is unnecessarily convoluted. why can't you just send an invite to a friend directly through steam? i've heard some say well that's just how it's always been. but does it have to be that way just because that's how it's always been? i think the game might also benefit from a quest logtracking system. not saying to add markers on screen, etc. at the very least i'd appreciate a bestiary or compendium that details the enemies and characters you have met along with the lore and story elements for them. think of witcher 3's bestiarycharacter compendium. i was pretty nervous and unsure if i would like the game after my illfated time with dark souls 3. but i have enjoyed it far more than i thought i would and hey when i've spent 100 odd hours in the game to this point? i'd say that's a win. i've now killed margit, godrick, renalla and hell even malenia yes i used summon and bleed don't judge!. my progress has been slow but it's allowed me to soak in the world and appreciate each triumph that comes through perseverance. would i recommend this to newcomers? if your going to try a souls game? or a soulslike? elden ring is probably the best place to start. a 10 doesn't mean the game is without issue. it needs better optimizationperformance. but as someone who is a souls newbie? it gets my highest recommendation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-06,"i have been playing video games since the early 90s and this is probably the best game i have played so far and i'm not a huge fan of other fromsoft titles so far. review bombing this excellent game is just wrong. anyone rating this game low probably didn't take enough time to appreciate this opus magnum. if it's your first step into the souls genre and you aren't the most stellar player you might have to deal with frustration. so this game might be a bit like a fine wine or piece of art that you can only appreciate with enough experience. but this is not an actual flaw of the game it is a problem of the person going into this game with wrong expectations it will not offer instant gratification to a newbie. also the game does not really offer accessibility options which would be a doubleedged sword as it's not really compatible with the idea of games fromsoft is making. works perfectly fine on my ryzen 1600 with rtx 3050 50 fps in the open world and stable 75 in dungeons with near max settings. my only complaint would be the lack of dlss support. this masterpiece blows any other similar game like breath of the wild out of the water. it has better graphics, sound, atmosphere, gameplay etc. they even finally managed to nail the controlsoptions almost perfect. about the story it might be basic but i think it's perfect to focus on relevant things and not waste my time with tons of text or mindless dialogue that doesn't have any relevance. show, don't tell  for me this focusedabstract way of story telling is nearly perfect. yes souls games might not be too beginner friendly. you will need to look up some info and basic mechanics like iframes and maybe watch some videos to understand how to play correctly etc. also you will need to adapt your strategy depending on the enemy and use your brain a bit. if the enemy is using a knife consider using a shield to block or parry those weak hits. if the enemy is hitting slow but hard consider dodging. if the enemy is shacking the ground maybe a nicely timed jump would be helpful to avoid the shockwave etc. overall this one is the most beginner friendly fromsoft title i have played so far and it actually offers very good and functional qol features. absolutely love it. update after finishing this masterpiece i was motivated to conquer most other fromsoft titles and for me there is no company that can deliver games on this level. if you are stuck in a fromsoft title it's almost 100 on your end because the games offer a lot of different strategies etc. for example i play all fromsoft titles including sekiro without controller, without parry and without lockon while a lot of players are stuck in a mindset that they are forced into using these mechanics or complain about struggling with the camera which was never a problem for me in any fromsoft title."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-05,"elden ring is the pinnacle of fromsoft's experience, combining both the best and worst of previous games into an open world 200hours game if you're a completionist like me, that is. it deserves neither the excessive praise from fanboys, whom at this point have become fromsoft cultists, nor the excessive hate from casual gamers. the good  fascinating storytelling, which unfortunately can be partially lost by exploring too early as this breaks various questlines. the main storyline, and storylines which lead to alternative endings, are excellent.  open world suits the dark soulsesque genre exceptionally well, while plenty of large dungeons are available in the traditional dark souls design style. large portions of these dungeons are optional and wellhidden, but also highly rewarding.  the game world is breathtakingly beautiful. ignore the complaints about the graphics these are just people used to the trope in gaming of high detailed stuff up close and ugly trash in the distance, hidden by fog or needless objects. elden ring instead emphasizes distance, giant landmarks and open plains. the thematic designs of various areas is also exceptionally aweinspiring, particularly the underground cities seen in the midlategame, though unfortunately many of these are entirely optional and somewhat hidden.  per extension of the above, and the huge amount of content in the game, exploration is absolutely amazing  perhaps the best out of any game thus far. expect to be surprised by random dungeons and unique loot nearly everywhere. the subjective  much easier than previous titles, even when compared to the original dark souls, which was also much easier than claimed in mainstream gaming journalism. er is not a hardcore gaming experience, as opposed to fromsoft's last game sekiro shadows die twice, and the lack of a difficulty setting now favors semicasual gamers, thus it turns into an annoyance to hardcore gamers.  optimized for playing with a controller. very poor support for keyboard controls you can't bind specific items or spells to specific hotkeys, thus you're stuck cycling between lists while peering at the ui to see what you're selecting. not as bad as sekiro, thankfully, since you've got plenty of time to mess up. the bad  extremely poor balance between classes. melee exclusive play forces you to learn enemies' moves and pick your fights carefully, while a mage class can just stomp through the entire game with nearzero chance of dying. some of the game's most interesting and imposing bosses can be killed in twothree casts. in other words, class decision is the game's difficulty slider, and it ranges from difficult to child's play. i expect future patches to alleviate this problem somewhat.  poor balance between early and midlate game. early on the game can be ruthless, especially if you open the first locked dungeon you find and waltz right in, yet after being given the opportunity to optimize your build it's smooth sailing, and you can go for a full fashion build without problems. you'll get to know early game enemies well, but the late game ones are just fodder. this punishes completionists, who become far more powerful than casual players would be at any given point.  as mentioned, exploration is punished by questlines randomly breaking, often without any causal reason. it just sorta happens, because.  it's nearly impossible to keep track of the various npc's quests without using the game's wiki due to a lack of an ingame journal or other hints about where to find npc's. it seems fromsoft decided on the open world design, but didn't embrace that decision when it comes to storytelling.  forced platforming. the overwhelming majority of my characters' deaths were due to falling off cliffs or into water which for some bizarre reason means instant death. there's no reason for this in a combatcentric game. like driving challenges in gtalike games, it's unnecessary and disruptive. at least in gta games the rewards for driving tend to be drivingrelated, but in er the platforming leads to combat gear, which is silly.  some of the common small dungeonscaves are so heavily copied from one another that you'll know exactly what you'll find around the corner. not a major issue, but certainly unfortunate. all in all, 810. it could've been 1010, and with some major patches it still could be  but i'm not holding my breath."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-05,after 100 i can clearly tell that this is a downgrade in every aspect except creativity to other fromsoft games. elden stutter bloat cheese  i believe that sums it up well.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-05,"huge performance problems on pc. the controls are designed for the controller and the default keyboard and mouse settings are horrible. unplayable with keyboard and mouse because most of the keys have multiple functions which you have to activate with shift. even changing the key bindings doesn't solve some problems. you still have to press multiple keys in combat, for example, when you want to call your horse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-05,"i've said it before, i'll say it again, elden ring is a remarkable game. at his point in time, i've beaten it three times. there's a few things i've seen in other reviews, and i want to address. first of all the graphics. as someone who does 3dmodelling and landscape creation, i can only marvel at the stuff from soft did. some people call it last gen... oh boy how this infuriates me. to me it's as if you call games like minecraft and cuphead ugly, because they lack raytracing. just type in elden ring vista or search for a youtube video of the graphics and you know what i mean. just as a reminder you don't need the unreal engine 5 to achieve impressive imagery. when it come to gameplay, its just plain fun. like i said, i've beaten the game three times already. the difficulty is insane, but doable, if you abandon the thought of face tanking everything. the music and voice acting are, as always, pretty freaking epic search for malenia theme and serpent king the last thing i would like to point out as something i enjoyed but some may not is the missing hand holding. where quests basically pull you through the game world. but i think this just encourages you to go out and explore, because this is a world worth exploring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-04,"i didn't finish the game, probably won't, but i did enjoy it and had a lot of fun, just for me personally i don't really wanna put weeks or months into this game when i have other games i'd prefer to be playing, i'm not much of a dark souls person but the games are enjoyable and this one was really good, i loved the free roam aspect and being able to go at your own pace, but like i said i probably won't finish the game, because i don't wanna sit there for weeks to months trying to beat it, but unlike other people who rant about the game and didn't even bother to play all of it, i did enjoy it overall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-04,"the pve experience is quite good  pvp in the other hand is not as good as the previous dark souls  has a lot of  examplethe afk rune farmer,they are some fricking idiots who's just gonna stay at some place that you just cant come to them without torrent and make you look at them and cant do anything.another problem is about the equipments in the game,there are some weapons and ashes of warskill that are impossible to punish except its user make a mistake and you cant just go for an  rivers of blood,bloodhound's step,stars of ruin,these things are busted in pvp and so op that you sometimes have to use them to win in pvp,cause theyre way more superior than  of course the bugs but they gonna fix it in the future so im not gonna talk about them. in conclusion,if youre a person who enjoy pve not pvp,youre gonna have an amazing open world game  if you want to play pvp too,i recommend you to wait for a patch that they fix most the problems that i mention above.overall,this is a awesome game,probably the best game yet in 2022 and it will not disappoint you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-03,"my first souls game. this game is simply beautiful, it is visually stunning. endless combat options keep me interested to try new specs. i've put 180 hours into it and i can see many more ahead. easily the best game i've played in recent years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-02,"this is essentially a dark souls 3, but better!  combat mechanics have been improved  graphics is just astounding  there's a lot more content than in previous games  1010 it has its issues, but what it really is is the souls game polished to the maximum, it takes everything that made previous souls games good, puts it into a single game, and even builds on top of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-01,pros  build variety  enemy designs  beautiful graphics  beautiful world map  great voice acting  atmospheric  platforming while on horse cons  malenia fight  can't open map while in combat  occasional stuttering  no inventory search or favorite
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-01,"i really wanted to love this game, but i still prefer the witcher 3. you will either love or hate this game depending on what you enjoy out of video games. if you look for a challenge where you have to work hard to make any progress in the game then you will love this game, if you look for an immersive game with an amazing story then you will hate this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-01,"the game looks great. i love the art style and animation. unfortunately, it's not for everyone. elden ring is designed for a niche audience. it's made for 1329 year old males that play video games for 12 hours a day. more importantly, it's made for people who are familiar with the dark souls franchise. if you're not a hardcore gamer and you're not familiar with the dark souls franchise, you're going to hate this game. it wasn't for me. i couldn't enjoy the play style. i hate the controls. they're clunky and unresponsive. you press the attack button and you get locked into an uninterruptable 5 second animation. some people enjoy this play style  i do not. i didn't enjoy the game play. i couldn't get into it. i refunded with less than 2 hours played."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-31,"monumental game one of the best in the last years. pros  intriguing story and breathtaking cinematics  beautiful landscapes and graphics  no performance issues for me  playing as a fairly new fromsoftware game player i could finish it with minor frustrations  difficulty was ok for me, except crucible knights some fights gave great accomplishment after longer tries  lot of content,100 hours cons  repetitive smaller dungeons  repetitive bosses sometimes you have to fight one like 3 times  sometimes really poorly designed ruthless enemies"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-30,"load bar simulator  waste your life away waiting for death load bars horse simulator  one of the best horse simulator combat games ever made. should just be called you died 50 hrs in no real progression, small rewards, and almost nonexistent story. i find myself falling asleep waiting for load times trying to memorize timing and spin attacks. i find this more boring than reading. 150 hrs in can't play it for more than an hour without getting absolutely bored with the content. overall score  bad game. 210. it could have been so much better if they added a difficulty bar and scaled the bossesmonsters. instead the bossesmonsters are levellocked and later endgame bosses are a repetitive nightmare. you can enjoy the game if you get to level 300, but then you one shot all the lower level bosses because of levellock."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-28,"i haven't played much, but right now i can confirm that game optimisation . with mine i511400f and rtx 3050 on low settings frame rate on open world surely on dungeons fps is higher is jumping over 3555 fps. and that's even i wasn't talking about 60 fps cap. this game needs so much fixes for pc idk how's going on on consoles. and optimisation is the main task! imho"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-28,"after fully completing the game and putting in 140 hours, i think the critics nailed it, this game really is an open world masterpiece which is guaranteed to influence open world rpgs and maybe even open world shooters moving forward. the artistic, design, sound, exploration, immersion, combat, lore, enemyareabossweaponspell variety and size of the world are literally off the charts. it's also challenging while not being unfair and it gives you options to trivialise absolutely anything if you have no interest in the challenge. if they had charged 100 ea or ubisoft would have it would be understandable but at 60 it's a steal. this game is almost certainly going to win goty 2022."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-27,"i really wanted to like this game, but it was impossible it's not soulslike is literally the same dark souls again, the same game with new enemies and a new map. the combat is quite boring, movements feel imprecise, very clunky, combat feels boring when you have to spend most of the time defending, i'm sure there are people that enjoy rolling most of the time of a combat but i don't, this feels just too boring and old for being a 2022 game, same goes with graphics, the performance for the visuals are bad, so the result is a game that feels 67 years old."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-24,"wait for a sale so you don't feel committed to it. i can understand a person liking this game if your expectations from openworld games are low because, well, that's honestly just me trying to throw the masses a bone with this game. the truth is i don't like it. my time doesn't feel efficiently spent and i swear i've spent twice as long playing it as the game says i have. never a good sign. i'm not a fromsoftware veteran whatsoever, but my experience with openworld games is extensive, so i judge the game on those merits. the things i heard fromsoftware did well in past games are present here, which namely are the combat mechanics. combat against normal enemies and minibosses is more fun and engaging than in most games. apparently their level design is lauded too though which i would never know playing elden ring. it's a really boring open world if i'm being completely honest. exploration is deincentivized pretty quickly because i never feel amply rewarded for it. maybe that's not the point but why make this an openworld game then? there are no interesting characters to find, talk to, and gain a sense of direction from, but there are odd merchant beings hiding in unlikely places for some reason and in the roundtable hold, which i don't otherwise see the point of and you're forced to go there very early in the game in a jarring fashion, and the meager things i do find aren't impressive. maybe once you've mastered the mechanics, the ashes of war pickups are more valuable, but i'm still learning the game when i have five of them in my inventory, and from what i can tell they make my weapon stats worse. i tried them as a curiosity and while some of them do cool things, storm stomp feels useless and makes any weapon it's attached to worse  i trusted the game not to do that to me and ruined a good weapon in the process. i like the rune system overall but i don't wanna grind for them to get a new weapon. all this is my observation as someone who isn't aware of the mechanics behind the scenes when i first try it. i don't want to feel like i need to go rng mode when i'm first experiencing the game. you also don't feel like you have much choice but to invest all your levelup points into certain stats, at least earlygame, so character creativity is stifled if not entirely sacrificed. you like story? good like finding one here. become the elden lord ain't exactly gonna propel me like a rocket through any game. this world and this universe are boring without a decent narrative. sorry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-24,one of the best videogames i have ever played in this decade. inmense and rich
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-23,"probably the best open world in a game to date. there is so much to do and see, that is leaves other open worlds to shame. gameplaywise, it's what you expect out of a souls game, but with more depth and variety. the rewards for dungeons or other challenges can be a hit or miss sometimes cool stuff that you want, sometimes useless things, but the journey not the destination is very much applied. the end game has a major spike in difficultymostly enemies doing absurd amounts of damage, but it is still a very very satisfying experience. highly recommend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-23,"the game is good, excellent sound design, locations, variety of weapons. she pulled me in for lot of days. but on the technical side, the game is 5 years outdated. havok in 2022? really? something needs to be done with the game engine, physics alone is annoying to the point of impossibility."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-22,"elden ring is a massive, open world soulslike game which works way better than i thought it ever would. the story is pretty vague at surface level and some of the side quests can be hard to follow without a guide, but the gameplay is so good and the amount of things to fight and places to see is great. the feeling of discovery you get from this game is unparalleled, in the sense that there's always something to find. main issue for me is pc optimization is pretty rough and the lack of a pause function."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-21,"elden ring is a perfect example for the things running wrong in the gaming community in the last years. this game is by far overrated! a generic open world with problematic controls which let you die again and again because the controls cannot live up to the high standard the developers set for itself. i really cannot understand gamers which like to waste a lot of time for very less progress in a game. are they all unemployed with no families or what?!! on the other side they blame the developers of a far more complex and more difficult to develop game like f.e. battlefied 2042. in my eyes bf2042 is on a far higher level in technical, mechanical and controllable matters than this elden ring crp."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-20,"video games are supposed to do two things entertain and give fun. the souls saga fails in both. its a game which will keep you frustrated, because it's unfairly hard, and even after a lot of effort, when you manage to kill the bosses, there is no good sensation, just a relief from a bad sensation that the game caused itself. i am really needing good games lately, and buying dark souls 3 and elden ring was a big mistake. don't waste your money with this kind of game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-20,"one of the biggest titles of the decade. if i had to decide, i'd go with this over breath of the wild, f link."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-20,"during the first playthrough of the game, masterpiece encourages you to explore the lands between. it is rather tricky than impossible to progress through the story while only defeating the shard bearers. exploring the game and discovering new items that the game awards you for being curious, different ways of approach produce different outcomes that reward your craftiness. defeating the miniboss and the main boss feels satisfying while you learn their move sets. the map itself is an artwork yet unforgiving, you will traverse the land encountering new mobs while adjusting as to how you should plan out your journey"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-19,"as my first souls game, i wasn't sure if i was going to like elden ring or not. however, after playing it, i can confidently say that this game is one of the best i've played. this is one of the few games where dying does not feel frustrating but fun. furthermore, the game allows for huge playstyle customizability. on the other hand, i found the story to be uninteresting. in addition, there is no quest log, which in my opinion makes the experience of doing sidequests worse. lastly, the pc performance can be laggy, but not to a degree that it makes the game harder or unplayable. despite some minor flaws, i would recommend this game to even newcomers."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-19,"this is the best game i have ever played. no joke. i've never even played another fromsoft game besides the first dark souls which i didn't even beat. the gameplay is terrifyingly addictive, the world and the lore is so deep i could soak in it for hours. there are characters you actually  care about and quests you devote too many hours to. the soundtrack is outrageously beautiful and the game itself is stunning to look at, graphically and artistically. i don't think many games out there deserve a 1010 but this is absolutely one i have no doubts about giving it to."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-16,"if you see a 1010 they are definitely fromsoft fanboys. this game is nowhere near 1010, especially the pc version. the single player game is a 6 to 710 max and even that is generous. the constant crashing, the lower quality graphicsfor 2022 the graphics should be a lot better than this, the need to google everything about everything in the game, and the reused assetsyou will fight the same boss over and over again after midgame is why i cannot give this higher than a 7. i am not a graphics nerd. i don't need it to be life like for me to enjoy itheck i still go back and play atari games sometimes, but the graphics, while good, are no where near the quality of even god of war which came out over 4 years ago. look no further that the fact that this releasedand still as of this date with no widescreen mode. if you have a nice curved 3440 monitor than this game will only serve to piss you off with the huge black bars on the sides. it has a bad problem with crashing constantly. it seems to happen the most when i use the map. no fix yet as of writing this. the need  search bar integrated into this game is a huge fault. i don't need my hand to be held with my games, but when i can't understand what something does and there is no repository for it in the game, then there is a huge problem. there is zero quest tracking, not nearly enough info on what things do, the amount they do and the time in which they do said thing and no journal to look at to remember what's been saiddone. this adds nothing to the game and in fact detracts from it to the point that it makes the devs look extremely lazy, to not add even the most basic of info on things, or they did it to pad the games play time. the reuse of assets gets really bad after midgame, the same boss you fought earlier will make an appearance, it's not if they will, it's when. the multiplayer is straight garbage and is why i gave a 510 instead of a 7. the multiplayer, hooo boy, where to begin... first, this is not a coop game. it's a pvp game with coop elements. you don't get to just hop in with a friend, oh no, you have to furl a finger and wave some mist around first, and if your friend has beaten the boss of the area it's a no go, you can't join them. also be prepared to get invaded by a guy who is maxed out on everything and is in new game  16 with op weapons and skills and 1 shots you, or someone lag switching and warping everywhere so your hits don't land but when they hit it's always a crit or backstab, or a straight up cheater who will invade just to corrupt your save so you have to start all over again. sounds fun huh? wanna play with just your friend and run around and have fun? too bad! this is fromsoft beeeeouch! if i would have known how bad the horrible coop mode is i would not have purchased the game. so no, this is far from goty and any 1010 score. take off the fromsoft rose colored glasses and get a reality check if you think it is. even with all this the single player mode is still pretty enjoyable, but these problems are, for some reason, completely overlooked because it's a fromsoftsouls like game by all these 1010er's. do you think they would overlook all this for anyone else? i seriously doubt it. i have an unfurled finger for you fromsoft, wanna guess which one?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-15,"games pretty good. i don't think it's a masterpiece nor do i think it's as good as people say it is, but i still enjoyed my time with it for the most part. keep in mind, while i am gonna write more cons than i do pros, the pros still outweigh the cons in my opinion. pros fun combat great graphics interesting world the weapon artash of war system is pretty interesting and fun to mess around with cons bad pc performance overall badlazy bosses there are some good ones and some great ones, but they are far outnumbered by the ones that just aren't fun. many bosses do this annoying thing where every time you get close they attack and back up from you to get out of your reach, making it feel like the boss is more scared of you than you are of them. it's annoying and not fun reusing bosses both from previous games and reusing bosses multiple times in this game a lot atrocious balancing end game enemies do way too much damage for what is reasonable, even at 2nd softcapped vigor you still get 2 shot by nearly everything pvp is bad, mainly due to the poor balancing i will admit it can still be fun, but i still think its pretty objectively bad certain mechanics are just really annoying and add nothing, such as not being able to teleport at the beginning of caves or not being able to open the map if an enemy 12 football fields away is staring you down like bruh just disable fasttravel, not the entire damn map lack of quality of life features such as a quest log or elevation changes being poorly displayed on the map many areas are either lame or just outright annoying, such as the mountaintop of the giants or elphael in closing, this game has many flaws but is still pretty good. i wanted to go further in depth into the cons because most others seem to sweep them under the rug. overall, i would recommend this game, but just take the 1010s with a significant portion of salt"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-15,beautiful and fun game. if you like a challenge you won't regret playing this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-15,"i love rpg games, however this game made me want to uninstall straight away. it is a big waste of time and money. not intuitive for new players, no story. just an open world where small rats can kill you and make you lose progress. disgusting. how can this be the game of 2022?? i rather play tetris than this crap"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-15,"elden ring isnt perfect. comparing this game to other fromsoftware products one aspect after another its clear that elden ring isnt as smooth as sekiro, doesnt have bosses like dark souls, and its story isnt as good as bloodborne, but looking this way at anything will make no sense, you simply do not order salad in subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad. were thrown in fractured world only hundred years after the , war that no demigod came out victorious leaving lands between in stalemate. were tarnished, once stripped from the grace of greater will and exiled, coming back to lands between, resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from, with one goal  to become the elden lord. to summarize how big lands between are i will say only this theres always more. elden ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level, this already sounds like enormous place. but wait, theres more  each part has legacy dungeons, big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place. there are also catacombs, minor erdtrees, ruins, villages, and so on. it is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through. still not enough? there is literally 3 major underground locations, each bigger than the last one. and for the dessert  whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of lands between. fromsoftware creates dark fantasy and i, personally, think that currently theres no one in the industry better at doing so. the most important part for some, especially if advertised as action rpg. just a reminder, youre tarnished, a nobody with a simple task to become the elden lord, against various demigods, with a stick and wooden shield. the game is not easy. it is not the hardest fromsoftware game, but its still hard, especially for newcomers. will you get bored? i dont think theres a chance to get bored in this game, even with such simple combat mechanics, because theres also variety of builds, with easily over 200, probably even more weapons, over 100 armor sets for your fresh elden bling, and many more configurations with new addition  ashes of war. if thats not enough, lets talk about variety of enemies. remember seeing total of 19 enemies in god of war from 2018, winner of game of the year? theres over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other except for reskins, not many of them though. i am malenia, blade of ashina, and hasitation is defeat. tldr  the game is the only rightful choice for game of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-14,elden ring memberikan eksplorasi yang sangat baik dalam game open world. kebebasan dalam bagaimana cara untuk menjelajah gamenya membuat pemain memiliki banyak cara untuk menamatkan gamenya. variasi build yang sangat banyak juga menambah kebebasan dalam game ini. 9.610
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-13,"disappointment story what story? something about fight bosses and become a lord, bland and boring. there is memorable character, i found the let me solo her cosplay player more memorable. graphic hello 2003 graphic, there is a reason why things are dark and hazy, to hide all the outdated graphic. sound there was sound and music? i cant recall. game mechanic not difficult at all like everyone else is saying but certainly very frustrating, no save, loss of hard earn runes, chunky movement with a lot of platform jumping, bad ui design and control."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"the majority of the game is very fun and addictive but, and this is a huge but, the boss design and balancing is insanely bad, certain bosses are made to be roadblacks that must be faced, there are some that actually punish you for not cheesing them, there are loads that are way too aggressive so they literally leave no room to get an attack in and some builds will have no way to counter them until after they somehow beat the boss. there are a lot of places where you will, without warning, end up teleported and stuck, unable to level up, reallocate flasks, upgrade anything, so you can end up losing your save if you get sent in unprepared which goes against exploration because there is no way of knowing when or if you're strong enough without entering and then you can't leave. there is a lot of that and it really ruins the experience and flies in the face of the dust yourself off and try again appeal of these games when a lot of bosses actually have nothing to do with skill, if you have the wrong build, you just may not be able to react fast enough to do anything without being killed as a result, you went caster? tough luck, you literally have no time to charge your spells. you went tanky with a shield? tough luck, this boss does a room length piercing attack that will stagger through the best gear available until after them and then they go into a one shot combo before you can control your character again and they patched out one early material could have let you upgrade one gear piece, like your shield, so you wouldn't stagger, could dodge the combo and then punish but instead we have this because boss design and balancing . the fact even diehard players went after the material because without that upgraded piece, some builds could not beat the boss blocking them from progessing the story and accessing other areas, or at least would require such perfect play, it's beyond what even a souls style game can realistically ask. in summary, the good is very good but the bad will make this game literally unbeatable for a lot of people."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"a masterpiece. don't trust people who bought the game only to hate it. tho all those who say the game is too hard i would like to remind that you literally find two gamebreaking invocations the ashes on the path to the first boss. if only they would be so kind as to try them instead of just quitting after the third try on margit against wich you also have yet another summon then maybe they would realize that this game really is an approachable game for everyone. but i don't think that's gonna happen unfortunately, since people who make such shallow reviews probably don't even have the will to seriously try the game before insulting it here..."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-11,"not your average open world assasins creedhorizonesque type of game. this is basically dark souls but huge. it's not for everyone, and it doensn't have to be. it's a unique type of experience, even for a dark souls aficionado like me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-11,"after playing loot of crap from bethesda,ubisoft,ea ...etc this is so god and do not copy anyone after long time and after 2015 witcher 3 ...finally proper rpg"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-10,"a wonderful open world experience...unforgiving and uncompromising, sometimes a little bit too much. but overall satisfying and i'll look fondly back at my 300 hours and multiple playthrough's. ignore all the mewling  moaning about graphics, its totally fine. the games vista's and scenery is awesome. the music is great, the atmosphere of danger and exploration is probably one of the strong points of the game. the combat is not for everyone, although once you get over the difficulty and start getting used to the controls and mechanics it becomes more comfortable, but it still requires some investment. the ui is rather plain, sparse and dull, and not the greatest. the story is actually great, although its told really sparsely and too cryptically for my liking, and that would be my main gripe. there is no journal or record keepinglogging of quests and clues, so you have to use a wiki or keep notes. which i also felt was kind of unnecessary. but ultimately a good game, just not too big a fan of some mechanics and features of souls like games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-10,"best game ever. a beautiful world, so many things to discover with no quest marker or anything, this is your story you go wherever you want. a lot of replayability with many ends and builds possible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-10,"i enjoy it very much. thank god it runs on rx 580 smoothly. control is understandable, and the progression system is excellent. easy to follow, yet at the same time, it offers high level of freedom. this reminds me of the witcher 3. easily 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-09,"elden ring just another legendary game ever , but pc still some graphic problem need to fix , if u really like dark souls 2 , u should try it , i think elden ring more like dark souls 2 became a open world game but in fantasy type ,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-08,"optimization, fromsoft  on their fans with how bad it is optimized for pc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-08,perfect game.absolute peak of from software games. the sheer amount of content available for the player to explore is absurd.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"elden ring is fromsoft taking great things from all of their other games and melding them into one, but also made it open world and bumped the quality from 10 to 11. the combat is basically ds3 but better, which is great. bb and sekiro still have better combat though. the world design is their best ever, the side characters are their best ever. the boss design is mostly on par with their best imo. there are like 5 bosses that contend with my all time favorites from the other games. the open world is probably the best i've experienced. also has the best qol features by far. i do still have some complaints though. there is a lot of boss reusing, but its 99 in side content so i don't really mind. some boss attacks are kinda bs. and theres a lot of groupgank bosses that are very obnoxious, mostly in side content but there is one story one in particular that everyone despises."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"bisher das beste dark souls spiel berhaupt. ich wrde es noch ein ticken besser als bloodborn einschtzen. wrde mir aber fr den nachfolger doch wieder ein geschlosseneres areal bzw. eine erfahrung wnschen, wie der entwickler sich es gedacht hat. durch die vielzahl an hilfen, wusste ich nicht, ob die bosse zu leicht, ich zu hoch gelevelt war oder meine waffe mein build einfach nur op. aber alles in allem ein must play, eines der besten spiele berhaupt bisher."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"ok after skyrim, elden ring is the game of the decade for me ! its not for everyone, its hard, you will die too many times but this is the game. pros storyline by george martin with vague quests, no help, no markers, the game tells you go f you, go find everything yourself 1010 gameplay dark souls formula, many weapons, many strategies watch youtube 1010 quantity with quality these words together is very hard to find in games nowadays, many games will have only one of them, but elden ring have them both with no extra cost, no payments just free content to play 1010 graphics the graphics are not so good as the latest pc games but the drawing of the scenary is mindblowing, too many places, unique every one of them 810 diss bad pc port unfortunately the pc port is not perfect, i have gforce 1070 titan, i didnt had a lot of lag, only sometimes for a second but there are other with much more lag, with graphic cards much more stronger than me. from software should give the same quality in performance as the ps5 version, there are no excuses here, we are talking for a game witch every second matters between victory  death. 610"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"despite my love for such games, i, surprisingly, disappointed. basically all the problems come from open world.... prehistoric dungeon design, inconsistent enemies type and group, open fields of pure nothing and lack of motivation lead to the fact that after some time you just started skipping most of the battles, and simply run out of interest. in the end lack of sense of progression and direction just killed whole mood. and that's all without reminding about soulslike storytelling, which is very subjective. ps i really miss carefully designed classic levels. ps ps let's forget about the widespread reuse of materials by developers... or not..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-06,longtime fan of souls series and this was over the top masterpiece dont know what they can do next i think this was their peak. optimalization on pc is not very good but still that couldnt scare me off to enjoy this peak of gaming industry to finish it. hands to the best game i ever played. 1010 deserved
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-05,"el titular es el siguiente el souls definitivo, est claro que la evolucin es esta y no otra, el mundo abierto le di un golpe de aire fresco a la obra de miyazaki, rompiendo as por otro lado el teln de una saga de nicho, este es un juego disfrutable tanto para el jugador habitual como el casual e invita seguir explorando los otros mundos oscuros de fromsoftware. por otro lado a pesar de que mi nota sea alta no est exento de problemas y problemas como por ejemplo que los enemigos y miniboses se repiten y mucho a lo largo de la aventura, la cmara sigue traicionando como en anteriores entregas y te llevars ms de un susto con este tema. en definitiva un juegardo muy recomendado por mi parte y si eres fan del gnero compra obligada."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-05,"as others reviewers mentioned, the pc version is super . it doesnt support uw screen and the instructions of control button is confusing. otherwise it can be a good game. play on ps5 if you want to enjoy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-05,"this game is great! the landscapes look stunning, the gameplay is fun and intense, the bosses are all hard but fair, and the classes and weapons all are very creative and fun to use. my only complaints are liurnia of the lakes and the pc port being eh. first off, liurnia is a nightmare to traverse. mountainous areas in this game just doesn't work. you have to contantly look at you map to see where to go when all of the other areas feel like you don't even need the map. easily my least favorite area because at least with gelmir, you get a bunch of ladders. my second complaint is with some performance issues. it is very clear this game was meant for console. the game will sometimes drop frames for no reason i have a very good pc especially during bosses which is the last time you want frame drops. this game is exellent, but if you want the full experience, play on console. i have put nearly 200 hours into this game and i only got it recently. my fullest recommendation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-05,"my first souls like game and im blown away. the sheer content in this game is mindboggling. its not easy, but feels very rewarding when you get an upgrade or defeat a boss. easily game of the year. edit i just finished it after 160 hours and it was a epic journey. 1110"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-04,everything a game should be. you never run out of ways to die and things to find.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-04,"man..what a journey elden ring was. yeah, sure, there was a lot of hype surrounding the game, and i knew i was going to play it day one. and yeah, sure, i knew it was gonna be good. ive played every title fromsoftware has dropped, so i knew what to expect. what i didnt expect, however, is that elden ring would blow my expectations right outta the effin water. where do i even start? huge open world. nooks and crannies freakin galore. secrets. dungeons. secret dungeons. i mean, you name it, theyve already thought about it and put in this damn game. this is a world begging to be explored. because if you do, you will absolutely stumble upon something. a weapon, armor set, spell, whatever. this game rewards you in so many different ways. and the worldholy hell, just beautifully crafted intricate, in fact. the world is your oyster. play however you want, go in any direction you want, fight whoever you want. it simply will not hold your hand. from the very moment you step foot into the first area, the game simply tells you, go. i got huge breath of the wild vibes, and that is a beautiful thing to have that much freedom at your fingertips. here are my gripes. for the pc version, the performance is hit or miss. the game runs great the vast majority of the time, but ive run into frame rate drops, hiccups, and freezes every so often. dungeons will recycle bosses, so i wish there was more variety there. main bosses are a friggin nightmare. they will one hit kill you, or assault you with relentless combos, and have long range and devastating area of effect attacks. maybe i need to get good, but somewhere in the back of my mind while fighting these bosses i felt like the relentless amount of attacks thrown at you and damage scaling could use some tweaking. elden ring is not just a lover letter to the soulsborne genre, but a love letter to gaming in general. it has been a long time where i have been truly absorbed in a game. i very, very rarely try and unlock trophies in any game. this was an exception. i unlocked every trophy. elden ring set the standard and set the bar really, really high. this is what games should strive to be like. it really was a pleasure to play and experience this, and i hope fromsoftware continues to follow this formula with their future projects. although i had an issue or two with this game, elden ring is perfection. this is a masterpiece, and you would be remiss not to play this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-04,"absolutely incredible game, easily one of the best games i've ever played. yes, it's difficult, yes, there is a lot of bs, but if you have the balls to keep playing after the 2nd boss, you figure out why critics are giving it a 1010. it's simple. very few games give you as much freedom in the open world as elden ring does. exploration is the name of the game here. a boss too hard? go explore the world, become stronger and kick it's ass. that being said there are issues here. some areas of the game cough divine tower of caelid will make you wonder wtf were they thinking. and while most bosses are fun and interesting, the fire giant just... is not. people have also complained about performance issues which i haven't personally experienced and i play the game on linux, so yeah idk what's with that. there are also a few areas of the game that are a bit annoying to explore, the story is a bit confusing, especially if you don't progress as intended you can end up skipping a lot of story. overall, great game 9.510"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-04,"a genuine masterpiece coming from a studio that has kept improving their games each time. this game is a culmination of all their past experiences. being an avid souls fan, this game was truly a love letter for me. venturing into the genre of an open world game must have been challenging, but fromsoft has proved yet again that love for one's work will always leads to successful results. this game does not hold your hands at all. after completing the tutorial, the player is immediately pushed into a world full of epic vistas and exhilarating challenges that, once completed provide a sense of grandeur and glory. this adventure towards becoming the elden lord will truly be a beautiful journey provided that you stick with it even when the obstacles seem immovable. truly a must play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,amazing game when compared to other open world rpgs out there. very innovative and course setting
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,"if you are a sunday player or moron who likes only easy games, please leave it and stop giving ones and twos. game is genius, best game i ever played, equali with terraria. after 130 hours i still have a lot, i mean a lot of things to go thru, still being like idk 50100 hoursbto the ending"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,if i had to sum this game up in one word it's exhausting. the sloppy platforming makes exploration a stressful mess where enemies are far less threatening than a 3 inch jump. that being said it's mostly good but this issue really brings down the experience.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-02,best game of all time and to all the people who give this game a low score you are just braindead!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-02,cons boring. parry doesn't work. you need to do a lot of work to make you own fun and read into no story at all. the hate keyboardmouse users. runs awful on pc. pros beautiful game and great enemy design.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-02,"let me start by saying that i platinumed all previous soulsborne games, and i really wanted to like this game. the first areas are great, you can explore, there are dungeons, bosses and secrets, but it gets stale really quick unfortunately. the first area is by far the most interesting part of the open world, after that it takes a huge dip in quality late game areas almost made me uninstall the game, and not because of difficulty but for lack of interest i know bare and depressing atmosphere is their thing, but it doesn't work in an open world setting, the combat is great and varied with the addition of weapons arts, but it seriously lacks balance it's extremely easy to make an op build that renders most bosses a joke. the lore is legit dark souls copy pasted. yeah i know that may not be a bad thing for some, but when they said they are done with dark souls and wanted to create something new, i thought they meant it.. and finally, and what really triggered me was the side quests, the system in the previous games was always stupid, as you couple easily fail a questline simply by doing something before talking to some npc you didn't even notice, although that was more or less tolerable as the game was somewhat linear, but stick with the same quest system in a huge open world where you are meant to explore new areas in no particular order is beyond silly. overall, i think this was a failure and it's better they avoid open world games in the future if they can't actually fill their world with something interesting, not going to even address the optimization..."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-01,"wow! two months have passed since the release and i haven't had enough of this work of art yet, let's take it in order.. 155 h nikita47744 steam visual it is impossible to evaluate the work of artists and the level of designers in any way other than great. despite the general oppressive background that permeates the whole world, individual locations hide a separate history and a unique atmosphere liburnia of the lakes  the atmosphere of a magical lake. caeli  once the great plains of the stargazers, but destroyed by red rot. altus plateau is the concentration of great will, the center of power, order and wealth... etc.. only the winter location loses its tone and uniqueness, but it also has its own identity. the main method that miyazaki chose to influence the player is gigantism. you literally feel like a grain of sand in this vast world. coupled with the fact that every living being in this world is trying to kill you, you literally consider yourself lost and oppressed in this world miazaki has achieved his goal gameplay a huge number of variations of the style of play a huge number of unique weapons a solid number of bosses even more diverse movement sets here it is worth touching on the problem of reuse to create absolutely unique bosses for this whole huge world would require 67 years of development, and the passage of this game would be delayed for 150200h you just couldn't get used to this world my opinion is that familiar opponents serve as a way to test their abilities and consolidate previous lessons in memory there are still frankly broken builds among the builds, but the developers are working on solving this problem. plot i am amazed by the number of new players who complain about his absence and incomprehensible pitch, well, welcome to miazaki games lol the central branch  rennie's quest is a small masterpiece, i think martin worked on this branch and it's good. without taking into account rennie's quest, the plot also looks quite holistic if you want to become a lord, you have become one in this case, the plot works, but it becomes easier. additional quests are just telling a story that fits the tone of the game and contribute to the disclosure of the world, i would call them functional, although i have imbued with many stories all this together makes it possible to say that miazaki understands perfectly well what the players want from him and he gave it to them. huge fame and big sales will surely give the green light to the sequel. but as a first attempt into the open world 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-01,"here goes my rewiew for me, elden ring is the best game i ever played. i have never been so addicted to a game. it is a game that do it good. the best of this game are the bosses and his openworld. but it has some gaps that i think that can be avoided. there are a lot of optional bosses repeated throughout the world from catacombs to prisons. another thing that i think that it can be avoided is the optimization of the game. sometimes it drops from 60fps to 17 without any warning. but i need to told you that this game is worth it. it's difficult because is a fromsoftware game but one friend told me that this game is the easiest of all fromsoftware games. and it is true. this game have sections that are a wall like the firstboss battle, but if you explore this huge world, you can defeat them very easy. because you can have a bigopen world to explore, invocations you can invocate from players even a clone of you. all this players that told to another people that this game is difficult and abandoned it, are a  because is the most accesible fromsoftware game. resume is a game that it's worth it. i finished it and how amazed i was, i ended up buying bloodborne."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-01,"i had a hard time with the game at first due to being new to souls games and the poor controls due to it really being a console port. after getting use to it and adjusting some setting this game is an absolute must play! there is so much to discover and explore that even after 4 play throughs i always find something new whether it be places, items, or npc quest lines. decided to give it an 8 due to graphics being a little underwhelming at times, controls not being properly fit for pc, poor performance, and lack of ultrawide support. other than that it has a good story, open world, characters, and an amazing amount of content to explore!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-01,gotm game of the millennium period. an actual superb game. a fresh breath of air to the rpg genre. they fixed the fps lag and stuttering. no microtransaction
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-01,"better then breath of the wild by a long shot. from software at its best. some bosses are a bit unbalanced but overall it's a must play but know that, you will get your butt whopped."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,"i love the souls genre but this game does very little to innovate on it. most of the enemy moves are recycled old material but it's not really the issue, same comes with most spell animations. cool new thing you can use the spirit bottle thing to offer momentary distraction, but most of the time that's all they can do. the biggest issue i have with this game that it's crashed in just yesterday more times than cyberpunk did for me during 200 hours of playing it on pc. i don't get how people like theactman can blindly praise game like this and then act like cyberpunk was so unstable it took only 5 minutes before game crashed. and it wouldn't be that bad if the app just crashed, but it jams my entire computer and i lose everything i had running on background. but hey, apparently everyone decided that elden ring is awesome and there's nothing terrible in it, after all it's a game where they didn't deliver more than they promised. without crashing it would be a solid 7.5 buy in sale. the problem is also with community who blindly accepts everything as long they own previous title. i went to mention about the problems in open world game like this. everything is isolated from one another outside of 23 pieces of collectibles to open an elevator or a door. but don't get me wrong, this game would be awesome 1010 game to anyone who reallyreally digs into the game and it's environments and has done all throughout study of all the quests and item locations, because god damn, you're not just accidentally going to find that lightning spear spell in this gigantic open world, which i might add is quite crucial to faith build. i also didn't enjoy travelling to the one nexus location to do pretty much everything, especially when that nexus location had to always be located in the bottom of the map. there are some great ideas but some are just poorly thought out. and then there's the 10 different crafting items just to upgrade a single item to 10 as opposed to 23 items in past titles. and most of the crafting just feels like wasted potential. i'm pretty sure elden ring 2 is going to solve a lot of these issues, but like i said, without bugs 7.5, with crashes... well this score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,bad port  no dark souls servers. they promised to bring them back savedarksouls
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,its a barren world rehashing concepts you've seen a dozen times over for decades. the combat and class system is fun yet underdeveloped  poorly balanced. the world is completely lifeless and what few npc exists are boring  uninspiring. graphics are dated. reminds me of ps2 era games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,this game is amazing ! you really want to know what lays in every corner . afraid on every boss .gives you joy on every kill . so many places to go .so many quest .so many itams sowrds shields and so on .this was a great jorny ty for this masterpiece game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"for dark souls veterans, this game feel like coming home. i think it exceeded the hype."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"if you want more accurate reviews, go look up steam reviews. you can actually see if the person has actually played it, plus how many hours he has. don't waste your time on this cesspool."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,doesn't spoon feed you an experience. you have to work for it. i wish more games would work this way. git gud scrub
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"el juego es impresionante. el mejor dark souls hasta el momento. mantiene toda la esencia integrndolo en un mundo abierto perfectamente creado. esto hace que se mantenga el desafo, pero dejando la puerta abierta a la exploracin para prepararse para derrotar a los jefes ms duros. los grficos no son lo ms avanzado que hay hoy en da, pero es fromsoftware y su estilo. es dark souls ningn dark souls se caracteriza por tener grficos punteros para su poca. lo mismo con los controles son controles de dark souls. este juego enamorar a todo fan de fromsoftware, pero puede que deje indiferente a los que vienen de nuevas. de ah tanta resea chunga. por cierto, lo juego con un i9 10900k y una rtx 3090. por eso no he tenido absolutamente ningn bug."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"the games score at time of writing 6.1 is a demonstration of how overly obsessed people have become with graphical fidelity over every other aspect of game design. yes, this game does have some performance issues. it is also, in almost every other way, a masterful piece of art that prioritizes artistic design and quality gameplay over stuffing itself with pointless busywork. the open world itself is fantastically made, filled to the brim with quality content that exists as more than a time killer or a space filler it's well thought out, tightly executed content. the changes that have been made to the souls formula help to elevate the game, working in tandem with the open world to provide a greater sense of exploration and discovery than any other fromsoft game. in brief, this game is a well thought out, beautifully realized gem. it uses its open world to benefit its gameplay and its design instead of using it as an excuse for mediocre content. that gem just so happens to have a bit of dirt on it. i don't like to be confrontational, and it's completely fair to not enjoy the game. however, if some graphical issues are enough for you to give a game this well designed and beautifully realized a 010, please reevaluate your metrics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"once again i fell for the corrupt reviews of journalists who put this game 1010. scripted quests and dialogues break, npcs disappear, there is no balance. you can play normally only as a magician, a pure warrior . pumping so insignificantly strengthens the character that it could not be added. worst open world i've ever seen 1 90 of game time is horseback riding, 2 repetitive assets of enemies, buildings, etc., 3 just not fun to explore."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-28,"another pc release from fromsoftware that requires gamepad to play. it is absolutely and irrefutably unacceptable to sell a game with this price tag that would still require a gamepad! the arrogance to release a game without redesigning its control scheme or even changing the default button icons, showcases how low customers expectations are . the majority might give this fake product a pass but i will not. the game gets a zero because it requires a gamepad to play. sell the game for 2 so i can buy a gamepad then."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-28,the game boils down to pressing a button in a very limited timeframe. designed to piss you off. save your nerbes. dont play it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-28,"the sheer amount of content that this game has is absolutely mindblowing. definitely a modernday masterpiece. the gameplay is toptier, which doesn't hold your hands through the fights, and forces you to actually get skilled enough to be able to beat your opponents, since you get punished every time you make mistakes which is absolutely intended, as it makes you learn from them to make you better. the openworld is one of the best ever created, which gives you freedom to do whatever you please and approach the story and sidequests in whichever order you want. the visuals are pretty breathtaking as well. definitely not perfect though, with clunky and poor jump mechanics, and a few bugs, glitches and exploits here and there, which hopefully will get fixed in the later updates."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-27,"this will probably be my goto open world rpg for a long time. with so many reasons to replay builds, affiliations, active balancing this is probably the only game i've felt comfortable paying full price for in a while."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-27,"after 300 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that included some of the most challenging fights ive ever fought, and innumerable surprises, there are still bosses that i left on the table, secrets that ive yet to uncover, sidequests that i missed out on, tons of weapons, spells, and skills that ive never used. and this is all on top of pvp and cooperative play that ive barely been able to scratch the surface of. throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat havent changed much from what weve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. even with all the threads, i didnt manage to tug on my first playthrough of what im sure will be several, what i was treated to can easily be held amongst the best openworld games ive ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,"i'm aware that most people that gave this game a 1010 are fanboys all the way. it's just not reasonable, even more, if you played the games that came this month alone sifu, horizon u just can't nail a 1010 on this game, is unfair for the rest of the developers that put a lot of effort into their products. sifu had way smoother gameplay and animations and horizon feels like it is 5 years in advance in terms of visuals, the difference is gigantic. so what i think the game did good and bad good  world design  exploration  art design  variety of enemies in the world  and let's say the level design bad  graphics textures, lighting, shadows, etc, feels like a 2014 title, not 2022 one  mocap, lipsync insanely bad for a aaa developer  story super generic, vague, diluted, the dialogs and characters are super cringe  clunky controls  animations  sound effects again super generic  60hz cap?? in 2022?  optimization, stuttering for pc at least and for now, maybe it will be fixed with a patch"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,"the game is difficult, though unlike souls titles, this one allows you to play at your own pace, skipping anything you find too difficult until you feel up to the challenge. the world is a 100 free roam open world, so you can basically go wherever you want from minute 1. you can also be whatever you want, even the craziest builds can be viable if you know how to exploit them properly. a big fuss was made about the performance, but my computer is below the minimum requirements and i don't even set everything to low, yet still have a stable 30fps. so... i really don't know what all the fuss is about. another thing people apparently don't like is the storytelling. but this aspect is no different from previous souls games, just more massive and dense with content and lore. overall, it's a unique experience and i can't remember being so immersed in a game since skyrim. as with the previous games in the series, you may feel that the game is not that good at the beginning, but if you manage to persevere through this funny torture until the end, you will realise that you have been playing a masterpiece for the last 100 hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"molto probabilmente vincer il goty di quest'anno,  uno dei giochi migliori che ci sia. ha un ritmo di gioco incredibile."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,love this game! ultimate souls game with insane beautiful world full of new stuff to explore and find out all by yourself! game has multiple mechanics u can try its just there its letting u do it how u want to defeat it and has like 6 endings u can do by your actionsquestsidk am still finding out d. i played like 200hrs till i defeated it but still i have a lot to explore so. if u want a game that lets u do whatever u want and like u want it just there  just writing this cuz many kids dont know how to play this game cuz todays games are just so dum d anyway d love it cant wait for dlc  just play it by yourself  love u fromsoft
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"the game runs well in my 4year old laptop i can't even belive people is crying about 60 fps when it's all you need, it takes the best of what they have done and brings even more. i will give it a 9.6 out 10 but 10 is the nearest. i still belive it's not a game for everyone but it's very enjoyable if you give it a try!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"masterpiece in making... game should be like eldenring ,more to game play than money .."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"this game is for people with big brain. it's not for people who need hand holding. and yes you always play as a cleric..always. the story is the reason it gets a 9, and the bugs. jesus fix the bugs. furthermore the hacking is bad at times. oh and people with stuttering, get a better pc honestly"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"i'm in a delicate position here. fromsoft has consistently delivered fantastic experiences for the past few years, and here's elden ring, a game everybody calls a masterpiece that's dark souls' formula distilled and perfected for an open world. this must be the bge, right? umm, no. it's not fromsoft's best game still sekiro, and it'll be for a while i'm guessing. it's not even their second best game. but it's still pretty good, because it's a fromsoft game. i noticed these times tend to exaggerate the quality of open world games with a slightly different take on it than the others. first there was botw, then there was rdr2, and now er. i'm not exactly sure why, open world games have a lot of trouble maintaining interest over time. for reference, i just finished the game with 100 hours under my belt, my character is level 151 and beaten every single boss. pros   fromsoft knows how to make gameplay feel weighty, impactful, and that didn't change with elden ring. i love their animations, the variety of builds available. the weapons, the spells, the enemies. they look and feel great to use and fight.  the art and design of the lands between is incredible. they know how to make you drool over landscapes, towering buildings, or even a swamp yes, another one. i threw out a few wows during my run, and that very rarely happens.  the ost doesn't deliver as much impact this time around, but it's still a great soundtrack.  the bosses. they're fromsoft's biggest argument, and they were my greates fear when i started my game. then i met a certain omen, and i knew my fears were unjustified. there are problems, but the big, intimidating, rageinducing bosses are here, and they're great.  flexibility and accessibility. fromsoft understood that running for 5 minutes every time you want to try a boss again was not fun. spirit ashes are an interesting mechanic for newcomers, the stakes make repeated trials less tedious, there are more sites of grace and they're less isolated. this makes going through some zones less of a chore and more of an actual challenge. cons   the open world. everybody praises this like it's the second coming of breath of the wild, but i found it very bland in its structure. once the discovery phase fizzles out as nice as it genuinely was, i just understood the structure and that it wouldn't change. catacombs, mines and grottos are always pretty much the same.  recycled content. this i'm really not happy with. remember that super cool boss you fought once in the starting area? remember how fun it was? here, here's five of the same guy, hurdled together either as a boss fight or just random mobs in a dungeon. i'm not kidding, out of the 170 bosses in the game, only 15 are unique, all others are used multiple times, and sometimes they come in twos or threes, which is honestly a very cheap trick.  balance. this is a byproduct of the open world structure. it's not up to the player to set a base difficulty in fs games, it's kind of their thing. they set up obstacles for you that seem insurmountable and you manage to overcome them as best you can. except that in er, you can pass them in a gta equivalent where the game basically does all the work alone the mimic10 summon can solo bosses, or you do your best to fight against mechanics designed for the case where the player is actually in gta mode and therefore you're in for the hardest ennemies ever in an fs game. and let's not talk about me playing normally and getting to every zone with 20 more levels than advised the devs response? make everything oneshot my character past a certain point, even though i invested 50 points in vigor.  poor servers. i mean, if you're gonna have servers that bad, don't force people out of the game each time they fail... it happened to me a few times during boss fights, let me tell you i really wasn't in the mood to play after that. anyway, not the best nor worst thing to come out of fromsoft, i'm waiting for the dlc that'll hopefully correct some of the aspects i talked about, fs are known for their great dlcs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-24,"keep crying yourselves to sleep over elden ring, 1000010 game, don't listen to  haters"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-24,"not mentioning pc performance, since the game itself worked okay. however, nothing better than previous dark soul series, only added with some feockedup openworld. well if that is to be called as an openworld, the semi openworld in god of war 4 can be called as a galaxy. feockedup levelscaling, hugely disappointing battle speed and character movements. and no mission tracker at all? i mean, they could make some option to on  off the tracker, just like ac odyssey. all i could do is to hopelessly wonder some giant plain until got crushed by some  played 80 minutes, and i still think it was a waste of time. sooooo curious how other people like this dung."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-24,a lot to say. stunning experience for me as a casual player. definetly worth to give a shot.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,just forget about the ac and call of duty players tears. this game is solid.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,"its good, huge content, best soul game by far. variety of maps, enemies and fun for 80h. performance is  though, not optimized, fps drops, stutters and more but i try to ignore that since the game is really good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,"there i thought i will play this game after a hard day's work. but noooo, this game is going to stress you out even more than reallife problems. screw this game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,there is dificulty than this. if the first mini boss takes me 5 tries than you failed to make a playable game. you filled it with to much information and it made it impossible to chose a class. why not instead try this dont be stupid and add a setting called difficulty easy medium or hard thats literally it but no you chose the 2nd difficulty option of lets make this class bassed system impossible for anyone whos never played a dark souls game to understand so instead they just google it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,non vale quello che costa. l'ho abbandonato dopo 10 ore di gioco a causa di meccaniche di gioco non all'altezza e di una grafica inadeguata per un gioco del 2022
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-23,amazing! already played 90 hours yet and i can't stop  haven't played sooo much any single game for a long time
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,the menu's give you the controller buttons not the pc buttons to push. this is a halfbaked game which has not finished its pc port. the gamer unfriendly features and game failings are too many to list. the fraud critics have been lying over and over about this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,thought it was boring. game did not motivate me enough to play the game. not interesting at all. very bland.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,i'm changing my review here. i gave it 7 and a pretty crappy review because i was frustrated and irritated by it's game play. it's definitely hard and takes getting used to. but if you do get into it like i finally did you will find it's full of wonder and interesting things. combat is great and the enemies are very unique. can't stop playing now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,47.5 hours in and my file corrupted. i can't even start a new file it just wont let me in. it was a bad pc launch. waste of 80 for me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,"this overhyped stuff that blatantly bought out all the gaming media as if they count anything anymore has one unique feature abusing of the countless glitches. this stuff is messy, glitchy, buggy af and has constant balance issues. bosses are either overpowered or totally powerless, with no inbetween. i'm enjoying how at lv 18 i'm doing stuff for lv50 by getting bosses stuck in the terrain, or making their ai bugged. oh, right, this is the pc version aswell if you want to play with a gtx mobile graphic card more than capable to obtain 3040 fps at 720p and 900p you need to patch the game, making it unavailable for online play due to needing to bypass easy anticheat. you need to cheat to open the game on your gaming laptop. in 2022. what a disgrace for a 1010 game. stuff is ludicrously bad and people giving 10 are just bots or underage kids, that's my opinion."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,"souls combat with all the bells and whistles  many viable builds despite the meme ones being popular  best graphics yet in the series and great character creator  lots of content to play through, 100 hours is the norm  the catacomb level design is surprisingly creative and fun for dungeon lovers like myself   worst boss and enemy combat design. blatant input reading, delayed attacks, endless boss combos and unnecessarily short punish windows. whether easy or hard, it's simply never satisfying to defeat an enemy.  heavy asset reuse. every cave and landmark is exactly like all the other ones in their category. every catacomb, cave and ruin looks exactly the same. most bosses and enemies are reused too.  terrible storyline. hard to process main plot with an abstract, irrelevant twist radagon  marika, and npc quests that always reward the player with utterly depressing and futile outcomes. it feels better to not do them!  the open world is really just for looks. it's a wasteland with points of interest, generic caves, catacombs and ruins with mostly useless loot. combat is all you really have to look forward to. try not to miss radiant quests from bethesda. at least those were better than nothing.  uncreative armor design and lack of variety for gear. a lot of sets are thematically redundant or look alike, when they don't look plain disappointing.  weapon and spell variety really makes sense in ng only. at a first playthrough you'll be likely stuck to the same couple spells and weapons due to the upgrade system and the best ones being confined to late game.  the damage scaling can be harsh unless you're told to stack vit and defense bonuses early on, and even then it's not pleasant to die immediately to every couple rats you failed to notice in time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,other than graphic improvements there is nothing new elden ring offers. if making a hard game was a skill we should be giving 100 points to all huge strategy games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,"on it's own, elden ring is a good game  tons to do and see, and the exploration is usually rewarding. if this is your first soulsfromsoft game, you'll likely have a blast if you can persevere and learn the mechanics. however, if you're coming from other fromsoft games, elden ring is a massive downgrade in terms of combat fluidity. somehow they managed to make movement and combat clunkier and less responsive than dark souls 3  wtf happened? also, the general boss and mob encounters in elden ring are mostly terrible. endless combos that always break you out of poise, so much that trying to do a pure str build though not impossible is insanely difficult, compared to magic which fs have completely dropped the ball in and made super overpowered  super rapid casting  keeping distance  constant fps. though the world is massive, most of it feels like filler  dungeons and catacombs are copypastes and even the bosses are copy pastes with zero thought about balancing. to me, elden ring is the fallout 4 of fromsoft games  in trying to make a souls game that is open world and accessible, they've produced a mediocre souls game with a mediocre open world. buy this game if you want, i don't care. i just don't think it lives up to the masterpiece and 1010 hype. fromsoft has gotten complacent and lazy and no longer understand how to make genuine difficulty without resorting to lazy design."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,"awful boss design and a disappointing combat system, their last game sekiro did better, this game should be called dark souls 4."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,"little to no roleplay, forced builds and difficulty based on unplayability. 'best pc game' for a game with a terrible port is a joke."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,its massive  bombing for this game. its not worth any money. its another dark solus print with new
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,"this game presents a lot of options and tools, gives the player agency to find out for themselves how to best advance. it respects the player in a way we're not used to anymore. some people sadly can't break their conditioning and whish the game would hold their hand. that's not what elden ring is about. but other players can be summoned to fulfil that purpose. the world is alien and embroiled in its downfall. it doesn't concern itself with the player, which makes it so much more fun to explore. i haven't had this sense of wonder exploring since morrowind."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,not bad reminds me to 20012013 gta 345 and 2018 red dead redemption two kinda sounds 20062015 edmonton rush tho.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-20,"i'm sure people here who are complaining about bad graphics and boring open world are people paid by corporation jealous of elden ring success. exploring an open world without any marker is so much fun, you can just unleash your curios heart and submit to it. i haven't tried breath of the wild before, so this is my first time experiencing true open world. the world of elden ring full of danger and gorgeous view. in this kind of open world, how can you still care about graphics fidelity, art direction and style trumps graphics fidelity anytime. elden ring bosses are hard, harder than any souls game before. i too, died countless times to margit, godrick and the other. for some who think the combat is unfair and cheap, seriously, go watch youtuber ongbal. how could it be cheap and unfair when all bosses attack has been proven to be dodgeable or parryable. just don't give up, learn the game mechanics, learn from your mistake, use your imagination and come up with a plan. the game won't handhold you for anything, not the combat, not the quest and not even for the story. if you want to know the lore and story, then explore, talk to npcs, defeat bosses, read item description... or just watch youtube. if you can't even handle that, you might as well go back to playing barbie, here's a link for you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-20,absolutely beautiful world full of treacherous beasts to explore with an amazing community to help you on your treacherous journey
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-20,"once you defeat the area bosses, you essentially become locked out of multiplayer. worst game mechanic i have ever seen. adds no value to the gameplay, but only serves to irritate the players who spent money on this garbage"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"massapiece. this is the peak of from software. well, along with bloodborne. just imagining a bloodborne 2 with this kind of open world gets me titillated."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,my first fromsoftware game that i have beaten. for me it was the best open world experience in addition to epic bossfights that i have ever played. a game that will make history.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"edit the latest patch has fixed the stuttering for me, as well as made some important balance changes so i have changed my rating from 9 to 10. i have just finished the game for the second time, once as a full caster build and once as a full strength build, so i think i can finally say that yes, i definitely do recommend elden ring. this is without a doubt from's most accessible game ever, you can tell they've put a lot of effort into the new player experience. they have also added a ton of quality of life changes which are very welcome even to a veteran player. that's not to say the game is easier though, because it's not, and some bosses are without a doubt some of the most challenging they've ever created. the move to open world was risky but i would say it paid off for the most part, although the game being so open and especially vertical did make for some frustrating moments when you were left thinking how the hell do i get over there?, and sometimes the answer was extremely convoluted. the gameplay feels fresher than ever, with more ways to play and more viable builds. magic has never felt so good, even a little too good at times. you also have weapon ashes which are like weapon special moves which add a ton of customisation to your build. on top of all that you have incarnations which are like spells but more holy faith focused. there are many endgame builds which are all very different and all viable, which gives the game a lot of replayability. and speaking of replayability, you'll almost certainly want to do at least a second playthrough as you will miss a ton unless you're following a guide, it's impossible not to as the game has so much content that is off the beaten patch. so far i have been extremely positive but the game isn't perfect and the issues need to be brought up. first and foremost the game suffers from stuttering, regardless of your hardware, this is a fundamental game issue and you will experience it whether you'll notice it or not is a different matter. if you are sensitive to performance problems you will definitely notice this issue as it's very prevalent in certain areas. the online coop is also massively broken, you will be met with unable to summon cooperator errors all the time, it doesn't work more often than it does, so if you're planning to play with friends or just like to summon help from random players you may have a bad time. the later portion of the game is also a bit of a letdown, with several of the bosses being overwhelming difficult, as a veteran i struggled, so if this is your first time playing a from game just prepare yourself for the fact the difficultly dials up to 11 very rapidly towards the end, more so than any other from game. i also found the final boss extremely underwhelming, i won't spoil it but it's not a fun fight imo. for the most part the game is a massive success, the amount of content is unbelievable, the world they've created is gorgeous, thematically the bosses are incredible and it has never been easier to jump into a from title. most of the issues can be fixed, but only time will tell if they are. the bottom line is, if you're a fan of from games you will love elden ring, and if you're not, there has never been a better time to jump in as a new player."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"this game completely encapsulates everything that fromsoft have been incorporating into their games from the start. the game offers challenge after challenge while giving the players multitudes of different ways to approach each one. there is a large variety in play styles that simply could not have existed in past titles such as stealth play, horseback combat, and jumping with aerial attacks. this step forward in the souls formula also introduces exploration on a whole new level. for the first time a fromsoft game is completely open world. the only time you will see a loading screen after booting the game up is during teleports and after each assured death. the world is vast and beautiful, full of hidden secrets, and littered with enemies and bosses to fight for some sweet loot or that dopamine dump that we all search for when overcoming such great challenges. this has been my favorite entry into the soulsborne franchise and i hope that this game can show the other aaa studios and publishers that making games more about set pieces and holding our hands with constant markers and unimportant dialogue only serve to create uninspired and boring worlds. just because games are getting larger does not mean that they are getting better. a small environment with a lot to feel invested in makes for a much better experience than a massive world with nothing but busy work. fromsoft have seemingly taken this concept and turned a massive world into a wonderful experience by adding multitudes of activities and places for us to invest our time and efforts into."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"quantity over quality meme ring, id est, dark souls 3 with a horse, copy paste enemies, boring cringy choir music, only 8 unique boss fights, and broken overpowered ashes of war for the casuls. carefully crafted by from software to cater to the mindless masses who are blind sheep and bought this lie because some overrated writers name was attached to it and who cannot see that  is a onetrickpony who makes the same game over and over again. at least it has no microtransactions. all in all this game would have been better if some of the content was cut because if you are going to buy this prepare to fight the same copy pasted bosses over and over again. from fanbois are idiots lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,only tryhard loser enjoy this game you lying to yourself if you say you enjoying the game go get monster hunter game because it seems like the people that make mh aware that not all gamer are tryhard loser
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"this game is amazing! this is my first ever soulsborne game and since about a week after launch i have 275.2 hours full playtime. entering into the open world for the first time feels very fresh and exciting, there is so much to do, and so many minor details. just riding on your horse to get from one place to another may take forever because you'll find battles between two factions you might want to get involved with, an enemy caravan containing weapons or armor walking from one place to another, an npc with a fullblown questline, a dungeon, and so much more! the boss design is incredible with a whopping 165 total bossesincluding unique. even while exploring an empty area you can get invaded by an npc and have to take it on or run away. they did the best they could to keep the player engaged and doing stuff while playing. if i could edit between decimals, i would go 9.610 i read most of the bad reviews on here and they all are talking about stuff that isn't even true. i'll correct some of the bad review's review flaws below because those people clearly haven't played enough to actually know what they're talking about. one of the bad reviews that i saw a lot of was graphics. the graphics are amazing at first and for most of the game, however there are a few texture flaws when blood is splattered onto the ground, pieces of the ground flying up from it getting hit by an attack, etc. overall the graphics are amazing, but they could have done slightly better with them. the second most popular bad review i saw was about the story being awful. first of all, the story is new and unlike any other game we have ever seen before. the story is unique, its engaging, and it was written by george r. r. martin! you're telling me that george r. r. martin, the guy who wrote game of thrones, is bad at writing a story? that is toxic and untrue. overall, amazing game, totally recommend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"i got my ass beat by radahn for four hours straight. it was pretty fun. game's fps dies during the more intense parts, but then again, i am running it on a 1050."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,almost perfect minus some slight frame stutters that have happened maybe 5 times in about 50 hours of play.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,"a more accessible dark souls game. personally felt like the sense of discovery and reward were more tangible than other open world games. still not a game for everyone, but for those that it is for are in for a real good time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"maybe i'll give it another chance in two or three years. the game wasn't ready to land on pc and, as far as i can tell, not even on consoles. from a gameplay point of view it adds little and gets boring after a few hours. from a technical point of view it is poorly optimised despite being far from being at the top compared to the potential that pc gaming offers today. the publisher has invested more in marketing than in development resources, creating the usual mass of toxic baby fanboys."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,really good game the only thing wrong with it on pc is the occasional frame stuttering.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"banger game, at the start you have to set the key binds that they fit your style on pc at least if you are playing with mouse and keyboard but then you are good to go, and i can tell you it is the best game you will play this year"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"the evolution of open world game design. ill start right to the point elden ring is an excellent game, but the pc version is not the best it should be, simple as that. the pc version of elden ring needs a bit of love and care its a shame that, as of the day of posting this review, the game still suffers from shader chaching issues, or possibly asset streaming problemsmaybe both whatever it is, for some pc setups and users the problem is bigger and more noticeable than for others. for meits alright, because it seems the more i play, the less frequently said issues occur, and overall the experience is not tarnished much by it, for me   now, on the actual bad design aspects in the pc version the menu navigation is a pain, because it has some hardcoded keys, like q, e, etc. sometimes well need to press q to go back a menu, while in other occasions its just the expected esc key. that is poor design, and lack of proper testing with people used to play pc games. secondly, camera movement and target selection are awful on mouse and keyboard. the target lock and camera reset actions are bound to the same key, with no option to decouple them, for starters, and idem for the dash and dodgeroll keys, same crap. with both my dualshock 4 and dualsense controllers, the game plays as expected from a gamepad, no way to officially show playstation buttons, though only with mods, a minor issue anyway. i understand certain developers from other companies  games have been publicly criticizing elden ring lack of proper user experience ux, if you will, but thats not exactly what im talking about here, or at least not in the same manner those developers are a disgrace to their respective companies and should rethink their words next timebecause their games arent exactly the prime examples of marvelous uiux design, either, ive played all of them, i know. theres stuff to be improved for this pc version but, with that saidyeah, whats left after going past those issues is an incredible video game that teaches very important lessons in open world design, which i hope some other studios learn from and get inspired by. this concept has always been there and used in some video game franchises, in the past, which we have now seen evolve, in some of their recent titles as well. what elden ring does, is just taking all the great aspects of their previous games, and expand it into this great open world theyve crafted for us. im not a veteran of the souls series at all, but ive played all kinds of games since the 90s, and i dont feel a game being less handholding on me is a problemit just makes me feel more free to do whatever i want and, if i mess up and diei die, and learn, then repeat but, in the process, i have fun, because no matter what i doim learning, exploring, discovering. i think this design fits perfectly for such an open world game, it does, it works and i like it. on the performance side of things, the game is locked at 60 fps, which is another aspect id like to see improved, but not as crucial as the other poorly designed stuff previously mentioned more importantly, framepacing feels off, especially because the games fps limiter is not good enough, and also the game locks itself at 60 hz on fullscreen, so i recommend playing in borderless if your screen supports higher refresh rates. ive been playing at 1620p dldsr, on a ryzen 5 3600 and rtx 3060 ti, and fps are normally as close to 60 as possible, sometimes in the low 50s in certain demanding areas, all while at maximum settings. im eager to see what ray traced effects they implement on a future update, because currently stuff like the ssao and shadows are quite poor in places, especially ssao has this while halo  overlay around objects that are also close to a water surface, and shadows flicker quite a lot, especially distant shadows  from vegetation. the story requires a lot of exploring and talking to different important characters to even begin to comprehend the basics of whats happening, but i love that because it makes me want to play more, and leaves a good part to the users interpretation. theres not a lot of voice acting, compared to other games, but the actors do a great job with their performances. and the graphics, while not being the most photorealistic ones weve ever seenwell who cares? when the game looks so gorgeous anyway, because its artistic design and atmosphere are really top notch. so many areas in the game leave me speechless, with how beautiful they look, and i wish this game had an official photo modeoh, please, we need one i know, theres a good one with third party tools, but this should be a standard feature in these huge games. an easy 1010 if the issues ever get fixed, for nowa bit lower from me, but still an excellent game nonetheless."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"nearly perfect before i get into my review i would like to say i killed all the bosses, found 99 if not all items, and discovered every inch of every location that just so happens to equal out to 300 hours for my first playthrough. i also want to note i've played all other fromsoftware titles except for demon's souls with a combined playtime of over 1400hrs. praises just as with all other souls series games, elden ring has a very beautiful and varied world. combat feels much more polished compared to dark souls iii taking elements from dark souls, bloodborne, and sekiro to create the best feeling and most fairfor the most part combat. enemies, bosses, and npcs are familiar yet also unique in design and in battle. it feels like every playstyle is actually viable in elden ring which cannot be said for past titles. i also want to mention the ash summons for adding something new and fun to boss battles. and the last big thing is the inclusion of horseback riding and combat, really didn't expect it to turn out as good as it did. complaints performance i can understand a couple performance issues here and there, but elden ring launched in a frustrating state with memory leaks, stuttering, and crashing also doesn't want to close out without using task manager. bugs the game also suffers from some pretty annoying bugs such as certain questlines and an ending being locked off all because one npc breaks, clipping through the floor and falling to your death during a boss battle, and key items not dropping from certain bosses. summoningpvp friendly players can't be summoned after you defeat the story boss in that area, this is straight up stupid given that this is an open world game. only work around is red summons which disables the ability of invasions. lackluster loot throughout the entire game from start to finish i could not believe the same developer of all these past souls games made this giant world with so much  loot. you see a hidden little cove with a purple item guarded by a few tough enemies only for it to be a goddmn arteria leaf. trash. inconsistent difficulty bosses and enemies go from being difficult to almost being one shot without even leveling up. everything is a cakewalk and then you run across malenia which easily tops the list of hardest bosses in all fromsoftware games, the final boss is a joke in comparison. inconsistent overall. eac  cheaters even with the addition of easy anticheat cheaters are still very much able to weasel their mangy sses into pvp. open world this is my biggest complaint with elden ring. i just couldn't help but notice how most of my complaints with the game wouldn't have existed if the game was built more linear like the past souls games. i feel like the focus on making the game open world caused less of a polished souls experience overall. the world just feels too big and empty in a number of expansive areas, the garbage loot makes this much worse. conclusion with all those complaints i still like the game regardless because it fits the soulsborne mold. i give elden ring an 8 out of 10 recommendations bloodborne1010, dark souls iii910, sekiro"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-16,.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-15,"masterpiece, goty, that's everything i have to say, except for those playing on potatos and rating under 5, you all are tagging this game for trash, but look at your pc's they're about to explode, exclude your self from rating if you have an old pc. i have an rtx 3060ti, upload your devices , you all are complaining and want to play a 2022 game with a 2010 graphics card c'mon dude xd. best of souls like game ever made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-15,"absolute great game, not a 10 in my eyes because of the performance issues, even with a 3050 i get some stuttering sometimes and so far, 2 crashes. but still it takes everything good from the souls series and puts them together in a big dense open world, which isn't small btw. with tons of things to do. amazing game. worth every penny."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-14,"an absolute masterpiece. adictive gameplay, innovative with just the right amount of fromsoft tradition to make you feel at home. if you're new to fromsoftware games this is the perfect game to start from."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-14,"severely disappointing. bad main bosses perhaps even worse than ds2, botched endgame, tons of recycled content that makes this game feel like assassin's creed. at least the open world was really fun to explore until mountaintops"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-14,to all the people that gave up on this game. you missed out on one of the craziest rides of your life. every hour my mind is blown by something that happens. cant stop playing it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"playing this game with a mouse and keyboard is beyond challenging  as a new player to soulsborne games this made me suffer quite a lot. the open world is amazing but u never get a clue what to do... you have to look at everything and since many players lay their own informations above notes that explain some of the story its annoying to get to it. the gameplay is challenging, thats for sure, and depending on what class you play you cant progress well. according to others you are able to play through everything on lvl 1 if ur skill lvl is high enough. so  elden ring is lacking in story, is confusing, with a big but kinda bland empty world that makes no sense crusaders beeing richt next to a barbarian camp for example. if you like soulsborne games  well go for it. if you can look past the horrible way this game is played  go for it.. if you dont want story, just want to lvl up and kill harder enemies  go for it  or play minecraft. to me  this is not worth my time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"this is literally a reskin of dark souls 3. which dark souls 3, by the way, was a reskin of dark souls. this company has been making the same game for over a decade now and they're getting away with it.  this game is too long. if you've every played a souls game, then you've already played this game. same combat, same weapons, same mechanics. now take dark souls and imagine it's twice as long. games can be long if they successfully introduce new ideas to spice up the gameplay. but here you've already seen it al before there's next to nothing new here. add to that the recycled bosses and enemies, and you'll quickly grow bored  the bosses in this game are balanced around mimics. that is, summoning an npc to help you. if you do not summon, bosses will be so hard and unfair you'll think it is the hardest souls game yet. it you do summon, you'll think it's the easiest. i don't like coop play and am disappointed it has been forced here"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"wonderful game. i die constantly. but every now and then, i get to win. seen people complain that you need a controller. i'm 30 hours in and never touched anything other than my trusty kbmouse. i find the game is more immersive and runs better without the online component turned on. i don't need messages telling me to finger, but whole or fort, night? in the middle of all the spooky atmosphere and oppressive enemies and i don't have to have them."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"please read all of this before downvoting. this generation of gaming as a whole has been killed by the tryhards and greed. if you want the truth this game reflects a lot that is wrong with this generation of gaming. cheap flights of sweaty mechanics like dodge rolling, parry, and jumping. fanboys are a big problem with games as well. they defend it being a sweaty game as an excuse to get good but it is so hypocritical because these are the same gamers crying multiplayer games are too sweaty. the problem isn't the difficulty it's the game and this generation. the game really isn't that hard or even takes much skill to beat. it's just cheap and unfair combat. all just one hit kills with cartoonish animations with a slight delay so if you dodge roll it hits you anyways. it's just frustrating not hard or even takes skill to beat it. it just takes patience and mental health loss to beat it. this is reflected in this generation of gamers in multiplayer as well  jumping and dashing and cheap tactics to win. that is why no one likes multiplayer games. multiplayer games die in less than a few months because no one likes playing against unfair ai or players. this is what divides this generation in gaming because they are hypocrites and want to call games competitive and a sport but don't want rules or sportsmanship in games and want to use exploits and use cheap tactics to win like scuff controllers, dashing, and jumping. there is a reason why sports have rules like football and basketball to prevent ppl from cheating and exploiting in unfair ai or players ways to win and be unsportsmanlike. if it is a sport and it's all about the competition then get rid of cheap tacticsboss fights, exploits, and unfair fights and make some rules. if it is not a sport then why are we making games so tedious and playing like our lives depend on them?  i beat the game on new game plus and level 167 but i had no other games to play and wanted to give it a fair shot. i feel like i gave this review a good score for how i feel and others feel. it is a mixed review for a sweaty game that could have been great if they focused more on the performance and rpg and toned down the sweaty feel of the game. not to put in an easy mode but an outofthebox rpglike combat system rather than dark souls combat system."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"if the game actually played well and optimized this would have been an 910, but when you release a game which is basically unplayable because you keep getting annoyed by stutters and bad optimization, i have to rate it accordingly. fix the game and i'll change this review to its rightful metric. it's been out for a month now and we have heard nothing from fromsoftware."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"one of the best games ever made. there are practically no real problems, almost all criticism is purely subjective."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"amazing game and is my goty, itd be a 10 if it wasnt for the stuttering if they fix that, solid 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"graphics are awesome. jumping is nice. glitches, bugs, lazy so so so so much recycled content, especially after litterally the beginning portion of the map pc port awful 60fps max, instructions not even translated bosses glitch and ive fallen through the map so many times even saving the game is a hastle and the game loves to crash. dont even bother trying to use the targeting clipping, animations kinda bad example  mimic blob things, seems like a last minute ,we need to finish this ememy , lets just put a blob around an attack animation and seriously not try at all. wanna play with a friend? good luck, no cross platform, and trying is such a hastle its not worth it pllluuusss whoevee gets transported doenst get the progess. feels like a half developed game got released for a cash grab and toxic gamers jumped on to the scene, you are just bad, common features dont exist, a quest log for example. the community is cancer. go bang your head on a wall learning how to defeat each boss or google it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"a love letter to fans of classic game difficulty, a masterpiece in subtle story telling and world building. secrets around every corner. excellent boss design."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"i don't understand why people are review bombing a game because their computer can't run it. if your computer is dated, then consider buying it on console or upgrading. if your expecting a brand new aaa open world game which is huge to run on a baked potato, you need to look somewhere else. if you don't want to shell out for a console or a gpu upgrade then look into something like geforce now. it has become my favourite game of all time and has the best soundtrack i've ever had the fortune to listen to. i wish i got the deluxe edition."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"its the same game fromsoft was done 6 times before. but not even the best combat of the bunch, because in this one you need to use the lock on like a scrub since most enemies have broken hitboxes and animations to the point of just hitting you through walls, unlike dark souls 2 where you could play the whole thing without it. the graphics are good but the vegetation and skybox feels dated, the open spaces are a good change and the map is huge, everything else is just another coat of paint on a good game that can feel tired if you arent in the mood. doesnt supports ultrawide resolutions natively, thats unacceptable, the pc community has to finish the porting for lazy devs like this, its has occasional stutters and even crashes but very rarely. its definetly my favorite game of the franchise so far but its held back by the complete lack of innovation in the combat, like gore and damage models, being able to move sideways without the stupid lock on, being able to free aim while playing as a mage or an archer, they did something way back with demon souls and never tried making it better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"when i first started playing this game, i had performance issues such as invisible enemies and dropping frame rates, but i think that was all due to my potato pc not meeting the minimum requirements lol. thankfully all it took was a mod and i was good to go. though granted with the mod on i had to play offline, but overall i still think elden ring is a great game with great combat and even greater world design. i think it shows when the developers put a lot of effort and passion into making it by the absurd amount of detail in the open world. personally i think this game deserves all the praise it got."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"don't expect an open world full of things, this is a soul game, so you'll die a lot and the open world will be full of tough monstersknights to farm in order to level up. unfortunately, you'll have to rely on guides to find what to do at the beginning. the game is good, but certainly not goty! graphics are disappointing for ps5xbox series x, there's a lot of bugs. gameplay is archaic. fan of the souls serie will love it, but again isn't for everyone and is certainly not as good as all the reviews says."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"amazing game, amazing gameplay and story, great graphics. only low reviews are from people that mad at the game because theyre trash."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"despus de ms de 80 horas jugadas, puedo decir, en mi opinin, que es un gran juego, en todos los aspectos, aunque peca de falta de optimizacin, aunque, nada tan grave como para decir, es injugable! historia en la lnea de dark souls y sekiro, pero, ahora con las conversaciones, puedes sacar mucha de la historia. no como antes, que tenas que leer hasta las descripciones de las piedras, para entender algo. jugabilidad lo mejor y lo peor de todos los juegos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"this is my first souls game experience and i did fall in addiction with this game. game design, combat and atmosphere were phenomenal. beautiful and interesting world to explore. thrilling fights and enemies. only issues i have with this game, or rather what would i add is some sort of journal to track quests, even if it held almost no descriptions on quest, but rather from whom i am on quest. most quests dont tell you what to do or where to go at all, at some instances, i couldnt even figure out that i have taken a quest. keyboard  many people complain that you need a gamepad for this game, in my experience that couidn't be further from the truth. i completed whole game on keyboard and mouse  but had to change some setting from default ones for better comfort performance  this game ran smoothly on my ryzen5 3600 with rx580 on 2k res with medhigh setting with around 60 fps at all times, that was also lovely"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"finally after soo long, another masterpiece from fromsoftware, i used to think they peaked with bloodborne but they proved me wrong"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"dark souls 1 me fascino y hasta el momento es mi juego favorito, pese a eso la segunda y tercera parte las senti un poco menos sorprendente, quizas porque el lore no era tan epico y desarrollado o porque el diseo interconectado de su mundo no estaba tan bien logrado. no me esperaba de elden ring mucho, solo quizas una pequea mejoria tecnica un dark souls 4. pero de verdad me sorprendio, en las primeras horas no lo note pero mientras descubria las diferencias en el gamplay comparandolo con los dark souls y descubria poco a poco su mundo me vi atrapado de nuevo en un juego tan atrapante, de nuevo por su lore y su mundo. este juego debera estar en un top 10 de los mejores juegos de la historia."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"elden ring is the best videogame i've ever played in 35 years, don't believe the hatred usercritics, most of them never played elden ring for sure. my playtime 218.4 hours, achievements 22 thank you from software! thank you for this openworld masterpiece!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"what an amazing game, i just got the platinum achievement for it and i love every single bit of this game except for the technical part. that's why i give it only a 9.0"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"and other dark souls without any changes. you have to go a looooooong way again and again in order to encounter a boss? i don't have this much of time. what were you thinking about, when creating  actually copypasting from dark souls this game? did you think gamers have many free times? it's just wasting so much time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"if you enjoy games that are dripping with story, endlessly playable and a bang for your buck, elden ring may be the best for it. my first run of the game clocked about 100 hours. it is not an easy game to play, the game is sett like every other soulsbourne game while allowing the player to experience the open world at their ease and pace."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"the game is amazing. played for over 100 hours and did not complete it yet. however, due to technical issues  performance, stutters, crashes, i cannot recommend this title to anyone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"quite fun game but full of flaws 1this is an open world it is not a soulslike, the areas are open, you can escape and choose enemies more within your reach so any hidden mechanics inherent in the quests either you lose them or leave them since you do not understand anything about how to go forward in the secondary quests 2 a diary is missing, it is not possible that in 2022 an open world rpg does not have a diary 3 the menus seem catapulted from the 90s, the comparison functions weapon in hand weapon to buy sell? the tokens to understand the last item collected dropped? and there would be other trifles but forget it, a game that is nice to play but myazaky and alla from obviously get angry when they create something that works and completes the product, i don't give them more than 7.58 10, the combat is fun and the scenography is wonderful but not enough .. it is too dispersive and not very immersive .."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,found the game a bit punishing so i hacked it to have regenerating healthfp. then it's basically the best elder scrolls game of all time. the story doesn't hold your hand at all. you discover a mad world that has lost the blessing of death. it's a beautiful experience. best game i've played in 15 years.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"a very hyped game for no reason whatsoever because the quality does not corelate with the hype.i would see how souls fans would love this game because it's basically dark souls 4 with some mechanics changed and a bigger world,that's basically it,the story is still nonsensical and left to interpretation,like i can see the writers in the meeting being like hey,we barely have any story and have 1000 plotholes,what do we do? and one came with the ideea don't worry,our fans will just make up for our lack of competence by saying it's just abstract storytelling.amazing... anyway,as for gameplay,some mechanics were changed like the dodging is more scuffed,balancing is now directly corelated with your level,so less git gud and more get on the rune sigma grind,bro. there are some improvements like the new jump buttonwow,a jump button in 2022,what a feature and the arts of war are pretty cool,as well as adding stealth and more stagger options,and also spirit  while it made improvements in some aspects,it tooks some steps backwards as well. also,i really dislike how they went for the quantity over quality route in stead by reusing and recycling so many bosses. graphically,it's ok,nothing amazing,some things do look amazing but maybe only 10 of the time. and i don't know how george rr martin was involved in the making of this story cause it just seems like some more miyazaki  so it feels like false advertisement to me. all in all,i believe a 6 is a fair enough grade,after 4050 hours on steam,i just got bored of it,the pc performance was not stellar even after 3 patches and since i'm not not such a huge fan,i can look at this objectively and say it's very dissapointing since they claimed it's going to be very different from their past titles but it's the same old ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"i was there for the hype since 2019. i knew that miyazaki would deliver, since he always delivers. it surpassed every expectation in every way possible. it has perfected difficulty and level design. the music feels fresh, the story is the most intricate they've made and it's truly a joy to experience. there might be some nitpicks on the code department on a microscopical level, but they don't hold a candle to the overall product."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"let's focus on the positives first  awesome world design, absolutely incredible open world  soundtrack is great as always  character and boss designs are great visually speaking  so many builds and customization options so how does a game with this much good in it fall so flat? laziness, really. the game is lazily put together in so many aspects. it feels like they just threw proper level scaling and actually difficulty out of the window for the late game. featuring bosses with undodgeable kill combos, ridiculous damage, bad hitboxes, and unfair design all around. for every amazing moment there is in the early game, there is like 5 bad moments in the late game. so many late game bosses would be so cool if they weren't infuriatingly unfair and badly designed. beyond that, the difficulty at large, which in the early game felt carefully and expertly crafted, becomes unfair as well in the late game. the same reasons as highlighted above but apply it to basically every enemy that they introduce in the late game. in all honesty, if you want to play this game, you should really only play all of the earlygame and some of the midgame, as the rest will just make you hate it. luckily, the issues as to why the late game is bad are all fixable, the ideas behind the enemies themselves do not get worse, they are just horribly unbalanced and unfair. a few balance patches can really save this game. so for now, it is a 5 out of 10, it is still a really good game, but it truly feels like it only lives up to half of its potential due to the laziness in balancing the late game. hopeful to see that fixed soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"as a long fan of the soulsborn series, this game feels so much like a best of tour. some of the best, most grandiose bosses the series has to offer, the best weapons and spell variety in the series and does enough to make the game feel new and fresh with the dedicated jump button and the new ashes of war mechanics. despite the rough launch performance wise the game has very much stabilized and stutters are really only noticed in the open world, not so much boss arenas and legacy dungeons. the game is also the most accessible in the series, as summoning ashes are plentiful, and the open world allows for exploration and leveling before tackling the bosses. i will admit, some of the minibosses in the open world and catacombscaves are really just there to fill the run time, but some of these encounters are quite rewarding none the less. also highly recommend using a controller because the game isn't exactly made with pc controls in the forefront."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"great game, large operworld, must have for exploration freaks. replayability garanted."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,iiiiiiiiii game score  92 iiiiiiiiii
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"garbage game, 20220409 still can not enter game, white screen crash. do you have a grudge against my computer?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"this game is so adictive, the game is hard, but it's very fun, the visuals are stunning even if not the most realistic, the creativity made this game become a masterpiece. there's always more to do, all sidequests are fun, the rewards are interesting, the lore is well thought and even visiting old places, you can find something you missed the last time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"my first souls game. incredibly hard, but after sinking weeks into this game and only being halfway through if that! i think it's an absolute masterpiece. i'm on pc and apart from a few crashes to desktop it's been a solid 60fps and no real issues. so glad i skipped forbidden west to play this instead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"amazing! definite contender for game of the year. my favourite game since witcher 3, just alot more challenging."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"so, no game is a 10 for me. i feel like it can't be. maybe if it came out with 120fps option and fully optimised and included some insane brand new mechanics that flipped the souls formula on it's head i would have to give it that but that's the only downside. the sense of exploration, the sheer magnitude of running all over a map then realising there is a whole lower level you haven't seen and you have to survey the lands and your map to understand where to go. the build variety is insane, you want to go strength but like faith things? cool, there is a catalyst that scales off str, just get enough faith points to be able to cast that spell. you like a weapon but it doesn't have the scaling or weapon art u want. cool there is an ash of war for it. the game engages you to explore, you can easily find flask upgrades just by looking for ruin type objects in ur map. you run into so many weapons, items, talismans etc to form your build. this is what i wished skyrim was, each dungeon drops cool things, has a boss that's challenging. boss design is also refreshing, more aggressive, different attack chains depending on what option you choose it's a nice change to typical souls bosses bar artorius and probably others. if this is your first souls game, maybe don't shell out the bucks and play dark souls 1 remastered. but if you want a broad sense of exploration, discovery and sheer wonder of the world you can't miss it. but you will have to git gud, understand how dodge rolling first and maybe check out some beginner videos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,my truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game 9.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"its a improvement from dark souls 3 in every way. the only problem is that the hardware requirement is a bit to heavy. and the open world mechanics are improving the franchise a lot for me to. if you like souls games, you will love it. if dont or, you are new to the series keep in mind that you will die a lot. and that you need to engage in the mechanics. its a bit work and you cant just turn of your brain. its still not a mainstreamed game, so you should really think about what kind of game you want to play. the story is really good but again told in a to cryptic way for me. you wont get everything until you played it 100h or watched some youtube. but you can say that the beautiful world itself tells a story to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"elden ring is a very good game, but it do lacks some story to it. most of the game do not as such hold a story and for most you just riding around killing stuff. the game it get extremely difficult and one must level up and up. this goes esspecialy in the beginning and then very late. took me 124 hours to reach the fire giant at level 89, and then i simply hit the wall and according to the various forum i would have to level up for 30 level to have a chance. as no real story to captive on and follow, it just got to tedious to continue. most bosses can be taken by call in other players, and this is very needed, but i had strange issues in summon, and hence assumingly game servers have issues. in all, it is a masterpiece, but it need more story and yet again formsoft lost  of the games to the difficulty and should consider some way of lowering it. in the end, i cheated by weemod and ran the last 15 of the game after the fire giant though godmode e.g. cannot be killed. those bosses after fire giant seem to me only to be possible if you know how to take by various glitches and hence you need to go online and read what to do. so said in other words, you will need to read a lot, see youtube to find the way of slaying the game.......hence, this is the strength of online community, but also the bad  nearly have no chance of winning this game alone. so in all, i somehow think it should be a 10, but the lack of story and diffulculty setting issues it get an 8."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"the game is addicting as hell, it's dark souls meet botw. easily get your money worth. the amount of content in this game is insane. easily 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,favorite game.made an account just to rate this game. polished game with no micro transactions and a massive massive map.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,"elden ring as a whole may seem charming and inviting on the outside, but i implore every single person who has ever thought about buying this game to save yourself the effort, and dont. i have played all the way to the final boss of the game, and didnt have fun at all, for the whole experience. it's slow, clunky, and overall just not fun. oh and it stutters to hell and back on pc. 010 game, would refund again. it's way too unforgiving to new players to the souls genre. and i'm saying that as someone who isnt, it's too hard, unfun, and it will completely ruin your mood every time you play it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,"well, 1010 and it's only 45 hours. that is a truly remarkable game, no, it's an outstandingly great game! as i can see there's a lot of poor reviews mostly in pc section, and those reviews have absolutely nothing to do with the game itself. it has everything, that is a quintessential of miyazaki' s art. graphics, difficulty, and an incredibly beautiful world. lore, bosses. amazing game. shame on all who downgrade this game because  and poor optimization on a game launch!! you should all be grateful to fromsoftware for this masterpiece. besides, how do you imagine playing this game on a combination of keyboard and mouse? just think about this for a moment. don't downgrade this game for no reason!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,one of the best games i have played in years hope fromsoft make more like this
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,"not the best optimisation , but god damn what a game , best in its genre for sure ! if you've played any soulsroguelike games i can definitely recommend this one ."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,i am a big fan of the soulsseries and this game gives more of that but i do not like the new open world. for my taste the game could be more  is just a little bit too open. nevertheless i think this game is a great piece of the soulsseries. the gameplay is better then ever before and you have so much more possible way to play.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,this game is the pinnacle of the souls genre that simply saved the whole videogame industry. goty 2022 for sure!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,this game is incredibly fun and i love how you can build your character in any way you want!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,"felt like the first time. this game is so awe inspiring and full of mystery, that it honestly felt like exploring my first open world game again. every time i thought i had found everything i stumbled upon a new location. there are many options to make the game easier or more difficult for yourself with equipment or leveling choices. massive amounts of content to explore that feels rewarding. only 910 though because of poor pc optimization stutterframerate lock ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,"this is the best game i have ever played. the game world is beatiful, gameplay is rewarding and the amount of content in this game is just unbelievable. i feel like storytelling could be a bit better, but besides that everything was perfect. i thought i was going to be forced to play this game on controller but the game works surprisingly well with mk. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,"i've never been a brother with the souls series. i never touched any part, and the only game from fromsoftware that i finished was sekiro. i watched the trailers and gameplay of the elden ring and decided to give it a try. i will not say that seeing videos on youtube, i was most captivated by the beautiful open world. so, the game was purchased a month after the premiere and started i soaked in 125 hours of wonderful gameplay. fromsoftware's storytelling style is so great that i couldn't tear myself away from my computer. i spent about 100 hours exploring every bit of the map, patting the optional bosses and riding my horse wherever my eyes can see me. more than once, i found myself turning in a specific direction because i was meeting something equally interesting. in order not to write too much, i will mention the most important points in my opinion pros  a beautiful open world with a huge amount of content that encourages detachment,  interesting story and nicely written characters  i got hooked so much that after finishing the game i sit and read lore on the internet.  interesting combat system, lots of weapons, nice attacks, ashes of war, skills,  the system of summoning ghosts to help  he saved me many times in the fight against the boss and it was pleasant to develop this large number of ghosts.  horse  perfect for exploring the world  nice speed, not muddy, something great.  bosses  bosses everywhere, no matter where i entered it was a satisfying boss fight after clearing the area.  grind  some treated it as a minus, but i thought the runes for the next lvl were very pleasant and i watched my character develop with pleasure.  difficulty  compared to sekiro, it was quite easy here. i tortured the crucible knight the most in the eternal prison out of 30 times, but melania came down the first time  the last boss after the third.  rivers of blood  this katana is a dream"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"game is not as user friendly as it could be. enemies are very over powered, especially if your just starting out. one or two swings and your dead. for the price point i would not expect to get this discouraged just starting out but what do i know as a consumer. enemies should not be this overpowered especially in the very beginning. this will most likely be the only game i will ever purchase from these creators. would not recommend as ive spent far less on games and had much more fun and didnt feel like i needed to take anxiety meds just to play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"masterpiece, top 3 games of all time maybe even number 1. the world is breath taking everywhere you go, this is the best execution of an open world game together with breath of the wild. extreme fun making different builds and trying different play styles the possibility to travel anywhere can lead to outleveling some bosses and make them easier but the game is still very challenging and fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"a true masterpiece. the best game from software has put out. where do i even start? there is so much to do in this game so many unique bosses, enemies, caves, mines, dungeons, castles, weapons, weapon skills and other items that are scattered all across this gigantic map. it never gets boring exploring the world because there is so much variety in the biomes and its enemies and it never feels empty thanks to all the things that you can find. i have almost 200hrs in this game and i beat it only once but that's because i took it very slowly and tried to explore everything and the thing is that i probably still missed some stuff. the story is simply amazing and in my opinion, even better than in from software's previous titles. there are much more memorable characters and i really love the way they are related to the world, other characters and your character. the story is told through the things you see in the world, the items that you find and its characters instead of exposition. this style of storytelling works amazingly for a rpg and leaves a lot of room for your imagination and allows for a very personal journey. it's like reading a book except you're playing a video game! i didn't even mention the amazing gameplay and how great the combat is. the combat of course has similarities to dark souls but you have much more tools at your disposal. you can summon spirits, use an item that turns enemies against each other, use so many spells with different categories like dragon spells, lightning spells, holy spells, magic spells, a friggin' laser and much more. if you use melee weapons you can use a new counter move, which is very useful and fun to use, you can also now equip weapons of the same type to each hand and then attack with both like in dark souls 2 and poise works like in dark souls 1. the best of all worlds! the horse combat is also amazing, you can just spawn the horse whenever you like and it's more of a extension of your character instead of an annoying transportation tool. but my favorite new feature is that normal weapons can be customized with different skills and thanks to that they can be equally as fun to use as boss weaponsunique weapons. the only negative things that i found are  when picking up an item, there is no button to go to the inventory page, you have to go there yourself if you want to read the description  switching between usable items is a little hard  coop on the open world is not very fun since you can't use the horse while playing online  there are some specific places where you can go and find no item but those are few and far between  performance and the lack of playstation button icons but those are very minor issues and don't stop me from giving this game a 1010! don't wait for a sale, this game is worth much more than 60"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"magnum opus, obra maestra, masterpiece. a gaming experience that changed the formula for open world games. one of the greatest if not the greatest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"it's ok but not so good enough. performance, story, mission design still needs improvement."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,good better than horizon forbidden mid stop rating thisna 2 cuz ur stupid  mid game is getting overshadow by elden ring its getting overshadow cuz its ass ofc nobody cares about horizon its bad compared to elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"absolutely a masterpiece. the soulsbourne formula in an open world adds a richness for veterans of fromsoftwares titles as well as an easier entry point for newcomers given that you arent stuck on a linear path for the entirety of the game. sound design, graphics, content, characters, etc. everything hits the mark and fromsoftware continues to prove that you dont need to produce a crappy ubisoft open world full of handholding quests to be a good game. its refreshing to finally have a game unburdened by micro transactions, a lack of content, political tropes, or a boring gameplay loop. if you buy any game this year, make it elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,"so big, so deep, so interesting, like nextgen zelda. many secrets, many interesting bosses, many locations. u play the game and game doesn't meant to end."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,too hard to play really not wroth my money any don't suggest for low reflex people or unpatience. total game desing and art really great but difficulty wall not allow me to experince it p great game but really  on introducing for every people.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"great game with a lot of content, but framerate issues even when playing on lower settings than the game recommends for my pc hold the game back."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"137 hours played so far on steam. the next highest on there for me are crusader kings ii 69 hrs, no man's sky 51 hrs, factorio 46 hrs, fallout 4 44 hrs. the last game i played this much was breath of the wild. it is definitely not an easy game. and, you need to become more comfortable with dying. but, once you get the hang of it, it's an addicting game with plenty to do. the world is absolutely huge, and there are dungeons and bosses and other secrets littered all over the place. it would be a nightmare to get 100 completion. the leveling system is a little whacky. you lose your runes which are needed to level and buy things every time you die, and you're given one chance to collect them. if you die again before returning to the place you died initially to collect them, they're lost forever. it can make the game incredibly frustrating. but, now i basically level by runefarming a certain area, and ignore my lost runes when i die. coupled with use of multiplayer where applicable, the game became 10x easier, and more like botw. i did experience the stuttering some pc folks complain about, and this is on a brandnew system with a gtx3070. after fiddling with the graphics, as well as the recent patch, i'm not experiencing much of that anymore. at the end of the day, any game that has me playing as much as this one does deserves a 1010. is it perfect? no. but if we reserved 1010 for perfect games, i'm not sure if we'd ever use it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"blown away by the vast world. i have been playing fromsoft games since armored core 1 and king's fieldthis, this is the zenith of all things they've made thus far. forget the maidenless reviews from players who haven't taken the time to git gud. i rated it a 9 because of performance issues but you will not regret this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"awful game. it's just 80 hours of raw, unforgiving pain. and not the fun kind of pain  the stupid kind of pain. i love dark souls 1 and 3 and have completed them plenty of times, so it's not that i have an issue with the souls series. i actually went back and started a playthrough of ds3 after getting most of the way through elden ring just to remind myself what a fun from software game looks like. the bad 1 boss design. absolute garbage. every one of them is a giant dude that can hit you for 75 to 100 of your health from infinite range with aoe. every one of them has an 8 hit combo. every one of them has some illegible attack that they wind up, pause for 12 seconds, and then swing super fast. tree sentinel? the first boss you come across that you're supposed to skip, yes, yes, i know? yeah, it's a dude on a horse. his jump attack doesn't go straight at you. no, he jumps about 30 degrees off to the side so that your spells will miss him, and then changes direction in midair to hit you. if he had wings or was some ethereal being, sure, that would makes sense. he doesn't. he's just a dude on a horse and someone at from software decided horses can defy physics now. half the time, you're in a tiny room so you can't manuever too. one boss like that? sure, it's fun. capra demon was cool. sister friede was cool. but in this game, it's every. single. boss. 2 it should have been called dark souls 4. once again, we're in a decaying world with a bunch of people who speak slowly and vaguely. there's some gods. they're not doing their part. we're some undead dude that needs to go fix the world. souls are now runes. bonfires are sites of grace and they're still used as a loading icon on the lower left of your screen. phantoms are still phantoms. messages are still there. you still get a nice big you died when you die. it's all just too familiar. look, if you're going to just reskin dark souls, right down to the plot, just call it dark souls. 3 the characters. just about every character in this game starts with a g, r, or m. want to keep track of the difference between godric and godwyn? how about marika, malenia, and melina? maybe you'd like some ranni, renna, and rennala? redahn and radagon? what the hell. i completely stopped caring about this plot  george r. r. martin and miyazaki have lost their minds. 4 pc performance. awful. even on a high end machine, you'll come up against constant stuttering. enemies and allies will turn invisible. half the time, my dude is riding around on an invisible horse. it's kinda funny, but it's really frustrating when you can't see the adds in a huge boss fight. the good 1 the environments and enemies still look cool. they look great, even, and the world is huge. but it's just not enough to carry this game on its own. especially since it's still the same art style that we've come to know from other dark souls games. skip it. just skip it. buy it when it's in the bargain bin in two years if you must, for curiosity's sake."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"i do not understand why those who love the game love it so much. i played the game for 20 hours and heard 30 sentences in total, how is this a perfect game? is it the game of the year to make a map and fill it with ridiculous bosses and creatures? i've played the game for 20 hours and i don't understand what's going on in the game, there is no such nonsense game. there are already a few dialogues in total, and they wrote them so strangely to create mystery. for example, i see someone in the game, i think he will talk about what the game is about. he makes two stupid sentences and says go on, i can't deal with you. when i went to that round table, for the first time i said, okay, now they'll tell you two things. they said two ridiculous things. someone said let me know if you see that woman, a woman hugged me and then said f.. off now. the other one has a wheel on his head, he said, let me teach you something and he was teaching magic. someone stands and looks at me and doesn't speak at all. something like two statues is holding on to a stick selling something, what kind of environment is that? tell me this. is not it? for example, i came across something like a big cauldron while i was traveling, it was stuck on the ground and i saved it by hitting it, so this is not a normal type, is it? you have to explain this, the talking cauldron, it has hands and arms, what is it, where did it come from? no. i'm alexander i'm traveling that's it??? i entered one cave, there are wolves etc. then i went through a fog and there's a creature i can't remember the exact name of, something like the monster man of azura. i killed him and got out in 56 tries. eh? what's up now? what did i understand, he is a type that looks like he has mutated from wolves, what is he looking for here, who is he? they modeled it and threw it there, two moves, it's over. is this the perfect game? in short, there is no story that draws me in. if there is a story with a boss, you are ambitious to learn the continuation of that story, you try to defeat it, right? what's the story in this game? what motivates you in this game? what makes you wonder to continue? does the next boss shoot by spinning, or does he create a sword out of nothing and shoot to understand it? for example, i think that first boss appeared in a place like a bridge. tarnished etc. he said. who is this? what does it do? what's the deal with this? his face is like rabies, he hits with a big stick in one hand, hits with his tail, throws out an imaginary knife, hits with an imaginary sledgehammer, hits with an imaginary sword, but what is the place of this in that story? i watched a few videos and there are too many meaningless bosses. i don't think any of them are told about their story, because as i said, i played for 20 hours and i must have heard 30 sentences or something. the cat statue is the boss, the dragon is the boss, the big horse is the little boss, etc. even the item names are meaningless. there was an item named something like white pickled rabbit d i think the man who did it thought let this boss have a tail, hmm this one has 30 hands, what should it be, sir? let it shoot and shook everything out of his head. anyway, i guess people thought they would make up a story in their head. if there is a decent story, do i have to open it and look it up on the internet etc.? tell me the story in the game. i would like to learn the story of the game in the game, not by asking uncle google, we are playing a game, after all, we are not doing thesis research, are we? the game world is full. get out of there. if we don't see the game, we will eat it. creatures wandering around aimlessly. go around and kill. is this the full world? there is no sign of a living world or the like. i played a total of 30 hours with other characters and i always played in the mind of people have always loved this game, what do i not understand, i should love it too. but it's a very bad game. you're stuck on a hype. the game also got 96 points??? what does 96 points mean? it means everything has to be perfect. performance issues alone should have prevented him from getting that score. no story, no enemy ai. if we look at the graph, it  too. if other games had these problems, the whole game world would curse that game. but if you ask about this game, the answer is always the same souls games don't look for these d don't look at the animation, don't look at the graphics, don't look at the story presentation, don't look at the optimization, what the hell are we looking for? come to a boss, die 50 times to that boss, go back that way, memorize the moves of that boss and finally when you kill him, oovaaaauuuvvv, this is the game, what a defeat, this is the pleasure of difficulty, yiaaa. the game is just that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"easily the best open world and minimalist ux experience ever invented, nearly ruined by its being a technical dumpster fire. while amateur critics lambasted games like cyberpunk for sporadic texture glitches, elden ring features server disconnects in a single player game, a plethora of ctds, save corruptions that will see dozens of hours of progress lost, multiplayer disconnects, and a complete lack of matchmaking in multiplayer that will make gameplay with a friend a slog of level 100 players camping level 130 areas. elden ring has an expansive and meaningful world and rich, perfectly understated lore. unfortunately, it struggles at being a game underneath everything it does well. monsters will hit you through walls, iframes on dodges and hitboxes on attacks are imperfect, and the classleveling system is skewed in importance early on due to the game's prioritization of level over stats as an expression of the player's power. it's a great game. i just wish they spent a little more time making the gameplay enjoyable and maybe consider using their cloud system to protect players from save corruption? this is the first time i've seen save corruption in over a decade, and it's inexcusable. that alone is worth taking two points off the total score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"i enjoyed this game and spent around 45 hours playing, my problem is i have reached a point where i just can't progress. the bosses are too difficult. also i can't stand a game where i need to have the game guide open in a seperate tab for like 95 of gameplay. some of the things i have had to use guides for i'm sure i would have never figured out without them. it's just not fun for me when a game is so difficult that it requires a play guide. also i cant not stand the fact that it is open world and there is no indicator of how difficult an enemy is before you attack it it would be really nice if they showed the enemies' levels rather than just getting one shotted all the time. i really gave this game an honest try but i've decided it isn't worth any further investment. i'm probably going to try and play dark souls because it is linear progression."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"is this dark souls 4? on the surface, it appears so, but if you play it like a dark souls game, you'll have a very short lifespan. the open world and horse mechanics opens up new possibilities during combat which are completely necessary to overcome the challenges. this is an evolution of ds and sekiro set in an open world. it is engrossing and the urge to explore and discover new mysteries is palpable. highly recommended to those who have loved the ds series and even those who have never played them. it is exquisite!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"the hardest video game i have ever played in my life is also the masterpiece of the decade bar none! elden ring has raised every bar imaginable for every game across every category, and this is the rare title that truly deserves its hype. gushing with content from head to toe, a gorgeous openworld that puts everything else, even the amazing horizon forbidden west to shame! incredible combat system that pulls no punches with savage enemies who will adapt to every situation. the most intense boss fights i have ever experienced. i don't know how many more times i could say masterpiece about elden ring, its zelda on a thousand steroids and is the must play title of the decade. hardest game you will ever play, no hand holding whatsoever, but if you can get past its difficulty, its a diamond the size of jupiter. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"the culmination of years of perfection by fromsoftware. brutal, challenging  punishing. yet also fair  easier than what came before, thanks to more options made available that the layer has to find  actively use. pc version's only real marring quality is it's stability, requiring waiting for the game to warm up before you stop seeing hitches in the frame rate or brief pauses. but even then they don't go away."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"cons 1 the streamer is dumb 2 the map is big and confusing 3 the optimization is horrible, the game runs poorly on rtx 4the people who make tutorials are dumb too. they don't show the map, they just show a specific corner hoping we know where it is. pros the game is beautiful, at 40 fps"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"it's a good, and fun game. sure, it had some graphical issues, but none of them have caused any problems or annoyances for myself"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"the handling is clumsy. the gameplay itself is slow, outdated, like the graphics are. and despite that fact, the game manages to lag on a pretty good computer. total waste of my money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"after 120h of pure frustration and 200 level at least 4050 farmed, i give this game 210. the game is beaten solo offline. it , and here is why main story there isn't one, after 200h the only thing that can be understood is that there is a stupid ring g.r.r.'s courtesy, and that is it. you finish the game and there is no ring, you become elden lord, whatever that means, and that is it. side quests not a one normal quest that i will remember. no quest tracking, no map points, nothing. i've finished the game and missed 90 of the quests. some of them i finished following various yt videos because i needed some gear, otherwise i wouldn't finish any of them. all quests expect players to spend tens of hours figuring out where will the quest character appear and when, and since the world is huge, that is a nonsense. the whole exhausting dialogs approach is stupid in many ways. combat pure frustration. dark souls sheep that believe that dodging is a skill, i pity them. controlling your character feels like controlling an old dude who is lagging in every movement, and you are supposed to dodge with him in front of enemies with limitless stamina, 5 hit combos and 5mlong weapons. drinking potions is slow, so you need to dodge at least 57 times away from some enemies in order to be able to drink one potion without getting hit again. most enemies use endless combos. it doesn't matter which level you are, if you go back to the beginning and find yourself between 23 enemies, you will die from couple of hits. it seems that your health is taken by percentage, almost every boss in the game will kill you in 3 hits at most. waving with staff takes the same amount of stamina as hitting enemy with 3m hammer! enemies great design for some enemies and bosses, and that's it, everything else about enemies is frustrated. big bosses are stupid locked camera goes crazy, hit box is not accurate. some normal enemies are way harder than some bosses. all enemies are way agile than your old dude. double bosses are stupid. double stage bosses are even more stupid. some bosses have enemies before it, each time you have to deal with them before entering boss area, because if you don't, you will get hit from back, or your summons will fight the enemies behind the barrier instead of boss. difficulty nothing to say here, everybody knows it is kind of stupid difficulty that has nothing to do with the skills. i can only say that leveling up your character and coming back later is not fun at all. it makes you skip the content, the whole areas, the whole quests, and forgetting about them. losing runes on death is just frustrating, it doesn't make the game any more difficult, it makes it longer because you will try to farm runes instead of playing the game. open world the design of the world is great, with wonderful scenes. the world is describing you its atmosphere graphically, whereas the music is not following that atmosphere at all. however, like many games, this one is also using open world to extend game's length in a lazy way. a lot of places have nothing, you are just traveling vast spaces without finding anything. animations slow combat movementdrinking potionopening doorsgetting up when knocked downbow attack, ... controls they chose the biggest idiot to make this port to pc. never seen more stupid key bindings in any game, ever. how dafuq i am going to use earrow key in the middle of a fight?! and don't tell me you have to use joystick, bla, bla, .... if you are charging for pc game same as psxbox, you should invest some time in adjusting it for pc. have they just assigned random keys?! then there is constant shuffling between spells, potions, weapons, ... try doing that in front of boss that takes 90 of your health with one hit. i've died countless times because i shuffled wrong item. there is no consistency at all sometimes you can use esc to close something, something you must, sometimes you can't. space for running instead of shift like in every game?! g for map, why not m?! f for jump?! ui stupid dark souls recycled ui. it seems they copied everything they can from there. in a game where you die hundreds of times, you should be more creative with death messageanimation, but they went with the lame you died for 100th time. inventory management is painful. no pause! when you want to exit you are forced to see 2 logo animations again. click any key to continue except enter and space. soundmusic i think there is one track throughout the whole game, and second one when somebody attacks you. and they both . i wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. this game feels like doing chores and not playing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"i have logged just over 100 hours into this game over the last two weeks, and i am a working professional, husband, and father of 3. no game is without flaws however, i am overjoyed with the value proposition of this game. for me, it is like a mix between of few of my favorite games such as zelda breath of the wild, tom raider, and an old favorite everquest, etc. it is a massive achievement, particularly in this age of poor quality releases. this game will be as timeless as breath of the wild, and more so for me due to its' adult nature and added verticality to many challenges. there is ample freedom to explore, creativity in tackling obstacles, and just when you find yourself on the verge of boredom or thinking you're approaching end game, the world opens up further and new challenges put you back in your place. i am often surprised by death in a way that brings a smile to my face  like ok you got me there. then there is of course victory after several failed attempts that brings joy from overcoming. bravo. masterpiece, warts and all."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"masterpiece. perfect in every regard except performance sometimes, but it's not that bad really"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,"the beginning of this game is probably some of the best time i've had gaming, ever. however, the more you go on, the more you realize the game is full of copypaste dungeons and bosses. i can't put into words how bored i got fighting the same bosses over and over and over again. there are 6!! different versions of the same boss, 5 for another boss. and the farther you get into the game, the emptier the world feels. aesthetically, the world is absolutely beautiful, but it's just empty. i do understand that this is a problem with just about every open world game, but i think it was a mistake to make a fromsoft game open world. on top of the open world issues, the game is just too easy. the allure of an open world and fromsoft games in general is to explore every inch, find secrets, and acquire more gear. however this leads to you being overleveled way too fast, which meant i was just breezing through the game more than i ever have in dark souls, bloodborne, or sekiro. overall, it's a good game, better than most, even. but for a fromsoft game, i'm disappointed."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"from software has made recent history with one of the highest recently released games, elden ring. every bit of praise has been deserved with how much this game has to offer, especially given the fact that the developers changed their formula quite a bit, making this soulslike arpg open world and filled it to the brim with content. while there have been some performance complaints due to the network errors and stutters, most of the issues are minor and hardly game breaking. this game will no doubt make it to goty and is one of the best arpgs to release since witcher 3. there are no words that can describe how beautiful the lands between are, let alone how much content is filled in every nook and cranny. from the beautiful lake of liurnia, to the vast plains of the atlus plateau and the towering mountaintops of the giants, i constantly feel the need to screen capture every moment. elden ring is absolutely visually stunning, especially on a 30 series gpu. not to mention, you never run out of things to do between dungeons, area bosses, hidden items and shacks of merchants, and evergaols around each and every corner. there is always something new to discover between the hours spent roaming each area and i absolutely love it. i would often find myself running into random caves that would ascend to the depths with a boss waiting for me, or even random ruins of a church or building with some much needed loot inside. nothing feels too obvious to find, and everything becomes more challenging with puzzles and obstacles, or just a purely brutal boss. each area is also filled with hours worth of quests and discoveries, i mean there are 83 bosses in the entire game. limgrave alone will take a player around 25 hours to fully complete given the fact that there are 15 dungeons alone. evergaols are a delightful surprise that often end in pain or fun. they are, in laymans terms, what can be described as everlasting jails, with brutally tough bosses waiting to fight you in an arena that is basically their prison. some will require a stonesword key to open, and usually those ones are a bit hard than the others. that being said, if you are over leveled, some of these fights can be a cake walk. the nice part about them is the fact that if you die, your souls will be left outside of the ring leaving little to no punishment, but the fights still feel rewarding to take part in. these gaols are scattered throughout the lands between with little to no obstacles in the way, and they can be challenged at any time without progression punishment and rewards. while every class has their unique stat priorities like any souls game or rpg in general, due to the sheer damage every enemy seems to cause, vitality is one of the most important stats for every class. it is highly recommended to get this specific stat to at least 20, and even then most players have changed the spec even higher. almost all magic using classes have become glass cannons as well as dexterity classes. many bosses have a move that can one hit any player with 20 dumped into vitality which is insane. it should also be noted that soft and hard caps have completely changed for each stat. every stat hard caps at 99, but now there are around three tiers of soft caps that are completely different for each class. a prime example would be that stats like faith and intelligence soft cap at 20, 80, and 90, while endurance has four soft caps at 12, 18, 32, and 50. this in turn creates a whole new ball park for pvp, which we will have to wait and see where the meta turns. one added bonus to from softwares first open world souls game is the spectral steed torrent. torrent is a life saver due to how massive the world is, but also changes fights entirely. i love the fact that you can fight with a weapon or use spells while mounted, but also sometimes choose not to due to the fact that you can fight area bosses mounted and it makes it way less challenging. dragons are a prime example of this, because even though they can most likely one shot you, you can complete a lot of the fight without getting hit if you use torrent. convenient or not, it does take away from the impact and fun of the fight a lot of the time. however, torrent is great if you want to grind for souls and quickly take out enemies. overall, elden ring has slowly become one of my favorite games of all time, and is one of the top open world arpgs to release this generation. while there can be some balancing changes, as well as some performance fixes that will come with time anyway, this game is almost perfect in story, side content, and gameplay all around."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"can't give it a good rating, because of poor pc port. it's been a month since the game launched and it still stutters, no matter the graphic settings, drivers, anticheat or satanic rituals. the world does seem interesting, but fromsoft had the audacity to release a stuttering game that is all about reacting to your opponent? for real? don't buy it, there's a high chances it won't run properly for you"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"amazing game, one of the best i have played since 10years! i had zero problem with my pc with performance! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"it's a game that suffer from the same problem as it's predecessor. the art and overall world design is flawless not counting the hostile part, that's for the next pat, there is nothing i can say on that, it's just wonderful. where the problem is with the game, is the gameplay. overall, the game end up being hard for the sake of being hard. the intricate story and the breathtaking artstyle end up being painful to access as you have to face all the unceasing crap the game send your way. as with other game from the director, you can still screw yourself up from questline by doing things the games never indicate you should not, like attacking a bear in the area where they attack you this cuts you out from a quest. this kind of situation can happen at any point, and considering the lenght of the game and how it save constantly, it is still impossible to correct the tiny mistake you make. but hey! it's still better than a game daring to hold your hand a bit, am i right? also, it's been 13 years and there is still no pause that isn't an exploit. that you are alone in your game or even fully offline, in 2022, if you need to use the bathroom, mr miyazaki say you need to wait the needlessly painful experience, the lack of basic game functions like pause and the obcession with being overly cryptic to the point of negatively impacting the gamew experience is why i cannot give more than a 5. the game is gorgeous, but it's not worth much when everytrhing else is pain"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"this game is great. i heard it had a rough launch on pc, however i didn't have such problems, yes my game crashed once or twice in my 200 hours playing, but nothing too bad. the world of elden ring is amazing, is beautiful, the art direction is incredible. graphics were never the strong suit of from software games, so don't expect photorealistic graphics, but its not a complain, the graphics are not bad either, its better than ds3 but worse than the demon's souls remake for ps5. i was afraid of the open world, open world games normally are repetitive and empty, not elden ring tho, the world is full of things to do, every corner, every little cave has something waiting for you, if i have one complain is some bosses are reused especially on dungeons, but, normally makes sense, like, a knight from a army or a regiment, of course there are more then just the one knight dude, its a army after all. there are plenty of unique bosses and enemies, probably more than any other from software game before. from software already proved that it is willing to release new patches for the game so than can correct any performance or balance issues, at this time i have played it in full once, exploring everything i found, killing every boss i encountered and i have to say this game has a lot of content, and a lot of it is a homage to past soulsborne games. if you already love the genre, this is a must buy, if you're new to the genre, this game offers a lot of ways to make you life easier, yes it is a hard game, but if you put the time to learn how to build your character and use all the tools given, you wont have too much trouble getting to the end credits. summons for example can help you a lot during difficult encounters, splitting the enemies attention and giving you an opportunity to attack them while they attack your summons, and the coop still the same as ever, maybe easier, since you can craft the item that allows coop easily. this game is great, it isn't perfect , nothing in this world is, but is one of the better ones i have played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,overhyped! but still a good game. its just a little bit monotonous. the only thing you are doing is fighting. need better weapons? fight! want to explore the area? fight! want do something beside fighting? buy a new game! the other point which i dont like is the introduction. they do not explain so much things.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"absolutely phenomenal. the start is pretty difficult for people who are new to the series but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a glorious journey of slaying giant foes with precision. i would recommend this game to anyone wishing to challenge themselves."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"game does not stop crashing for some reason, pc can run every other games except this one. searched up everything to fix it. and on top of that the support of bandai did not even reply. really disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"this is one of the glitchier games i've played in a while, worse than my experience with cyberpunk, halo infinite or the newer call of duty games. it's not enough to make it unplayable by any means, but random graphic glitches, enemies sometimes being invisible at first, stuttery visuals when moving. i'm using an rtx 3080 graphics card too and only on high settings because on maximum settings its much more stuttery. i shouldn't have any issues with one of the best modern graphics cards on the market, especially when this game isn't pushing the envelope on graphics. running cyberpunk on ultra with rtx is a smoother experience than elden ring on high settings. i can't imagine how rough it is for people with mediocre specs. pc feels very much like an after thought. weird controls by default, weird feeling mouse movement, doesn't autodetect keyboard so you have to dig for the setting to change the button prompts. the world feels fleshed out with solid lore and mechanics. you can tell they put a lot of passion into it within 10 minutes of playing. after several bosses you're hooked into the story and mechanics of improving your build. it's addicting and the downsides of the pc release don't ruin that, but it definitely burns a little bit. i've played minimal amounts of ds3 and bloodbourne, only several bosses each, so this is the farthest i've ever gotten in a fromsoftware game with about 10 hours of play time and level 70ish. i'm not one to play bosses over and over again so i picked mage, found some op gear, beat some bosses and then did some rune farming  its essentially a builtin easy mode. the game is still challenging but it gives me a way to progress without getting frustrated. this also feels like one of the largest open worlds i've ever played. as i said i'm 10 hours in, i don't think i've explored even 5 of what this game has to offer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"elden ring es un juego entretenido, pero no una obra maestra. resumidamente, es dark souls 4 con un mundo ms abierto. si esperabas una historia como la que prometieron, con jrr martin involucrado, olvdalo, es la misma historia, el mismo worldbuilding y la misma forma de contarlo que en ds3. si esperabas un mundo abierto lleno de cosas, olvidalo tambin, es un mundo abierto lleno de combates pero poco ms ocasionalmente un minipuzzle, o algn npc con el que hablar, pero igual que en los mapas de ds, y un mundo abierto que especialmente en zonas interiores y a partir de la mitad del juego rpidamente pasa a cerrarse cada vez ms. el combate es el mismo de siempre, con la adicin de caballo que funciona igual que en mount and blade. la progresin es la misma de siempre. los enemigos se repiten un montn en diferentes zonas, incluidos los bosses. y ya. grficamente el juego es muy bonito... al principio. luego la ejecucin sigue siendo excelente pero los modelados se repiten de zonas anteriores e incluso las zonas nuevas se sienten rpidamente ya vistas antes porque podran perfectamente ser zonas de arnor londo o cualquier otro lugar de ds. no en vano uno de los comentarios que ms veo en la gente es esto se siente familiar. el sonido tiene un valor decente pero me ha decepcionado especialmente una banda sonora que encuentro muy anodina, carente de temas memorables. la ia es ms bien tirando a mala, tanto en amigos como en enemigos. y el juego tiene un montn de bugs, desde el pobre optimizado que lleva a cadas de fps, a glitches grficos con la iluminacin, a enemigos que atacan a travs de paredes y finalmente salidas a escritorio. por todo ello, no es mal juego si, como a mi, te gustan los dark souls, pero no es una obra maestra, y representa un paso atrs despus de todas las innovaciones que from haba introducido en sekiro. y, adems de la falta de pulido, hay que sealar que el juego se siente sin terminar, con questlines que quedan en el aire y un cierre creciente fruto de tener que terminarlo. un 6. pd como nota final, una cosa muy personal, que puede que al resto no le ocurra. como siempre, quera jugar un personaje de armadura pesada, escudo y espada larga, un clsico en mi. la mejor espada larga para un personaje con una build de fuerza la encontr nada ms salir del tutorial... y ahora todo el juego con la misma espada. la mejor armadura la consegu antes de la mitad del juego y antes de eso encontr el escudo. desde entonces, el mismo equipo, todo el rato, lo cual se vuelve cansino. le quita toda la gracia a obtener nuevo loot cuando sabes que va a ser peor, llega un punto en que ya ni lo miras. y es un error de diseo que se produzca as, cortando toda la progresin en equipo de una build que puede ser genrica pero no debera ser olvidada tantsimo como para que la mejor espada se consiga con 1 hora de juego y luego ya no quede ms que refinarla. y no me importa por cuestin de stats, sino por la sensacin que da de repeticin y prdida, que hace que solo busque loot para conseguir los talismanes. una decepcin a mayores para el juego, aunque como digo, muy personal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,brilliant masterpiece! its an example how games should look. probaby the best game from software and in future game of the year.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"faced with a vast world, where various passive and hostile creatures inhabit, you have the freedom to explore and discover secrets. a perfect game for soulslike style."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"i sport a monster of a pc and use a controller, so i can feel for those who have technical issues and have qualms with the lack of pc support. legitimate complaints, all of them. but i'm reviewing my experience. the game  technical support aside, is nothing short of a masterpiece. fromsoftware has jam packed so much content in a game that can be beaten in a matter a few dozen hours, or with hundereds of hours, depending on how you play. they drop you into the world with no purpose, and then culminate everything towards you becoming elden lord. yeah, absolutely no small feat, but with a the barrage of new experiences, surprises around the corner, the figure it out yourself brand of quest lines, and the complete release of a player into a world where they make the choices  it's a truly fascinating game design choice from a formerly very rigid gameplay cycle and linear design the developer was known for. is it perfect? no game is  but i feel it at times is very close aside from some weaponbuild style balancing, and was the pc port extremely disappointing? absolutely. but past these issues, this has to be cemented as one of the best titles of the year  and that fromsoftware has ever released, free of tropes and rehashed open world designs, taking risks to diverge both from their core fan base and average gamers experience to bring something familiar yet as a completely new amalgamation of great ideas with enough ambiguity to embolden those who made the effort to understand the subtle and indirect presentation of the games tasks and lore. i'll acknowledge the technical shortcomings, certainly not ideal for all players, but the core game itself, is a feat that i feel cannot be dragged down by the unfortunate technical issues which i agree, need to be figured out by the developers and better supported. this is goty territory in febmar"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"ahora el turno es a por las tierras intermedias! saludos sinluz, en esta nueva aventura por las tierras intermedias en bsqueda del anillo de elden te puedo comentar lo siguiente elden es el sumun de mecnicas de la saga souls, bloodborne y sekiro. deja el estilo de mapeado lineal y arriesga esta vez por presentar una obra en mundo abierto. si nunca haz jugado algn juego de este estilo no te preocupes, elden est diseado para nuevos en la saga y trata de ser el ms accesible en cuanto a la difcultad. tendrs muchos checkpoints para tu reaparicin y que puedas recuperarte lo ms pronto si llegas a caer en un combate, recuerda que estos juegos muchas veces se basa en ensallo y error, por ende aprender de ellos es cardinal y necesario para tu progreso. existe un sistema de crafteo de tems por si quieres ahorrarte las compras de los mismos, es tu eleccin farmear materiales y crearte tus mismas flechas por ejemplo o simplemente pagar en un comerciante para obtenerlas. aaden un companion equino espectral para que te ayude en la exploracin del vasto mapa y por qu no en los combates o simplemente salir de ellos. hay varias zonas secundarias por no decir muchas, mazmorras, catacumbas, tumbas con trampas, minas para material de refinado para tus armas, diseminadas por las tierras intermedias, unas muy ocultas que otra que cuentan con buenos diseos y recompensas que son opcionales pero que depende de tu estilo de juego alguna que otra te convendr ms en obtener sus recompensas. en el combate puedo decir que como cualquier otro souls, sigue siendo desafante y gratificante cuando en eso algn enemigo se te hace resistencia pero cuando lo logras esa segregacin de dopamina por el xito es nico y caracterstico en este gnero. lo enemigos esta vez cuentan con una barra o medidor interna de postura que con ataques cargados o en salto se las romperas muy rpido y es indispensable para hacerles mayor dao por un crtico. muy aconsejable. salto! oh s, esta vez contamos con un salto cuando andas a pie que te ayudar para la exploracin y combates, al igual con el caballo pero este podr contar con doble salto para llegar ms lejos. en elden para los combates puedes pedir una ayuda en solitario de algunos npcs o espectros que podrs invocar. pero tambin est el apartado cooperativo online pero esta vez debes hacerte con un item para activarlo pero teniendo en cuenta que activas a su vez el competitivo. todo esto sera lo ms notable en mis primeras horas de este ttulo, pero a la fecha lo ms notable como lo malo es el desempeo o mal rendimiento pero que segn from estn trabajando en los parches respectivos. cosas que hacen falta a mi punto de vista, es que debieron haber metido alguna subcategora en el inventario de los objetos nuevos tomados, ya que coges muchos y luego quieres saber su descripcin para saber su utilidad y se te pierde si no te acuerdas del nombre, debieron quedar resaltados en tu inventario mnimo hasta que lo hayas visto en el mismo al menos una vez. lo otro que si ests en cooperacin online y en el mapa abierto, que si pones un marcador cooperativo que estuvieran en el mapa de ambos para coordinar el sitio a ir en conjunto, pero solo cuentas con una brjula en el hud que te seala la direccin de dnde estn los compaeros en caso de perderlos de vista... ante todo esto, si haz llegado a leer esta resea sencilla sobre elden, no me queda ms que decir que recomendarte est gran obra del maestro hidetaka miyasaki y george rr martin. es un verdadero must play que est reescribiendo el gnero mundo abierto  souls."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"story has some dark souls vibes but it is fresh and not so short. gameplay has best from all ds games. open world is wonderful, always interesting to explore. bosses are challenging but spirit ashes makes them a lot easier for non hardcore players. i cant say if i will replay it straightaway first walkthrough, but ill do it anyway some time sooner"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"not sure what the hype is all about. feels grindyslow, devoid of lifeatmosphere, controls  out of the gate, inventoryetc management , graphics are ok at best. has a very jrpg feel to it somehow. overall it feels like going back to the original gothic game with its certain 'feel' after playing through skyrim with what i would label a much 'better' 'feel'."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,it was another console port . pc gamers were playing this type of game 15 years ago . what's with all the hype . i was bored after about an hour . and the controls were awful . gutted i spent money on it . and the amount of fake reviews is a joke . a 10 really? really ! bs
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"this game is actually good in many aspects, but the pc optimization is just trash and makes the experience unenjoyable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"a beautiful mess. i played this game for 50 hours, and i just don't have the motivation to finish it. the open world aspect of this game feels shallow, empty and meaningless. nothing has changed since bloodbornedark souls 3. there is no driving factor in this game, the bosses are plentiful but most are reskins of eachother put in a small dungeon in the corner of a map, there is no satisfation to killing a boss, you are rewarded with the same items over and over making them obsolete. the game is boring, a empty husk of what could've been a great game. overall this game is a big stepdown from fromsoft's earlier works, i'm not even going to touch on the performance issues this game has. i'm dissapointed, what happened fromsoft?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,"esto no es lo nico en lo que destaca, el juego pone a nuestra disposicin una cantidad bastante flexible de estilos de combate, existe la posibilidad de aadir y modificar la habilidad de ciertas armas, adems de volver el famoso powerstance, que permite aadir un moveset nuevo si llevas dos armas de la misma categora. la variedad de hechizos, habilidades y movimientos provoca que la creatividad sea partcipe de como afrontas a los enemigos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,best game i have ever played. if only the pc version did not mess up with the game the rating of the users would be higher

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,i'm an old school gamer that has been around through all the ground breaking games. this game has renewed my faith in video games when nothing seemed to interest me anymore. my favorite game of all time.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,"one of the best games ive ever played, for those that say that it is too hard, there is a easier way to play. using ash summons and summoning npcs and other player can make the game absurdly easy but you are the one in control of what you use"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,"honestly this is about one of the best games i've played in a long time, if not ever. i'm a huge fan of rpgs, roguelikes, and not a huge fan of 3rd person action games, but the depth of gameplay and world exploration in this game is phenomenal."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"masterpiece . great challenge, amazing story, and has max replay value. worth every penny and years waiting"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,i love this game. it runs nearly flawlessly on pc however the game doesn't tell you the controls and the default ones for mouse and keyboard are not great. i fixed this within five minutes by checking what people recommended you change the keybindings to with a quick google search. the world is beautifully crafted and some areas are genuinely scary if you're underleveled and it's able to let you explore but still sort of advise you to stay in the starting section. if you do choose to risk it and adventure you can get some really fantastic rewards. the message system is a little weird and is mostly trolling but sometimes it's helpful and doesn't really take away from the experience. overall the world reminds me of botw and so does a lot of the experience. if you are uncultured and don't know what botw is look it up and check its score on metacritic.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,not enjoyable for me. so much hype and i don't understand why. i get the appeal of souls games but it's the same thing over and over. bad port
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"buen juego, pero si le falta mucha optimizacion, para tener un equipo bueno deja mucho que desear."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"after more hours  it wasnt more attractive its not hard and challenging. its just dumb. let me explain how is this  in can masterpiece my first defeated boss. walked down to canyon by some dumb mario bros shortcut horse only, climbing is to difficult for programmers. found crypt with stone goblins and boss. read a lot of spoilers look left etc. skyrim is scarier. tried to kill goblin ahead, targeting button is locking one on sealing, cant change target.... found some ground button to unlock door. i dont see something  why mount door open button so far away. so complicated mechanism and no door key. ive killed few times goblins to spend runes for next level. why i cant spend runes for 0.7 part of level? thats why i feel little like in mmo kill mobs until level up and next kill boss... killing boss wasnt easy a specially when not killed goblins and just run to the boss room. 2 problems  goblin heads in magic boss door and summoned wolves attacking them without effect. 3rd problem dumb fight style with bosses  hundrets of non physical dodges, wrong collisions, and not many options with weapon and shield, little dumb counters. more logic would be some aikidojudo movements with so much mass difference or just big cannon, physical huge companionminionarmy,... next part after killing goblins and boss i've won. lot of stones i did it etc but for what? i didnt saw any loot. weaker goblin had more attractive but also dumb stone head helmet. no satisfactions. same thing with killing large trolls. my opinion was 510 now i could only give less. 310 earlier review maybe too early for review, but just boring, not intriguing. bigger overhype than cp77. how its possible to get so many possitives before release?  optimization 310  story 210 fingers, rings, witches, some boring ideas  graphics and nice atmospheric lightning 710  menu and shortcuts with keyboard 210  physics and fighting 510  open world i don't feel consistance, reason to go further. its so chaotic and claustrophobic in design.  tutorial 210  i hate this text stones. i dont know why i cannot summon spirits. ive found after hours how to run and lock target.  fighting  u die very often but painless. it would be easy when u find weak points, preferred weapon sets and know how to run, but its too old style. not much physics, cant undecide to do some move. illogical counter, block, break system or animations. only left right attack axis. i dont want to enable enemy lock to move backwards. tps camera lock would be better for me. level up system 410 good are small changes between levels but i prefer training level up style than some collecting runes overall 510  only because i hope next part of the game would be maybe more interesting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"punishing, brutal, satisfying. there is a new adventure around every corner of an extremely large world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"you would be lying if you said this game didn't have great potential its almost there, yeah the pc port is lack luster but really complaining about ultrawide support is kinda pathetic, the game runs fine for me i don't know why that's a problem for so many. i get it, after games like cyberpunk and security breach another poorly optimized game isn't what we wanted but to give it a 0 just because it doesn't always run smooth 60fps, i really and i mean really enjoy playing this game its just fun and isn't that all that really matters. i understand being mad about the port but i think this is to far. lets just enjoy the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"horizons, far cry's, tom clancy's  don't worry little player you safe with us. just take our hand and we show you where to go. and while you at it you can look around and enjoy view of our ray traced, uberrealistic and completely dead and boring world. you can enjoy mediocre story that you've seen thousand of times. enjoy our overbearing ux that clutter every inch of your ultrawide 4k monitor. the worst thing you can do is move from already carefully paved pass to explore underwhelming boredom of our empty, dead game. some problems with stuttering and fps dips, but nothing that couple of patches couldn't fix. great game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"elden ring is a fantastic and the most ambitious project from soft has done yet, maybe too ambitious since i've found myself almost angry at times since the map and stuff to do is so big. it has some problems here and there with the port, but most of them have been solver already with patches. it is overall a great game, with very little negative aspects such as topography, nonetheless the game is still a great joy to play and experience!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,elden ring a game that almost every souls fan including myself craved for so long finally released was it worth the hype ? yes yes and yes the game is the most fun i had since red dead 2 its stupidly immersive and fun everything in this world is just wow i have almost 70 hours on console and pc combined and i still haven't seen everything this is totally game of the year material the only bad things i can say about this game are  the game is very unoptimized and released in a broken state on pc and console which really killed it for most players and really takes my final score for this game down  the game feels way to easy because of how its approachable for a lot of new players and i really don't want the next souls game to be easy just for the sake of more people buying it but with all those cons in mind still my final score to elden ring is an easy 9 out of 10 the game is fun and doesn't hold your hand at all unlike other third person open world games it could have been an easy 10 but at its current broken unoptimized state its not there yet i really recommend this for souls veterans and new people to the genre just because its super fun and approachable for everyone
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"too bad review bombing is a thing. this game is amazing and it deserves a better score. it's true the pc port is a bit buggy, but it's far from what people make it to be. i love the combination of dark souls's combat and openworld gameplay. from software did a great job combining the two in the most organic way. i'd say the game is well worth its price tag."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,"after 30 hours of playing i have to say this is just great. the lack of guidance, the difficulty and the atmosphere of the world are great. i like challenging games, where i die often or have to restart myself because my run wasn't perfect. i like to play stealth games like hitman so trying a boss over and over is something i actually like a lot. it gives you the feeling that you achieved something that not everyone is able to achieve. i played many open world games like cp2077, dying light 12, most far cry titles, ac, and so on and these games feel more and more like i have a list of chores to complete. the map littered with quest markers, which often lead to boring side quests, that i usually regret doing, is simply pain for me. elden ring is exactly the opposite of that. no questmarkers whatsoever and i like it! elden ring is a breath of fresh air in the open world genre. combat is really challenging, especially for me who has never played a soulslike game before, i die a lot, even to regular mobs, but i don't care. it's fun because eventually you beat the boss or clear the area and then feel good about it. why only 810? mainly technical issues like 1 the 60fps cap. i have a 144hz monitor and a rtx 3080 that i really like to use. i don't see the reason why the framerate is capped. haven't had the kind of stutters that other have so no issue for me. 2 bad controls for mouse and keyboard. why are there xbox promps when i first start the game? btw i know how to change that, but still, why? why is the map key g and not m? a minor detail, but cmon... every other game uses m. keyboard layout overall isn't the best. had to change nearly every key besides wasd to get good controls. fs could've done better here. 3 inventory, pouches, equipment those tabs are nasty and not intuitive. why can i not click on an item in my inventory and simply select if i want to equip it where my flasks are or if i want it in my pouch? also how do i know what goes into the pouch and what doesn't? why do i have to switch between inventory tabs why y  x? e  r would've been much better in my opinion. overall these things are kind of minor to me, but i still have to take them into account. can't give a 1010 if it's not perfect"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,120 hrs in i have to say that this game is amazing. so much to explore and so many interesting monster designs. there is a steep learning curve if you are not familiar with 'dark souls' type games but totally worth it if you just push through. there are a lot of guides online to help as well. i did not experience any of the stuttering issues that some of the older reviews in here reported.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,ya era la mejor saga de juegos y tambin los mejores en mundo abierto que bestialidad
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"this game some how pissed off new comers and souls veterans. i played bloodborne, dark souls 3 and seikro before playing elden ring. elden ring is the last fun game to play. if only the reviews know how the game works. you need skill and persistence to beat the previous game bosses. you no longer need that just level up tank hits and over power bosses. bosses and insane combos that are impossible to dodge. may be a bloodborne or sekiro like character would do some justice to the new bosses. story is straight up cringe. every boss with multiple hands only use 2 hands in combat. so what that means is a wasted potential and staying in the comfort zone. open world feels like a chore. you play dungeons to get spirt ashes or golden seed. you get the best mimic by playing story line. after upgrading crimson flask to max. i was left with 5 extra golden seeds. so what that basically means was doing dungeons is a waste of time. no real benefit except you being over leveled for the boss fight. after you explore everything and ready to fight the boss. in a traditionally way you find yourself way over leveled and slap the boss cheeks. if are under leveled the bosses will slap your cheeks. there is no middle ground here. worst bosses i ever played are exclusive in this game. open world is good for few hours after that it feels pretty useless. most of the effort went into early game and its all down hill from there on. you play souls games for bosses. which is the biggest failure in this game. graphics are fine but i can forgive that. bloodborne  sekiro  ds3  elden ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,mid game bro sekiro is better much better mid ring elden middddddddddddddddd
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"tldr open world ds3 with a few minor additions. full disclosure i have not completed elden ring and don't plan to for now. i bought into the hype and regret dropping full price on this game so i'm hoping my review might help those still on the fence about buying this game. i have beaten demons souls, darks souls 13, bloodborne so i do have experience with prior fromsoft games and have enjoyed them. the technical issues with the pc port have already been covered ad nauseum so i'll go over some of the other aspects of the game. gameplay basically the same as dark souls 3 with a few minor changes 1 addition of jump button, 2 addition of mount and very basic mounted combat, 3 addition of guard cancel, 4 weapon arts are now equippable ashes of war in elden ring. veterans of the souls series will feel right at home whereas the slower, calculated and methodical style of combat may take some getting used to for newcomers. button mashing will get you killed very quickly in this game and even trash mobs can tear you apart. what was once revolutionary and spawned the whole subgenre of soulslike games has become stale, predictable, and formulaic. most of the enemies are reskins from the prior entries and in some cases, reused assets eg. the giant crabs. yes, the game is punishingly difficult but much of that difficulty is artificial from things like janky camera angles, busted hitboxes that pass through walls, gank squads in tight quarters, enemy projectiles defying the laws of physics, etc. bosses attack relentlessly and you'll find yourself dodging for what feels like an eternity for a safe opportunity to counterattack, only to deal like 2 of their health. you'll likely die to greed, trying to get some more hits in on the boss because you're so bored of doing nothing but dodging yet another unending combo. for fans of the souls series, this may be everything you wanted and for newcomers, this may still be fresh and exciting. for those who've played the souls series and were hoping for some fresh gameplay, you won't find it here. world design the biggest change in elden ring from the souls series is the introduction of an open world. for many, this is a breath of fresh air and one of their favourite features of elden ring. the world is massive and you can easily spend hours just exploring, opening up many possibilities for nonlinear progression. unfortunately for me, once i got passed the initial beauty of the world, i found it to be mostly empty and lifeless, and i found spending hours riding around on my mount looking for things to do tedious and boring. you will encounter random enemy mobs scattered throughout but the reward for killing them wasn't worth the effort so i just started riding around them. the optional dungeons i explored felt pointless, akin to the chalice dungeons in bloodborne. if you follow the recommended path through the game, you will likely be severely underleveled for the first main boss so exploration of optional content is clearly encouraged by design. sadly, i don't find the exploration in elden ring to be interesting enough for the time investment required and this is the main reason why i don't plan on finishing elden ring, while i do plan on finishing ds3. however, many people love the aspect of exploration and discovery in elden ring so you may have a very different experience from me. story like all the prior souls titles, the story of elden ring is told cryptically in fragments mainly from npc dialogue and item descriptions. george rr martin was involved in the writing which i never would have guessed since the lore seems to basically be a reskin of the prior souls titles. there are 11 equivalents for almost everything. the elden ring  first flame, tarnished  chosen undeadashen one, site of grace  bonfire, crimson flask  estus flask etc. souls games have always required multiple playthroughs to unlock all the different endings and different npc questlines to piece together the lore. the lore is often rich and interesting but i frankly don't have the time to go through the effort and will be watching some youtube lore videos to experience the story. some people love this mysterious style of narrative and i enjoyed it with the prior souls games as well. however, it really is just feeling like more of the same at this point and even the basic premise is similar to the prior games and i guess i was hoping for something fresh. overall elden ring is a very good game but isn't for everyone. fans of the souls series who just wanted more of the same will enjoy this and newcomers who don't mind the challenge will likely get  in as well. however, for players like me who enjoyed the souls games but were expecting something new, elden ring falls shorts. maybe i just don't like open world games? 710."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"i really dont get how people can call this unfinished boring time waster a masterpiece. i mean even the controlls are striaght outta ps2 era. the whole game has no structure or balance. everything, from the dialoges to the menu to the enemy strength to level design is pure arbitrariness. this leads to undeserved deaths like sprint button is also dodge button. okay so far but when you hit and hold, the character still makes a giat jump backwards which sure has cost millions of runes. sorry i can not unsee stuff like this. it would be easy to fix this by making the character only dodge when the button is pressed short and on hold the character goes into sprint mode like in every game since 2001 or so i dont know if this is intentionally bad game design or if they simply didnt knew better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"first game in a long time where you get exactly what you payed for and exactly what was advertised, no micro transactions, no battle pass, just a massive playground where the only one limiting your enjoyment and progression is you. the only thing as grand and marvelous as the world itself are the horrors attempting to keep you from your goals. elden ring is as hard as you make it.flaws are few and far between a few npc quests were unfinished and guess what, its already been patchedlooking at you coz!. i wish other game developers put as much love, care, and dedication to its games, its fans, and its employees as fromsoftware has."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"malgr quelques ralentissements, ce jeu est excellent! il est vaste, exigent. parcourir l'entre terre, affronter les boss, faire progresser son perso est un vritable plaisir extrmement addictif, je le recommande vivement!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"excellent game, runs poorly on computers, but i was able to fix that and never noticed any issues again in my 50 hour playthrough. one issue i do have with this game though is the sheer absurdity of the damage lategame enemies do, i'm fine with bosses doing that damage, but some random bug guy wiped out half of my 2000 health in a single attack, otherwise solid game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,an amazing game! one of the most complete game that's came out in years literally can't stop playing
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,this is the game that makes me feel like a kid again that i have been waiting for.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,i delete my first review now that i have put more hours in the game and is my second play through. its a 910.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"definitely a solid 8.710, but could be better. i originally would have made it an 8.510, but they added an update that lets you finish alexander's questline. ultimately, if you enjoy dark souls 3 and are okay with tweaking settings to get better performance, i would recommend you to try out this game. it's honestly one of the best games i've played in several years, probably since 2015."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"i just wanted to say thank you to all the gamers out there that bought all of the other fromsoftware games, if they didnt they absolute masterpiece would of never existed. i tried dark souls and just couldnt get into it, was just a little to linear for my liking but this games many weapons, armour, enemies and exploration spots makes this the ultimate open world experience, and of course the actual fighting never gets old, the epic boss fights are challenging but satisfying. if you love your open world rpg games this is a absolute must, it has made me realise how mediocre 95 of other games are,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"the game crashes, error 0xc000001d 7 times today it's really annoying. i really hope this will be fixed in the next patch. but when it works i have fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"the performance on pc has some problems, but it's not as horrible as many say, in my case the game was played with dropped frames at times but after patch 2 several problems were solved. it's a typical soulsborne game, but with many new elements and a mixture of things from previous miyazaki titles, excellent open world, beautiful music, dynamic gameplay, the story is incredible as far as i'm concerned and above all, a spectacular design of characters, monsters and creatures. sure, the game has its level of difficulty, but being an open world gives you the chance to equip yourself to the best of your ability and then face the bosses and minibosses, that's what's beautiful and engaging about the game, it's difficult, yes , but it allows you to expand the possibilities for you to improve your level, and by making more and more effort, it rewards you, and with those rewards you improve to later face the most powerful enemies. the game doesn't treat you like a fool, rather it wants you to get better and by getting better, more powerful. it is clearly a very good title. 910"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"game is awesome and very addictive! the world is beautiful and full of dungeons, bosses and items, that make it very fun to play. graphics are ok, but the design of the enemies is awesome. the general art direction of the game is nothing new or original but it has some wow moments and locations. and then, it has its errors weird collision boxes only for the player, like when you hit walls with your weapon cancelling your attack but the enemies hit through it and kill you camera issues during combat means you are dead, ztargetting just doesnt work, cheating combat mechanics for the enemies disguised as high difficulty, the world feels dead, unbalanced weaponsbuilds, and sometimes feels like an open world battle game instead of a rpg. maybe some patches can fix some of these things."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"i finished the game, i liked the game very much. i want to highlight, not very good optimization there are fps gaps. and i'm so happy, i will definitely replay it again!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"early game 6 out of 10 mid game 10 out of 10 late game 2 out of 10 overall fun but scales horribly. plus you need a guide for everything, typical from soft."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"one of users tell please play the game before writing a review about it . thats a very true advice. however i couldnt play this game more than 2 hours. that wasnt because the game was hard. i have rtx 2070 on my tower , and i have 1080 p monitr. i couldnt get 60 fps continually. mostly it drops a lot. i wonder what kind of setup is there for those who give high scores to the game?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"being a souls fan, i'm pretty disappointed in this game ... for so many reasons ...  there's no innovation whatsoever. it's more of the same of ds3  quest system cannot apply the same way it did to ds3 for example, simply because the world is so huge ... and u'll either miss on too much or just forget about it altogether if u don't use a guide ... which is a very bad way to play a game ... cause what's the catch?! watch and apply  most of the world looks really bad ... esp caelid ... it simply looks horrible ... like an unfinished scribbled draft  no story unless u watch looong lore videos  opening cutscene voice acting is pathetic and mostly all npcs'  bad performance  world feel empty most often  reskinned enemies .. even bosses!  no skill required .. just level up or be a mage and u'll be fine  hitboxes are pathetic and hits from enemies ignore walls while urs deflect normally!  arrows and magic ignore enemies .. and enemies' magic reaches way further than ur same magic  sometimes u can't decide how come some lightweight enemies have so much poise .. even more than u do despite the fact that ur armor and weapons surpass theirs by so much!! all in all the game is just tiresome and feels like a chore .. nothing original .. just scraps of previous games molded in an unfinished world 410"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"ok, this is a review that i never wanted to write but here we go. fist the good the world looks amazing, locations and enemies are diverse and boy oh boy, this game is huge! the secrets are everywhere, weapons are cool and there is tons of quality of life improvements. world building is up there with the best they ever produced. there are a lot of moments that i caught myself looking at my screen with my eyes wide open, gaping mouth and a genuine feeling of awe. this game really nails down the exploration experience! now the negative which are without doubt not a lot, but are  for me at least borderline game breaking game runs like absolute crap on my 3070, 32gb ram, 10700k rig. i run every other title on the market on max settings, no problem, but i'm getting constant stutters on this one. the one thing that a from game cannot have is  performance, as everything can kill you in the blink of an eye. it's been a month already that the game is out and it's as if the problem is not even addressed anymore in the updates so at this point i'm starting to doubt that they'll ever fix it. i also have a base ps4 and i find the thought that i should have bought the game there as it'd have much more stable performance to be at least infuriating. and that brings us to the second issue balancing is shockingly bad. almost every weapon is op. almost every enemy can 1 shot you, there are dogs that can literally 1 shoot you in this game, i wouldn't be so salty if we are talking about bosses but plain old mobs doing so much damage while you have the best armor and a ton of vigor, that's just bad balancing. this game needed a bit more time in the oven i think and it's a shame because a lot of people were counting the days for it to be released and i was one of them. it can be a 1010 but right now, its definitely not there. from software, all i will say is, i really thought you were better than this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"elden ring te coloca em um mundo pico, te ensina o principal, porm o resto voc precisa aprender sozinho, tirando a motimizao para pc, o game  fantstico e inovador. a fromsoftware evoluiu de maneira magistral, pois o jogo te d uma liberdade enorme, mundo aberto rico e envolvente, tornandose prazeroso explorar cada canto do mapa. os grficos so bonitos, a ambientao te prende, lutas com chefes insanos e trilha sonora magnfica."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"everything in this game is amazing. from the world that is wide and full enough of enemies, unexplored dungeons and unknown secrets, to the vibe that the general gameplay gives which feels like you play a truly evolved souls game. they have massively enhanced hitboxes made them more precise. the lore is very rich and interesting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"painfully average game that doesn't meet the expectations. it is by no mean bad, but it was designed with quantity in mind instead of quality, and it shows. i'll get the technical issues out of the way now  easy anti cheat is a massive joke that leeches performances like nothing while being useless to prevent cheating. disabling the anti cheat is easy, greatly improves performances but prevents online play. worth it if you ask me. the game simply doesn't run well on otherwise decent pcs. the combat is as low as it's been in all souls game. i did not play as a caster so i can't tell if it's better, but melee combat is so repetitive and unsatisfying for a few reasons  elden ring has dark souls 1's style of poise coupled with bosses that do nothing but spam force you into a reactive, passive playstyle where you only exploit the small opening to use one ash of warcharged attackjump attack to go back to dodging. the world is also incredibly repetitive, once past the first area you'll have seen most of the structures, enemies and bosses. a lot of them are simply copypasted and it gets old fast."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,"i have doubts if this is the best souls fromsoftware has created, disputing the title with sekiro. it feels like a fitting end to the more medieval souls, a grand and exciting adventure in a world that makes you want to explore for hours. after 200 hours of gameplay i still feel like i have a lot of exploring to do and will start a new game soon to face certain bosses again. it feels bigger and more alive than dark souls, not necessarily harder which is not a bad thing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"peak of rpg games, there is no discussion if you downvote this game is only cause you play kids games"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"incredible game, bad port. an amazing experience overall, but occasional crashes and freezes are annoying. still giving a 10 because the game itself deserves it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great this game is very bad and  love getting one shot killed and im lvl 150 its great
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"great game with lots of potential, the first 30 hours of this game were amazing, but largely over hyped. 50 hours in, and the game falls apart. after beating certain story bosses, the difficulty level scales dramatically and largely invalidates any work you've put into building your character. boss design repeats itself over and over. the pc performance issues don't seem like they're going to be addressed either."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,is magnificent. just the perfection of souls games. maybe not for everybody but is with no doubt one of the best games in history.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"this is basically peak of what fromsoftware has ever done. all attacks feel like they have a place in combat, magic feels fluid and snappy, bosses are  insane even more than usual, areas are outright beautiful, artstyle, lore and story are one of if not the best i have ever seen in gaming. honestly, my all time favourite and overall a magnum opus of miyazaki's lifework."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,this game make me wonder before i play i just fear about it too hard for me but when i farm and try to practice my skill it very enjoy and finally i play this game to the end.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,one of the worst games i have ever played. awful and outdated in pretty much every aspect possible.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"terrible performance. running up to date drivers and firmware, running 5950x, rtx3090, 4000mhz cl16 ddr4 and pcie4 nvme ssd. stuttering mess. reasonable art direction with ps3 era graphics. roll simulator. considering how much dodging there is, dodging is what should be customisable  not combat. bad customisation with controls too."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"most compelling open world design seen in a long time, culmination of from's gameplay learnings and great character creation, builds and fashion options. some of the best bosses in from's catalogue and great world building."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"game is probably good but the performance issues on pc are preventing it from being playable in any reasonable manner. i will update the review if the pc performance issues are improved. 3080ti, 5800x isnt enough to prevent stutters and poor performance..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"the atmosphere is there like in the from soft but i thought it was less mythical than in the previous titles. mostly because there is a ton of miniboss and because bosses' fight misses some greatness imo. the last fight is epic but i was so bored by the game that i have overlooked it. i won't do a new game plus, imo it's not worth it. the game balance is pretty  bosses can be really hard and so easy it's boring. the game stutters a lot because of an anticheat engine that does not prevent cheaters and people from exploiting bugs. i usually love from soft games but for me, this one missed the target. i really really tried to like this game but in its current state i really don't."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"easy 1010, despite the technical issues. maybe i got lucky, but outside of some annoying crashes, i didn't experience anything enough to detract from my overall experience. haven't felt like this about a game since botw."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"playing on the pc and it only crashed once, and it was my fault for opening too much tabs 1010, must play, really good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"i have 45 hours of gameplay, this game is beautiful. it's most like souls game not sekiro, it's not a game for everyone. great bosses, great atmosphere, great npcs. this game got a lot of easter eggs from another souls games and it makes gratifying. bad points recycling of dungeons and fps drops. i've hope fs can fix it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"cons no quest log and little to no quest tracking. npcs give little to no info on your goals the horrible graphics from dark souls 2 only got a slight upgrade. dark souls 2 and elden ring have almost the same zero to hero story the story is horrible. the dialogue is horrible and at times incoherent. monitor refresh rate capped at 60hz. all the menu and tutorials are in gamepad format not keyboard and mouse. the knucklehead who created this game had 6 opportunities fix all of this, but was too lazy to do so. pros my money was refunded."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,166hrs in and i can't wait to keep playing. an absolute masterpiece for those that it appeals to.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,the souls formula combined with an beautiful world fits better than i thought. edit i was hyped at the beginning but i think its not as brilliant as i thought from the start. there are many copypaste bosses. still an ok game i guess.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"i have absolutely no idea how this game got such high review scores, i understand we now live in a world of craziness but this is next level alternate reality, wtf people? the graphics are ok, there is uw support but the developer has made a conscious decision to block it by adding black bars which sometimes load in shortly after the game starts the voice acting is hilarious and to be honest it gives the game some unintended personality because it has none any where else. as a character speaks it is as if at the same time he  she is chomping away at a bowl of cornflakes like an old n64 game everything including your own character moves like a robot with the jump option being an afterthought as it has no animation before jumping and on landing, it is funny though so i will give it that the menu screen is like something from a sinclair spectrum 48k before most of u were born and looks dam right ugly the performance is terrible, the frame rate is locked, characters outside of your view stutter around the environment which is more noticeable if you use the mod that remove the black bars the missions if u can call them that is boring the game is boring, it looks boring, it seems the developers were bored making it. i could go on and on but what is the point when so many people have given it such high scores, it makes no sense in this reality, it does not. no wonder other companies that i wont mention have posted shocking responses to this games success and i am pretty sure like me they are searching for the portal so we can get back to our own parallel universe where peoples expectations are slightly higher where unpolished games like this farce gets a 510 uninstalled rant over.... peace lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"the game itself is amazing. it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever played. the pc port is so poorly optimized, i can't give it the 10 it should've deserved. i'm running a rtx 3080 and r5 5600x, and the stuttering is incredibly immersion breaking, and has caused me to lose a few boss battles. if they fix the performance issues, i'll update my review to a 1010. also, a game in 2022 shouldn't have a 60fps cap, especially when highend hardware like mine can handle much higher, even at max settings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,i was so excited for this game but it's unplayable due to motion sickness. no options available that help like fov. it's a huge problem that hasn't even been addressed publicly but has been brought up by many in news articles and reddit. i hope they fix this game. also the lack of ultrawide monitor support is surprising.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"absolute masterpiece. was never into the souls games before this, elden ring is gorgeous. great story, surreal fantasy mixed with gritty horror vibe. the combat and movement do take some adjusting to, but are excellent once you get the feel for them. on pc, have only had one instance of stuttering and it was over almost instantly. game of the decade for sure!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"in 2011 i was respecting people who play this game because i thought souls are hard. but now i know those games just have iritating sword swing mechanics for last 11years. if you learn to roll you are almost immortal. game getting easy. league, cs are way harder. souls are ez singleplayer destressing dancing with bunnies on the meadow games. ps its true. as exploring game it's 710. plot and gameplay 010 boring almost not existing. fine game to relax for 50hours not gonna lie. not worth the price."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"i've written an elaborate and long review explaining why this game is an 810 even without the optimizations issues, but this site  and has completely deleted my review.. so trust"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"it's a very empty game. if you're interested exclusively in challenging hack and slash gameplay then you may enjoy it. if you're looking for a plot or narrative, or any sort of actual substance, you will not find it in elden ring. the open world feels devoid of life. you'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over again, but in different areas. you have to hunt for content outside of combat in a bad way. i just don't know what else to say, the game feels cadaverous. it's got no soul."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,very good game. 910. reusing bosses and dungeon is the only one problem
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"after 140 hours of gameplay, this is clearly rushed and unfinished game. dont even get me start with reuse enemy and boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,one of my favorite games i've played this year. the only problem i have with the game is that the performance is not that good on some computers. but other than that this game is incredible
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,dark souls in open world?...i was worried but from software really nailed it...great story rewarding exploration and the gameplay is top notch a genuine masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,this game is just great. its world is vast its rich in lore and its totally worth the 60 paid! i have already spent about 200 hours on the game and yet im only still half way in it!!!! so you can imagine! there is a lot of replayability as well of the game! i need to rate this game a 10 due to many trolls who are purposely putting down the score to 0 these people are either other games devs who are jealous of the games success or just people who dont know how to enjoy a good game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"an absolute masterpiece, fromsoft has taken everything they've learned from previous games and put the best of it into this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i haven't finished it yet, still i love to get my time exploring things around, the feeling of fear and adrenaline you get when getting to a new zone and the relief and satisfaction of killing a hard boss is something only this genre can offer. perfect game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"stutter for pc still not fixed. so many connection errors. game is visually stunning even running on a fairly old engine. most interesting game i've played for a long time, even it's not perfect but i'd still recommend it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"267 hours played to date. 1200 hours in ds3. 600 hours in ds2. maybe like 200 in dsrptde. e update in 250 hours i have had one coop where i actually ran an entire 30 minute map clearing session without disconnect. this is a historic first. the multiplayer matchmaking is really bad with rampant disconnects. i am directly connected with 1000 down myself. over 200 hours in and well, this is probably one of the worst overall experiences i have had with the souls genre. context for this review, i have historically put over 500 hours into fs souls games, as a result, i am looking at elden ring as a 1000 hour game to replace dark souls 3. the one constant fs souls genre had was every game improved the mp aspect, here it takes a huge step back. if the question is, will i get my money value out of this game the answer for you is yes. get it, but remember, if you do this game has forced coop invasions so you will deal with people coming into your game to kill you. also, please understand, they will be rather well geared because they are always fighting groups on invasions. if you are looking for something to peacefully play with your friends, i highly recommend nioh 2. fromsoftware seemed to go out of their way to make this game as rewarding and accessible as possible and in doing so, i believe they may have over stepped their bounds of what was once a well designed, concise, and impactful journey. the result is a convoluted mess of confusion, missed events, recycled bosses and field enemies, and gank mechanics that just make everything feel so bland. outside of this, the game takes a few serious set backs. you can no longer be invaded solo, unless you use an item which removes the cool down timer for invasions. so you are invaded nonstop. the traditional souls experience is completely lost. you can either pvp solo or play solo, but not both. this makes the entire game feel very lonely, furthermore, most invaders are now focusing on the cheapest builds possible because every invasion is 3 people waiting for them. the invasive multiplayer interaction, which i mostly play souls games for is no longer there as a solo player. you either have to summon coop players, which ruin your experience of the game, trivializing content, or be forced to run massive quantities of land on foot just to be invaded. this effectively ruins the game for me as the traditional souls experience is no longer there, despite the fact they could have allowed solo invasions in dungeons. the irony of this is they left in the hunter group that hunt red invaders except it's never used because hosts don't use the item since there is no need as invasions are coop only. even if they did it would just be 4 people versus 1 under leveled invader. so people who are new to the game and the mechanic are just not going to bother and it's really hurting the active invading pool. as it stands solo, i am invaded by the same few repeat people in whatever bracket i click my solo invasion item on. they usually die enough that they just stop invading me or leave my game. what fs should have done is allowed solo invasions, automatically spawned a blue covenant hunter next to the player on a red invasion. this way, they could have alleviated the loneliness and provided the host a phantom who seeks player vs. player and is likely properly geared and tuned for it. they could have taken this a step further by allowing hunters to invade the invader's world as in ds2. no auto invade areas? where are the bell bros, the aldrich faithful, the rat men? another lost opportunity to use hunters to better the hosts and broaden their horizons. long term value is lost here. there was so much opportunity to carry on the improvements made to mp over the years. instead... we get this. coop people are not happy because they are always invaded despite just wanting to play with friends. invaders are not happy because every invasion is a really tough match up. solo hosts get no pvp anymore, unless they use an item where they can only pvp. no one wins."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,this game is a sign of just how poor the gaming industry has got lately that games like this are deemed to be ground breaking and best game ever made blah blah blah. my gripes with the game  the game is unbalanced tf. one minute you one shot main bosses then next minute you are getting one shot by a rat.  the crafting system is pretty much pointless  the game has a very poor story  the graphics are dated  the voice acting and audio is laughable  game has major glitches. was worried it would brick my 3090  the stuttering is a mess  the armour is just for cosmetics pretty much  the bosses are reskinned constantly  the side quests are a dreadful guessing game mess  the puzzles hardly make sense.  the dungeons are repetitive  some of the secrets are so poorly designed you basically need to spend the game hitting every wall with a stick  you spend ages working through areas to get loot you can't use  the classes don't actually mean anything  the leveling system is boring  the game tries to be edgy by not explaining anything which means you can miss integral parts  the combat is a clunky mess. the game isn't mechanically  is just badly designed  the game endlessly jump scares you with unavoidable enemies attacking around corners...this isn't fun gameplay  online multiplayer is terrible  most of the spells are useless  the lack of variety of weapons per class. basically have one staff all game  the platforming and jumps are painful  fall damage is a nuisance  the ux menu is terrible. very hard to locate items with ease.  putting dash on the same button as dodge is beyond stupid and being unable to remap it is even worse  the cutscenes are terrible and lag like crazy. also the loading times are a blast from the past i could honestly go on and on. this game is thoroughly unenjoyable to complete. the longer it went on the the more of a chore it became to complete. the only reason i gave it a 1 is the map is big and the art syle is niche. apart from that... don't buy this
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,first i experienced at least 5 crashes on elden ring pc. over 200 hours in and it's was worth every minute. this is not my first fromsoft game but it is the first one i beat. i am so ready for new game plus. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"elden ring is a totally average game. don't believe the trolls and the toxic community talk. many people consider from software to be the originator of the souls genre. it actually has its origins in nihon falcom. therefore, according to them, miyazaki is a messiah. however, miyazaki and the souls team is still making the same mistakes. objective problems hitboxes are not good. there are times when it reminds me of the ds2. boss designs are very unbalanced. they didn't really work well with many bosses. the game gets too repetitive. open world exploration is nice, but it gets boring quickly. there seems to be a lot of items, but in the end, a few items are the most useful. the game forces you for make to broken builds. because some boss designs require it. all builds look alike. for example, more than half of even pvp uses blood builds. optimization is still not fixed and every update is getting worse. spells are powerful. playing spell builds are more advantageous in many ways. camera angles are not good. it really causes trouble. when the number of enemies is high, you cannot control field of view. lore quality is definitely a controversial topic. however, it has the same lore in other souls games. only their names have changed. george r. r. martin is just pr work. enemies are just based on nonstop spawn attacks with endless stamina as like most of bosses. many of the bosses repeat themselves. most bosses are either the same or reskin version. the hit feeling is not good. especially the bosses don't even react properly to your attacks. it has a toxic and cancerous player base. artificial intelligence problems. a real disaster. it is a headache for some attacks in the game to pass through objects. conclusion this game is not a masterpiece. not on a new ip. it's just dark souls 4 with open world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"probably the best game ever made. elden ring is unlike any aaa game in recent memory, delivering on both exceptionally high quality design and an incredible quantity of content. i was constantly stunned at the combination of high quality experiences with an expanding map showcasing more content than the last several games i'd played combined. fromsoft games always require you to actually be good at the game but its worth it to struggle  persevere through this world. also, i played this on pc with a controller and didn't encounter any framerate or other issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"feels like a soulslike instead of an actual souls game. late patch that adds npcs and quest shows game was not even out of beta on launch. reading critic reviews make it quite clear they never made it past the 20 hour mark before publishing as the game's issues take a massive spike after the first area. most nonstory bosses are repeated ad nauseum fight, refight, refight, now fight two at once. some story bosses were even reskinned as later story bosses! feels incredibly lazy. hitboxes and enemy range is still horrible. enemy attacks and projectiles go through all solid walls. boss ais just stop attacking every now and then, breaking the fight and turning it into a cakewalk. has happened 3 times since i got to the capital, easily 50 hours into the game. homing spells are nighimpossible to dodge, specifically on horseback. normal enemy magic does 7080 of health with 50 vit. combat consistently feels like you're cheesing everything or getting 2 shotted. combat design is the worst since dark souls iiwhich is exactly what this game feels like. story  fromsoft10 world  1010 combat design  310 fanbase  010 this game actively put me off fromsoft games unless they're directed by kazuhiro hamatani. patch released weeks into launch fixed a ton of hitboxes and poise issues, but they still feel terrible. does not feel like they actually playtested combat. game feels terrible to play after bloodborne and sekiroalmost actively hostile towards the player. also the fans throwing slurs at you for even bringing up issues that were addressed in the patch is hilarious. a fan base that refuses to have an actual discussion about the game instead of slavishly worshipping everything miyazaki produces."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,the best game ever made. skyrim or zelda are not even close. fromsoftware are the best
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"the game let's you... 1. upgrade your weapons 2. summon and upgrade ai spirits 3. let's you level up 4. summon other players to help 5. move on to another area and progress on something different. what else do people want? i'm all for accessibility, like better color blind options and such. but the game gives plenty of avenues to decrease difficulty."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,genuinely have no idea what the review bombs are talking about. the graphics in this game really shine in later zones. i haven't had any frame drops since the recent patch despite my old machine. the game is hard but rewarding like every from game. the only complaints i understand are no ultra wide support and framecap 60 but i don't use ultra wide and i'm good with 60 frames
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,simply an amazing game this is my 2nd souls like with jedi fallen order being my first idk if that counts but whatever and this is simply an upgrade in every way. i feel like there's so many different play styles and so many builds this has so much game play and aside from some bosses i feel that they are all fair and enjoyable. and regarding the fps issues i found that with mine below minimum specs gtx 1650 i could get 4060 fps which i think is acceptable this was with some mixed graphics settings but texture on max.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"the game is great, but the optimization , they can fix this problem ..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"like many people, this game made me feel like i was a kid again. a kid so excited by a game, by all the options, that he cannot disconnect from it! i had dreams about it. i played it more than 100 hours and i enjoyed all of them. on my computer, i personally think the game is beautiful i have a geforce rtx 2080. the open world is amazing. what strikes me is that you can always see super far away, with numerous details and even if you doubt it, yes you can reach all these places that you can see from the top of the cliff or the bottom of the castle. all of them will have a secret to uncover. yes exploring is rewarding, and even relaxing despite the numerous and hard fights. i enjoyed the interaction with other players for the hardest fights. i enjoyed the views, the bosses, the dark fantasy spirit and decorum. i disliked the fact that i had to google some accessories to understand what they are needed for. i enjoyed the open spaces, the castles, the dungeons, the weird characters i encountered let me touch your fingers.... i laughed when pierced by an arrow of twice my size that i did not see coming. i almost cried after losing a lot of runes ! i banged my hand on my table when i almost killed numerous bosses. in short, it is a great experience. they did a great job. it is hard to understand how people can complain to such an extreme because there is no wide screen option, or because they experienced one bug here and there. it is the best game i have played for a while and i am sad i am reaching the end because i loved exploring this map. go for it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"horrible pc port  bad keyboardmouse implementation  feels alien to a pc release 2022 without ultrawide monitor support!... release with easyanticheat preventing customer to fix their lack of ultrawide support using e.g. flawless widescreen! i know there is a workaround and use it  but this should not be required to play a simple game in 2022 slow mouse movement hamperes the playing experience only got like 510 min. in backand forth to os to fix widescreen, google for mouse issue, google for flickering in the far right and left screen uncomfortable and annoying  breaks immersion played elex 2 which is not perfect, but at least it ran without issues like you would expect from a game 2022. elden ring is bad even at 1.03.2 version."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"from software's best game to date. there may be aspects from their other work that were slightly more refined but this is their first attempt at making a truly open world game and they have absolutely nailed it. truly the best open world rpg ever created. it is an endlessly replayable masterpiece. there may be some slight performance issues but it takes nothing away from the overall experience and is barely noticeable the majority of the time. to the snowflakes giving it a poor rating, plz just git gud"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i had extremely high expectations, and they were still surpassed. the amount of content blew me away, and even past 90 hours i'm still finding new things. my only issue with the game is that the nonlinear design that comes with an open world makes it very easy to become overleveled for parts of the content, which makes it less fun for me personally. sad to hear about the pc performance issues some people are experiencing, i personally have had no issues playing on high settings with a 1070."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i have no idea what's going on with the other people, i don't have any performance or other problems. you can tell that the game was developed for consoles, so only the keyboard controls failed, so i play it with a controller on the pc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,i never liked fantasy rpg games as they seemed like too much trouble and while i admit that a lot of streamers and youtubers did compel me to try elden ring but eventually the game won me over . the world is so vast yet so engrossing i've spent tens of hours at once in elden ring without noticing the time. there are a lot of issues on the pc side like the target lock malfunctioning stuttering and overall game balance related issues but nonetheless i love this game to bits.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"absolutely fantastic. the game looks beautiful, plays the best out of the fromsoft games i've played, and has a captivating world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"it's fine if you like the current path fromsoft is going down. otherwise not really horrible pc port, locked to 60 fps, horrible performance issues, horrible graphical settings. unacceptable for a supposed 1010. these reviewers are embarassing themselves with these reviews and showing a complete lack of substance and credibility when they write these inane, pandering reviews. the combat is what it is, the now well established degeneration of the souls de facto series. roll and poke. the most major addition is the lazy abundance of delayed attacks, the only thing fs could think of to spice things up for veterans. no mechanical diversity, virtual all bosses are a variation on the same theme, with just a slight different attack skin on top. a far cry from an amazing game, let alone the perfect masterpiece people are deluding themselves into thinking it is. a solid 6"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,i would probably give it a perfect 10 if most of the weaponsfighting systemcombos were more fleshed out like the katana. you can clearly tell they're japanese and only know how katanas work while they think claymores weigh 200 lbsmaybe 5 lbs realistically. i'd appreciate harder difficulty modes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"the copy and paste was unreal i rolled my eyes seeing the same structures and layouts repeatedly and the bosses where worse, the amount of times the godskin bosses showed up was especially lazy. also had some bosses just flat out go afk in the battle like the dragonlord placidusax. not a bad game, above average but the overhype is real"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"first the bad. yes, there are random stuttering issues on pc. yes, it doesn't offer a solid experience using a keyboard and mouse. for me personally, these haven't been as problematic as some of the negative review bombers here would have you believe. there are also some minor bugs that don't impact progression, and they have already patched a couple that i have run into. now for the good. this game is a honestly a masterpiece. the level design, art, narrative, sound and game play mechanics are easily 1010. to me it plays like skyrim set in a dark souls universe, without most of the brutally punishing mechanics of dark souls. it has really hit the sweet spot and it simply feels super rewarding learning boss mechanics, and then changing your strategy until you end up defeating them. i've honestly been waiting years for a game like this to come along and have played 80 hours so far and feel like there's still so much left to discover and explore. i highly, highly recommend playing this game. even though there are some minor frame rate issues at times, the rest of this game is a beast, and we should reward the developer by buying and playing it. i am hopeful they will fix the frame rate issues in a future update, but like i said it's not a show stopper."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"it's 1010 not too much water. honestly most addictive game i've played since skyrim, and i don't need mods. it might change for me in ten years. let's see."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"i was sckeptical at first, but after seeing dozen of vlogger on this game, i decided to purchase it... what i can say ? the atmopshere, the level design, the art direction is absolutely breathtaking. the quality, unity, and total dedication in the creation of this parallel universe inspire respect... ok, there is some lag, and dps drop, not enough serious for me, i am playing in 4k full max, and accept those fps drop, ..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"likely one of the worst games i have ever played and i mean it! extremely boring and outdated open world, 2011 graphics, no story, insanely bad pc controls, fps problems even with highend gpu and worst part, awful outdated combat"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"probably one of the greatest games i have ever played, and will ever play, in my lifetime. no micro transactions, no f2p, just absolutely fantastic gameplay, artstyle, level design, and most of all, bang for your buck. id pay over a hundred dollars for games if they were even remotely as immaculate as this game. 1010 i cant recommend enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"elden ring is truly a masterpiece. from the design of the map, the plot, the boss, the music, and more, it's all well designed and carefully invested. the recent patch makes the game even better. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"absolutely dont understand who can give 10 points to this game. no story, stupid ai, almost nothing new or improved  friendly characters absolutely without any sense or action, you find them in some place and they say their two stupid sentences and stay there like idiots in same position till the end of the game. enemies looks quite deaf, sneaking behind them in full gear is ridiculous. i dont see any new original thing in this game enemies are very nicely done but thats all, everything else was already here several times. absolutely no reason to call this game of the year or give any higher score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,"an excellent game poorly ported to the pc. all controls are designed for the console and the pc implementation is awful. starting from basic things like the escape key not being 'go back' in the menus, to essential combat maneuvers requiring 10 minutes to google online. halfway through the tutorial actually on an online forum, i learned that you need to tell the game you are not using a controller to get tutorial tips for the keyboard  mouse. it would be incredibly simple to make sensible defaults for the keyboard like using the numbers 19 to select weapons, spells or items, but no such effort has been made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"the overall game is excellent, with a large number of branch lines, huge maps, and excellent degrees of freedom. the disadvantage is that the optimization is not good enough. fps drops frequently"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"elden ring is teaching an important lesson here. hyped video games these days following trends, paying influencers and pushing unfinished products forgot that gamers don't care about battlepasses, skins, microtransactions and other gimmicks. if you build a game with all its features at its launch, it works and if you concentrate on quality over quantity and listen to the community i.e. don't treat gamers like idiots, the game will eventually sell itself. this is a goty and haven't enjoyed a rpg that much since skyrim"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"the best from's game, it combines everything from their other titles and makes an incredible experience just ignore the bad reviews here and look at how the game is very positive on steam, where you actually have to play the game to review it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"absolute masterpiece! this is a culmination of everything they've created, and it just oozes passion and competency! considering it all started with demon's souls which wasn't taken serious at all and was expected to be a flop, elden ring truly speaks to the testament of from software and their daringness to do something different and risky! it paid off in spades and other developers need to learn that playing it safe is why gaming has felt stagnant and open world particularly feels so samey and boring. elden ring has been fun to the max every single second ive played and from software really knows how to engage the player and create an experience unlike anything! 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"the launch had some bugs on pc and this is clearly a console port, but overall this is one of the best games i have ever played. i am 98 hours in, and almost done with the game. this was my first souls game, though i have played other similar games that are less difficult. i think my favorite thing about this game is the sheer variety in how you can tackle it. there are so many viable options, and the most op of them seem to have been, or will be nerfed to be more appropriate. my friends all use different builds and weapons, and we have all had such different experiences going into it. there is a level of freedom and exploration that breath of the wild started and elden ring expanded on substantially. it's not going to be for everyone, it's definitely hard, and unforgiving but fair most of the time. you can be a sweaty if you want, you can use summons and have friends help, you can be a mage, a 2h warrior, a stealthy rogue style build, the options and new game plus really do lend themselves to an expansive varierty. one of the best games i have ever played, truly a 1010 game, and a breath of fresh air in a aaa environment where microtransactions and overly busy huds gimp what could otherwise be solid games."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,allthough the game had some stutter issues at first its gameplay whise tue best open world game ive played so far.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"i feel that the reason there are so many negative reviews aside form the review bombing which is just pathetic is due in large part to the difficulty of this game and this being peoples first time playing a game like this with people first starting the game getting absolutely destroyed by the first boss and thinking the entire game will be like this. let me just say you can beat this game this series has gotten this reputation as being these unbeatable monoliths only made for the most hard core elite gamers and i have to say that reputation is  these games are hard i won't deny that but the game has ways of making it easier. this game has so many ways of making it easier on the player in fights whether that be through spirt summons, player summons, items in the world that weaken certain boss or just finding better weapons and armor. i can't force you to love this game i can only ask you to give it a try because i do believe this is the peak of fromsoft games. ps. make sure to use a controller since mouse and keyboard controls in these games have always been dreadful"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"it's really fun in singleplayer and obviously challanging, but the coop is completly broken in my opinion and getting invaded also isn't fun, it's not like in dark souls, it just makes no fun to get invaded by some dude with a broken weapon and getting destroyed in dark souls it was far more balanced. also they were many glitches and it's fine, but then also not, because players who want to have fun in the multiplayer get constantly invaded and then die to some dude in two hits."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,bad controls on pc. you get killed on and on because of this. so the game becomes unplayable. more observations  if you manage to kill an enemy it respawns after you rested.  it is not possible to save with e.g. f5 so saving after a win is not an option.  there are no levels. so you can not turn the game to easy mode to at least see a little bit of the world you paid sixty ! euros for.  you are tempted to play just long enough for steam to refuse a refund. do not buy this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"fantastic bosses and skillls, but poor interaction and disgusting monsters ruin the expolration. luckily, side quests become integrity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"this game is a from software game, not for everyone, but for those who like the genre, it's amazing. first thing, i don't think the game deserves a 10 because of poor optimization on pc, second, why do i gave it a 9? i've never played a souls type game, elden ring was my first experience with a from software game, and now at 96 hours and planning in getting it up, i'm going to play all dark souls, and sekiro, these games are just art, pure art . at first you seem to have nowhere to go, no map, no hud indication, that's when you know what the devs want you to do, go explore, seek what you have to do in this enormous game, the gameplay is just better compared to the previous games, they took it almost to perfection, the progression of your character throughout the entire game, wich is massive, is so cool to be a part of, it gives you a feeling of achievement, joy. and as usual, builds, there has to be in a from software game, this game gives you tons of items to do experiments, and in the pve, every build if made correctly, gives feedback to the player, you see what you have experimented with, and become proud, you used what the game wanted you to, for something better... hope to have helped someone with this review, i wrote some things that i liked about this game, i say you should try it, everyone can beat this game, and that's other good aspect, but for now thats what i have to say, bye!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"i've created a metacritic account just to write a review for this game. let me start off by saying elden ring is the best game i've played since the witcher 3, and besides that, is the most visually stunning game or media i've ever seen. my specs are the following i78700k, 16gb g.skill ddr4 3200, gtx 1080, m.2 evo 970 1gb i'm playing on max settings, 1440p, hdr on. the game runs fine, mostly 60fps with dips into the low 40's. it could be further optimized, but the game itself is so unbelievably good that you tend to forget all about the performance issues by the 1st hour of gameplay. starting off, the game can be a bit disorienting. the map is gigantic, and besides a very general pointer guiding you in a specific direction, it can be a bit overwhelming. as you start exploring, very quickly you realize that the map is not just big for the sake of being big. every single nook and cranny of the map has some adventure awaiting the player. from dungeons, to optional bosses, to powerful loot, incredible lore. about the lore, just wow. every from game besides ninja blade has spectacular lore, and it's what keeps bringing the fans back. this game's lore, because the game has the capacity to carry it, is extremely deep and varied. every single item, structure, enemy or even clutter, is there for a reason. to tell an incredible and epic tale the likes of which you could never find anywhere else. the game doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't directly inform you of the details. instead, it gives you the broad strokes, and trusts you to seek the truth behind this mysterious and dark world you've been cast into. no other game gave me a feeling like it trusts me to explore it, without guiding me to see everything it has to offer. no other developer is confident enough in its own creations to basically hide 75 of its content from the player, and trust the player to discover it by himself. entire areas, loot and bosses are practically hidden until you fulfill a very specific set of instructions to reveal them, and every time you do make that effort, you're rewarded with another piece of the epic puzzle that is elden ring and the lands between. the combat is an amalgamation of everything that works in a soulslike game. from the posture breaking in sekiro, to the fast pace of bloodborne and the familiarity of dark souls, this is from combat perfected. all in all, i didn't expect much from elden ring. i expected from to crash and burn on their first open world game, and i wasn't too sure the dark souls formula could translate to open world. but it did. and it did it better than any game released for the past 10 years. bravo from software, and thank you for this incredible piece of art"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"the fps lock and occasional framerate drops are annoying, but other than that the game is one of the best i have played so far."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"bloodborne is better, demon's souls is better, dark souls is better, sekiro is better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"very, very awesome game! this my first soulslike game and i enjoy!  only few problems here  some simple mob very unbalanced i hope patchs reprair this  few performace issues but patch can reprair  we no have good storytelling but this world is fantastic, need more story whit voice acting, ingame cinematic, etc  very very missing the questlog  pvp is lame and unnecessary freature"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"pc port was really bad for the first two weeks of launch, but the game is the best souls game hands down. i'm amazed what they could accomplish, albeit repeated but harder encounters feel a bit weird in some of the cases."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"i played 1 dark souls game previously, it was the 1st one and that was a while ago. i gave this a go, because the open world promise lured me in. here is my no 1. problem i don't know what i'm doing and why. seriously, this is like a fighting simulation? random enemies walking around in each area, so i go and fight them, they either turn out to be easy or nearly impossible. so i die, start from last check point, and don't go that way or run away. so i try to find a different location , hoping i can do something, which of course, kill some monsters , but i am losing the point, because they will respawn anyway as soon as i leave. so... what am i doing? just go around and kill whatever be killed? maybe i was hoping to have more content, more purpose. other reviewers said, the game is huge, but if this is what i supposed to do for 100s of hours, sorry this isn't gonna hold up long. whacking my sword around endlessly and i don't feel any progress made, i don't feel like i'm getting anywhere."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,played for 85 hours  never gets easier and story is so convoluted  not very enjoable. but a beautiful openworld if you like action  consolelike games.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,un des meilleur jeux qui m'est tait de faire ces deux dernires annes ! aucun problme d'optimisation de mon coter ! je prend un plaisir fou comparable  ce que j'ai pu ressentir sur botw ou mme sekiro hollow knight. bref foncez !
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,barely playable with performance issues. stuttering and low fps regardless of hardware. all that with subpar graphics for 2022. terrible controls. extreme input lag and inconsistency. slow and sluggish combat. many steps backward compared to any other soulsborne game. critics' reviews are either paid or plain lies from fanboys. huge disappointment.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"1010, everything bangs in the game 1 for performance issues still after updates. 910. will update to 1010 if they fix performance issues. date  2003"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"muito bom, excelente camon every bory, lets go play go home is nice play video game, no precisa de super grafico pra ser um excelente game, mas pegou carona no zelda breath of the wild, sem sombra de duvidas mas ta valendo."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"this game is not flawless, but it deserves a 1010 for 1 reason it will change the gaming formula for aaa games for years to come as seen in current gaming journalism. it has an unparalleled level of quality for a 60 game in its graphical fidelity, gameplay replayability, total game content, character customization, combat system, enemy variety, music composition, voice acting direction, map size, map environmental ambience, map verticality, explorable locations, and i can keep going on. for the sheer scope of the game, i am not surprised that there were minor issues at launch. but as of the current patch, this should have been addressed. i've seen larger games in gb with far less content to play struggle to get off the ground at launch. it has a simple story, that it immediately presents to you, and does not shove down your throat. you may, at your volition, tackle that story at anytime. or you may explore the world around you with brimming life, in a endless valhalla like setting. it trusts the player to explore, and allows for an almost endless customizable play choices. if you take the time, regardles if you have gotten gud, you can beat this game. if you are an action rpg gamer, and you do not mind dying, this is the game for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"this game still follows the precepts of the souls series, although it has become simpler than the previous parts, which i would not call a plus, but let it be, the game is still good and, as always, it is complex in an interesting way. those who insult and underestimate the game for being too difficult, the only thing you deserve is a spit in the face."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"this is a huge world, fraught with many secrets and mysteries, where you can spend dozens of hours without even killing the first story boss. elden ring is fromsoftware's best work to date and one of the best games of recent years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"don't believe the over inflated fanboi reviews, they are either ignorant or willfully blind to the major issues that plague this game. extremely overhyped and given the undeserved title of best game of the century and a masterpiece by silencing anyone who criticises the game. boss designs are atrocious with some of the worst combos i've seen in a souls game. map is big but empty, literal copy and pasted across entire regions. the gap in skill needed to play melee over magic is horrendous. balancing is non existent. don't even bother with coop, it's the biggest ballache and half assed multiplayer experience i've ever seen. not that it matters anyway, because doing anything outside of a dungeon will mean you'll get invaded every 10 minutes for balance reasons. the connections are so piss poor that your attacks won't connect even if you're right in front of them, making pvp the biggest joke in this game. we are now at patch 1.0.3, and yet despite the community screaming for better pc performance, they've completely ignored it, and made it worse in some instances, and given us instead some of the most stupid, unwarranted buffs and nerfs that they could have come up with, purely to appease the part of the community that only wants to suffer playing this game and demands everyone else does too. don't bother complaining about anything though, the community for this game is so toxic and full gatekeepers that you can't actually criticise the game without being abused or told to git gud. it's the worst case of stockholm syndrome, it's like trying to talk to someone from north korea. there's no point. the game isn't hard because of well designed bosses, enemies and movesets. it's hard because they kept tedious design decisions from older souls games, gave the bosses undodgeable attacks, the worst roll mechanic out of all the souls games, and allow the bosses to break game physics just to get the upper hand so you are constantly caught in a gotcha moment. its not hard because it's a fun challenge, it's artificially hard. fs has let the hype go to their head and has made this game harder just for the sake of being harder, trying to buy into their difficult game reputation. it's just a dark souls rehash but made worse. unless your a really big fan of souls games don't bother with this one. it's seriously not worth your time and definitely not worth your money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,the best souls game ever made. thank you from software for this magnificent piece of art.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"i loved the souls series. bought dark souls 1 for every platform and rerelease in the house. every dark souls game is hard, but fair. elden ring is not fair. past a certain point, regardless how much health you have or what armor your using, every single enemy will kill you in one or two hits. bosses will always manage it in one. and the must annoying  from bloodborne and dark souls 3 is back with a vengeance. if you tend towards a defensive or slower play style, just skip elden ring entirely."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"its awesome, its so addictive! being open world it gave players more options to git gud if they ever feel stuck at any tough situation!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,honestly the best game i've played in years. unlike other souls games this is friendlier considering your not being forced in any direction. if something is to hard you can just explore somewhere else that is closer to your level and come back way later. the map is big and takes around 120150 hours to do everything.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"perfect 1010. no question, if you are up for a challenging game that is one of the most beautifully done games you will love this. all the people leaving bad reviews are just noobs and scared of a difficult game im tellin you give it a go and play it longer than 5 minutes and plan on dying a lot. its a blast"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"aside from the fact this is a copy pasta of other souls games story wise, and the technical problems the pc version has, the true abomination is this games shoddy controls. this might be expected for a console game, but that  is not acceptable. this goes so far that the only difficulty in this game is derived from the poor controls and stuff like enemy attacks clipping though walls and objects. had i known how bad that game is, i would have waited for it to come up in the steam bargain bin before buying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"i have some trouble running discord and elden ring at the same time, but overall fantastic game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"it's elden ring. despite the performance issues on pc, it's still elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"have around 30 hours in on the pc version, i absolutely love this game. it has everything from excellent world building to addictive gameplay. i created an account just to say how amazing this is. its only once in a while we get a game on the same quality as something like breath of the wild and bloodborne"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,added black bars on purpose to prevent players from playing ultrawide. sometimes the game opens without the bars and looks beautiful. the company doesn't give a damn about pc gamers
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"this game is a masterpiece. its hands done one of the best games of the decade. it has a huge amount of content, the combat is tight and rewarding, and their are a lot of great bosses. i dont understand the complaints about the fact that there are a lot of reskinned bosses. most of the reskins have a different move set and i see them as mini bosses anyway and theyre still fun to kill even if they arent all hard. most of the people rating it low have no patience and do not understand great story telling and game design. its product of this generation with wanting hand holding and everything given to them on a platter. they all want to play the same game that everyone else is making with easy combat and maps that tell you where to go."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"absolutely fantastic! hours and hours of quality entertainment! and unlike certain other triple a games just released, no microtransactions!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,i hate this  game so much the enemies are so  unfair and the bosses  kill you in 2 seconds even if you're overgeared. 1110 would buy again
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,uma obra de arte. simplesmente espectacular. j vou com 240 horas de jogo e ainda estou longe do fim do jogo.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,best game ever played since breath of the wild. the world design is absolutly insane.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"too many performance issues and bad boss deisgn. repetitive, too expensive."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"i honestly don't understand why people are writing raving reviews for this game. let's start with the good before we move on to the bad and the horrendous that is elden ring  gorgeous bosses, world, art, etc.  huge  mounted combat casting is way better than the sword play though  the game plays well  lots of armors and weapons, that are cosmetically cool  sound design is really good now the bad  hyper aggressive mobs that 23 shot you  bend curve for stat effectiveness but a doubling curve for monster health and difficulty, making end game extremely tedious and repetitive. your char will shine midgame, but after that your increase in damage and survivability flatlines, while monster health triples.  repetitive  many, many places, dungeons, etc. in the world are reused.  depth of field is confusing, the camera doesn't really have optimal rotation, you will often plunge to your death, and after you have you have to backtrack to your corpse, and hope that this time around you don't miss the jump, and if you do, lose all your runes... i mean... uff exhausting  the platforming and death from falling is absolutely horrendous.  backtracking  the combat just , i'm sorry. it's fun in the first halve of the game, but when fights start to drag out to 5 minutes per normal mob up to 1015 sometimes 20 minute boss fights that you have to restart if you make a few bad dodges, it just get's tedious. not to mention you'll be using the same spellscombat arts most of the time, so it get's extremely tedious and repetitive.  best way to play a lot of the game is just by running past and skipping everything.  most spells .  questlines are confusing at best, there's nothing to guide you to understand what the game expects of you, and sometimes if you missed a part of the quest and progressed too far, the quest dies.  bugs.  balance is  this game is overhyped, and the user score reflects that. i would honestly stop trusting any critic reviews, they have no idea what they are talking about, and are most likely hyping the game for a paycheck i would avoid this game for a few more months, if not year, and grab it on a sale. it has some esthetic, and you'll get some fun out of it, and it will at points frustrate the  out of you with poor gameplay design. i guess fun if you are a sadomasochist."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"another unacceptable port from a studio that never fixes their games, look at bloodborne and dark souls 3."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"this game is going to be the best game of this year, i strongly recommend playing it on xbox series x, the only platform where it does not give problems with lag or fps, from software did it again but this time better than ever, it brought together the best of all the video games they have released to date in one, with a beautiful open world as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"expected some innovation in gameplay, but it's just ds3 in an open world, with a horse. said open world is not interesting, combat  ass compared to sekiro. horrible performance, for graphics that can only be considered barely acceptable in 2022."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"freaking master piece! i love how out of the box it is, i never played a souls game so coming in fresh into a open world game like this was like a breath of fresh air, compared to all of the stale open world aaa games you have out there. a solid 910 for me, i'd give it a 10 if the frame dips were fixed, and if the story was told just slightly better. but bloody amazing, people will be talking about this for years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"i didn't play the game but i respect fromsoftware think about their audience and making games for them but not only casuals. i am a casual too, but i can see when the problem is my lvl of play and when the game is actually broken. here is the 1 option. if you can't pass the game becouse of your own skill, it's your problem, not a problem of the game. as assassin's creed player, i am sad that ubisoft doesn't care about original games fans, but i'm glad that game studios, where people care about they're original fans still exist."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"i know it has a huge fanbase but.... to me, this game is nothing more than an infinite loop of doge, attack game with very clunky and outdated attack animations... i can't believe in 2022 a game like this got so much hype and positive reviews! i tried to enjoy this game multiple times but couldn't play this dumb game for more than 5 minutes. i love change and hard games but this primitive dodge and attack type game.... hell no!!!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,refresh from the bloated rpg these days rpg was ment to be explored by you meet someone go in any direction you want and you have to play elden ring for get a taste of that of course it hard it was meant to be but theres is multiple way you can overcome most of them use spirit summons lvl them up summon other players even go other places lvl up try again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,elden ring has an absolute gorgeous world to explore and it never feels copy paste like so many open world games. the boss design is top notch and the customization options are absolutely insane! whenever you get stuck on a fight you can now take a breather and go and do something else to train and better equip yourself. you never truly get blocked in. i haven't had much performance issues but i've seen some that have. this is honestly the best adventure game i've ever played and it definitely deserves to be held up high and shown as a great example of what gaming can be.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"absolute joke of a port. the game itself when it functions is okay, but on pc it's unacceptable to release it in this state. eta don't get me wrong. it's massively overrated even when it functions properly. it's like ds2 but with the map copypasted 70 times. the bosses, music, enemies, locations are all low quality compared to previous games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,elden ring is phenomenal for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the soulsborne series. it does have a heavy learning curve and can frustrate newer players but give it a chance and hopefully you will also see how amazing this game really is.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"this game is simply awful, it does so many things and none of them are any good. it seems that from threw the whole kitchen sink this time around. it's like they truly embraced and thought they could make quantity over quality work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"technicalperformance there were some minor technical issues at lauch for me at least.i've not experienced any stutterings however there were small fps drops but it was very rare and only in huge open world areas.i've played at maximum settings in 1440p. my rig is 3060tii7 9700k 2x8gb ram 3200mhz and standard crucial mx500 ssd. generally my gpu was not stressed and was operating around 6070 the drops were very rare in 90h of playing i've seen less then 10 times where fps was down below 60.i find it perfectly acceptable it's a lot better than for example god of war was at launch earlier this year. plot  world plotline is shrouded in mystery basic fromsoftware unless you really dig into it you will have some bare idea what is going on  . world is massive there is no other way about it. where sekiro was too small in my opinion this game is enormous to the extreme the amount of bossesnpchidden areas etc is staggering. it took me 90h to explore most of it kill major bosses collect items for achievemnts etc. and that is only single playthrough considering there are 3 endings it just shows how much of content there is. graphics  audio from graphical standpoint the game is nothing special not to say it's bad or anything it's as expected though anyone who played any fromsoftware game is aware that they never rly stressed that part of game for me personally graphics are acceptable though some textures could use some more loving in 2022.audio on the other hand is excellent as always the soundtrack from the game is great and creates some very climatic boss battles. gameplay basically the dark souls system is back with additions.those are spirit ashes  which are basically ghost summons that help you out. ashes of war  an enchant on weapons granting special abilites some new attacks like jumping attacks ,nice dual wielding, counters after block etc. it's basiclly time tested formula with new additions that keep the system fresh despite it's age. conclusion the game is great it delivers what was promised. an open world with countless paths that we can explore at our own  excellent gameplay with countless exciting  and sometimes infuriatingly difficult malenia  poor controler had some close encounters with table boss encounters. it is without a doubt a must play for all fans of souls genre 1010 and a solid contender for 2022 game of the year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"my pc satisfies the minimum requests parameters to play the game and since i started to play i had only 3 soft frame rate drops i play with max graphic settings, the game is perfectly beautiful in all of his aspects. i don't have all that problems the people critices so in my opinion this is a 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"das bisher beste spiel von from software  mit abstand. von der story ber gameplay bis hin zum welt, boss und dungeondesign ist alles stimmig. die kmpfe sind anspruchsvoll und doch gib es builds und mechaniken, die es auch ungeschickten spielern erlauben die story genieen und fortschritt machen zu knnen. die schlechten rezensionen ber, wirklich minimale, microfps freezings und 60fpscapping, usw. lassen wieder tief in die wohlstandsgesellschaft blicken und verraten mehr ber den rezensenten als ber das spiel."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"best souls like ever... i've been playing souls 2 and 3, bloodborne, sekiro, nioh 1 i 2 but elden ring is my favourite... optimization for pc best. 60fps without a single fps drop. controls? only controller."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"elden ring is perhaps the best soulsborne game, they took everything from there titles and put it into elden ring. the lore and story is quite interesting, bosses are pretty cool and awesome looking. i really do like the horse torrent you acquire, horseback battle is simple but makes some fights easier and some harder. overall this is an amazing game and might be my favorite out of all fs games. cons currently there are problems with the pc problem like stuttering, freezing, etc. mk is bad but its a souls game, why arent you using a gamepad. netcode is really buggy. it will disconnect a cooperator or invader randomly and quite often, like maybe 710 it will do it. all in all, once issues have been fixed, i recommend you should try this game, but its a difficult games and if you dont enjoy challenging games then maybe it isnt for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"best game i have ever played. beautiful world, great story and amazing gameplay. only thing holding it back are the performance issues on pc. otherwise a near perfect game."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"hate seeing this anywhere below atleast a 9. but it's an easy 1010 for me. i created an account just to help this game's ratings. i'm 80 hours in and i can safely say it's the best game i've ever played. as a 30 year old man, it makes me feel like a kid again, even just thinking about playing it after work! if we are comparing games, this is objectively a 1010. so majestical and mysterious. dark cosmic horror mixed with open world medieval buildings. different enemies, different locations, it just never gets old. i honestly don't know how i'm ever gonna play another ubisoft like title again. the industry better step it's game up! fingers crossed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"this game is absolutely amazing, exploring never gets boring as there's always something new to see or do. the game has multiple huge optional areas and engaging things that can keep you playing for hours. it's also extremely immersive, i haven't felt this since my first playthrough of dark souls 1. it has creative bosses, fun exploration, cool side quests, a huge map, and much more. i highly recommend this game to everyone, even if you aren't experienced with a fromsoftware game before."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"wonderful, beautiful game that struggles on all things fine tuning. a 7.9 that never quite reached an 8 for me. love fromsoftware but while the aesthetic, bosses, and npcs of the game's world shine things like camera controls, jumping, and sprint mechanics feel clunky, you never know when you're gonna get stuck on a tiny rock divet  indestructible twig that prevents your movement and it will happen  cause you to get killed. basically, you need luck to be on your side in a game that is trying to reward skillbased patient rpg gameplay. things like level progression mid game, item progression, and game direction have their own clunkiness, trying to play the game without reading 5 tabs first on a second monitor will lead to boring sessions. often you'll go through a difficult area only to find some semiuseful item within a build path completely opposite your own, and while getting through the area is satisfying in itself it ends up not feeling like it builds towards anything significant. later in the game, these boss enemies get heavily recycled and upscaled, making the original satisfaction dim, and leaving a certain apathy toward future side areas. as far as the good of the game, the world is huge and beautiful, and you will have moments where you feel extremely badass. though the stats screen is awful and cannot show comparisons of armor  items side by side, the armor itself is varied with all kinds of cosmetic looks. weaponsspellsashes all have a range and truly give a dnd type experience where the player can get custom as hell. without spoilers, there is an area where the player can reassign stats for a cost, which is a much needed feature that allows all types of mid life crisis. ultimately and this is speaking to my own experience, the bottom line was that after a certain point of exploring the beautiful map most of the time in this game just wasnt fun. i was either looking for fun in world, looking up fun online, or grinding mob filled rooms to get fun parts, all while carrying that passive fromsoftware 'die whenever wherever' game stress that does give some satisfaction to the experience. after trying a couple of different builds i found that typically there's way more fun to be had in completely overhauling a build every so often than in steadily carrying a build through the game. and that speaks to my opinion of the game. most of the thrill is all the new things, the novelty, the possibilities, but once you've seen 50 of the enemies, explored what you want, and committed to a build path, you're in for a boring time grinding from boss to boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,absolute masterpiece . simply put its the best game i have ever played by a long shot

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"yes this is the one of a few games that i give a 1010 score, i never been a dark soul or demon soul fan, not because of the difficulty i love challenging game and i'm a big fan of sekiro but because how slow the movement is, and no jump!!!, it just not my cup of tea. i love sekiro, challenging, awesome combat system, awesome bosses so sad that there is no dlc for it so when elden ring came, i was really considering should i order it or not, and in the end i gave a try. so? it is awesome, every complaints about dark soul now is gone in elden ring, the movement feel so smooth and you can jump awesome. the world is beautiful, the graphic to be honest not at next level, but it is still beautiful, every lands, dungeons and runes are unique, the combat system is great, still i miss the posture and parry mechanic from sekiro  you can still parry if you get the right shield or weapon. elden ring open world is one of the best period imo, you can explore every placer before the story route, even some of the area at the end game can be even explored very early, so it is also a very forgiving soul like game compare to previous from soft games. it's been a while since i was so into a game like this, spent around 60 hrs already, and this is easily goty for me, i downloaded this together with horizon forbidden west in ps5 and after playing elden ring, i feel horizon is a bit boring now even i love zero dawn sorry horizon fan. it has some optimization issue for pc but after some update now it is much better. after playing this game, i'm a big fan of from soft now can't wait for them to release some dlc for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"worst pc port and boring open world. other than interesting bosses this game has nothing. it has lore but no game story. graphics from 2013. cyberpunk is less buggy on pc compared to this madness. to fromsoft, please do not make pc games. pathetic excuse for souls like genre."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"good game, they have little performance problems but not create big problem.i'm playing with very good 1660 ti mobile .i would recommend it to everyone"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"the masterpiece of from software in every single step. variation of battlefield and enemies,weapons incantations."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"elden ring is the first big singleplayer game i have ever played for a considerable amount of time and it stunned me. there is so much to see and to experience, that the game has not gotten boring after 80 hours where i am not even close to 100. some great features i want to mention are following. 1. diversity in playstyles magic is powerful, weaponarts are easy to use, there are a ton of different weapons, combat while riding is intuitive and can not be abused for every enemy 2. exploration  open world despite of some other reviews i have read here, i think the overworld has much to offer. the areas are all unique with obvious high points in the bigger levels. everywhere you go you find either a cave, a graveyard, some brutal bears, a merchant or even a random mini boss. and yes there is repeating content, however always with a need new aspect to it. the important loot, while quite often not useful for your specific build, is still almost always unique. 3. design  graphics fromsofts design is great as usual. the big levels look stunning and even the huge open world has not to hide from anybody. and yes the repeating ruins and the thick fog everywhere sometimes seem like lazy design, yet they did not make my experience any worse. and yes graphics are not top tier. still they are by no means bad. 4. difficulty the difficulty is not nearly at a level of the ds games. for me as a starter this was quite welcoming as it takes some time to learn all of elden rings mechanics. whit constant exploration and without losing to much runes due to dying, leveling up is quite fast. a danger this poses is that you can get overleveled really fast. for some enemys this just makes the fights faster, others however can get hilariously easy a boss in an main level died after three hits in my playthrough. still almost any enemy can and will kill you in seconds if given the opportunity. there is also the option just to progress to other areas early. most areas are not locked as to be expected from an open world. 5. enemy's  bosses their complexity evolvs alongside the player. basic knights fe. get more abilities in later areas. if you found a strategy for every enemy type they all are manageable. however ganks are deadly. and mages  your melee dude. for the bosses it is pretty much the same. with the right powerlevel they are all beatable. some are made to easy by summons. and there are a bit many reskin minibosses. with just few alterations. 6. controls on pc i heard some complaints about playing without a controller. i can not confirm. with some keys changed controls still are not intuitive, yet they are also nothing abstract and are rather easy to learn. 7. story and npcs idk. they are either crazy, dead or gone. seriously there are cool questlines and most of the npcs tell you a good portion of what you have to do, however you still either seem to need to google some or just be lucky to progress at some point. for the lore it is probably the same. i feel like i have not grasped most parts of it. however i enjoy diving into lore analysis after finishing the game myself. yes there are performance issues, however they seemed to correspond with other programs running, at least on my pc. in conclusion elden ring is by no means perfect, yet it still offers so much to anyone giving it a chance that i can not take any points away from my 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"really disappointed in fromsoft for this. combat is slow to the point of being almost turn based, boring, and way too easy. most bosses are first try. it feels more like a circus than a fight. you see the same enemies and bosses over and over. very lazy. animations are silly and sometimes just ridiculous. weapons and armor looks stupid. lock on system is trash. camera . status effects go through shields. lol why? bad fps stutters no story whatsoever. terrible multiplayer and netcode. coop keeps dropping. pvp is laggy. engine feels like its from 2005 crashes and locks up. glitches happen often. soundtrack is boring, uninspired, and generic. reused sounds. reused animations all the way from ds1 mouths dont sync with dialogue or most of the time, move at all lol. positive note, the incantations seem interesting. overall not very fun and definitely not worth 60. feels like fromsoft just tried to exploit their audience for cash. very lazy developer"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"un juego no muy apto para noobs, los fans de horizon y god of war no dejan de echarle tierra, pero este juego es una joya en todos los apartatados imaginables, ya casi voy por las 200 horas y creo que falta mucho mas por descubrir, es un juego para los fans de los souls, no apto para nios."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,on of the best games in last decade. and i'm not even a souls fan.  gorgeous art design  atmospheric music  dark lore  refined souls combat  sense of accomplishment  while very difficult it's not frustrating lots of respawn points and can fast travel almost without limits being open world you can just run through difficult area until you leveled up  some rareminor performance issues on pc
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"this game is like a really good spicy meal but the chefs put crazy hot sauce on it. the story of this game is completely eclipsed by the difficulty, at times theres enemies that are around your level, then you go through a door and uh oh youre trapped until you spend 3 hours of your life trying to kill a completely unbalanced boss, not for loot or to progress any quests, just to escape the room would. that being said i would love a game to be made out of this story thats for enjoyment rather than whatever this is"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"great game just needs to fix some bugs with clipping, tearing, and frames. also some crowding and camera issues but everything else is amazing"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"one of the best game ever made. maybe the best arpg ever made. surely the game of the decade. fs are artists, it's rich, long, epic, marvelous, addictive and most over we must discover the world without any arrow or help like all in the modern open world. moreover the game is more accessible than previous souls game, you can make your game etc. a 1010 well deserved."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"elden ring an eyeopening experiance i have now played more than 40 hours of elden ring. i killed two of the major bosses out of three and reached the grand lift of dectus before i decided enough was enough. first, what the game does well. feel and tone it lets you get a feel for the game without throwing things in your face. this could have been done better, but it is nice to experience a game where, as you go through, more unfolds before you. bugs. this game is quite well polished. it is relatively bugfree. in forty hours of gameplay, i only ran into one serious bug. what the game does poorly. music. although the musical score is very nice, the music is poorly implemented. you know whether something is intended to be an easy fight or a hard fight, just based on the music, and it changes your tactics. when the music indicates this is meant to be a tough fight, you hang back and take stock a little to learn your opponents' moves. combat. the combat is dull, repetitive, and clich. you are playing in a quick time event qte. in fact, the whole game is one long qte. you see the horse rear back, hit dodge. you see the guy with the halberd pull their arm back for a lunging strike, hit parry. every enemy has a slightly different indicator of what button to hit when, but they are all the same tactics. enemies. they are all laughable and trite. seriously, they are bad. it's like the game designers went to a fiveyearold and asked them what a cool monster would be. oh, a giant head, on a gokart, that shoots flaming harpoons from its mouth.. seriously? the creatures you encounter seem to have no relationship with each other. some are animals, some are weird inanimate things, and some are people, but none seems consistent. gameplay. the objective of the game is to kill three big bosses. the only indication you get as to where they are is that you get a little golden line at some respawn points that show you roughly the direction you need to go. death is an integral part of the game. many people told me the game is good because it is so hard unforgiving. but it is probably the most forgiving game released in recent years. death means nothing, nothing at all. if you die, you drop runes. but this doesn't matter, you can go pick them back up, and as you can run around most enemies, you can literally just run to where you died, pick them up, run to the nearest spawn point, let anyone pursuing you kill you. now you respawn right here, with no enemies  as they also reset  and pick up your runes. it's pointless. consider this to a more traditional game. if you die in a more traditional game, you have to load your previous save. the experience, money etc, you got is gone. every enemy you killed is alive again. in atmosphere. the game is void of anything worthwhile, there are numerous tilesets, but they don't do anything different to each other, just look different. the world is devoid of content, vapid at best. you have virtually no people, no characters, no justification for anything being anywhere. it's just a perpetual rule of cool. lovely ruins, why are there? who knows, there's no lore about it. there's no perceived purpose for the building. it's just there. not only this, the world is big and empty. you can spend ages just running from place to place, no fighting, nothing interesting to look at, nothing interesting to do, just run. character creation. wow, this takes the cake, you get given the choice of three classes, with no explanation about the differences between the classes, and you begin at level 8, and none of it is explained or even makes sense. npcs. the npcs you meet in the game are quite frankly  they give you no reasoning as to why they are there. they are all tropey to the point of making my teeth hurt, and, for the most part, they would have been just as compelling if they were a roadside sign that you had to read. lore. i like the lore, but it's here instead of what they did well because the lore has virtually no intersection with gameplay. every item gives you snippets of lore. if you want it all, be a completionist and collect everything. story well, no, the story is crap. the story, in essence, is that you are at a tipping point, and how you level up your character is meant to reflect the  balance of the world around you. but you don't have a story here. the story is found in the lore, which undercuts the entire game but never intersects with it. there is no story in the gameplay. conclusion is elden ring good? no. it's trite, repetitive boring large, but not full lacking consequence and impact. it's flagged as an rpg, but it isn't you don't play a character. all you do is allocate stats. you don't make choices that matter you go through the motions. it is an entirely linear game in a nonlinear environment, and it suffers because of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"just another dark souls with an open world. the ui is awful, the story shines by its lack of development and the graphics looks dated asf. plus that, it runs very laggy even with a 3080."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"apart from technical issues, game is great and very enjoyable. great atmosphere with lost of colorful places."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"it's an ok game. but it barely works. it keeps on stuttering and freezing, sometimes it doesn't even start remaining on a white screen forever. this situation makes some enemies impossible to beat, just because the game crumbles on itself when you are near them. the fighting system is annoying and unfair for the player, to make an example if you manage to knock an enemy to the ground it becomes invincible and you can't attack them. you would guess that the same goes for you, but no. if you get knocked down you receive a combo that kills you. the major bosses almost instakill you after one hit. the magic system is overpowered, and doing a parry is almost pointless because the combo that you can do after the parry, does the same damage that you would do with a charged attack. to make everything worse it's extremely hard to do because you can't understand when the enemies hit you.  this is especially true for the major bosses . also, there are a lot of attacks that aren't parryable, and there is no prompt or indication that they can't be parried. the mechanic of blocking the attacks is really interesting because you can follow it with a combo. but it is doable only on small enemies because after a boss combo you don't have enough stamina left to attack, and instead receive an attack in your face. the game feels generally old and every animation, every weapon, every combo has a feel of already seen. if you go to an advanced area and beat an enemy that would have killed you in two hits, you receive the same exp that you would get beating the same enemy in his weaker version, in the starting zone. it is completely mental because advancing in the game, you need progressively more exp to level up, but the enemies give you always the same amount, even the harder ones. the game gives you the illusion to have the possibility to fuse a lot of styles, magics, weapons, armors, and abilities. but in reality, the only sensible ones reduce to a number countable with your fingers. this is especially true for armors, which are incredibly useless to one another, with really small chances between them and just a couple of them being really useful. i didn't understand the weight mechanic... between mediumweight and lightweight changes literally nothing. moving speed is the same, attack speed is the same, you roll in the same way... the soundtrack is ok, nothing special. i've played dozens of hours and i can't recall even one track... so yeah, they work, but nothing memorable. the new mechanics are also annoying. the jump is utterly pointless because in the open world you can jump essentially nowhere, resolving in the end always using your mount jump. in a closed environment instead, it just becomes a way to give you anxiety and frustration. it opens new possibilities to explore the environment and have smart shortcuts, but the majority of them are on a freefall down, which in this game means instant death. it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that you respawn at the last checkpoint, and even if you manage to survive all the enemies on the road to get where you died, you could just slip down one of the platforms and lose all the exp you have collected to that moment.  which could be a lot since going further in the game, you start to require something like 25.000 runes to level up one level and the enemies give you around 150 runes average . this could be acceptable if the jump mechanic was implemented decently in the game. but that isn't the case, the jump is hard to calibrate and sometimes unpredictable. i would recommend this game if you like exploration and big boss battles. those are two points in which this game excels, it doesn't even seem the same game. weird is... the game usually stutters less on the big bosses compared to the small ones. also, being the big b.s big you can challenge them also on your mount. which is super satisfying. the exploration is always interesting and pretty much diverse even tho the story is comparable to a headache and is really confused. overall it isn't a bad game. but not a good one either. it has its very good things, but sadly it also has huge negative and annoying things. p.s. during frame drops, enemies are literally invisible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"it takes 10h and not giving up to appreciate this game as a nonsouls player. the design of this game is both breathtaking and old school, in that nothing is give to you by the game, you have to explore, fight and find out. somethings are hidden, so when you find them you appreciate the discovery. it goes back to roots when most games handhold you. because the hard ways are the true ways and persist. even those hating the game will realise it later. best game since witcher 3 for me. and i started as a hater. hats off to fromsoftware, very rare developer to do this. 1110 and an understatement. i am kbm user, just rebind, not best point of the game, but i will forgive them because they have merited it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"gioco davvero pessimo, ennesimo open world cafonata commerciale da 4 soldi, fromsoftware ha preferito incassare picci a colpo sicuro piuttosto che sviluppare un gioco considerabile anche solo decente. l'intera mappa  una presa per il , praticamente l'ennesimo simulatore di passeggiate con ottimi panorami, ma a sto punto mi faccio un giro fuori.  su 6070 ore di gioco ne passi circa 3040 a cavallo e onestamente  pure fatto relativamente male  game design fatto coi piedi con almeno la met e sottolineo almeno la met dei nemici riciclata da dark soulsbloodbornesekiro, manco lo sbatti di farne di nuovi.  dungeon copia incolla uno dopo l'altro son tutti uguali in ogni regione c' grottaminieraaltarinodungeon legacya parte a caelid dove semplicemente non avevano sbatti e han messo un castellino cosi di rappresentanza  boss copia incolla uno dopo l'altro son tutti uguali, alcuni si ripetono proprio e hanno un altro nome o qualcosa che sbarluccica.  meccaniche vecchie di 12 anni e neanche tirate a lucido, proprio lasciate stare come erano lo sono anche adesso.  bilanciamento pessimo di gameplay, se hai 2 neuroni in pratica dopo 10 minuti oneshotti mezzo mondo  bilanciamento pessimo di gameplay pt.2, i combattimenti contro certi boss da met gioco in poi sono pura barzelletta, puoi avere la miglior armatura del gioco e 99 di vitalit verrai comunque oneshottato, quindi a sto punto a che servono le armature e la vita ?  checkpoint ovunque che permettono anche al peggiore dei pedali di approcciarsi al gioco potendo ripetere a oltranza certi mostri con zero penalit dovuta alla morte.  grafica da 2010 non c' neanche da continuare a discutere  anzi si perch droppano gli fps con una di gtx2060 giocando a 60 fps cacati , doom eternal lo reggo a 155 fisso no drop no stutter no un liscio come l'olio  colonna sonora ? what is dat ? nessuna soundtrack anche solo lontanamente considerabile tale, solo 3 suore che fanno ooooooohhhhoooooohhhhoooooooo tutto il tempo e rumori di che picchettano nelle caverne.  online pessimo , manco riesco a giocare con i miei due di amichetti che han avuto la sfortuna di comprare sto di gioco che vengono disconnessi ogni 2 minuti.  online pessimo pt2, dioporco han pure detto che la cooperativa sar molto libera si , sei libero di non poter fare un  se vuoi entrare in un dungeon prima di disconnetti, poi ti riconnetti dentro il dungeon per poi finirlo in 5 minuti netti e riconnetterti un'altra volta fuori. non so voi ma per me son solo insulti per uno schifo del genere nel 2022. se mai avr ancora voglia di perderci tempo continuer questa recensione."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"im actually not surprised by the semi low reviews. the game is highly unoptimized as of release and maybe not the best looking one released in the past year. its also not with might have been expected from a fromsoft game. but as a game in itself its actually quite good. first of all, i am a fan of the souls games. i've played the dark souls trio and bloodborne numerous times. i've played demon souls once and i've touched sekiro. part of the experience might be influenced by nostalgia. i might add that i'm also a fan of the elder scrolls series. why is this relevant? the best way to describe the game is as if dark souls 3 and skyrim had a baby. the dark souls signature playstyle in its complete form. someone who played any of the ds games will easily adapt to the controls and gameplay basics. the difference is a jumping mechanism and the vast open world format. you have a horse that you can use for travel as well as combat. however most of the bosses are in mount restricted areas. all in all theyve made it work but at a cost. the world, as of 15hrs in the game, have a feeling of 'lifelessness' and the world is too large for its own good. if you played skyrim you might have had the same mixed feeling. one part of you loves the big, free, open and unrestricted world while another part of you is tired of walking another 10 minutes through a forest consisting of nothing but trees, or a tundra full of ice but nothing more to it. the world is not very interesting and sometimes gives me the ubisoft 'far cry open world' vibe. you sometimes however stumble upon more in depth areas but my feeling is that they couldve cut the world size in half and still have the big size feeling but with more personality. some locations feel synthetic in the way that they are added as filler or just to serve for a certain mechanic. that leads me to the other problem. dark souls, or the souls series in general, usually have a very abstract story where you have to puzzle the small hints of dialogue and cutscenes to find out about the huge lore and deep actual meaning of the game. due to open world nature of the game and the lack of dialogue and cutscenes that comes with the somewhat unpersonalized open world, you get more distanced from the otherwise semi linear story. i personally don't care much about story in any games, souls game included. i play for the riskreward, the exploration and the gameplay, therefor i don't find this downgrade of story that impactful. however i do miss the change of scenery and feeling of progress that you usually get in the more linear games. apart from these downsides or weak points of the game it good. the actual content and possible playtime and replay ability is huge. you have more alternatives than the previous games. more weapons avaliable. more abilities. more mechanics. improved multiplayer. more to explore. i love some of the boss fights i've fought and that the difficulty varies. what might feel impossible at first will become easy as you progress the game and your personal skill. also the art style and some of the architecture is great, as usual. if i could choose i would have wanted a more linear traditional dark souls 4 but the elden ring, being a different attempt to showcase the souls series, does not make a bad job. it just doesn't do it in the way a souls fan might expect it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"elden ring has surpassed all of my expectations. the game is a perfect marriage between dark souls combat and breath of the wild exploration. to my pleasant surprise, elden ring was able to make world exploration the most enjoyable part of the experience for me. being able to almost immediately unlock our horse companion makes the early game a wonderful time. there is something magical about riding through the world, enjoying the beautiful environment, and hunting for all of the secrets to be found. again and again i was shocked by the diversity of world design, the depth of the dungeons, and the scale of the world itself. elden ring gives me a feeling that no other game has the feeling of walking through an area with the sense that i've been here before. this chilling sense of nostalgia alongside the outstanding depth of combat options is the reason why i will be returning to elden ring for years to come."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"boring, repetitive and overrated. performance is garbage on pc dark soles game all play the same."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"great game and had no technical issues except a little bit of lag in some cutscenes, and my pc isn't some technical marvel rtx 2070 and i7, i also did not change any settings, except sound. the only reason i post this, is to higher the user score as it certainly, despite the issues some have, deserves a much higher score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"elden ring is the first fromsoftware game i have played, and now that i have played the game for some hours, i only have one major complaint, the fps spikeslag spikes. if they optimized the game a little i would definitely give it a ten out of ten. i have a pc that should have no trouble handling the game on max settings, but i still get the spikes even if i go on low settings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"for sure one of the best games that i've played in my life, i'm a big fan of souls like, and beside that problem with fps already solved my experience was perfect, 127,6 hours until now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,a few hiccups in performance but the gameplay and story are fantastic. easily the best game of the year so far and easily one of the best games ever.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"typical dark souls game with boring,tedious,empty open world. pc version runs like potato with drops to 30 fps and constant stuttering while it looks like ps4 early game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"very good world but way too much problems. with my rtx 2060 i can barely play on lowest settings still getting a lot of fps drops, sometimes in the middle of the game your enemies become invisible or just disappear. one of the worst game performance i've seen since cyberpunk 2077"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"masterpiece. this game is fromsoftwares masterpiece, they took a lot of their older games and forged it into this open world banger. fights are fun, exploring is super addictive, theres literally anything behind every corner. there are so many ways you can enjoy and play it character, weapons, fighting styles, , that ill definitely play it more than one time. one of those rare games youll think of way too often."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"looking beyond the initial performance issues, i believe i have never had more fun in any game. the sheer amount of content this game offers, the depth of combat, the exploration. must play for any soulsfan."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"i might change this later if things improve. anyway, here's my review for the pc version. to start, performance is fine. i run it on a 1050 ti with a newer cpu and runs fine other than stuttering. then again, it just runs fine, not well. game play is standard souls. if you've played dark souls you have played this game as well. the open world is boring. it's beautiful but serves no purpose other than a way to waste time between minor or major dungeons. most, or all, progression will take place in those dungeons. the major reason i give this a lower score is just bad game design. every enemy and boss is disgustingly overtuned to a point where you have to wonder if the people planning these attacks thought they were for a dmc game. now i have no issues with getting punished for bad play, but when every boss and enemy is whipping out 812 homing projectiles while swinging an instakill sword around, it gets to be a bit much. there is a boss who literally just fills the field with homing projectiles, half of which will kill you extremely fast, the other half will kill you instantly. she also summons minibosses while shooting these projectiles. don't get me wrong, i love a challenge. but this is not a challenge of your skill, it is a test of patience, as you oh so carefully traverse the area, memorizing enemy spawns and behavior, only to be hit by an enemy who just decided that animation frames weren't cool anymore. if by the time i finish this game, the gameplay improves, i will remove and update this score. otherwise, it's very mediocre with questionable game design choices i would expect from a first time indie dev."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"such an incredible experience. i didn't believe the reviews at first saying that this game is a masterpiece, but here we are after 72 hours of gameplay and yeah, this is indeed a masterpiece! a much better and more authentic open world experience than all the mouth feeding simpleton npc mind open world titles out there. things don't necessarily need to be easy or super intuitive. there is so much more meaning in a game like elden ring. just give your self a chance to try it. it is the closest thing to a dnd gaming experience, everyone has a different journey. the world is incredibly mysterious and rewarding, it's fair to say that nearly every corner of this nearly endless world has something hiding, something that most of the players could potentially never see or experience. i hope that new patches will fix some minor performance issues for pc. otherwise, me and my friends loved every single bit. felt like playing elder scrolls  oblivion or any epic game of the deep past again. certainly a game changer for the whole industry and open world genre!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"pc controllers  as usual in fromsoftware games, however, this is one of the best games ever made. noobs as usual give bad reviews for dying 20 times in the first boss, but even they know the great game this one is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"a gigantic open world with amazing bosses, lore, and that buttersmooth combat that we all know and love from previous souls games. i'm really loving it so far. the amount of character customization, armor and weapons in the game is also staggering. multiplayer with my friends has been amazing so far too. solid 1010 from me. i did have a few frame drops and stuttering close to release but those seem to have been mostly resolved"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"loved a game that didn't baby me. got lost in finding my adventure. no  glowing items or annoying quests. music was bomb, setting great, voices fantastic. customization and pvp great. challenges were there and the tools to fight them available. been a while since i was this awed"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"thankfully for now it's very obvious that most people don't actually like this game, yes it sold over million copies, because lots of people were baited into buying it, because it was advertised as very accessible for new players, but in reality it's just same as every souls game, just with open world and most people don't like games where you have to die million times to learn move sets, most people don't find that interesting, it's very obvious that most gamers want good story, fun gameplay and challenging, but not too difficult combat. souls games are way more than challenging, they are brutal and even with best gear you can die easily and for most people, this is not fun. just speaking facts."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"this is probably one of the best games i have ever played. i can't come up with any faults of the game apart from the frame drop issues that will likely be fixed and have already been fixed for many people. this game from its incredibly fantastical environments to its incredibly hard bosses is an absolute joy to play. with over 40 hours in the game, i still feel i haven't even reached the surface of what this game has to offer. the endless exploration feels almost daunting as an end to the game remains nowhere to be seen even 40 hours into the game. this game is so much more than just a dark souls 4 and feels more like a combination of everything fromsoftware has learned over their years of game developing. a true masterpiece, thank you fromsoftware"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"in terms of content and experience, this games is a solid 1010. but with pc tech issues with random screen stuttering i give it a 910. with some other game the stuttering would be bigger issue, but the game makes you overlook technical issues. its a have to play game for everyone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"best fromsoftware game. big open field areas, 100 bosses, smooth gameplay and combat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"great game world design. cool bosses and npcs. boring, noncoherent story and unbalanced game play with tons, and i mean tons, of stutters and glitches on pc. wish i'd saved my money and time until they fixed the game, if they ever do. however, even without the glitches it's just a game of super gimmicky bosses, some of which are impossible to beat, at least for me. i quit at level 169 after not being able to even put a dent in malenia. the stupidest boss and saddest end to a ton of time invested in her story. save your money on better storytelling and games that aren't there to just punish you after investing a ton of time. very disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"elden ring does open world gaming right, i find myself wanting to explore every single dungeon in the game, because every dungeon has a unique reward at the end in the form of a unique weapon, spell or talisman the landscapes are stunning, and each area has a distinct look to it the combat is great i understand that some people on pc have had some performance issues, but i haven't see any"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"it is such a beautifully stunning game. hard as hell bosses, but doable. ancestor spirit is what did it for me. one of the best from has ever made. hope they keep it up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"decent game but really not deserving of the 10s. a nice map that you can barely stop to appreciate due to being 1shot by some enemy if you stand still. some of the most awkward onesided dialogue in a game where your character has no voice. a wide variety of skills and weapons that have no ingame explanation of what they do. one of the worst cameras on recent memory. it's another souls game, take it or leave it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"fcking amazing. i love every minute of the game. margit beat my fcking ass the first few times, but i got gotfried on my 3rd try"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"great looking game as always, visually stunning. sound and music also great. new crafting option is a welcome addition, same with boss checkpoints. the meta of the game seems to be to anger the player by any means necessary and really they just do this without reprieve, using every dirty trick in the book. example, there is a new lobster mob that can shoot at you with pinpoint accuracy from miles away, taking out nearly half your hp with one shot. i've had enough of that nonsense. it's cute but it doesn't serve a purpose other than to be a nuisance when you're exploring. noteworthy combat encounters are rare, dungeons are few and far between, even fewer of them containing items of value. i was mostly sad to find out that it lacked the sense of accomplishment i felt in dark souls after beating a boss. i killed nearly all of the lords and i just felt bored. control mapping is weak on pc, can get really confusing in time sensitive situations. i don't like playing with a controller but it really was made for consoles in mind, so instead of using a button per action sometimes you'll have to combine two. latency is also weird sometimes, like the commands activate late or not at all. most infuriating though, it's filled to the brim with hackers and it hasn't even been two weeks since it came out. fs still tonedeaf to the pleas of the community. my advice is get it after the hype dies down, or after it gets a few well deserved patches."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"you wont find every thing you wont be told everything nothing holds your hand and accedentally finding out about something such as finding a alternet ending by accident is the best thing, such a breath of freash air"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,if everyone is giving legend of zelda breath of the wild a 1010 than elden ring definitely gets at least a 10 because it surpasses that game in every way.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"its just darksouls with an uninspired, empty and boring open world. one of the thing the soulsgames were known for is the almost brilliant level design and an open world like this destroys it. it looks nice, there are some nice poi and dungeons, but its downgrade to the series of those fromsoftware games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,one of the best games ever made. is compared to botw and the original dark souls. deserves all the money.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,this is the best game i've played in a long while. definitely game of the century if you'd ask me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"this game is a great show of what a fromsoft game is supposed to be, hard and unforgiving for your mistakes, and a lot easier once you know what you do. if i had to compare it to something in reallife i would compare it to moutainclimbing, if you cant make the climb you should not be there and train some more. that principle has always been a part of the souls series and is a core part of elden ring. those that ask for a easymode are those that ask for an elevator up the mountain, dont listen to them the are not fansclimbers and should have no say in it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,it's an exciting game. feel the love of the game. the character is wonderful. the story is wonderful.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"absolutely horrendous interface and control scheme that is beyond unacceptable for a pc title, even a ported one. bad performance compared to the graphical fidelity, unsmooth movement, gameplay lacks fluidity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"didn't play it longer than 2 hours, because i refunded it. i love open world games, but i don't understand how this game is hyped like this? despite all the port issues, no ultrawide support, the clunky controls, the 60fps lock...i have never been bored like this by an open world game. i wait for a sale, hoping the technical issues are fixed by than, giving it another try. not worth 60 bucks at all!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"haters gonna hate, but the game is great anyway. some many people already said why this is great i have nothing new to add"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,best game i've played. just like dark souls but more gameplay. i recommend buying this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"so i think this will be my very first legit review ever and let me just say this game is everything it's been praised and more. first of all i don't think people who give it bad reviews based on their computers specs and crashes should even be valid as i myself don't have the best cpu out there, but would never downplay a game when my hours played would be close to none. if you aren't familiar with fromsoftware i.e. bloodborne, dark souls, sekiro games either and just hopped on the hype train of what's popular and got slapped in the face with that difficulty shock don't take it with a grain of salt it's meant to challenge you. people also out there like there's no open world or lore or loot i don't know what you're talking about cause there's literally loot and lore all over if you actually explore and pay attention. yeah there's no tutorial or quest page to guide you when playing or to hold your hand but you can always also use google like almost 99 of everyone when they get stuck somewhere or just look up a guide and don't feel ashamed there's literally tons of info out there on the game to easily guide you by without needing a in game tab. everything about his game is rewarding, from killing that crazy hard boss you are just determined to finish whether you die 100 times or not. you can respec your character later in the game so even if you find something you want to use which you didn't build your char for you can always alter later on or if you really feel like it just grind it out like most games require these days as there's no real max level in the game as opposed to skills capping out at 99 which you can actually get every attribute to if you really wanna be elden lord. the game had some flaws at launch but then again almost every game now and days days one has some sort of broken system to it which usually gets fixed right away or down the road. one major thing about this game no matter how much you might think you're a video game god is you're going to die.. numerous, numerous times. laugh it off, learn from your mistakes and move on. i've never clapped my hands so hard and yelled so loud to myself in excitement after getting down that boss i thought was ny imposible. graphics aren't as good as one would expect from a aaa game coming out in 2022 with 1010 reviews and no it doesn't have dlss or ray tracing or anything but you also have to understand it's all about the gameplay and it still looks pretty damn beautiful if you ask me. i haven't got a chance to wander the lands with a friend yet but i heard it can be even more of a blast in coop which i'm interested to try. also if you're finding it super hard but also enjoying it yes their are trainers and cheats out but honestly that takes away all the fun from the whole game plus then you get put in a soft server with other cheaters so it's just not worth it if you ask me. the game is clearly meant for consoles so i do recommend if playing on pc to have some sort of controller to make your gameplay a lot smoother and easier much like most console released games. all in all. if you were waiting for a new rpg you could just play by yourself or with others on your own time similar to games like witcher 3, nier automata, rdr2 and etc with lots to explore, numerous endings to unlock, new game 's to catch anything you missed the first time or so on and wanna just be your own badass hero whether it's wielding a giant sword, shooting bows, casting spells or basically doing almost anything you could in the likes of skyrim then give it a shot. my biggest piece of advice before purchasing is just know like most others have noted of the games difficulty and don't let it frustrate you do the point of quitting. the game basically comes at you with no difficulty setting but similar to very difficult versions or your favorite games you might be used to playing on normal or even easy and just aren't used to the challenge cause you just wanna enjoy and finish it. don't aggressively attack enemies without properly dodging or blocking, it's not meant to just smash the hit button and heal. lastly just take your time, we're not all speedrunners out to smash records. you get no rewards in finishing it in one hour or one week. chances are you're just gonna miss out on more stuff along your run. anyways i just wanna say i've loved every second i've spent with this game so far and can't wait to new game plus it numerous times to learn and discover more and more. coming from someone who's died hundreds of times enjoy everyone!! d"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"if you take skyrim and remove the interesting story, fun, progression, npc population, direction, you get elden ring. i played for 20 hours, leveled to 20, and its just riding around on a horse trying to grind runes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"'elden ring' was a masterpiece of soul series games, it has excellent qualification,it is the first soul series game worth trying for all players. review of elden ring graphicart 8.5 musicsounds 9 narrativeperformance8 gameplay9 score9 0.3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"most overrated and most boring game of all time, game crashes every 15 min, the graphics aren't that great, it's overhyped by fanboys!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,from software really outdid themselves this time. this game takes all of the best pieces of their previous titles and makes them better. i was hesitant at first since i didnt know how their formula would work in an open world but i was wrong and couldnt be happier.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"jogo incrvel, fora as lagadas que d no pc  100 bom, a experincia de andar pelo mapa ao invs de ficar preso naqueles cantos torna o jogo bem menos repetitivo."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"game graphics looks like from 2006. other languages than english were probably translated in google translator lol. stupid texts on the ground, i mean, they are really stupid, and with zero point. bad console port on pc, u have to guess which button does what. im really dissapointed, gameplay is boring. story even more. at least we know which company pays for good reviews."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"i made an account because this game deserved the points. frankly, it is just the best fromsoft has ever done. there is a little bit for everyone who enjoyed the previous entries. the game is absurdly massive and fun no matter how you go about it, it has outrageous amounts of replayability even compared to other souls titles who boasted high replayability... if making elden ring does not go rewarded, i don't know what would."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"i do not understand the hype and the critics reviews. it's a big, empty open world, without tutorial, quest, lore, loot. sluggish controls and graphics is worst than modded skyrim. 5 hours play time and it's already boring. if you take away the difficulty and you can on pc with cheat engine there is nothing left, a big dead, empty world where nothing happens. go and learn what a 1010 open world is by playing rdr2."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,a complete masterpiece visuals art direction gameplay music everything about this game is completely mesmerizing
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"a great game with relatively minor issues that i personally have faced. it's hard and unforgiving, but much more accessible than previous souls like games from fromsoftware. work needs to be done to perfect the port, but as of the 12322 it's working perfectly fine on my pc. those who complain about the 60fps lock are screaming into thin air, it is clear the engine is reliant on that 60fps lock, very similar to how skyrim is. overall, it's great fun, but very difficult and can be very annoying to a new player. it's not perfect, and it's a way off the 1010 score many people spout, but it's a game that has adequately lived up to it's enormous hype, which is very rarely seen."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,elden ring review 010 can't even play the game because it crashes every 10 minutes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"a really great game. but even a great game like this has lots of issues, and these issues ruin your whole experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,one of the best fromsoftware game i played so far. also one of the best games period
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"one of the best game i ever played. imagine a mix between witcher 3, zelda botw and the darkness of the souls.this game is huge, i already played over 100 hours and i feel i know nothing about all the world and his secrets. i wasn't a fan of souls but for me this game is a master piece ! the game is not as frustrating as sekiro f.e, the open world allows you to move and do other quests and things till you feel confortable and come back. i just can recommand you to play it, you won't regret."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"a nigh perfect souls game set in a vibrant, dense open world. from software have picked up the best parts of all the previous souls games, bloodborne and sekiro and have added a lot more to make this game. the combat and other gameplay elements are top notch and the sound design and music is a new high bar for the soulsborne genre. i've personally encountered no performance issuescrashes on my pc but i'm sure fromsoft will patch the issues out at the earliest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"great game. don't listen to most of the review bombs from new accounts with two reviews, the other being horizon. it's like people bought a souls game and are offended that it's a souls game. it's a classic souls game with a lot of the same mechanics from previous games. it's more accessible as there are usually sites of grace bonefires right outside the boss rooms. you can also fast travel to any of them right from the start of the game. being open world they have a lot of smaller side dungeons throughout that can be vested in 15 to 20 minutes but they also have those classic longer ones. it's more accessible than previous games but the combat is in line with previous entries and in my opinion it's more difficult. there is story but like all souls game it's not something presented to you on a silver after. everything has to be earned in souls games. people who look at dying in a souls game like a failure might have a hard time with this as dying is part of figuring out enemy and boss attack patterns. i will say that the pc version has some performance issues that need to be patched so my actual review is 9 out of 10 but i gave it a ten to try and balance out all the review bombers who gave up after an hour."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"one of the best games i played. amazing art, challenging, huge world with a lot of things to do. master piece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,input lag problem and input queue system in this game make game unplayable.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"enemies are invisible and its only a dot still after 2 weeks of its release. so people still say study their animation to defeat them, i really want to say how? its rendering the game not playable. and i ask for refund."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"its a great game, i love the open world and all the mysteries in the game. it has some preformance problems but the game is so good i forget about it after a couple of hours. hope they fiks the stutters soon"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"fantastic game. the world is gorgeously and purposefully designed on another level to any other game i've played. the combat has ds3 dna with some positive changes. if you like fromsoft games you will love this. some minor performances issues and lacking some settings for pc, ultrawide support and 60fps cap for example. these things do bother me but all things considered it's still an incredible game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"this game looks amazing, the graphics is okay but the art style makes the game looks really beautiful. the gameplay in a open world works well for a soulborne game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"i was thinking okay maybe fromsoft coming with a game for a wider audience will fix their hitbox circus and all the combat issues but no. theyll just convert everyone to weebs. it was nice in the begining im 200h in and i wont touch it again when i finish it. yea im bad at it but cheesing , relying on luck and rhytm games isnt difficult . its just for people who are willing to learn because they dont have anything better to learn . like i played it because it was the only game that seem good but i would recommend not to suffer through this . it was good in the beginning because of a few original tricks but after that it all becomes the same thing over and over but with more health and damage"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"after almost 140 hours of play and in the middle of ng, my verdict on the game. there are a lot of positive things, but also negative things. dark souls 4, oh i mean elden ring is one of the best games i've ever played. the game has a fantastic open world with a lot to discover. a very good story with multiple playable endings. the desire and motivation for a new game  is definitely there. as in all souls games, dying is part of the program and if you have a problem with demon's souls, dark souls and bloodborne, you probably won't like elden ring. the game is a bit more generous and beginnerfriendly, offers more to level but not easier in the end. now we come to the bad things. the performance of the game is catastrophic in certain places, fps drops to 5 and it's not my hardware, it's a problem that many have in the same places in the game. the game sometimes freezes for me or just closes instantly. i bought the retail launch version in an online shop, it was supposed to come with a steelbook and the preorder items. i wanted the steelbook and the goodies, the steelbook and the preorder bonus are missing and now i can't even upgrade to a deluxe version or i can buy the full game again for 79.99... that's really bad service. normally you can always upgrade the games to a better version. that makes me a little sad. in the end it will still be one of the best, most important games of our time, setting new standards."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"by far fromsoftwares best game yet, elden ring is a masterpiece on nearly all fronts, with only a few minor issues stopping it from getting a 10. if your a fan of these games, play elden ring now you will love it. it's the culmination of everything fromsoftware has done ever since 2009 with the release of demons souls. the openworld is surprisingly good, i was worried we'd be getting a super dead world with just fields of grass, and while that does occasionally happen, its usually quickly broken up by something that'll catch your interest, whether that be a castle in the distance, or massive tree, or one of the many dungeons. the dungeon system is a great way to split up the world and give you stuff to do, it's a welcome addition that adds so much more content. while they can occasionally be a bit repetitive and some of them are way too short, their for the most part well done. my only complaint would have to be the dungeon's reuse of bosses, once you've done a couple of these dungeons your likely to run into a boss that you've already fought once and likely more. this is likely my biggest issue with the game, bosses are reused so frequently that it becomes a joke after a while, even some bosses that are in the main story are reused as either another boss or a damn enemy type. it just comes off as really disappointing and lazy, especially when they can't even be bothered to change some of these reused bosses up in the slightest, one boss, in particular, is used over 10 times and is the exact same every single time. some may not consider it that big of a problem, but to me, as someone who considers the bosses to be one of the most important aspects of a fromsoftware game, it was really disappointing to see. thankfully the main story bosses make up for this issue and are all amazing, there wasn't a single one that i didn't like, and elden ring has by far the best bosses in the franchise when it comes to the main story alone. even fighting these guys in coop is lots of fun, their extremely well balanced and can actually be very challenging even with 3 other players. with the bosses being given a bunch more health, and actually switching targets from player to player, and using wide sweeping attacks to hit everyone on the field. and thankfully it's easier than ever to get into a world with 2 of your friends, as the item used for summoning is extremely easy to get using the new crafting system. the flowers used to craft it are everywhere and respawn, so if you ever run out, all you have to do is farm some flowers for about 5 minutes and your set. unfortunately, pvp is nowhere near as good or well thought out as coop was. when you're dueling a player whos using a fair build, then the 1v1's are extremely fun and intense but occasionally you'll run into someone using an extremely broken build that you can't do anything against. this is a problem i've only recently run into, so it could be patched soon, but this game's balance is currently a nightmare, there are insane oneshot builds, stunlock builds, or death blight builds that can literally kill you without the enemy even hitting you. hopefully, these issues get rebalanced soon, cause it is currently ruining pvp. the last thing i want to talk about is the technical issues this game has experienced, and yes, i've experienced them too, and it's very disappointing to see. fps drops and crashes are far too frequent and annoying, and while the fps drops do seem to have been patched, for the most part, the crashes have only seemed to increase. in the past week, i have crashed 5 times, during my initial playthrough which was 73 hours i had only crashed twice, now i have crashed 5 times in only 20 more hours. i do see these problems getting patched with time, similar to the fps drops, but it's still something worth mentioning. despite these issues, elden ring is fantastic, and while i would love to give it a 10, some of the problems hold it back. but don't let that deter you, i would still recommend this game, especially to diehards of the series or even just players who enjoyed one or two fromsoftware games. to someone who has never played any of these games, i'd still give it a try, it'll be very difficult at times, but doing side stuff, leveling up, or using summons will make things much easier. fromsoftwares masterpiece and an easy recommendation. full review up on my youtube channel kang fasho!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"i'm not gonna complain about the pc port, the game itself is a piece of  easy game with a lot of recycled bosses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"i have no idea what the other people reviewing this game are talking about. ive been extremely disappointed in the video game industry in general in the past few years. nowadays, games are made to please investors and make the most money with the smallest amount of time andor money possible i.e. cyberjunk 77, battlefield 2042, recent call of duty games. this game elden ring actually feels like the creators cared when they made it. it feels like a work of art with years of effort put into it. its engaging, challenging, beautiful, rewarding, and surprising. the only complaint i have is that combat is the main focus of the game and there is little content that doesnt force you into combat. this isnt a huge issue, however, because the combat is technical and interesting and the ai is extremely welltuned. theres no or very very little rest from combat in the form of minigames or sideactivities. this can become exhausting after a while. however, this game feels like games used to feel  it surprises frequently with hidden quests, bosses, items, and lore. the fps drops have only noticeably occurred during the first miniboss tree sentinel, but other than that i havent had any other noticeable fps drops, and my computer setup is mediocre, at best. do not listen to all the people complaining. the fps drops can be frustrating, but the game is highly entertaining and, to me, is worth playing regardless of the infrequent frame rate issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"elden ring brought a new set of challenges which i was not expecting and that is something i can appreciate as a souls fan. performance issues aside, the world of er is big and beautiful to explore. lots of cool bosses which can be borderline impossible but leave a great sense of accomplishment. wide variety of enemies and interesting areas spread throughout the game. for some of my less favorite aspects of the game, the crafting system is somewhat useless. i used it once to craft sleep arrows and that was for a very poorly designed boss which i won't mention here. the overengineering of some bossesmobs, which made strength builds nearly obsolete due to how little window there is to attack for the majority of bosses. overall, this is the hardest game i ever played which is something i can appreciate. starting ng and looking forward to playing this again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"soooooo many bugs, garbage ai, stupid horse, and story is hard to understand"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,if dark souls it's the best 3d metroidvania experience! elden ring is the best open world experience with strong metroidvania elements in key dungeons and even at some degree to the open world itself. the formula of ubisoft open world is a plague to the videogame industry and seeing fromsoft creating such a new and fresh take on the open world design is something that is amazing to see. i can only hope that other videogame studios that wants to create open world game will study elden ring design and take some inspirations for their futures games!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"despite the pc performance issues that undeniably exist, the game is different from other souls games, it has become an open world, with an exciting and really challenging adventure. the visual effects and soundtrack are wonderful the more i play the more i want to play. the more i discover, the more i want to explore this amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"el juego est muy bueno, graficamente el avance para un juego de fromsoftware y de mundo abierto es genial, y corre perfectamente en una 1050 despues de actualizar sus driver una maravilla"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"this is by far the best game i have played in a long while. sure, there are definite bugs in it that cause some creatures to not do what they are supposed to do, but if you ignore that and just concentrate on the game itself...  and to all the people complaining about pc issues, get a better pc, i had no issues with lag or framerate. the hitboxes are absolutely perfect.. if you know your weapons range, then you can predict and time all your hits. combat is amazing with the addition of the block counter way to go software!! the open world is so massive and it really touches the heart.. the difficulty is perfect.. not as hard as dark souls 2, but not so difficult that you can't beat the game. now for the cons.. the summons are way to powerful they need to be nerfed.. a single summon can defeat a boss alone without your assistance.. this should not happen. certain magic spells are overpowered and should be nerfed. quests should have more descriptive instructions. currently they are to vague. item locations should have more descriptive colors weapons 1 color, armor another... bla bla.. the map itself is hard to read and should be better descriptive on how to reach areas. every trinket should have it's own questline."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"awful overhyped game. i'm not familiar with the souls games but i saw this game get hyped up so i thought i'd pick it up. what a terrible mistake. i've got a 3080 and the frame rate issues are abyssmal. not to mention the stuttering, the texture pop ins and multiple crashes that deleted my saves. i would not recommend this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"just overhyped! the story has no sense, alloy is the most lame main character in this year, the dodging skill is useless, the arrow has not enough dmg, the melee fight is very good against nonrobot enemies but against robot the spear is useless and lastly, the levelbiom designes are bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"combat is totally irrational,more on luck than on skills ... sometimes with a weapon you can do damage from a great distance sometimes with the same weapon at close range you don't do any damage the same goes for attack through the shield ,,, sometimes it does damage sometimes it doesn't ,,, a fight made quite according to the template the story is too abstract and unrelated .... too much .... i'm at the beginning of the game, but it scares me that over time it becomes constant and boring..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"in this game, souls game features are fully utilized and  content of this game exceeded my expectations. although it is hard but it really is a good game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"elden ring is one of the best fromsoftware games. the good points to highlight are its graphic section along with gameplay and the wide variety of enemies and bosses throughout the map, but my only negative point is the drop in fps on pc, although the studio is already working on a solution to that problem."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"horrible performance, terribly boring. the world is empty and the combat is repetitive. don't be fooled into thinking this is another game like demon's souls, dark souls or bloodborne."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"possibly the best single player game ever made. if you don't play it you are missing out on a masterpiece, simple as that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"i have never reviewed a game in my life, had to create a metacritic account just to do so this game is just fantastic. the souls series might not be for everyone but it's very sad to see people giving this amazing game a 0 because they are unable to put in the time and effort to learn the game's mechanics. absolute masterpiece regardless. oh, and pc performance issues were fixed very soon after launch."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"after achieving a platinum in steam i can easily say that this is overall a good game but sometimes it's just too frustrating. i mean it's still definitely a dark souls game with all that positives and negatives which i personally like but with a giant open world. it is pretty obvious that this open world would be rather empty or full of reuses so from software chose the second option. i can't even tell you how many times i've killed that erdtree avatar or ulcerated tree spirit. for me this is too grindy. someone might say that cleaning the open world isn't necessary and that would mean that this person hasn't played the game at all. the very first story boss clearly tells you to go and clear a few dungeons and catacombs before you come to him. the next thing i don't really like is summons. you can literally just summon one thing on a boss and go have a cup of tea because this summon will just do everything by itself. personally, i didn't use that thing and it took me a long time to master some of the bosses, but my friend just finished them in one try using this thing. but like i said before, it's still a dark souls game that i love and i really enjoyed the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"this game is an open world souls game with an easier learning curve then previous entries. if you are thinking about getting into souls but the series look to hard, give hard elden ring a try. you are able to explore the world upgrade your character then fight the area boss when you choose to do so."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"it's 2022. it's stupid to keep a control scheme that physically makes dodge come out slower by few frames. it's stupid to set the horse reborn prompt at no. it's stupid to punish the player for beating a stronger boss early by giving smithing stones that aren't even usable until you go back into earlier areas to find other mines. it's stupid to throw the great combat mechanic out the window to just slap a bunch of lazy duo, trio bosses. with all that said, yeah it's a fun souls game. just saying it's a completely lazily created open world mess."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,really good game. pinnacle of the souls genre so far. just not for everyone. game could be better optimized but it runs well on my machine.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"elden ring is the last step from the yearly development of dark souls games, including bloodborne and sekiro. the map is heavily complex and with plenty of things to do. after my 24h first hours in game i am enjoying every part of the exploration, because it is rewarded with items, upgrades and things that will help me in further combats. the enemies are very different and the bosses are complex and unique. i play the pc version and it's optimization is pretty damn bad though, probably because of the easy anticheat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"this is literally the best game i have ever played,i love it thank you software for this game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,".glitches, crashes and frame drops all the time .server sudden disconnects can make all your effort go to waste due to the game quitting. .map about 25 inaccurate with the terrain .open areas full of nothing but monsters that barely defend themselves and the eventual big ones that 1 shot you even with high hp and level .the balance is by far the worst in the series, big field monsters and even some normal enemies hit and resist more than bosses .open world is only an excuse to get items for the crafting table that you will never use and join the dungeons the franchise always had, making it a useless addition that will be there only to waste your time tldr a big ugly son that only a fromsoftware shill would love."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"even with performance issues at launch i find this game to be amazing. my stuttering was fixed by leaving the task manager open in the background. this is probably due to not meeting the minimum cpu requirements but far exceeding the gpu ones. regarding the game, it is intentionally obscure with very little hand holding outside of the five minute tutorial dungeon. the world is dense enough that exploring is fun with many hidden little places to discover. quests are hidden away in the world and obscure enough that you can walk right by them if you aren't paying attention. the combat is deep and satisfying, it has built on every previous fromsoftware game and is as tight as ever. the game is much more accessible than any previous souls games and the difficulty is fairly smooth with only sharp spikes in and around major boss fights. this is my goty bar none."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"elden ring has an incredible number of fascinating locations to explore and cool enemies to fight. the developer studio has refined the precision of combat over their past five games, and it still feels so good to outmaneuver dangerous foes. the music and art direction are as beautiful and powerful as ever before. they really do most of the work to set the tone for an epic adventure with a dramatic finale. elden ring is more accessible than any dark souls game. example 1 stakes of marika allow players to revive closer to the boss arenas and get back to the action quicker. example 2 the mount in this game spawns out of thin air and moves through the open world faster than the normal movement speed. example 3 spirit ashes enable a variety of npc summons to be upgraded, and they make boss fights a lot easier. example 4 invasions only happen when you voluntarily interact with the online summons. they do not happen randomly in the open world. example 5 fast travel is more convenient than before. all of these qualityoflife improvements make elden ring more enjoyable for the average player by cutting out some of the tedium. however, not everyone has to play it. i think the developers of elden ring still want to target a semispecific audience. if you like franchises in the fantasy genre such as final fantasy, god of war, the elder scrolls, the lord of the rings, and a game of thrones, then you might have fun playing elden ring. be warned that people should not buy elden ring just based on the hype alone and expect to love it if they were never truly interested in the first place. dying often is a natural part of from software games, and it requires patience and perseverance to earn the euphoria of defeating a powerful boss. overcoming the difficulty and marveling at the visual effects provides an addicting feeling that keeps players coming back. the lack of certain features, like a pause function and a quest log, are only minor inconveniences in the grand scheme of the whole game. in fact, the game developers may have intended to promote more natural exploration through these design choices. and the map has just enough details to generate more curiosity without feeling like a burdensome checklist. players will spend less time looking at the menus and more time actually immersed in the world of the lands between. i think my friends could have a great time with elden ring if they persevere through the difficulty because the cooperative play with strangers has been a blast so far. visual stuttering can a serious issue, but it happens rarely. its effect on the gameplay is usually negligible. everyone seems to be experiencing different degrees of performance issues, regardless of the quality of their computers. my personal experience has no freezes and no crashes. please realize a high review score does not mean the game is perfect. a high score means that the person gave their highest recommendation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"i have no idea why elden ring has so many negative user reviews for pc. i hesitated buying the game because of all the negativity, but i'm so glad i decided to try it for myself. the game is objectively amazing  incredibly welldesigned gameplay and progression that enables users to find a playstyle to match the level of difficulty they want. the world is engaging, huge, intricate, and beautiful. this is my first soulslike game, and i found it to be approachable without feeling overwhelming. its design stands alone from almost all other openworld games, with minimal handholding in order to cultivate a feeling of mystery, intrigue, and danger. i'm finding myself engrossed in a way that reminds me of my time playing skyrim for the first time a decade ago albeit with much more dying, better rpg elements, better open world, better enemy variety, better challenges, and thinner story. the performance issues are way overblown. does it have occasional stuttering? yes. does it lack ultrawide support out of the box? yes. does either significantly detract from my enjoyment of the game? not at all. plus, there's already mods available to unlock framerate and add uw support, so i wouldn't base your decision on the overblown performance complaints you may have seen. overall it's at least a 910 for me. if they can optimize performance and find a way to improve fps  reduce stuttering, it probably deserves a 10."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,one of the best games ever released. open world and boss count is unreal. the boss fights are fair and gameplay is fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"the most original and exciting openworld game since breath of the wild. the world is vast and full of interesting things to find, the combat is deep and challenging and sometimes frustrating, but that's part of the fun! there's a ton of freedom to customize your character, and a huge variety of playstyles. it's not for everyone, and i know some people are having performance issues. for those who like a challenge and unguided exploration of a mysterious and dangerous world, there are few games like it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"i'm liking it as much as dark souls 3 but with better graphics, better combat, more freedom, a great setting and a lot of variety of enemies. the performance on pc in my case luckily is quite good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"best game i have played in a very very very long time. sure, performance isn't perfect, but plays better than most new games on my system considering the size of the game, it has the least amount of bugs i have seen in an new game in years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,game is just bad. outdated graphics. input delay from controls. and same old dodge dodge dodge hit battle system that takes you 1 hour to kill a boss. only people with too much time in their hands can play this. also story is so messed up you dont know what is happening most of the time. no journal to keep track of npc or quests. just bad
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"bei mir keine probleme auf dem pc. richtig gute bosse, coole kampfstille und ein unglaubliches open world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"this game could have been perfect. before i start i want to say that i have thousands of hours on fromsoft games and that they are my favorite games, and also that the 710 is score is not influenced by the bad pc performance, not in the slightest. all of my problems with this game arise from the place that matters.. design. i could write a 5000 word essay about the flaws of this game and everything that brings it down, but that's too much commitment for a single game especially after an 82 hour playthrough. i'm splitting this review into two parts, questing and bosses. in short the quests are random and there is no way for the player to tell what an npc wants them to do or where they might have headed to without looking online or asking around. i spend 3 hours looking for millencent's new location after i gave up and asked on reldenring. turns out she's supposed to be in the alteus plateau in erdtree gazing hill. how in the seven am i supposed to know that? same thing with ranni, i visited ranni's rise before killing radhan and she wasn't there so i assumed that's all what the area had to offer, which obviously, is not the case. it feels like a king's quest game more than a souls game. for the bosses, there isn't much to say. i can name 5 bosses that are probably the best boss fights of any game, period. however, it seems like fromsoft got lazy after making the first quarter of the game and started copy pasting bosses all around the world. often even repeating the ds2 sin where they end up putting two entirely different, independent and pretty tough previous bosses in the same nonoptional boss fight because? frankly this game has frustrated me to the point of which i can't even write a proper reviewrant it. i'm done with it and i don't think i'll ever be playing it again. tldr  sould you play it? yes. is it the most flawed fromsoft game? yes, unfortunately"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"pc issues aside, the game isnt that polished. there are real headscratching oversights in this game that make me wonder how anyone can try touting this as the best rpg of recent memory. unfortunately, the evertoxic souls community is clouding a pretty good game. i will say, what keeps me coming back, like any player, is that addictive style the souls games are famous for. little by little you get better, learn more, and then get destroyed by a boss. if you have an addictive personality or short temper, its probably better not to even start this."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"not ignoring performance issues, but this game is so good that it gets a 10 from me despite that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,i don't rly care about optimization... the game by itself is just to good. love every second of it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,i've never had so much fun for a quite some times now with video games. and then this game came out. i didn't expect much initially. i just bought it cuz i didn't really has any other games to play. but . i'm so surprised of how good this game is. i'm hooked. it is so unique from any othe open world games i've played. definitely a goty for me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"elden ring is another addition to from software's repertoire, breaking from the normal soulslike formula with a new and incredibly well crafted open world. the lands between beckons the player to explore, discover, and conquer an intricately crafted world filled to the brim with content. elden ring demands the player to find their own purpose, there is no quest log or markers, no arrow pointing you forward, just a simple guidance, a nudge, pointing you in the path one might take. this is elden ring's greatest strength, as a player just starting the game one can easily choose to go anywhere, and explore one of the most fantastical worlds yet seen. from the very start of the game, past the short tutorial section, the player has access to around 40 of the entire map, all without needing to fight a single enemy. and when i say 40 of the game, i do mean 40 of what took me, a soulslike veteran with years of experience, 80 hours of playtime and even then i was still unable to complete everything, missing a huge section of the map hidden right under my nose! however, it must be stated that, like how i introduced the game, elden ring is a soulslike first and foremost, this means crushing, if not brutal, difficulty. elden ring has no difficulty slider, instead there are many other options by which a player can make the game significantly easier. build variety and the usage of online play can make the difficulty spikes in the game simply melt before you, and with the new system of spirit summons even singleplayer, never seeing a second of online play, leaves you open to an effective and at times even stronger version of online summoning. elden ring is also open world, allowing the player to simply go a different path whenever they encounter a roadblock, leaving them time to get stronger and better prepared. there is never a time limit to these games, and with fasttravel readily available from the moment you step into limgrave you'll have plenty of opportunity to zip to and from places of interest. elden ring separates itself from most open world games with its dungeons, various dungeons litter the lands between, each being unique and difficult in their own right. of course, these are all preludes to the real meat and butter of from software's designs, the new legacy dungeons are back to form, with sprawling and mazelike complexity of the previous iterations of the souls series coming back in force, i spent around 7 hours in the first legacy dungeon, stormveil castle, and i later came to realize that it was possible to reach the final boss of the area in under 10 minutes of having entered! these huge sections of the map will challenge you just as much, if not even more, than the bosses themselves. online play has received a rather large rework, with the new incorporation of the furled finger allowing solo players to play online without any fears of getting invaded by players at least. the new coop rework allows for up to 2 other players to join you in jolly cooperation, however be warned, in summoning another player you are now susceptible to being invaded. and that brings us to the pvp scene, which is just dark souls 3 but without the twohit stun that were so common, and backstabs are all but gone as well. be warned however, no matter how strong you think you are, there is some invader out there who can and will trounce you. i unfortunately cannot discuss the performance issues this game suffers, as i experiences very few during my playtime myself. meeting all the recommended system requirements i only suffered frame rate loss between load zones or under some rare circumstances. so read up on some other reviews! it should also be noted that this game has received a large amount of review bombing, so shave off about 300400 of the negative reviews and you might get a more accurate descriptor of the user ratings. this is because of controversy over the incredibly success in sales elden ring has had compared to their rival horizon forbidden west releasing just a week before elden ring. to anyone reading this, please do not spread negative reviews without justification for either of these games. elden ring is open world dark souls, with an amazingly crafted open world design that is filled with over 80 hours of content and not some flimsy content fetch quests made to waste your time, but real engaging and unique content throughout the game. the game is difficult, and will challenge you, but with an open world design it is possible to simply travel elsewhere and better prepare oneself. accessibility has never been better for these games, with the new spirit summons being an incredibly powerful tool added to your arsenal. invasions and coop are now required to be activated by the player, so no need to stay offline to avoid those pesky invaders. i hope everyone reading has a good idea of elden ring, and why it's so highly rated. be seeing you in the lands between, fellow tarnished"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,this is an amazing game! i have no regrets buying this! other open world games should learn from elden ring!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"where can we give feedback on issue for quality of life improvements for elden ring on pc, the camera issues and target locking problems from making the mouse both of the analog control sticks, please this is driving a lot of us crazy with constant uncontrollable lock switching and more key binding options, like actually being able to bind maps to m ffs!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"1010 would buy again. this game grabs you buy the ears, and jabs its meaty man flesh right in. before you can take a breath you've been assaulted with fresh gameplay, and inundated with a newfound appreciation of life. from soft has once again fornicated with me until the point that i love them once more. thank you for this masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,this is the best game of the word.only have a little problems but i have 100 hours in game and i can't stop gaming.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"its awesome amazing flawless, until it trys to load a new material or spell effect and it stutters like a... insert derogatory thingu, and there is a capped fr and no ultrawide support thank god for flawless widescreen. fix these and easy goty."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"great game, great soulslike. one of the best open world structure on the market and an amazing exemple of storytelling. the feeling of combat is crude, fast and visceral. the color palette is finally brighter and landscape is cleaner, dotted with a multitude of places of interest. i still have to reach the end of  the travel, after about 80hrs, is already memorable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,honestly i never played a game so good. i still have the urge to explore the world. every cornor is unique and exciting. the boss fights are fun but the could be a bit more challenging for my taste. overall its a 1010 game. dont listen to the kevins out there. the game is awsome
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"run around killing or getting killed by everything you encounter in neverending hellish like depressing environments. no tactics, just move along until the next boss and spend endless pressing buttons to dodge, slash and hopefully survive and then repeat. supposedly you are to find some ring but i have no idea why i should care about that. it is really a very boring game. nice graphics despite the very gloomy surroundings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,same soul game as we seen before... just added open world... bloodborne was much better.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"honestly an overhyped rpg only because of it's developers reputation from the dark souls games. it got a good open world and interesting developments for your character but lacks a good story line which is the core of an rpg and the movement response is mediocre at best. you could say, it works as designed but for me it sounds like an excuse to make a combat response more accurate. also it's full of bugs  exploits, dunno where those rating coming from."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"please, do not listen to the resentful people who criticize this game because they are not able to pass the first zone of the game because it is too difficult or because the game has a fps pull every 7 hours. this game is a masterpiece regardless of whether you like it or not, just as you may not like classical music but no one would say that beethoven is overrated, the experience that elden ring offers you is simply spectacular. it has flaws like any game but the positive things it offers far outweigh the small flaws, spectacular atmosphere, unique scenario design, epic confrontations, just enjoy and stop insulting something you don't understand."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"fantastic game, probably one of the best entries in the series. however, because of the amount of exposure this game has gotten its received purchases from all over the gaming sphere, players from every type of background have gotten their hands on this game and it shows. well the game is challenging, it isn't impossible, and never tries to surprise you in the progression or game design of boss fights and so on. the problem seems to stem from players' ability to learn new tactics, read the menus and understand what they're capable of in gameplay. many don't want to take on these new challenges or learn new things so you end up with a user score like we have right now. i've seen so complaints they could simply be solved if people would just read and try to understand what they want to do with their builds. some of the cons in this game mostly are to due to their dx12 implementation on pc, the game struggles with shader buffers, and while you play for the first time, every time you encounter new textures and effects you have a change of stutters. these stutters can only happen once on the first time they're loaded so over longer play sessions you will experience them less and less. i'm inclined to believe this will be fixed, but it is frustrating to encounter this stuttering during boss fights. if you enjoy challenges and have a healthy ability to take a loss and improve the holes in your game, this game hands down is one of the best experiences you'll play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"not sure why pc players hate it so much, the 60fps caps is bad, but stable so you get used to it pretty quickly, with a couple of key rebinds it actually feels great to me. the attention to detail in the animations and the overall quality of the game are amazing, rarely you can find something this well polished form a gameplay point of view. i'm not a huge souls fan, but i really respect this game!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"great, stunning, awesome game in every way possible. but fix the god damn stuttery performance. once it will be patched i will properly rate this game again. edit 85 hours in, performance is much better now. best game i have played in the last 25 years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"i really wish i could give this game a positive review, that being said, the user experience is awful on pc. when you've died on horse combat for the millionth time because your game started chugging down to 5 fps, that creates a big issue for me. if you're going to play this, play it on console. i can't enjoy this game until the fps issue is fixed. this game relies on stability far too much."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"elden ring  um jogo superestimado, ele sim tem seus pontos positivos, porm os negativos me chamam muito mais ateno, a quantidade de recursos reciclados utilizados nesse jogo  assustadora para uma franquia nova. a questo aqui  que o jogo no apresenta na minha opinio, nenhuma grande inovao no mundo dos jogos. ele tem uma explorao cansativa, que no  motivante, muitas das vezes no te da nenhum item que tu realmente fique feliz em ter pego, os inimigos repetidos a todo canto e com move set ou aparncia reciclados faz com que eu sinta estar jogando os mesmos jogos que foram lanados j fazem 11 anos. ter bosses diferentes, ou bem detalhados eu no considero grandes pontos positivos, pois isso  o bsico, falar que esse jogo a vale o que  cobrado pra mim  piada, 97 de nota  piada, no adianta de nada ter uma baita histria genial, contada de uma maneira inovadora se a gameplay durante as 60 horas de jogo vo ser enjoativas. sem falar que a histria  mais do mesmo, esse jogo se resume a preguia. a dificuldade  o menor dos problemas, sendo que uma das maiores dificuldades que voc vai ter jogando isso  a cmera bugada em vrios momentos do jogo. em resumo ele  no  surpreendente."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"i actually own the game. i can't say this for people giving it a 010 because ther's no possible way it deserves that. must be people who rage quit and left a rager review because they decided having to actually play a game, is asking too much. i put 90 hours in my first playthrough alone, on pc. which to me, is rare. i did everything. if you really like souls games for their atmosphere, and their lack of hand holding, elden ring is a must play for you. story 710  it's basically the same concept as the other souls games, but the formula obviously works in this type of game. gameplay 910  the vast amount of enemies and weapons, spells, is just insane. there are hundreds, if not thousands of possible playstyles dependings on what you have equipped. graphics 810  not the best, but its still a gorgeous looking game with great design. evironment 1010  they really know how to build beautiful looking places, from snowy mountains, to rotting depths, to blood soaked ruins of a forgotten underground palace. dont even get me started on norkon. optimization 810  apparently people dont know that you can entirely fix the stuttering issues in the nvidia control panel and one click in windows settings. i guess it's easier to cry and moan about something than to actually find the fix for it and implement it yourself. i would like to see the 60 fps cap removed for people who want that option. i guess make it so you're offline without risking a ban? something official wouldbe nice. overall 810. it's a very good game that definitely doesnt deserve the low scores it's getting from accounts, who somehow only have 2 reviews on their profile, this and forbidden west. fishy. most of them also left a 0 score on every platform elden ring is on. definitely something weird going on there, as i doubt those people have played this game on 5 different platforms. great work from fromsoft. keep doing what youre doing and dont ever change to appease the baby crowd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,the fact this masterpiece of a video game has a 6.6 user rating shows how stupid people are.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"fromsoftware has done it again, great game with a beautiful world to explore, and do explore it, there are bosses in every nook and cranny to gain a wonderful experience and well experience form!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"first off, i see that many ppl had launch problems and i understand the frustrations. for me it was only issues with my xbone 1 controller, which i could fix in an hour with steam big picture. the game itself is best game i 've ever played hands down period. a huge interesting beautiful diverse open world, hard diverse bosses, build variety, interesting questlines and characters, perfected ds mechanics etc. most games even the best of em fall off hard towards the end, you can see this especially in open world games becoming more and more sparse. this game stays intense and suprises you at the same pace throughout the whole experience. just love it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"i really wanted to enjoy this more, but it plays and feels exactly like dark souls, and the same positives and negatives i have from those games carry over into this one. as for the features unique to this game, the open world is incredible and so much fun to explore, however it makes it difficult to want to go back through it all again for a second playthrough. there is an immense amount of bosses which makes exploration feel rewarding as it'll always lead to new equipmentspellsitems, but some of the dungeons get repetitive and some bosses just feel like slightly more difficult enemies. however, my biggest issue with the game is the awkward balancing. some bosses and areas in the game felt to me personally, substantially too easy, maybe because i accidentally overleveled myself by exploring more difficult areas first. it felt weird to oneshot many bosses, something i don't think i've done in any other fromsoft game. don't get me wrong this game is good, but it's still just dark souls at it's core. i wish it had more of its own identity like bloodborne or sekiro. it will always be a refreshing experience to play a game by fromsoft, their tailormade difficulty and priority on combat above all else is lacking from a lot of new releases. but i can't help but feel this is a step in the wrong direction. i'm still eager to see what they can come out with, but please no more dark souls, i expected something more unique."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,best game i've played in years. the game might have had a rocky start with performance but just a few studders here and there are not enough to stifel my enjoyment that i been having. from software have set a new bar for the quality of an open world with no micro transactions to be found.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,one of the best souls game ever played  map is insane also design is insane etc. just buy it already if u did not.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"small stutters and framerate issues were mostly fixed with the latest patch, but still persist in some cases. other than that the game is a masterpiece, taking everything fromsoftware learned from their previous titles and translating it perfectly into an open world. of course some bosses are copy pasted to some locations, but even then it feels rewarding to explore the vast open world. the main bosses are the best designed and likely hardest in the series excluding maybe some sekiro bosses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"my first soulslike and is great, you have to work for advance and is very rewarding. run well un mi gtx 1650 nobile, mostly 60 fps, textures in ultra and the other settings mislow"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,2012 graphics  you died  blind fanboi  best game ever ??? this is the most overrated game ever. if ubisoft or ea release this game it would be 710 or 810 maximum
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,no way to pause the game and eac forced in a singleplayer game. that is a refund from me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,absolutely the worst souls game ever made. have fun with unbalanced garbage as  end game and trash enemy designs that do nothing but spam attacks this game is for cheap trash uninstalled and refunded immediately  this trash game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"best game this year, and i have played them all, up to this point. the fact that it's actually a struggle to see every part of it is what makes it exciting, the secrecy, the boss fights, and the art style all together should make it into the game of the year. horizon like and assassins creed fans should just stay away. game performs good on ps4 pro, other people just straight hating."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"this game is a masterpiece and deservers the score. it's probably the best game i've ever played and i have already over 100 hours. the gameflow, gameplay, combat is perfection. they took the best from all souls games and created a magnum opus in terms of combat. the enemysbosses and areas are so amazing and detailed that i am still stunned when i look at it. cinematics are awesome too and it has so much good content, that it blew my mind. the quests and story is also wonderful and i was never more into a game as elden ring overall. definetely a 1010. now lets talk about the current controvery some game devs especially the sore loosers at ubisoft badmouthed this game with various untrue reasons like missing ui, bad graphics, overhyped by game critics and so on ,while being unable to make good games theirself. saddest part is, that some ubifanboys are reviewbombing this game and giving their favourite open world game perfect score. they usually copy ubisofts and over devs words and just add the bad performance part for pc, which mostly has been fixed for people above min. reqiurements. if you don't like it or even hate the game, i guess it's okay if you give like a 5. but it shouldn't be objectively possible to give below 5 because it's in every aspect amazing. now to all the fanboysclowns if you really hate it, it's okay. taste is objective. if you think the game is bad because of gameplay or graphics then you didn't know what game you bought in the first place and you are a fool. if the game doesn't run smoothly, next time read the system requirements, which they posted like 1 week even before release. if you cry about ui, lore or just copy the stupidfalse words from the devs, just go to your corner and play your easyboringbad microtransaction games with 800 questmarkerwaypoints on the map where you just follow a path like a bot without thinkingplaying yourself. if that's the case, you are the reason why gaming gets bad and gives money to those big triple a companys, who exploit clowns like you. if you want to fight me in an argument about this, just add me on steam or write me a comment there. can't wait how many clowns are going to write interesting stuff and white knight their favourite game in comparison to elden ring. idgamingpotato"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"the legend of zelda released in 1986, and served as a textbook in video game development. most developers have forgotten that charm that makes a game, however, fromsoftware has certainly charmed me with this game. i have played well over 140 hours of elden ring that itself shows how massive the world is. i don't intend to criticize certain reviews that i have read, but i can only define them as invalid scoring methodology. to properly score a game you must base it off your own experience, and understand the nature of the game. elden ring by nature is an exploration based open world. heck the back of the box clearly states that its exploration based open world. negative reviews that state the game is confusing, and difficult to get around is not a reason to place a negative mark on the game. the exploration is breathtaking, and always puts me on the edge. that feeling of adrenaline is all over the place. boss fights are challenging as expected from a souls game, but the amount of exploration will tip the scales in your favor. elden ring pushes players to gear, level and learn the mechanics of the game. most bosses are well designed, and game contains many secrets. negatives of the game definitely some framerate drops or crashing during launch for pc, but these things happen. that charm that captivated gamers in the legend of zelda was the sense of exploration. most games today hold your hand in the beginning, but elden ring plops you right in the world. i understand that most gamers are nurtured to start with receiving straight forward objectives, and having a game that puts you in the world with no objectives is overwhelming. elden ring purpose is to pique gamers' sense of curiosity. making gamers curious about the world and mechanics promotes higher level thinking. this is the reason why elden ring definitely is considered a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"almost just what i expected. instead of making something like bloodborne 2, a sequel to a game that many faithful players would be grateful for, the game developer suggested that their special ideas are much more interesting. i skipped sekiro because of boring samurai setting and no freedom of character choice and was impatiently waiting for another soulslike. here it is, i play the elden ring finally. and my feeling is so mixed. on one hand, i see a big and beautiful open world to explore. on the other, nothing could save me from feeling that the big and beautiful world of elden ring is empty and boring, despite the fact that some enemies and bosses are really tough to deal with. some locations are really fascinating and entering one of these can be breathtaking, but this illusion breaks when you meet another portion of enemies which are a total disapointment compared to the surrounding landscapes. you would just wish to pass them as fast as you can to see something else, something really intriguing, but mostly you find none but disappointments. for example, you make tremendously difficult jumps to enter a huge lonely standing tower to find out that it contains a couple of mobs, a lot of deadly traps, another sequence of jumps, a boring boss which is however difficult just due to millions of hp, and another artifact which you would never use in further gameplay because of its uselessness. you do not find any shortcuts to other locations from there, just dead ends. when you visit two or three such locations you just think  i would never visit this place if i play again. and in fact, most of these places dont worth revisiting in case of further replays. therefore, the need of the open world in this game is doubtful. i didnt yet try to play caster characters, however sword or axe movesets are not that diverse as it was in ds or bloodborne, and there is not much difference in using this or that weapon, each fight outcome just depends on your level or skill, thats all... it is not much fun anymore. there is some war ashes option available, however it requires fp, so it is not a variant if you like facerolling because then you would need maximum number of health potions. sometimes stealth mode or spirits you can call for support deliver some fun, but there are still no chances of stealth bowcrossbow oneshot which makes this weapon just as useless as it was in previous souls games. as of now i played over 70 hrs and yet did not finish the game, so it could potentially surprise me with something, but i doubt it so much. i think to pause for a while because i am really bored. however, i was expecting it, so it is not a complaint. these days all games are incredibly bad, and this game tries its best to be better, even if it fails"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,a fantastic adventure created by fromsoft! pc has some perfomance isssues but even with the stuttering its a masterpiece!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,i'm a shooter... first time playing soul games the game is difficult and the action is slow for the speed of the bosses i could not play with gamepad for some problems frames drop the difficulty of the game made me hate  made me  game world makes you depressed
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,crap on pc  deleted after 50 hours. i cant deal with pc ports and this is one of them. cant change mouse speed or key bindings. aiming in game is clunky as f.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,this is easily the best fromsoftware game out to date. it has quite a bit of performance issue but i've played cyberpunk 2077 on xbox one launch. this is not bad. so worried about the performance of the game you don't spend the time enjoying how everything looks and feels. i wish they'd pay me to write a review
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,its a great game marred by terrible performance issues. dont get this game unless you want to spend some time getting to learn things as it is weird and difficult.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"on pc i've had few of the problems, from my own looking into the problems it seems the problems are only with the highest end computers not the mid range computers like mine. on the game play it feels like a more refined and expanded dark souls 3, so for those familiar with from soft think better ds3 with a massive open world. for anyone not familiar with the games, this is a game that takes time and skills that you'll learn by playing, from boss moves and when to attack, rolljump to not get hit. when playing there's always a way to avoid damage but learning how to get around it will take time. that's to say the get good meme is actually the advice due to every playstyle being just as viable as each other, but ultimately elden ring just like the other soulsborn games they aren't easy games that everyone will be able to just pick up, but if you have the time and patience you can get good enough to go the whole game never taking damage at level 1."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this is one of the best games in a while. elden ring reminding my 20 year old self what i love about video games. with such much of these easy things being released, elden ring is a nice gift to humanity. it brings to life both an epic adventure full of life and horrors, and an amazing combat system that can be punishing if not taken the time to learn. i play on pc and love this game, while do not deny the criticism for better pc optimization, this is perhaps the best game sense the witcher 3."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"easily the best game i've ever played. the open world is vibrant, diverse, and full of places to explore, the combat is the souls formula at its peak, the story is intriguing as long as you're willing to pay attention to it. if you're a fan of from software's previous works, i don't doubt you'll quickly rank this game among the best."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,tirando a performace cagada e alguns bugs que no atrapalham muito. simplsmente goty.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,a masterpiece. dont listen to the horizon fanboys trying to bring the ratings down. i havent had this much fun in ages
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,first of if you turn dof and motion blur off you'll have zero issues with performance. haven't been this into a game in long long time. so much to do and explore. and even with no prior experience with fromsoft games i've been able to enjoy this game to the fullest in the 75 hrs i already have in this game. this game is just a masterpiece.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"the classic souls formula, but with more things to do and places to explore and a gigantic new open world. simply a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"never played a souls game before this. kind of hit a wall difficultywise after the first boss but exploring solved that issue mostly. i will say this is already forsure one of my favorite games of all time, at least top 3. it's a game the feels rewarding in its most fundamental gameplay loops and systems. hopefully, i can wrap up the second boss here shortly. 20 something hours in."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this game has consumed me ever since it came out. i have played 60 hours so far and still haven't explored everything or beat all of the bosses yet. i have noticed very minor performance issues, but overall the game has run smoothly for me and i am sure that from software will release patches to deal with the issues people are experiencing in the future. but even now, i don't think the performance issues are any where near as bad as what the negative reviews make them out to be. i highly recommend playing this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"it's appropriately difficult, open world, dark  gloomy and has a plethora of weapons, skills and classes to choose from. from my perspective, the multiplayer portion of the game is integrated in such a way that you never feel disconnected from the community, even if you're running solo. it's possible to summon friends to your world, leave messages for other players, and engage in pvp by invading another person world. my only gripes would be the lack of a free camera it auto resets itself, minor, but annoying, and far too many people are reporting performance inadequacies but these can be easily addressed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"poor performance  2010ish graphics, overall poor graphics as for 2022  cheap, sluggish animations  alot of reused modelstextures feels like its 2012 not 2022"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,the best game i have ever played. from soft really out did themselves. it excedrd every expectation.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this is my favorite game from fromsoft, after playing all of the dark souls entries, i find elden ring to be a culmination of everything that i like with open world elements. negative points pc performance and 60fps lock."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"there is no need to spend money on such a mediocre work. did the critics who gave the perfect score get a bribe? or are you not playing? i wanted to adventure the world with the soul series system. they advertised that it could be done with an open world system. i bought this, but it was a fraud. i continued to resist boredom and work feeling on the wide stage and cleared it, but i am desperate to say that it is disappointing. i didn't want to spend all my time in the fight. there are countless complaints, but i'd like to ask one question, why is it all attacking without warning? it was by the way, the score is only for the game system, the score is zero if you take into account the price and various underoptimizations.  i'm not an englishspeaking person, so please forgive me for my poor writing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"i never could get into fromsoft games before. tried dark souls 2 and 3 and wanted to throw my pc in the trash. elden ring? 1010 would die 30,000 times any day. are there problems? a couple i guess. i do get some stutters on my 1080tiryzen 3600 but they are few and far between. frame rate locked at 60  but i've got the graphics settings maxed with no issue. the game is beautiful. are the graphics mind blowing? no, but everything is very well done. a great game that i've been playing non stop since release. don't believe the brigade."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"one of the best games ive ever played. and im gaming since atari 800xlc64 times. the world is so amazing, with so much fredom, that i have to think a long time to find another game that lets one that many choices what to do first. cant beat boss xy? just go to zy. cant beat zy, just go to yz. cant do yz, just do thing zz. every corner of the immense world is full of secrets and content. even after reading 10 guides one still will find secrets on his own, if looking for them, trying out things etc. controls are like always in souls games, spot on. one can count beats and it will fit, if the refresh rate is constant. bosses always give that immense feling of accomplishment, even if not that hard as in other souls games. the choosable difficulty of them makes this a perfect example how a soulsbourne has to be, playable by everyone who invests time into the game. everyone can choose how hard he wants it to have, by either just following the line or by roaming the world, doing it all before going to the hard bosses. technically i dont have the issues others have, so i cannot rate it down. after the latest patch the game runs on vsync 60 fps on maximum, if i let the first few minutes after loading in out of the calculation. its very fluid 9900k, rtx 2080, 32gb, win 10, wqhd. many nice features make this souls for my personal taste the best one. the open world, the horse and the ability to jup improve it by a ton. i dont understand why ppl rate it low, honestly, im afraid they are the ones rating everything down. for me its among the best games of the last years, maybe even for overall. its amazing and i cant stop it once ive started. if i would have 1 wish for something to be added, i would choose a bit more story. in form of cutscenes or whatever. i know there is lots of lore etc but sometimes i wish there would be a bit more."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"had to make an account for this after seeing how its score doesn't reflect the game's beauty at all. i've had an amazing experience so far bosses are amazing, the open world is fresh and dense. the legacy dungeons feel interconnected, they're large and hide layers upon layers of secrets and pathways. and how can i not mention the gamepl?ay"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,this game is still unplayable to me after 2 weeks of waiting for them to patch an invis glitch that should not have been in the game after 2 delays and testing phases its sickening that think that thousands might have to wait months for from soft to patch their game im never going to buy a pc port from this company ever again and now i understand completely the reason why people didnt get dark souls remastered on pc along with why bloodborne hasnt been ported
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"masterpiece, butthurt forbidden west trannies forever and ever blown the  out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"as a massive fan of from soft games i am more than happy to say that in my opinion this is the best from soft has released. its easy to tell how much time and focus has been put into this game by the developers and its paid off. the open world is beautiful and the gameplay and mechanics are just as smooth and in depth as previous from soft games. if you like dark souls then this is a must play, if you don't like dark souls then unfortunately this isn't the game for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,literally the best game ive ever had the pleasure of playing. its unlike any game ive ever played. you should definitely check it out!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"my only complaint is a little bit of stuttering on pc  no 219 support. other than that it's a great game, once in a decade release."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"i have to say that this is a really good game overall, but it's a very bad soulslike game, and as a longtime fromsoft fan, i expected a soulslike rather than a traditional open world rpg, which is the reason for my low score. the bad fromsoft made the game more accessible, but that killed what made their previous games memorable. the adrenaline rush you felt after killing harder bossesmini bosses and overcoming challenges was amazing. but in elden ring i felt no such accomplishment at all, i didn't feel challenged at all. no boss or miniboss took me more than 5 tries, and i did not use summon nor sorcerer builds. of course the game could've been challenging, if i level up less, upgrade my weapons less, don't use ashes of war but... if i have to actively avoid using the games mechanics to make the game challenging then that is just simply bad design. previous fromsoft games had a natural progression to them, unless you went out of your way to farm you did not overlevel. also there were quite a few bosses in ds3 that had high magic res and gave mages a tough time to balance things out, er does not have such things. there are some other minor issues as well, lot's of overused minibosses, repetitive catacombs, mounted combat is boring. bosses are not fun, all the delayed attacks ruin the flow of the fights that ds3sekirobloodborne had. lot's of downtine between action, not so action packed as previous titles. the good visually amazing world, combat is improved, ashes of wars and spells are fun to use, boss mechanics and visuals are also really cool. overall imo they should've sticked to the non open world format, the open world hurt the game more than it added, but it could be fixed with some balancingtuning. multiply the healthbar of every enemy by 1.52x, i think that's easier to do than nerfing everything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"while there certainly are legitimate criticisms that can be leveled and will hopefully be addressed in the future, this game is by far a class of it's own. mixing open world exploration and discovery with the soulsborne series combat mechanics that have garnered a reputation of its own, and an artstyle that leaves one completely stunned, this game is by far goty. i wish i could go on, however i encourage you to discover for yourself just how incredible this game is. i would definitely say this game reminds me of my first time playing skyrim, and just how wonderful and fantastic the world is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,i have no issues on pc. everythings works smoothly. not gonna lie. this is one of my most favourite games ever. the dark souls mechanics were meant to go open world. thanks from software.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"best open world, maby ever. pretty dificult. graphic is very good but optimalization ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"after spending 80 hours in this game, there are many things i have noticed it choses not to do, and in the process makes the game more enjoyable because of this. this is a great intro to the souls genre that deconstructs the openworld genre and asks the question is this really necessary for gameplay, or does this ruin the experience by design? by taking a minimalistic approach to assisting the player, the game gives you the agency to make any choice and explore any path. however, the game also provides guiding grace to give you direction if you chose to play the game in a linear fashion. this separation of exploration and objective is fundamental to open world games and yet so many restrict large amounts of exploration behind multiple meaningless objectives, gates, or levels which hinder player immersion. instead, by nudging the player through difficulty and death, you learn how to experience the game and succeed, and that's why i enjoy this game. that is to say it is not without it's flaws it makes the assumption you have played video games and understand how gameplay in a exploration game works. it makes the assumption human stubbornness is limited and that players will make the objectively better choice to explore and return rather than continue and become frustrated. the lore can sometimes be limited and only explained through items, though depending on who you ask the mystery is half of the enjoyment. some critical npcs that can make the game much easier are just randomly hidden away, for you to find in the first area spirit summoning, ashes of war seller. this makes melee gameplay harder if you miss them. spellcasters and prayer teachers are much more abundant and ends up leading to a playstyle where going purely with combat leads to more unintended difficulty than being a little bit of both blade and spellprayer. skills ashes of war do a decent job offsetting this issue, but they are not easily acquired though are great after acquiring. it also is not well optimized for pc, dropping frames when loading between areas and during some sequences. visually it is semidated, but its scenery and framing make the world look like so much more than it is, you hardly ever end up noticing the fine details due to to gorgeous views and sprawling architecture, all of which, yes, you can get there, yes, you can explore. the vertical enormity of the game makes its smaller overall map feel massive and full of places to explore. best of all, not being able to climb restricts you but also motivates you to reach places you have yet to explore. i have stopped for many moments just to take in the view and appreciate the world i am exploring. gorgeous view ahead indeed! overall i give this game a 9.510 for its excellent gameplay and the overall experience. i loved every moment i had with it, and can easily see myself replaying it on new game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"amazing game , breath taking every inch of it , really don't need to say much , play it , if you liked it you will be in a amazing journey"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"1010 masterpiece, the best of the best, play it, this game redefines what an open world should be, it takes everything from previous fromsoftware titles improves on it and places you in the best open world ever created to date, no other game compares, it makes you want to keep exploring the more you discover and rewards you like no other game when you do so, it keeps the high difficulty and challenge all veteran players want while still being accessible to new people, i cant think of a better game than this one, this game will remain as a cornerstone of gaming it truly took the bar of what an open world game should be and rose it above everything ever before."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,such a great game! having played through ds3 a few times i did not expect this game to pop off how it has
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,i haven't stopped playing since this game came out. best souls game to date
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,elden ring is the best open world i ever seen before you cant feel boring when u open new area or something like that in other games and the art design is so amazing every time u shocked and the bosses and enemies are the best about ever you seen in video games history!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"after spending the pandemic completing the souls series, including demon's souls ps5, sekiro, and still playing dark souls iii this is the first i have played from day 1 with only myself and a friend as a guide for what to do. on the first night i beat a boss that to this day less than 50 of users have beaten, and it feels good. i will more than likely put another 70 hours into 100ing this masterpiece, and hundreds more into the pvp. occasional frame issues on day one no longer happen after setting nvidia settings to high performance and vsync to on beats esv and any other rpg you throw at it. an instant classic that totally changes up the way open world games should be. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this game is in my top 5 of all time. i had some problems with joystick connection at the beginning but everything works after that. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is awesome, the history is awesome and the world is unique."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"an absolute masterpiece! from did it again and managed to pull out a game that is equally appealing to both a brand new playerbase and the old souls games vets. it may become a bit too hard for new players that are not familiar with the souls games mechanics, but there are big improvements to the multiplayer system that support newbies. this is not a story driven game that will hand hold you and point out what you need to do next along the way. it's a personal journey that you dive in and nothing compares to the first playthrough  souls game. just take it slow and enjoy  1010 would recommend the pain and gratification after! ps there were some minor issues with the pc version on launch day, but those were addressed by the devs promptly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"psima optimizacin, pero aun asi personalmente puede disfrutar el juego, un mundo abierto donde puedes explorar muchsimo, muchos bosses en el mundo abierto e infinidades de mazmorras, dificultad exigente pero no injusta a mi parecer, es cierto que los grficos son basicamente de la generacin anterior, no digo que los grficos no importen en un juego, si influyen pero mucho ms importante para mi es el apartado artstico y diseo del mapa, y en eso este juego es un 10 a mi parecer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this is my response to people who say well other than the pc performance the game is stellar! ffs reviews should be about the game as it is not potential improvements. don't you realize this is the same thing ea did with anthem and cdpr with cyberpunk????? i love from software. i've been playing elden ring for 12 hour streaks on my days off, sometimes even more. but you cannot just casually say the only blemish in an otherwise stellar game about performance. you have no idea how flipping annoying and immersion breaking this game is when it trips over fps. i have adhd and i can hyper concentrate on details like that, and although i love the game, it makes me so mad at miyazaki every time i mount my horse and my fps goes from a solid 60 to 33. on a ryzen 9 and 2060 setup on 1080. i can run games like this on 2 monitors with max settings and get over 60 steady. there is absolutely no reason why fromsoft can keep doing this to the pc community. dark souls remastered was next to unplayable for me. sorry for the rant, but crap like once it gets fixed it'll be all right you'll see! does not help. i expect this problem not to even be here in the first place. you're pissing in my face and telling me it'll be all right once i'm done! i'm pissed i preordered it but at the same time i'm a masochist so i'll keep off the horse as much as possible and try to get 60 out of a what feels like 15 sale game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"bom, well, good, fine, bien, bene, godt, b, b, hyvin, , , , , , ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,i don't put a 1010 because after 30 hours of gaming and fighting the story is missing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"this game is one of the most highlyanticipated games in recent memory, and it certainly lives up to expectations. i'll keep it short and simple. i am 20 hours in and could not be happier with this game. pros  visually impressive. i don't think this game has stateoftheart graphics, but that isn't really something i care about. the graphics are solid, the world is beautiful, and the art direction is phenomenal  combat is fun and engaging. like previous fromsoft games, the combat is a highpoint. git gud.  exploration is risky but rewarding. i am thrilled with their addition of dungeons and crafting. there are interesting storylines, secrets, and puzzles all around you just have to look.  difficulty is present and the game is better for it. this game pushes its players to be better and smarter. this is something rare but deeply appreciated in today's videogame market. i applaud fromsoft for not trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. cons  some performance issues initially. they were never that bad for me, though. i know that other pc users struggled, but all i experienced were some occasional slowdowns and framerate drops. following the most recent update, it runs flawlessly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,goty 2022 worthy. my first souls game but definetely not the last. this game reminds me of old games that use to be challenging. the design is epic and the amount of things to do is endless. i am addicted.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"jogo incrivel, apesar de ter alguns bugshoje em dia 99 dos jogos tem mais j tinha um tempo que no jogava um jogo que queria ficar horas e horas sem ver o tempo passando, varios cenarios e varios personagens incriveis"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"no he tenido problemas con el juego ms que un par de drops de fps, es entendible por los diferentes hardware que tiene la pc no es como consola que ya es un hardware fijo. muy aparte es un primer juego para fs en directx 12. ms all de todo es un hermoso juego, es mi primer juego de este tipo de gnero soul y me gust, lo compr porque est en mundo abierto, que es lo que al final me llamo la atencin para comprar un soul."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"the game is very good, faithful to the souls style, it is different from the rest of the games i am used to and i think that is the cause of so many bad comments, but let me tell you that the game is great, it's captivating, fun, it makes you think, explore and improve. it has much to discover and explore, people today are used to being told everything and being led everywhere by the hand. in this game you have to investigate, be cunning, have patience and be creative. i really liked it, i play it nonstop since it came out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"bad pc port, bad quest designs and a lot of copy paste dungeons. overall the game is good, good open world and fun to play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"was waiting on a patch to leave my review, on my lowish end hardware gtx 1650 the game now runs flawlesly and ive been having a great time. the game is a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"very fun and addicting game. i did have stuttering in the beginning, but in the later areas or due to the patches i don't notice it anymore. this is my first souls game and i didn't know they were this addictive. is it hard? well, yes, in the sense that it punishes a lack of patients and panic. at some point you just get the fights and the moment that it clicks the bosses don't seem that menacing. but the best part is that you get to go on an adventure and just explore and be fully immersed in the world. it's great for payers that try to avoid the main quest at all cost and do other stuff first. after many hours, i'm at the golden city and the only really frustrating boss was the crucible knight an optional side boss that doesn't even drop anything i can use."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"elden ring is a masterpiece, this game is absolutely amazing. the open world is beautiful with loads of secrets to find and nooks to explore. with about 200 hours of play currently, lag and stutter issues were extremely rare. i 100 recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played souls before. but this game really need a quest journal. because it's impossible to keep everything in your mind. pc spec r5 260032gb 3200gtx 1080 spec is pretty weak for 2022 imho resolution 1080p. graphics preset maximum. performance 60 fps with drops to 40 fps in random places and at nonobvious actions. game installed on hdd, i think this partly explains the lags, but loading is between tp fairly fast."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"i'v played 120 hours of elden ring and this game is truly amazing and awesome the level of exploration is truly solid the animation are well made , the story is quite abstract which is great and gives the sense of imagination game is artistically excellent how the weather behaves the way lightning works it is truly outstanding experience almost everything you see in map or specific area is reachable which gives the world disturbing sense of connectivity, the quests are vague which is good there is uncertainty in how the npc behave it feels like each one has his own destiny and they are not related for your cause in anyway either buying completing their quest line etc , the game feels like puzzle and your brain is constantly working , one thing is the enemy repetition they did their best so you cannot over feel it even if you might see other attack move sets still  was bit noticeable , keep in mind these games are hard to make they came from people hwo are passioned about what they do and they are not milking us to buy game content, it's truly shame to see all these negative reviews sadly this is what has the gaming industry come to we embrace low effort and p2w games and we trash the one hwo stick to their own roots , quality , fun , enjoyment , and learning scores graphics  8.5  10 music  9.5  10 world world design 9 10 exploration level  9.510 charactersenemies design  8.7  10 story  8  10"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"elden ring end game is very unbalanced. there is no git gud in it. it's just cheese or get ohkoed. i already said it many times elden ring is a amalgamation of all fromsoft titles but the combat the players have access to remains exactly same dark soul combat. so you will face bossesenemies having high poise and health bar of dark souls, relentlessness and unpredictable behavior of blood borne and extremely long combos of sekiro. it's just not fun. i feel like i am fighting nioh bosses with souls combat. i would rate elden ring 1010 for world building and atmosphere but end game is not fun and by end game i mean at least 40 of the remaining content."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,i absolutely love this game i came into this new not knowing what i was going to get myself into but after playing it for almost 50 hours i can 100 say the game is an absolute masterpiece and when it comes to performance issues i haven't noticed any or experienced any so yeah play it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"this is a great game, it has a beautifully crafted world, an very interesting lore, awesome classic fromsoft combat mechanics, that being said. it has som issues, but nothing too heavy in my experience, is a very decent launch for what things are today though, very very very good game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"first time i've ever cared to review a game because this game is simply a masterpiece. yes there are some framerate issues on the pc, but even with it's few flaws this game keeps making me ask the question, is this the best game of all time? i'm about 40 hours in so i won't say it is or isn't until i've completed it. it definitely is top 5 for me already."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"why did i get trolled into thinking yet another souls game wouldn't be complete and utter trash? the open world aspect combined with grrm supposedly writing the story  me in. oh how trolled i am yet again. story? story?! it's the same nonstory all these crap games have. what the hell was grmm needed for? there is no story as per usual. open world? no more or less than the other titles were. you're still gear gated into linearity, except now you just have more ways to screw yourself beyond repair and have to just start a new save if you get stuck early in an area such as the the poisonous swamp from a treasure portal. i have a newsflash for all the fanboys of these crap games it is in fact not good game design to have an area near the starting area, with the lowest tier enemies, get trolled into opening a treasure chest, have it teleport you to an area that you cannot teleport out of, yes even the first campfire near that area cannot be teleported out of, so if you have no gear, no horse, well you just need to start a new save now. cool great design. they really respect the player's time with this crap. also i know this genius mechanic i'm next going to talk about is present in all soulscrap games, but how in the world is it good design to just permanently lose all your experiencegold if you die and can't get back to your death spot? that isn't fun, it only angers you, depresses you, and wastes your time. i'd be halfway fine with having to fight the same enemies over and over again, but when you have the added bs of just losing all of your experience it just isn't good game design. period. and you're wrong if you think otherwise, objectively wrong. have fun torturing yourself with yet another awful installment with this franchise. if you didn't like the games before  trust me you won't like em now, even w grrm's name sleezily stamped all over it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"absolutely amazing game. would recommend to anyone any day, definitely game of the year, perhaps even top 10 best games of all time so far? the fact that people who never even read up on fromsoftwares games and instead of bothering to learn the game they get salty, rage quit, and review bomb it to make themselves feel better and make it seem like its the games fault is honestly kind of upsetting but i'm sure they will come around to their senses."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"the culmination of all the souls games thus far. takes the best of each and polishes it. one of the best open worlds i've ever played through despite the developer's lack of experience with such. never experienced the alleged performance issues, playing with an nvidia 1080. it has removed a great deal of the tedious grinds experienced in bloodborne, smoothed out the alternative playstyles of dark souls 3, and fully integrated the new systems introduced in sekiro, making it into one of the smoothest experiences i have ever had, without compromising on the challenge. amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"i was sceptical but they did it. will list rational procontra eventually still playing atm, might be the first 100 after dark souls 1 i attempted in the whole souls franchise"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"let's start for de beginning, the game is a dark souls 4, the history resembles dark souls 1, a ring shatter is like the flame. the tarnished is like the guy with the fourth flame. the grafics is amezing even in the low settings and bla bla bla. gameplay , it's literally just difficult fight, nothing else, none sidequest remarcable. the map is big which can look really cool at the start. but even the boss look the same. there is litteraly 6 or 7 enemy who is a knight. the gradon the same the only difference is the element of them. and the map has not much to offer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"overhyped garbage ps3 level graphics with horrendous performance on high end hardware. terrible stutters and framedrops. the game itself is boring and bland.. terrible gaming mechanics. there is no way to keep track of what you are doing and what you have done. morbid, garish art. a non existent story, there's nothing compelling or engaging about any of it.. gameplay itself is a horrendous grind fest, a mindless slog and rewardless gitguddery. the open world is graphically substandard think software from 2013, utterly lifeless and uninteresting with often reused enemies and terrible dungeon design. the ui is pure horror, game is massively unfun, and terribly ported. it's dark souls in an open field with a huge glowing tree in the middle  the open world is really just enclosed areas with individual sections, with weird creatures all just waiting until you get within range. there is no ai, just animals and enemies scattered about the landscape, step inside their attack radius, they come at you, step outside it, they stop. skyrim's ai was better, and that game is 11 years old."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"another overhyped triple a release that fanboys will inevitably defend no matter how many obvious flaws that are staring them in the face so disregard any 9 or 10 reviews. its pretty obvious at this point that this game is not even close to the masterpiece that critics and fanboys are claiming it is. i swear the term masterpiece gets tossed around so casually these days that its become irrelevant along with mainstream video game journalism. i truly cannot comprehend how you can look past all the performance issuesreused assets and then call this a good game. the open world is easily the most glaring flaw because its so empty and generic. unlike games like botw or witcher 3 there aren't many ways you can interact with the environment outside of picking up useless crafting materials. the optional dungeons are essentially chalice dungeons from bloodborne except with more copy and paste boss designs and rewards that make going through them seem like a waste of timespoiler, they are. for all the fuss about grr martin being the writer there is very little payoff. i was hoping he would give a more solid narrative other than the usual endless stream of item descriptions that are beyond overplayed at this point but i guess i expected too much from what everyone is calling a masterpiece. the combat isyou guessed it more of the same. the only difference is that there is a jump button which has very little impact on what you do when fighting, you'll still be dodging, hitting, and then chugging estus in between. anyone claiming this is good combat needs to be reminded how many souls games there have been and how it isn't impressive anymore. as a veteran i expected much more from the combat but hey, masterpiece amiright? the npc's are just as generic as the world they inhabit. the moment i encountered a talking jar was the point where i knew all semblance of immersion had been tossed out the window. no longer is there any coherence between what they are doing vs what you're doing in the world, now its just wacky nonsense. as a souls veteran i'm pretty disgusted with the praise elden ring has received. it does nothing better than the original dark souls or demons souls so putting it on a pedestal just shows how easily reviews can be bought and fool casuals. i use this game as a litmus test to see how easily fooled someone is by video game hype, disregard any positive opinion on this game as market brainwashing, because that's all it usually is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"if you liked any of the fromsoft games starting with demon's souls you'll love it. if you didn't, then perhaps elden ring is not for you. while it is more forgiving than some of fs's previous titles, it's still a souls game... be ready to spend hours trying to figure out enemy's movement patterns and die a lot. if this does not sound appealing then again, this game is not for you. what differs it from previous games is the world, which is not only open but manages to avoid the ubisoft formula. there are very few icons on the world map marking locations, and they only pop up once a location is discovered. there is no filler in the shape of findallflags or collectalllogs and so on. there are no objective markers, a journal, quest log, character dossiers, collectibles etc. you are expected to pay attention to what npc's are asking you to do, often indirectly and often in passing. i found this refreshing, as most games these days seem to be going out of their way to force you to experience everything they have to ofter, and they will remind you of the things you haven't, every time you open a map. when you discover a new location in er, it's your discovery, rather than an inevitable stop on a theme park ride prepared by the devs. i liked it, would recomend it to a friend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,this game need dx11 api and dx12 put in the back burner cause its still in alpha. the game also needs a diffcult slider so the casual none sweaty gamers can still have fun. many players have not played a darksouls game starting in this game. the game crashes 2 to about 6 times in a 24 hour period. needs mod support! if change will change the review. the game is not good without a easy difficulty!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,i'm running the game on a 1660 ti with mostly smooth gameplay. i'm sure the performance issues will be patched for others soon. as for the game in itself? simply beautiful. after creating a second character i managed to find much more of the story content  npc interactions which enriched my playthrough. i recommend buying information notes from the vendor in the game because it'll cue you in on some of the underlying richness of this world. the game is hard but the world provides many avenues for players to progress. after 50 hours in the game irate this game 9.510. taking off points for some over used enemies like the dragons and charging boar thing....
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"how fromsoft can't do a proper pc port after 3 souls game and sekiro is one of the great mysteries of this world. even though i can see that the game is good from my playtime so far, how can i give this more than a 5 when i'm getting killed because i can't see wtf is happening during some battles? and no it's not a git good problem, i've finished all dark souls games and sekiro, it's an optimization problem and fromsoft clearly not giving a  about pc gamers. the only 2 games where my pc started farting furiously as soon as they loaded are cyberpunk 2077 and elden ring and if you've heard anything about cyberpunk that alone says a lot. even with all options turned down to the lowest possible i get 2040 fps on 1080p in open world and these drop even more on boss fights. not to mention the occasional stuttering which sometimes turns into death warrant. it's shameful asking full price for a game at this state and even releasing it at this state in the first place. have we all just accepted that we'll be beta testing games from now on?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"it's a new fromsoftware game, but now without shackles to hold it down. the game is amazing, i'm 70 hours in and the game just won't stop amazing me. it's so much happening, there are so many weapons, the addition of ash of war just makes the combat so much dipper, the boss fights... don't even get me started on that. i've beaten the main boss in the calid region, and boy oh boy... what a boss fight. i don't wanna spoil it but that was just the most fun battle i've had in video games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"how can a game released in 2022 be this bad of a port onto the pc? if you cannot support comfortable and intuitive keyboard and mouse controls then at least make every control remappable. the graphics and gameplay were ok, but not enough to excuse the stuttering and clipping issues on a pc that can run other new titles at max settings. however, the lack of keyboard and mouse controls were the deal breaker. uninstalled and got my steam refund."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,game of the year for sure i haveing a hard time on pc with keyboard tho but its still fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"a must play. do yourself a favor and dont listen to the negative reviews from maidenless gamers who have been conditioned to need easy games, hand holding, and no thought. this game is not that. most the the negative comments are explained by lack of attention to detail. there is literally a tutorial 10 minutes into the game. there is a rich story. there is a rich and beautiful environment full of life. the game has built on the successful gameplay and atmosphere from previous titles. get the game, take it slow, learn, pay attention and thank me later."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"i have never played a from software game before elden ring. it took me a while to get used to the gameplay and questing. after playing for about 30ish hours of game time i absolutely love this game. the open world, the graphics, the combat system it's all amazing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"the game is a masterpiece, and this review is directed towards people who are interested but hesitant because of the negative reviews. while i have experienced, some performance hiccups, they did not detract from my experience playing the game. i do not believe that they will remain in the game given some patchwork. if you have bought the game and have issues with performance, i can understand being disappointed, but i urge you to get a refund and withhold judgment on it. come back at a later time, because this is going to be a timeless masterpiece and it would be a shame to not experience it in it's fullest. games are very complicated and pretty much impossible to get running perfectly for everyone, but given time i believe they will get the game running much better for people who at least have the required hardware or better. this belief is based on fromsoft's previous track record of having initial difficulty with pc ports and the sheer amount of effort clearly put into this game. they clearly care. i don't believe the game deserves criticism for how it presents its story, or difficulty. nor do i believe it deserves criticism for not having the highest fidelity graphics. this is not the game for you if you are looking for a game that has a lot of story to ingest, or doesn't require much of the player in general. there is nothing wrong with that, people are allowed to have their own interests, but that does not make the game a bad game. if you are interested in the visuals i would argue that, despite not being the most realistic or being the highest fidelity, elden ring has presented me with some of the most, if not the absolute most, awe inspiring vistas and visuals i have ever seen in a game. i would also argue that elden ring is a game that prioritizes gameplay as i believe all games should but that is my opinion, and if you believe that it shouldn't maybe it isn't the game for you, but that doesn't make it a bad game for it's target audience. as for people struggling with the difficulty, contrary to what a lot of people think the intention behind the game isn't explicitly to be difficult, but rather to present a meaningful challenge that is rewarding to overcome. it is about learning and thinking outside the box. there are plenty of ways to make encounters more manageable, they are however left for the players to figure out. being hard doesn't make the game bad. this game is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever, but it's not for everyone. that said not every game needs to be for everyone. i recommend the game, but i also recommend getting a friend to let you try it first if you are unsure. games are about entertainment so find a game you enjoy and don't be mad at people for liking a game that isn't made for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,fromsoftware did it again!! 16gb of ram and 1050 ti without any performace problems flawless game gitgud
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"it's a beautiful game with a lot going for it, but it's simply too hard to be enjoyable. i wish your character was more agile around the world. for being an openworld game, it sure limits where you can go. rocks that any physically capable human could climb are impossible to climb over."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"no direction or instruction, terrible ui, gameplay is bland with terrible hitboxes player and npc and doesnt ever get fun. not fun at level 10 and not fun at level 50. super disappointed..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"the pc launch was rocky for a couple days. i experienced lots of performance drops. however, with the recent radeon drivers and updates, the game rarely dips on a ryzen 3600 and 6700 xt. the environments are better than any fantasy rpg that has been released to this point. many of the vistas are like looking at a painting. this is highlighted by many of the in game paintings of the vistas in artist shacks. the artwork is fantastic, beyond anything other companies have attempted to do to this point. from software has mainly focused on decaying or dying worlds. this is also true for elden ring. instead of having a ton of quests requiring logs and tracking, there are localized quests and a few long, storydriven quests to follow. many of these take you to places you would explore on your journey. when npcs talk about them, it is very likely you already have the location on your map. joining factions often gives you the ability to teleport to their base. the open world is expertly crafted. it leads you to where you need to go without annoying tracking systems that have plagued rpgs in the last decade. many players will miss such systems, desiring for the game to tell them where to go. this game is more about exploration, and the exploration is rewarded well. often with a new weapon, art, or summon. multiplayer in the game is integrated well into the game world. invasions still occur, but only in multiplayer sessions. as you have seen from other reviews, the game is difficult and frustrating for some people to solo. if you want to play alone, around half of the optional bosses are tedious fights without over leveling or having a good build. coop is necessary for many parts of the game. coop is where the game shines. use it. it is easy to drop in and help others or find players at many of the summon points throughout the game. playing multiplayer opens you up to invasions, which provide a sort of miniboss for coop players. many invaders come prepared with good builds, items, and arts. rarely do they win though since they often face 34 players. at this point, everyone is packing some sort of weapon art or spell that will make quick work of another player. you have to be a better player to win. few games really integrate everything into a game so well. if you enjoy hard games, are willing to do coop, git gud, and enjoy exploration, then this is a good title for you. if you are looking for a single player mmo, then it isn't for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"the selling point for me was the story by george rr martin  however, after playing for about 810 hours there does not appear to be much of a story. the game initially would not run on my pc. i had to google reddit forums for tricks on how to do so. game controls were mapped to an xbox controller. had to google reddit forums on how to switch to pc. i made it to one miniboss that was punishingly difficult far beyond any ability to enjoy the challenge. good game design is not just enemies that pummel you mercilessly over and over again. i remember buying skyrim on release day, and it was infinitely more enjoyable than elden ring. give me super mario or legend of zelda any day over this nonsense."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"this game is insanely addicting fun, first time playing a souls game seriously after i ditched ds1 remastered since i didn't feel like playing anything grindy anymore, yet i'm already more than 45 hours in since release. the open world exploration is so wide, the view of the landscapemap is super beautiful, fighting bosses and enemies are difficult expected but it still feels fun and extremely rewarding. as for performance it does stutters a lot on the first few days of release but it was thankfully fixed after the update and for me at least i'm playing with barely that much lag, honestly i haven't had this much fun playing a game since god knows how long ago. to the ones who rated this bad cause its super difficult  bad graphics, first of all u got skill issue  cope  l  touch grace  no maidens."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"i never review games but in this case, after reading some bad ones im confused. the game is an absolute masterpiece. a journey to think about your actions, builds, paths to take, decisions regarding your progression and were taking risks really matter. bad reviews are from assassins creed players that want an empty game that underestimate you. this game wont treat you like a drooling brainless corpse and i love that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"unplayable for me ps5 controller not supported. keyboard not really supported many attacks impossible to do and there's no key mappings, so you're trying to click all the buttons on your keyboard to try to figure out how to do things. also, why does it require a secondary weapon to twohand weapons. looks and sounds great! shame you can't play it unless you have an xbox controller specifically, and then good luck with all the dropping frame rates and limited graphics options from like 5 years ago."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"1010. nearly perfect in almost every aspect i can think of, only a few minor gripes, all of which are completely overshadowed by everything else. negligible performance issues for my case."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,elden ring is very cool game i thnk. optimization is meh but optimization is not a problem for me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"this is the most fun game i've played since the original dark souls. i'm having almost no frame rate or studdering issues that are noticable, between my pc and gysnc. but i also expected hiccups from fromsoft, it's fromsoft after all. in it's current state i'd probably rate a 9 but gotta offset the review bomb of people who have no concept of anything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"this game is literally a masterpiece. loved everything from the gameplay, complex plot, feeling, a challenge which this game gave me to the ultimate satisfaction."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,",   ,     !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"best open world game i have played so far, it invite us to explore the world and not just go there, them go there and so, everything you do, everything you achieve, is was only because of you and that's amazing. in terms of difficulty? bery challenging, but it give you the tools to make it more easy you just have to look for it, again it recompense you for exploring. however is still very challenging, so you should know what you are gonna play before buying. you wouldn't buy a 1000 pieces jigsaw if you don't want to ensamble it would you? same thing here. overall my personal best game of the year so far."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"i think this is the best from software souls game just behind sekiro. but poor optimization and some crashs problems. for me, some minor problems."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"an amazing game that sadly, like every popular souls game, got review bombed by haters. the minor stutters and fps drops are rare and barelly noticeable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"the best soulslike, best fromsoft game, one of the best games ever made, poor optimization, 1 point for this, its a shame people with budget pc's cant experience the game yet, but in a couple of months itll be one of the best games in the universe when everybody will play it with no techical troubles."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"very excellent game overall, yeah it's got some failure on frame drops, stutter, etc.. but it's not game breaking, so i have a good time most of my first playthrough. my system running ryzen 7 with rtx 3060. i thought i can finish the game about 3 days, i was wrong. to explore search nook and cranny in this game takes a lot of my time, figure out the questline of every character makes it harder. all npc have a bad ending for me, my fault i do a bad decision after all. 1010 for me, thanks fromsoft."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"it's incredible. elden ring has a lot of bosses, a huge and interesting open world and a huge variety of zones and enemies. elden ring has the best of dark souls, sekiro and bloodborne, and it's a really clever mix of them. 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"elden ring is definitely my best of the souls, a masterpiece in some respects, but ... we expect more, in 2022 you cannot see certain things, first of all the graphics sector is at the ps4 level or perhaps less and on pc we expect much, much more. the frame rate locked at 60 fps, which is absolutely a poor choice. no ultrawide support, even this bad. free multiplayer, no more summons, change summons by zone, you just want multiplayer, base the game on that. one last thing, this lore thing is a bit out of hand, make a real story, just read descriptions from, put some cutscene, the tokens for the npc to talk to, give a form of path, in a open world it is extremely difficult to find the characters hidden in the map"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"what an absolute great game. brutal, yes. but it is so awesome to traverse this beautiful landscape. your victories are incredibly satisfying.im running with 32gb of ram and an i7 10700k with a 2070 super and zero issues with performance. this is a must have game if you are even remotely interested in open world rpgs. great job, from software."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"among the most banal games i've ever played. the point appears to be to wonder boringly through a halfempty world, dying repeatedly and pointlessly. the story is either nonexistent or, when it does make an appearance, utterly cringey, written presumably by an adolescent who just watched lord of the rings. every year games become less like art and more like fast food. no, that's not true. there are plenty of good games out there. this one just isn't it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,goty. please play the game before writing a review. please play the game before writing a review. please play the game before writing a review.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"this is my first soulslike game i've ever played, and is absolutely one of the funnest, most entertaining, rewarding, and occasionally infuriating in a good way gaming experiences i've had in nearly 10 years. i was prepared by some friends before playing regarding the challenging world and needing to skip some fights, which helped a lot. this is the game i've been wanting to play for so long. it may be because i'm older now, but i am just not interested in a lot of the more kid oriented, bubbly, neon colored, and flashy games available right now. i am thoroughly enjoying this artistic design and lack of hand holding. thank you to whoever the developers of this game are!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,1080ti8700k stuttering is almost nonexistent for me except for new area loading. running bw 5460 fps at 1440p with it almost always sitting at 60. almost all setting are set to high. 910 soulslike combat that you expect amazing art  enemy design something to explore everywhere on the map and you are rewarded for adventuring variety in how you approach mobsenemies  recycled assets  storytelling for the masses is not the best i really liked sekiros storytelling but it is much more linear game needs some polishing in the animation department ex. i hate how dialogue and mouth movement do no match formulaic fromsoftware needs to make something new from the ground up with a new engine and try to step away from its soulslike predecessors for me my pros definitely outweighs my neutral and negatives and i am having a blast
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"general  mounted fall damage is completely inconsistent, making the dumb jump pads ?horse trampolines???? my immersion. what happened to this world. seem even more pointless in comparison.  the game allows you to equip gear you can't use without adequately explaining or notifying you how much its actually impairing you. accidentally press a few keys fumbling through the ported interface and equip a sword that looks just like the one you were already using, but apparently you're too weak to hold right? your damage will suffer and you'll just go on thinking all these bosses have lots of armor and health.  crashes alt tabbing a lot.  the lack of focus the game exhibits really gives the impression it's been rushed and is not groundbreaking in any way, infact, taking several steps back. it's laughable to have no explanation or training for the core mechanics, but you'll receive a popup blurb you have to click through advising you some stupid side quest npc will accept some dumb item you just received for a pointless endeavour. how about the game introduce itself to us before asking us to babysit? interface  there's no keybind listing for open map if you open controlsbindings, so if you don't know what the binding is and are new to the game series, you never use the map. the first time i noticed an npc telling me they marked it on my map, it didn't remind me what hotkey to push.  you cannot press the unique map hotkey again to close the map.  no explanation what the more esoteric stat names really do, or even what the simple ones do other than gear equip requirements.  you can't keep moving while using the map, unlike every other aspect of the interface.  it takes a long time and a lot of navigation to leave the game their intended way.  why is the inventory ui so   scrolling horizontally in a menu to select which category of item i want to mouse over and view in my bags? why am i scrolling through 10 item types every time i obtain some stupidly named item to try and figure out what the  i just looted? gameplay  elden ring's mounted combat and controls manage to make trial of the crusader jousting dailies feel great in comparison.  mounted combat auto locking on and circling requires an enormous amount of finesse to fight against the steering wheel, per se.  speaking of, how is it that i have over an entire page of crafting material but don't know how to use it yet? game, are you there?  runes rewarded from creatures make no sense? getting very low runes from tougher creatures has made trying to fight stuff that is challenging not really worth the time.  for whatever reason rolling feels worse than before, oh well i guess i designed the wrong character with stats i dont understand and equipped something that is encumbering me but  me because the game isn't telling me that, for damn sure.  why is the horse with the dumb named so influential to the game? it isn't satisfying to use the horse and all of its clearly overpowered and hamfisted   can't figure out the weird weapon special ability flourish enhancement enchantment imbuement ash of war or whatever the  it is system. it's like materia or something right? i don't know, it didn't give an explanation. world  is the expectation for a from software game that you use a playercreated internet guide while you go through the game otherwise you're not playing it the intended way?  the open world isn't very rewarding, i stopped looting flowers and berries after the 50th of each type. lots of areas with enemies and different types of camps or castles don't give you anything.  story takes itself way too seriously considering it's the same  cares that george martin is involved? broadly speaking, this is the exact same brush used to fill in the story of the previous souls games. we're diseased souls tarnished! fighting to regain my humanity or purity or grace or whatever it is, lighting bonfires err grace torches along the way... it's an identical story and azerite power has just been renamed to runic power.  ps even the good areas are downright depressing. game might literally be  my soul away with its vibe. universe  why are there so many identical assets from earlier dark souls games? is this just a chinasoft clone and a hodgepodge mish mash of all from software game design concepts at the same time?  standing by my earlier appraisal that elden ring feels like a rushed expansion to an earlier dark souls and it isn't a very good standalone game, it's mediocre at best.  can't say its because i don't have patience to explore, i enjoyed over 200 hours of arkane's prey a game that actually is a masterpiece, unlike elden ring  this is sunk cost fallacy the game. maybe after 12 hours i'll figure out what the  i should be doing... okay, i'm 20 hours in, i guess i have to beat this so it didn't beat me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"no soy fan de los juegos de fromsoftware y solo puedo decir que es el mundo abierto mas espectacular al que he jugado nunca, en cada rincn hay una sorpresa, un jefe nuevoque te mata y te vuelve a matar una trampa, una  increble el derroche de creatividad que tiene le juego y  exigente, es difcil pero esta vez si he conseguido meterme en el juego y  maravilla."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"amazing!! dark souls, almost perfected. camera still . game design is beautiful! gigantic open world that is daunting. if you can see it you can get to it. this is the most accessible souls game ever, period. fast travel, checkpoints, summon pools, summon spells. game is difficult for sure. the game pits you against an overpowered enemy immediately to let you know youre not ready. go level up, learn the mechanics, then come back and kick his ass. thats the hook. you earn every kill in these games. pc has some tech issues, nothing that broke the experience though. praise the sun!! evga 3070 ultra, ryzen 5600x"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"this is the ultimate version of dark souls. so much content, so much to explore!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"this is my biggest videogamedisapointment ever. a dark souls game of extreme quality, that has been opened for the casual gamer. that was my expectation. now, 30 hours of later, im deinstalling, and am not going to ever play this, nor buy any from software game ever again... honestly i regret the 30 hours of frustration i had, and the hilarious amount i paid for it. it basically is just a fighting simulator. there is nothing more in this game. run around, fight difficult to impossible for me battles, grind endlessly, progress extremely slowly, and, from time to time, discover items that may or may not be useful for you. you will die a lot, lose all character progress regulairly, and generally, have no idea what this game is actually about. the story is nonexistent, the world is extremely lifeless, and just filled with enemies that wait only or you, and the storyline will come to an end pretty fast, because you will just not be able to beat the bosses. at least, if you are a casual gamer iike me. which forces you to battle easy opponents forever, as rewards and character developement are hardly more than a cosmetic feature. of course there are ways to exploit the game, but as soon as i need youtube in a tab to achieve any chance of progression, a game has failed for me. my last experience in this game, after exploring the whole starting region desperately, was a sorceress who finally enabled me to learn new spells. which gave me hope, that the torture had come to an end. and guess what those spells are far weaker than the weak ones, that you start with. its a slap in the face, and im sure, that its an intended one. this is elden ring in a nutshell..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"honest review x hours in if you were expecting them to balance enemy damage in proportion to their health and mobility, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to finally realize they already had a sensible poise system in dark souls 1 and to stop trying to fix what was never broke, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to stop gimping blocking in most boss fights in favor of rolling like they did in ds3, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to learn how to do enemy grab attacks reasonably i.e. not generally obnoxious with regards to damage and homing, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to cut back on every single enemy having a wombo combo that can chunk your health, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to cut back on staggered attack animations that give enemies the ability to hit you anyway unless you empty your stamina bar rolling and generally make evasion harder than it needs to be, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to realize that giving ai controlled enemies the ability to parry with absolute perfection would only result in unfair deaths to the player via 1 shot, you're going to be sorely disappointed if you were expecting them to figure out that denying a player their full potential by limiting it with a consumable effect that is lost when you die rune arc in this case, cinders in ds3 is an asinine idea with exactly 0 merit, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to make a primary feature lock on camera finally be more a help than a hindrance, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to handle fall damage well, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you were expecting them to make it so you can't be hit and killed when you're not able to actually control your character being pancaked, etc, you're going to be sorely disappointed. to expand a bit further, i've personally just started referring to the design philosophy that seems to guide fs as antiplayer or  the player. i say this because for the 3rd game in a row i'm exempting bloodborn from this castigation because it at least had the rally mechanic and other compensatory features fromsoftware has hit on all the predictable trademarks that have come to dominate their poor design. every enemy has a wombo combo, i.e. a combo that hits for outrageous damage or  of hits. this compounds with the next 2 points heavily. every enemy can hit you regardless of where you are in relation to them because they can just 180, have exaggerated attack animations or just have an animation that involves them holding their attack, running up to you, and hitting you anyway, or any combination of the 3. every build that isn't fast and focused on dodging is made to feel vastly inferior because they refuse to acknowledge that they can't come up with poise systems that are better than what they had in dark souls 1. the number of deaths i had to deal with because i literally could not move for various reasons in ratio to the ones that were genuinely my fault and lord are they many is actually staggering. you can get hit, rendered unable to move or roll or act, then hit again. combined with aforementioned lack of balance around damage done to the player, you typically are not going to survive the second hit. they fumble the open world aspect because there is negligible space between no fall damage and  instant death, they don't even restore your mounts health when you respawn. having recently replayed through demon's souls, dark souls, dark souls 2 and dark souls 3 in their entirety, i'm left to draw one of two different conclusions option a they are unable to balance things properly just because, and that dark souls 1 being largely really well done in that regard was nothing short of a cosmic stroke of luck. option b they simply don't care to, because again, their game design philosphy over the years has gone from tough but fair to  the player i'm not entirely sure which would be the most depressing. i'm done with fromsoft tbh, bring on the not helpful brigades because i dared hang them out to dry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,masterpiece. fromsoft has done it again. i am so happy this is absolutely a must play.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"this game is frustrating and boring. i can see where maybe some people would like it, but i imagine for most people it's going to . there's little guidance overall, the tutorial is hidden in a hole, the first waypoint sends you to be murdered by an overpowered boss, there are no normal monsters to fight until after you've been filled by 1 an unkillable plotarmor boss and 2 the or boss they guide you into, etc... not to mention the controls , since its a pretty clear console port. bottom line it's lame."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"i can't believe some of the people on here, they are just ridiculous! i made an account just to counteract the terror attack that has befallen this masterpiece . shame on you people! the amount of work that was put into this game alone should be enough to earn praise, and all your negative reviews are doing is hurting the people who made it. these people are review bombing this game because of occasional stuttering, very occasional by the way, as i have 90 hours already put into this game and just can't put it down! so people are angry about a bit of stuttering, that's no reason to give it a 0 rating, none of you are actually taking the game itself into account. i seem to remember another game that had performance issues due to its massive size, however it retained its positive rating and is hailed as one of the greatest games of all time. if course, i'm speaking of skyrim. to the people who want actual reviews, please use your brains and read some reviews, you'll see that it's really a great game, even made inviting to non soulslike players. no it does not have ultra wide support, but does it deserve to die based on that? come on people, think a little. also someone mentioned bad controller support, but none of the people i play with nor myself have had any issues with this, so i don't know where that's coming from. in closing, please be fair to the great developers of this game, have some common decency. i know this is the internet, and you can do what you like, but is that really the kind of person you want to be? think about it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"the performance issues are almost gone, still an occasional stutter but nothing too bad. love this game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"beautifully wonderful, fantastically amazing game. i just hit 100 hours and i'm getting close to the end. it works perfectly on my computer, no problems at all. i'll definitely definitely be playing the ng and creating a new character!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"this is simply one of the most astonishing games i have ever played. in a few words, responding to the critics if you are in trouble for the difficult, what did you expect from from software? if you are having technical issues, i am with you, i hope you will get to enjoy this masterpiece if you think that there is not any kind of innovation, play for some hours and come back here. there are tons of mechanics that makes this game a true rpg, of that kind we are not used to see, nowadays. and the story, check the descriptions of the items and try not to skip all dialogues, trust me. finally, do you really think that forbidden west is innovative? it's a masterpiece, of course. but it is the exact same thing of zero dawn. hope to see you in the lands between, fellows tarnished."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"sinceramente no me parece la gran cosa como lo pinta la prensa, siempre he jugado los dark souls y la verdad el que ms me ha gustado fue sekiro, elden ring me parece ms de lo mismo comparado con sus antecesores, la nica diferencia es que tiene un mundo abierto pero sin evolucin, el personaje es muy torpe para explorar tanto, no escala, no puedes descolgarte con una capa para planear y realmente poder explorar sin limitaciones, debes ir por donde ellos te digan para llegar a la zona deseada. en ese aspecto zelda breth of the wild se siente ms completo. aunque es interesante explorar, a veces me da mucha flojera intentar llegar a algn lugar, no creo que sea un juego para todos, si tienes poco tiempo para jugar, te sentirs abrumado por su mundo tan grande. lo nico que se me hizo extrao es que no pudieras jugarlo a ms de 60fps, cuando la mayora de los aaa ya cuentan con esa caracterstica para pc, otro problema fue el control que no era detectado por el juego aunque me parece que ya se corrigi, al menos no he sentido que tuviera muchos errores en la jugabilidad como me pas con horizon forbidden west, que sigo con problemas en el juego a pesar de que lo tengo actualizado a la versin 1.06, ya mejor deje de jugarlo para esperar a que arreglen sus tonteras."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"good looking. full sopp. nothing else. some reviewers dare comparing it to witcher 3... those are 2 different levels though. elden ring has zero character developed, no relatable stories.....well no stories at all. forced myself to play 10 whole hours thinking that i must be missing  no... i quit..."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"parto con il dire che seppur sappia scrivere in inglese mediamente bene preferisco recensire in italiano, per farmi capire al meglio dai gamer compatrioti. se avete tempo per giocare, questo  un must! anche questa volta bandai e from software sono riusciti a creare un capolavoro. tutti le caratteristiche di un gioco buono si vedono fin dalla prima ora di gioco, ed io ne sono rimasto entusiasta. la storia  bellissima, ma come ogni souls like non  capibile se non esplorando, e per essere la prima volta che ci viene mostrato un open world di questo genere hanno fatto veramente un lavoro straordinario. la collaborazione con george martin ha portato veramente freschezza senza uscire troppo dal seminato, ma dando quei toni che ci hanno stregsti anche nelle cronache del ghiaccio e del fuoco game of thrones. il gioco si presenta spettacolare dal punto di vista visivo, senza contare della fluidit assurda dei combattimenti, ma di questo parler pi . i  creati sono molto belli, anche se talvolta un po' noiosi per certi versi. anche questa volta larmamentario disponibile e ampio e differenziato, anche se con una maggiore concentrazione sugli spadoni a due mani. ci che sorprende per dal momento che si esce dal tutorial  la dimensione della mappa, e chiedetemi, se pensato che che grotte  rovine siano spettacolari, avrete un colpo quando vedrete le ambientazioni che si posso trovare in questo opne world. ed ora passiamo al combattimento di per s molto curato, fluido ma soprattutto intuitivo non si distacca molto dai dark souls, ma aggiunge nuove meccaniche molto interessanti. la telecamera fissa  perfetta per quasi tutti gli avverarsi e spero che quelli mancanti vengano aggiustati con patch future. le nuove ashes of war sono una buona idea, ma spesso risultano oltremodo inutili se comparate alle abolita uniche delle armi pi esotiche. ma ora passiamo passiamo alla parte che dovete leggere se avete intenzione di comprarlo da pc gira do su 60 fps su console nuove e vecchie, mi aspettavo una furia su pc di fascia media, ed invece vengo sorpreso da un limite di frame inopportuno. il motivo per cui ho dato un 9 al gioco  proprio per via delle poche comodit da pc ho potuto addirittura provare l'emozione di perdere 10 ore di salvataggi, per motivi del tutto legati alla debole o quasi mancante ottimizzazione su questa piattaforma ci rendiamo conto? mai spento il gioco bruscamente, mai toccato i file di gioco o manomesso le qualit grafiche pesantemente eppure steam ed il suo steam cloud sono riusciti a farmi perdere tutte quelle ore? in conclusione, questo gioco va comprato, e sono veramente deluso da questo punteggio basso che si mostra dai gamer amatoriali, molti criticano come me i problemi dal pc, ma molti altri la difficolt... cosa vi aspettavate? un peppa pig simulator? voto 9 ma se venisse ottimizzato 10 senza dubbi"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"the game is amazing. the only issue is that it has some performance issues, but other than that the game is amazing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"big fan souls here so i was really exited with the release, when i first logged in there where invisible enemies? all over the map bug never got fixed, plus when i tried to minimize the game my whole pc would crash... played around 11 hours and after the 1.02.2 update the game just crashes on launch? this is just some cyberpunk level game, the time i played game was pretty good but way too buggy, would be better to wait and fix it for pc before releasing whatever this is. oh and performance is horrible, seems like no company tries to optimize games anymore, they just want you to have a  ultimate generation gamer pc with a 2k graphics card. don't know if it have to do with open world or something but i have a ryzen 7 5700, 16 ram, ssd and gtx 660 and fps drop is  insane. just another company that goes for the profits and not for the player experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"no outofthe box ultrawide support? fps lock taken from consoles? terrible menu, stuttering and other performance issues. not worth playing on pc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"not a terrible game, but has a lot of issues. the pc port is one of the worst of all time. there is no proper keyboard and mouse support, there are random locked keybindings for menu navigation. all the prompts are using controller buttons. a lot of people report stuttering and crashes. the game looks at least 5 years dated if not 10 years. poor animations as if i'm playing risen or something. and the performance is similarly not in line with its looks. comparing it to the recent sony ports for example is like night and day. games like hzd or god of war really showcases how little effort elden ring devs put in towards making the game look good and run well on pc. the open world aspect of the game suffers from issues that plague most open world games. there's a lot to explore and a lot of stuff to find but most of it is meaningless filler. 90 of the loot you find does not feel rewarding for the time and effort you invest into finding it. the story and narrative is a mess. it's as if someone wrote a book and then put all the pages through a randomizer. there's some kind of a story, but it's basically intentionally vague and confusing so that you wouldn't even bother trying to understand it and would simply go and fight monsters. and as for the fighting  enemy ai is dumber than dirt, as if often the case with fantasy games. when it comes to creating nonhuman enemies, developers default to they see you and they will chase you coding. that's all there is. no tactics, no nothing. bosses are fun to fight, but at the end of the day, they all boil down to the exact same thing. you learn their limited move set and then you can beat them to death with a club while being butt naked and not even taking a single point of damage. there are no crazy tactics and cool strategies to beat bosses. you can pretty much run through the whole game naked and weaponless if you could memorize every boss mechanic. personally, i find that it takes out a lot of incentive to explore and try to improve your character, because even with good gear, a lot of the bosses still have moves that decimate you. so no matter what, you still kinda have to learn how to beat them. so more gear and xp just makes enemies faster to kill. which is different from a lot of other games where you kinda have to level and gear up because the enemies are literally not possible to beat otherwise. the developers also clearly ran out of ideas a quarter of the way through the game. as whole areas and boss fights end up being copypasted and refurbished. the scenery might change a little, the enemies might be differently coloured, but they're same as before. this again isn't new to most open world games, but it does add more evidence to why elden ring doesn't really do much anything that's next gen or creative. all in all, i would recommend most people to check out the game, if only to be aware of what's one of the most hyped up games of all time. but get ready to refund the game, because odds are, you will not be particularly impressed by it. if the game even runs on your pc at all. i got my copy refunded on steam without issue, so do make use of their generous refund policy to demo out the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"the game is just great! it is beeing one of the best games of all my life and it has a looong time i dont feel to excited playing a game like i am feeling during the elden ring gameplay! but still there is some issues on the game... the frames drops are inexplicable, i dont see a reason for the fps dropping cause it happens randonly, but this definitely doesnt make game impossible to play as some other reviewers are saying, excepet while defeating the tree sentinel, yes, that battle has giants drops of fps, but in the rest of the game, nothing exagerated or boring and it will be fixed. another default of the game, there is no crossplay  this is really sad. but, for me, this game still deserves a 10 cause there is no option for a 9.9 or 9.8 hahahaha so lets round it to 10 my pc config rtx 2060, ryzen 5 3600x and 16gb ram. playing the game on high settings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"ok. not a 10 but not a zero either, great game with launch issues. as a pc gamer i understand we get perfect launches 100 of the time so understand the frustration from the people who are having issues and if i was near them would help put their toys back in their pram."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"intro  based on the day one version of the game, so without any possible future patch. when i stopped playing, the latest patch was the 1.02.3  played on a pretty good computer  even though ive played the game both online and offline, i dont feel like ive used the online features enough to take them into account in this review, so i wont pro  amazing graphic and animations  really beautiful cutscenes  incredible osts  the level of details in the interiors of the structures is astonishing  soulsborne combat system's mechanics at their best  map and possibility to place pins  fast travel enabled between checkpoints  many checkpoints  tutorials  audio mixing options  big enemies destroy the environment when moving or attacking  defeating the leader  makes the other enemies frightened  the mount is extremely useful and comfortable to use  amazing battles with the steed  high amount of content  running outside of combat does not consume stamina cons  poor performances  death by fall damage unclear  death planes in order to not make you go in specific places  no possibility to pause even if playing offline  cannot access map when in battle even though it doesn't pause the game  the intended path for scaling difficulty is unclear  extremely low exp rewards from killing enemies or bosses, especially in early game  hard to find armors in earlymid game  most dungeons are extremely simple and short  most dungeons have totally useless rewards  completed dungeons are not marked as completed anywhere it's up to the player to keep track of which have been completed  the camera is bad just like any souls  enemies and npcs have infinite mana  repost on many bosses deals insignificant damage  some bosses remove far too much stamina with every hit if blocked  some bosses are not viable with many builds  exaggerated reuse of some bossesenemies  flying enemies are extremely hard to hit  unclear quest triggers and the next place in which an npc will appear is almost always totally unknown  multiple quests are tied to optional areas and dungeons, and they might be forever lost if dungeons are not made in a specific order or if you miss a dungeon and advance too much in the main story which is stupid in an open world miscellanous  there are some bugs, but theyre not many or severe for an open world  getting all the achievementstrophies might be tricky without a guide, since some quests or equipments might be lost if not obtained before a specific moment  based on , most players play it for 5060 hours, while a completionist run takes around 90100 hours"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"i remember playing morrowind for a year and a half back in 2003. i loved exploring that world. it felt like there was something new behind every corner and it kept me really invested. then, after oblivion was announced i patiently waited for almost 3 years for a new great adventure. when it was finally released in 2006, i woke up early and rushed to the store to buy it. after coming home and installing it, i was beyond excited. about 30 minutes later, when i exited the starting dungeon and got to the open world, it felt fantastic. that's exactly how elden ring felt after dark souls iii. so far, it's everything i expected and even more. the open world exceeded my expectations by a lot. insane variety of locations, enemies, spells, weapons and so on. at the moment of this review i'm 30 hours in, but i already feel like i experienced the density of 3 modern openworld games. the only game i can remember that had such a wonderful open world was red dead redemption 2. so, that's definitely says something. i see a lot of reviews comparing it to the modern open world rpgs like horizon forbidden west and assassin's creed valhalla. i don't think that's a fair comparison at all. both of them are fine, but they're using the same open world formula that was around for years. they have insane amount of handholding that takes away your freedom in favor of smooth and painless experience. fromsoftware games are simply not like that. they designed to give you all much freedom as possible. including adjusting the difficulty and discovering the story by yourself. in my opinion, this kind of approach is the golden standard that puts open in the open world. however, there are 2 reasons why it currently has 6.4 average user score 1. the game suffers from frame drops and stuttering. not a deal breaker, but can be annoying if you're sensitive to it. i'm sure it will be patched eventually, but currently it isn't. 2. elden ring had the heaviest marketing campaign of any fromsoftware game. as a result, a lot of new people came around and some of them are not really understanding what is it all about. that includes ubisoft and ea fans."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"what a good experience, this game makes me don't want to stop playing it..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,crashes on start up. disconnects from online mode. random crashes and frame drops. no widescreen. world could have more in  let's hope some mods sort this out if the anti cheat allows it. meh. worth at least one play through i guess.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"excellent game, open world that is actually filled with content. combat system typical for souls series with some new elements such as ashes of war etc. level design is astonishing, hidden items and pathways carefully put all around. the game looks beautiful even on low settings. 30 hours in and i had only 1 lag where the game crashed i was alt tabbing a lot, since i put video settings on mediumhigh i stopped having even frame drops."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"steam users from russia are complaining about the mass removal of the action roleplaying game elden ring from their libraries and forced refunds. some even threw out of the game in the process of passing. judging by a number of comments, money has not yet been returned to someone's card, and this despite the fact that they can no longer play elden ring. and, of course, the situation is contrary to the rules of refunds on the platform, since the problem also affected those who played fromsoftware's creation for 50 or more hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"game has little optimization. gave it a 10, hoping it will be improved later on, if it was already fixed, that's the score it would have."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"i don't give anything a 10 out of 10 usually because nothing is perfect, but a 9 just felt wrong for elden ring. it is not perfect, but its the closest to perfect in a game i have experienced in a long, long time. it is challenging, but just the right level of difficulty and the beauty of the way this game has been crafted is that you can walk away from a fight that is just a bit 'too' difficult, level up some and come back and try again. never before in a game has progression and levelling up seemed so tightly bound to your progress. it makes for a very engaging and addictive experience. the graphics are not absolutely spectacular, but they are beautiful nonetheless. the art direction is splendid, everything looks so richly detailed and interesting and some of the vistas are breath taking. enemy variation is excellent, you never know what challenge you are going to face around every corner, but it just makes for a very tense, exhilarating ride! performance wise, pc has had a few  issues, but thankfully nothing i have noticed too much the odd frame drop but i am sure fromsoftware are on top of this. this game is an absolute triumph. a masterpiece. please play it, you will not regret it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,amazing achievement in game development. maybe not for everyone but fromsofts execution in bringing the now classic soulsbourne style to the open world is just outstanding
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"well well, ignoring the optimization problem the worst problem that a game should had the game is just incredible. i really love how fromsoftware worked on this game, maintaining the soul of her games souls xd but adding an amazing open world instead of a linear world. i hope all of you'll get addict to this fantastic game like me d in a good way off course ps sorry by my english, i'm kinda dumb"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,dark souls but bigger. i could not ask for more. the bosses are so fun and the open world is full of insane discoveries despite performance issues i haven't had a single second where i've felt bored playing elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"best game ever. just finished it. dont listen to the metacritic trolls who always review bomb games because they are bored, this game is a masterpiece like no other. it will change game like zelda botw."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"never been a souls fan, but im definatly an elden ring fan, this is by far one of the best games i have played in the year 2020. a full game with no dlc or mtx you get a full package right out the box and that is something we need more and more of. just look at grand turismo, that game is littered with mtx and does not care to earn the respect of the gamers. elden ring is just a one of a kind game and im so glad i am alive to experience this!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"i already wrote my review under the ps5 page. just want to boost the score after a bunch of fools tried to review bomb the game for reasons only they know. like always with great games or great and challenging games, people show their incompetence on metacritic or other user scores, ruining sites like this completely. as if someone doesnt buys or buys a game based on your trash reviews lol. people already know that user score is invalid. so save your time and rather learn the game. noob."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"let' be short and clear, for me it's the worst game from fromsoftware, i'm not giving a single f about optimization, i just cannot bear this openempty world, even when you find cave or smth else, it's literally the same thing u probably have seen in the beginning of the game, bosses are a massive pieces of  everything that they do is a massive aoes and horizontal hits at range of whole arena, i'm simply not enjoying fighting bosses with millions hp and trillions of damage, leave it for someone else. this game is not a god damn jprg, leave more place for actual skill of the player but not for his level, overall i'm just really disappointed, it could've been much more cooler game"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"if you put 1000's of hours into other fromsoftware games like dark souls, bloodborne, andor sekiro then you may put at least 10,000 hours into this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,i think that this is truly a unique game and i would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then i think you should give this game a try.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"let me start by saying that i only recently started playing games by from software, starting first with sekiro, then dark souls 3, started playing dark souls remastered, but quickly hopped onto elden ring when it came out. i believe the game whole heartedly deserves of an 8.710 mainly due to performance issues, but i am rating it a 1010 because of the imbalance there is with the reviews i have been reading skip to last two paragraphs for more detailed explanation of what i mean. first let me address the overinflated, totally not an elephant elephant in the room, the performance issues. my computer can definitely hold its own 1440p max settings with a 4 core xeon, 48 gbs of ram , and a titan xp gpu. for me personally your mileage may vary, i am having minimal to nonexistant stuttering or framerate drop. do stuttering and framerate drops occur? yes. was it significant enough that i couldn't enjoy the game? hell no. honestly, i can only attest to my own experience, but these performance issues occur so infrequently or not at all during my 12 hour play sessions that i forget its even issue people are actually complaining about. when stuttering does actually happen, it lasts no more than 23 seconds. i've put 30 hours into the game and look forward to my next 30 hours. as for gameplay, any comparison of elden ring to far cry is simply lazy and delusional. for the sake of comparison, i'd say this game is more on par with the witcher 3. the crafting system is excellent, fighting is clean and smooth, leveling is a bit harder than souls 3, enemies are difficult and bosses are fun and challenging. i will say my biggest, and so far only frustration with the game is the button mapping. it is limited and i'm stuck wondering why does r3 also serve as a torrent dismount? the amount of times i've accidentally dismounted at the most inconvenient times is frustrating, and there are limited options for remapping. i also will not play on a mouse and keyboard because i'm not a lunatic. i find leveling up much harder on this game than in other souls game, but this is more of something i need to adjust to rather than a frustration. i have read many of the negative reviews and i completely understand why someone might not like a game due to the performance issues or lack of ultrawide support. does that deem the game a 010. absolutely not. yet again, these are not professional reviewers who know how to properly evaluate something. reviews take into consideration a variety of aspects, of which none never account for 100 of the score. so while performance is no doubt a category to be considered in a games overall score. it would never account for perhaps more than 20 of the final score. i literally just read a review that said 'it's a great game, but can't recommend it in this state  010'. really? it seems to me that reviews are either '010  stuttering, no ultrawide' and mention nothing of the actual game itself. or they are '1010 masterpiece and completely ignore the performance issues. with that being said, i believe the game is minimum an 8.710. however, i'm scoring it a 1010 because it deserves to be higher than what it currently is on metacritic. all the 010 reviews simply complain about the lack of ultrawide support or performance and don't even talk about the game itself. from my personal experience, i had minimal stuttering and it had zero effect on my enjoyment of the game itself. honestly, the stuttering happens rarely during a typical sessions for me 12 hours. when it does happen, i hardly notice it and it's gone in a few seconds. i understand why negative reviewers are frustrated, but most are being lazy and cannot control their emotions. the game is very much playable it is innovative and it is a world worth exploring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"elden ring its a souls game, it won't take your hand and takes you where you should go or when you should face a boss, the very first boss tree sentinel, teach you that you don't need to face everything on your way right away , you can go back once you feel that you can take that fight, margit teaches you to learn and be patient with an enemy and the whole story progresses trought items description. while this may not be everyones favorite way of play a game, allows the player to have so much freedom thats amazes me. i've seen some reviews saying that this game graphics are bad or dated and to be honest i don't feel that way, they definitely aren't they best graphics in the market but they don't compromised the enjoyment of the game, some scenarios are unbelievable beautiful, going down the elevator to siofra river its one of the most amazing places that i've seen in a game. i've also seen some reviews saying that the world is dead and that's completely false, there's a lot of things happening in the game, each area has its own unique enemies fittng perfectly with the environment. i can say that this game became my favorite game of all time, the whole gameplay feels amazing, some weapon arts are very impressive and this time you are rewarded for using them they arent just to show off."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"looks good and has fun combat. ive lagged a couple times, but they were very small things."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"another overhyped trash. 1010 is such an insult every review channel should be ashamed of itself. it might be a very good soulslike. but even that is a streatch. camera is still your worst enemy, the menu is atrocious, pc keybinding is half implemented. two bosses is lazy boss design, etc. and that for a soulslike! the moment you start to compare that to what everybody expects from every other studio this game is garbage. the flow of the game is fragmented all over the map. most of the time without even telling you. the story as well, highly missable, highly optional. the difficulty is definitely a matter of taste but the difficulty spikes is just like the game itself an absolute stumble fest. people enjoy the game, because the open world is easy and gives the illusion of approachability, but for every new weirdly designed boss or miniboss encounter that euphoria drops into the pit of realization that this game just started throwing  together and people eat it due to the established git gud syndrome. valhallas open world was garbage, this one's is better. is is still good just bc it's a soulslike with open world. the f no!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"absolute masterclass work from fromsoft. it's basically everything an openworld dark souls would be. beautiful landscapes and scenery, lot of rewarding exploration and amazing combat. for the fans of the soulsseries this is a nobrainer, for newcomers it's the best place to start with. you will die a lot in this game, but have patience and learn from your deaths. once it clicks, you'll love the feeling of killing a hard boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"i love it, the technical issues are things that i can overlook, they werent really that bad for me. absolutely loved exploring the world of this game and i am kinda sad that ive finished it, obviously im going to get the other endings but i really needed this game. the gameplay, even if it has some reused assets, is really good. the world is spectacular, it feels like it was built piece by piece because it is so strange and always look amazing. i adored exploring every road i found cause it always had something to do or someone different to kill. i really dont have an explaination on why people are saying that the world is empty other than maybe they havent explored at all. i totally get that it isnt clear as sky where you should go at certain levels because in the first area you can find enemies way stronger than you, but at the same time, if i couldnt defeat someone, i can always change path cause im sure to find something to get stronger somewhere. for me its must and it made me really happy playing this amazing world"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,its an incredible game with a ton of qol improvements over both open world and souls likes. the majority of negative reviews are people who couldn't get past margit and are salty
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"a breathtaking game with immersive graphics, an intriguing storyline, and thrilling combat. this game is for those who want a challenge. in terms of performance, there are no issues with performance. i have a mediocre pc and can play on maximum settings with no framerate issues. i did have some when it launched, but it has since been patched. do not listen to negative reviews who's only gripe is performance, since those no longer apply."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,les problmes sur pc gche un peu le jeu par moment mais sinon c'est un solide 910.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"it will continue to be a zero until they fix the pc port. no ultrawide in 2022 is unforgivable. horrible stutters, 60fps cap, bans for trying modding to get basic pc features."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"para mi es el mejor juego de la saga souls sin ningn tipo de duda, coge lo mejor de zelda botw y de darksouls y lo junta en un juego, simplemente una obra maestra"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"if you ever want evidence the gaming industry is corrupt this is it !!! released on the pc with immediately good critic reviews and positive reviews on steam negative reviews removed  down voted quickly. this is a awful port  hell you cant even get out of the redefine keys menu on the pc, fps is dire and the whole experience downright appalling. these software brand and false critic reviews should be punished and the only way currently is to never buy from that brand again to break this cycle of corruption."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"before i start, i want to say that every experience is subjective. so for you to have a little bit of context about my experience of the game   i've already played and finished dark souls i,ii,iii and sekiro and i really liked those games.  i play video games regulary but i'm not that good, i can struggle and i'm not a sweat type player  i did not experienced any performance issues while playing elden ring for some reason, even with my laptop gtx1070, 16 gb of ram  even if give the game 1010, i don't think everyone, should play it, every games are differents and offers differents type of experience and therefore, every game is not meant for everybody. but elden ring is for me a  masterpiece. as an artist who works in the videogame industry, i find the art direction unmatched, the graphical quality of the game is not meant to reproduce the reality with gorgeous texture but i look fantastic nevertheless. as you progress to the world you are in constant ah of what the game as to offer in his character design, places, music everything come together to immerse the player in the dangerous world of the land between. the game in itself is extremely dense there are cave, ruin, fort, castle in every corner, and it feels really rewarding to be curious, because of the variety of enemies and unique loot to find in those caves. even with an open world dense like that, the main level that you have to go through for the story have the same quality of the game before them, but with a lot more verticality you can go 3 time in the same castle and find 3 differents way to explore it. in term of gameplay, for a souls veterant like me, i feel like this game offers the most ways to build your character in any ways you want, you can customize weapons by swapping theyre special attacks, and use whatever tool you want to tackle the game difficulty  you want to be a tanky mage ? a fast bowman ? a heavy knight with dragons power ? you can do it and mix everything while still maintining it viable and enjoyable. now let's talk about the elephant in the room  the difficulty. if you're new to the serie i think this is the best place to start, elden ring is still challenging in the classical souls way, but there is a loot of tools to give the player a little rest in combat like summoning npc to fight with you on command and a lot of ranged weapons and ways to fight. additionaly, elden ring being an open world you can explore the world to seamlessly lvl up before trying to tackle a boss. this give the player room to breath in between bosses. i will add that from software games are suffering from their reputation of being difficult. it's not an easy game, and it requires a little bit of getting used to. but after some time if you're willing to learn how the games works, you can finish the game without that much of problems. and i really encourage people to do it because it's really rewarding. for me who was tired of most recent video games, elden ring give the fresh experiencz i needed to fall in love in a game once again. the last time i felt like this playing was in zelda breath of the wild, it feels like i'm entering a new world, with everything to learn and it's a lot lot lot of fun. and uf you're worry about the lenght of the game, be not. it's really really big and it has a lot of quests outside of the main one, it take probalbly 80 to 100 hours to finish the first playthrough, without taking all the npc quests. so yeah 1010 because elden ring is exactly what itns aspiring to be, it's different from everything i've played, it's beautyfull it sounds good, the voice acting is perfect, i'm never bored while exploring the open world, it's not frustrating to fight boss, and it has a lot of replayability with all the builds and differents branch of questsand yes it's different from dark souls, it's not just big dark souls 4 don't hesitate give it a go."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"a really fun and challenging game with a beautiful open world and awesome enemies. apart from the stuttering that appears from time to time this is a game i will definitely recommend, especially if you a souls fan"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"one of the best games i've played so far as a dark souls fan obviously the world, if you take your time to explore it, is filled with lots of love, dungeons and bosses everywhere, the game performance was once i started the game a bit frustrating, but once i started the game on the other day, all my issues were gone. absolutely in love 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"i cannot remember when a game made me pull a 16 hour gaming session in a go. absolutly stunning world design with plenty of secrets to discover. i could say so much about the game but instead i'll give you a tldr do you remember when skyrim came out? that whole feeling of adventure at any corner? what may be behind that mountain or see a ruin in the distance and wonder what would be there? that is elden ring. it's the skyrim of souls games. whatever you see in the distance, you can go there. no invisible walls. total freedom. added to that is the classical souls combat with plenty of new mechanics and insane weapons and spells. to adress graphics if a 45 frames dropped in a wink is a 010 rating for you, you never played a fromsoftware game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"the game is pretty good, i enjoyed it, but the recent patches make the whole thing an even bigger technical mess then it was. i get crashes and stutters more often after 1.02.3 to the point of literally breaking my saves, good that i make a backup after every session, now i do it more often. but the whole port is just the epitome of bad, no ultrawide, 60fps cap, they didn't even include a button prompts for ps controllers that are already in the game, where steam fully detect it. they try to fix it, but game quality slowly deteriorates with each patch, i just can't give this game a good note, the pc port is broken for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,the game graphics are amazing and its a game you'll never get bored off new monsters every corner all different a new challenge
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"unplayable, hideous graphics, hideous gameplay, hideous storyline, no plot, hideous enemies, hideous map, artistically disgusting, hideous frame rate, with this commodore 64 graphics it runs terribly. in short, all horrendous, money thrown in the bin. if i could rate this subspecies of theft i would rate 10"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,this game is almost perfect. the open world is maybe the best open world and the combat and enemy designs are great. my only issue is the common stuttering i've had.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"i do not think this game is a masterpiece and it is not running well on pc. the world art design, diversity in playstyles makes this a solid game and with the help of wemod it can be enjoyed by those who play games to relax. i do not find the story telling technique appealing anymore and i think the rr martin was used for publicity only. the biggest disappointment for me is the outdated gameplay mechanics. sekiro had much more interesting gameplay, but in this game from software just reused ds3 mechanics and implemented very little from sekiro innovations. there is still no animation cancel and reactive parry mechanic, forcing you memorize the enemy attack timing, which is highly variable. rolling also looks ridiculous and could have been replace with a cool dash. it is very annoying to check the map all the time to know where you are, i do not think this is an innovative way to make an open world game, it is just another lazy way to do it. i also think this game had an unfair marketing strategy, there should be a warning about the difficulty in the marketing materials do not buy if you are not a skilful gamer, you are not welcome in the lands between, and you are wasting your money. i platinumed bloodborne and ds3 on ps4 and i was left with a bad feeling of what these games forced me to do because they charmed me with the world design and gameplay at that time it felt more interesting, but not after you played for 800 hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"seems like it would be fun, but the performance is such garbage on a ryzen 7 5800x, rtx 3080, 32 gb ram, nvme.2 etc etc, fps drops 20 to 30 at times, locked at 60, no fov control, menu is clunky list goes on and on, fix the game and ill bump the review."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"how did this game score so highly...... being just a rehash of the past fromsoft games, but with abysmal optimization and an even worse lack of innovation. this game being able to score a 97 just proves that you do not have to be actively trying to move the genre forward or introduce new concepts. as long as you regurgitate the same thing again and again, with little to no change whatsoever, it doesn't matter as long as you have a rabid fanbase who treat every rehash as the greatest thing ever made. if it was another aaa franchise with this kind of game launch, just imagine the backlash. but i don't blame miyazaki and fromsoft, if the mass media and consumers had called them out on their crap since ds3, then maybe they would have explored new territory since then. they would have added something revolutionary, included impressive game mechanics... it just amazes me how this thing is hailed as innovative. with the same game design since ds2, graphics from 2009, tedious and outdated gameplay mechanics, terrible animation quality, and a lack of improvement of enemy ai the ai is even ps2 level ai since they do not act without you being in the area, and keep attacking areas you have already dodged. god, rdr2 was actually innovative. it was revolutionary landmark in open world design and storytelling, and it just got completely snubbed at major game awards and gets crapped on till today for trivial reasons. if this thing can get 97, rdr2 shld get a 101, minimum. no open world game developer should take any notes of game design from this game. it is already weak as it is. if there is anything else for me to say, it is that any consumer or review outlet giving this game anything more than a 6 should not be allowed to judge a game's quality and degree of innovation. the only thing redeeming quality about the game are aspects of the art design. i really wish this game was 97 great.... i really wish. 310"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"bought and refunded the game twice. it won't even finish downloading. i'd only be so lucky if i could load it up and see the framerate issues and stuttering everyone else is complaining about. goty is a laugh, it doesn't even work!! i've played hundreds of games on steam with no issue, except this hunk of junk."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,average at best. the game reuses assets and mobs from all of the souls game and copy pastes them all over the world. animations are janky like in ds1. open world is pretty but its filled with the same mobs over and over. everywhere you go you find some flaws. from software failed to deliver same quality with increased quantity.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"if a fromsoft game ever needed 'patches' sorry it's this one! i would be rated higher but due to the serious technical issues on all systems it has to be a red  now. let me explain. im a huge fromsoft fan and trust only them for day 1 preorders. i've platinumed all their games. buy it really worries me that blupoint demon souls remaster can launch at 4k 60fps or near to it but elden ring can barely hit 30fps and often dips as low as 15 in sadly the areas where you need consistent performance. on pc it runs better with improved graphics but all i get is decade old graphical and gameplay issues on pc even with a 3080. there is a whiff of cyberpunk about the game where fans are blindly supporting and conveniently ignoring the serious technical issues which also include a few progression stopping glitches  bugs and the occasional game breaking issue. and post launch the patches are not addressing these issues. it still looks and runs like a...decade old and at times elden ring just looks ugly. great art design but everything else is far from the beauty of sekiro or the grandeur of bloodborne. the open world simply fails in 2022. if it was 2010 then i'm sure it be far more impressive as it has 2010 graphics. it's not remotely as good as botw or rdr2 which are games that existed before er development even started. the latter alone is worrying but the large empty space which witcher 3 dlc would laugh at...isnt much fun to play. yes you can explore but you'll only find skyrim like identical copy and paste areas. forget the wildlife of most open world games or npcs with compelling stories. the george martin element is inexplicably non existent making the game effectively a dark souls 4. the latter isn't a bad thing but it's not as good as ds3 in visuals  performance or gameplay so where does this leave us? without widescreen or controller support at times that's where ! the game isn't suitable for noobs or non fromsoft fans. it's a game seemingly more for fan boys, prepaid journalists and shills to scream goty! while they wait for gameplay saving 'patches' sorry . it's not a bad game by any means but it has bad aspects to it or lazy maybe. bloodborne launched in a rough state so this is nothing new but it's still not acceptable. wait for a sale a year from now when it's been fully patched. eventually maybe 78 10 but a 410 !t launch due to poor technical state"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"unparalleled game design, art direction, and vision. once in a generation good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"performance problems are the only thing i could knock this game for, but i held a smooth 60 for 99 of my playtime with hitches in area transitions. some folks have had a much worse experience than me on this front. otherwise, beautiful open world, some of the best bosses i've found in the series, excellent build variety, soundtrack is another masterclass by yuka kitamura, game oozes lore and atmosphere, and has the tightest combat second to sekiro in a modern from game. as an aside, you are not as slick as you think having 2 reviews on your account hfw 10, er 0 on all platforms lol. horizon games are great, go enjoy them instead of being weirdly insecure on metacritic dot com"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"no performance issues for me on pc. i simply didn't like it. controlling the character feels like driving a semi, controls are sluggish in a fight, character doesn't move when i want it to. nope not for me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"this game is grossly overrated  it's dark souls 3 reskined and changed copy souls to runes  it feels a easier than the previous series  the world feels empty and shallow  it's a dark souls game, it's fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"elden ring is a poorly optimized and poorly exexuted attempt at a soulborne game. frequent stutters and screen tearing have plagued my experience. the music is short and repeatative, bringing back nighmares of the battle theme from the werehog sections of sonic unleashed. the graphics are detailed but it seems as if fromsoftware designed them to be displayed through a grayscale printer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"the game itself its pretty amazing, but unfortunally i can't play because its unplayable for me with 2530 fps and stutterings a had to keep trying a lot of boss fights like dragon blood warrior lightining or the swanp wyverns both fire and magic, or ancient dragon with 2025 fps its too much annoying. why release a unfinished game? why wont wait some months and release a stable version. im with a 2070 and a ryzen 5 5800x, and in all game qualitys lowmediumhighmaximum with any resolution 1080p1440p i get this 30 fps. isnt only that enought  game has a cap on 60 fps  do not support ultrawide monitors  constant stutterings  poor pvp online in comparated with ds series  constant crashes  constant frame drops  invisible enemys not renderized.  do not recognize your dedicated gpu  bricks pcs on quiting.  horses do not appears sometimes when called.  eac easy anticheat do not let the game starts.  freezings. im with 70 hours of game and the unic thing that i dont like to much about the game itself is the new pvp mechanichs invading mechanichs. and the game do not innovate im almost nothing but still a good game with doesnt have this horrorible performance issues i will probably review with an 8.0 or 9.0. fix your game from software"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"really bad game on pc, it's impossible to play that port, terrible performance and lack of ultrawide support, features like dlss, fsr, reflex, 60fps etc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,i loved dark souls and this game is really similar but with an open world to explore. there are a lot of dungeons and open world bosses to conquer. yes there is no ultrawide support i have one and there is a 60fps cap but it really does not bother me. also it is a port from cobsole just like ds3 was. the performance issues i had all got fixed 2 days after release. it is a definite 1010 for me and probably my new favorite game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"i usually refrain from writing reviews, but upon witnessing an absurd amount of straight 1's and 0's here i felt obligated to. many of these reviews make it fairly clear who's played more than say, 30 minutes or so. elden ring is many things, just another soulslike is far from one of them. the game bases its combat on the same fundamental system the developers have been fine tuning for years. no, it does not make any overly significant changes to the underlying formula of its combat. why would it? don't fix what isn't broken, rather improve upon it. and to that end, they have. they have yet again found ways to incorporate lessons and experiments from other games they've made into an experience not unfamiliar and yet more expansive than previous. for instance, more refined use of stealth as an approach to scenarios, or the new ash of war system replacing weapon arts, allowing for far greater options in what weapons you use and how. also, in case you somehow missed it, you have a horse, which you can use in fights, including some boss encounters, should you so choose. you have personal, ai summons you can find throughout the world to aid you in combat, many with their own unique strengths and abilities. that is just the combat, which as i mentioned, i wouldn't describe as some fundamentally different system, just an evolution of one that already worked quite well. more pertinent to discussions of this game is what it does do very differently. the open world approach is not so unlike many other open worlds, but a major change of pace for a souls like. it adds a degree of freedom not seen in prior installments, with it being possible to spend countless hours exploring the vast open world without hardly fighting any major bosses. that freedom allows one to play the game at their own pace. if you want to try to rush straight through, many encounters will prove more challenging, but those skilled enough can certainly do so. if you want to explore all the game has to offer, you can. the open world is far from lacking in things to do, and exploring is a rewarding experience often providing the player with more powerful tools with which to face the ever greater challenges of the main journey. the bosses themselves actually feel fairly unique to previous games, and those that are feel like they have improved greatly. the world itself has very engrossing environments, ranging from scenic to downright revolting, never failing to set the tone of an area. areas are designed to be complex environments which can be approached in a variety of directions. the game never forces you to do anything you don't want to, as demonstrated from the very first boss you encounter, which you can walk right around and come back to when you are better prepared. all that said, the game is not without its failings. performance issues are notable, but not so unbearable as many reviews make it sound. the minimum spec is a 1060. i have a 1050ti and have found that while my enjoyment has been hindered somewhat by lag or lower graphical fidelity, the game remains incredibly fun and runs well enough even for someone with weaker than supposedly required to even run the game. the approach to weapon upgrades can feel somewhat annoying as with previous titles, where you may find yourself wanting to use cool new weapons you find along the way but have already invested the materials you found into something else. the dungeons scattered throughout alleviate this issue somewhat, providing consistent repeatable methods of obtaining these materials, but lets face it, nobody like having to go through something multiple times just for materials. it's a small time sink, but a time sink nonetheless and i'm not a grind gamer. the game itself isn't a graphical powerhouse having seen it on a friend's pc, with a 3090 but the design of enemies, weapons, and environments are done well enough to be good looking regardless. the game itself is very long, something i both enjoy and have some disdain for, solely because the game has so much to offer i can't touch just yet because my build doesn't permit it. overall, the game is incredibly fun. it doesn't look the best. it doesn't run the best. but it's one of the most purely fun titles to release in years. it has no shortage of content, with my first run through approaching 50 hours and being nowhere close to done. i have enjoyed every second of it, and if you're willing to look past some superficial flaws and give it an honest try, i'm sure you will too. don't be intimated by difficulty. the game offers ample ways to grow in strength for encounters and has a healthy playerbase more than willing to help you overcome challenges. i'd rate it an 8.5 if i could, a 9 seems to overlook more of the flaws than i would like but an 8 feels as though it undersells just how enjoyable the journey really is. a great game to start with for potential new players to the series due to its open nature, more than worth its price tag."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"this game is great. the dark souls formula intertwined with a openworld dynamic is the best gaming experience i have ever had. i am not sure how people are having major fps and stuttering issues. i am playing on a gtx 1070 and an intel i56600k cpu  3.50ghz i'd oc, but i'm to lazy to take out cmos and fix bios issue, and i disables motion blur who doesn't, and lowered some visual settings like water, grass, and particles. blows my mind people have issues on better hardware than i have. if this is your first fromsoftware game, i will say its hard to recommend. there games are not like any other game. think about it, i'd recommend a friend, who never play a fromsoftware game, to try dark souls 3 first. that's my favorite fs game and i feel like elden scrolls being open world might affect the experience and understanding of what makes fs games amazing. i guess it is really doesn't matter though, bc anyone playing elden rings will have their own individual experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"really good game, but poorly optimized. it's like a dark souls iv open world edition"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"would have been 1010 if it was optimizedpc , but i've already seen improvements so i might change it to 1010. i'm a big fan of dark souls games, played since 1 game out, even though i didn't know how i felt about the open world change before, after i've tried it i really like the change and i think it brings a lot more of depth and playability. now that i'm 80 hours in, i think i can say that this really is a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"literally the best game ive ever played, the lore, discovery, and sense of awe and adventure are things i dreamed about as a kid playing a link to the past and ocarina of time. adult me hasnt felt childlike awe at a game in a very long time, nothing compares and fromsoft over delivered on their promise. the game suffers from frame drops and stuttering at certain locations, but as ive progressed further in those frame issues have ceased. that is my only issue full stop. elden ring is a once in a lifetime masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,the game itself is so beautiful even now i remember stepping out of the tutorial cave and seeing the world for the first time. the first and probably only time i will gasp at art. game is just as fun and addicting as previous. though i only played ds3 this game tops that hand or fist.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,best open world game made up to this day. awfully optimized yet from blames user's hardware for it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"yeah, technical problems and bla bla bla. the game is amazing and probably is the best game of the generation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"its alright i guess but definently not a 1010, the main problem with this game is not dificulty for me but the absolute garbage game level design you have multiple areas where you are just underleveld and have to 'grind' souls in the open world to advance. im not even sure what the main intended path is for the game it just seems all over the place. also be prepared to use the wikiyoutube guides a lot forgot a name the npc told you bring an item to? search the wiki. want to find upgrade material? search the wiki. want to fight 'hidden bosses'? search the wiki. for almost everything you do in this game you need a wiki or guide, a lot of places are not clear where to go and you get lost often even with a map the way to upgrade your weapons is complete garbage, you can only really lvl up 1 weapon to max or be prepared to find all the upgrade materials all over again. open world? yes i guess its nice but most of the games bests moments are not in the open world but rather in the closed dungeonarea sections. boss design is alright in this game a lot of realy unfair fights and you also dont know if you just have to git gud or if you are underleveled. story is just a  show, you never know what the f is going on and the ending was just confusing not really satisfying for playing a game like 60 hours pc port is a fcking joke and performance  on pc also the game looks nice i guess but not cyberpunk level of grahpics and yet it needs a beter specs. all in all i liked elden but to give this a 1010 just goes to show how paid off these 'reviewers' are i dont really feel like a second playthrought because the game level design is so garbage i dont want to have to use the wiki for everything again. 510"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"it's a bad port buggy, mediocre trash details here if you care mithaldustatus1496989167389003776"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"with currently 33hrs on record i feel that the only thing i can say i am missing at this time is finishing the game that still feels a ways away. overall it is understandable to me for the launch to have had a few optimization issues but as those are being resolved i would find it ill to hold issues that are minor for most users against the game's score. this is an amazing game that is worth your time if you are willing to put in the time required to learn the game system. new or old players can both rejoice and learn the big two lessons that elden ring has taught better than ever before within the first few minutes or hours depending on how quick you get to the first real boss or fight the first mini boss. 1 you can always return to something later with better gear and stats to make it more forgiving. 2 eventually ramming your head against the wall will break it as long as you remember to learn from each mistake that lead to your death. the open world never feels empty with even some of the more dead end areas at minimum having crafting materials. dungeons and bosses continue the classic formula and then go beyond showing more innovation than before, with varied environments and challenges as well as move sets and style. i will close on mentioning that the way some bosses move in the game are leagues ahead of where the games have been previously. it feels more than ever like the bosses have a reaction to what you as a player are doing rather than simply your distance away from them mixed with a die roll. see the first main boss where you will be forced to learn the game, similar in its lessons to another boss in the other fromsoft game sekiro that could be classified as a point where many players clicked as to how the game worked. in the end, i do suggest the game. but i say that anyone buying it should understand that it will require a bit of patience. you will not walk in here and dominate the game without first learning how the game works. and even then, sometimes you just miss a dodge roll haha. praise the sun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"es increible, la libertad, la exploracin y cantidad de puzles que tiene es impresionante la magnitud del mundo, dejando de lado el tema soulslike que ya se sabe, me ha encantado cada detalle del mismo, tiene batallas muy bonitas en lo que sera la lnea principal, y muchos bosses no obligatorios que disfrutar y retar, ha superado todas mis espectativas, y creo que las de muchas personas, tuve problemas de rendimiento pero la verdad que eso se arregla con el tiempo, sabiendo lo que conlleva programar, es un juego que merece el el 10010."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,this is one of the best games of all time. masterpiece. thank you from software.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,wow what a amaizing game perfect i can say i have start these jorney and i am loving it so much love the dificulty that the game has like all the old games and i am always a big fan of fromsoftwere always delivering these is the game of the year
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,good game. that feels like i am really in a fantasy world. didn't feel bad about the performance. maybe it has some issues as it is new and hopes they will fix them. the feeling of this open world is great. explore like an adventruerer.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"this is absolutule my favorite game of all time. i have heard of people having problems with performance on pc but i never did with a pretty average setup. some reviews are very understandable such as people not being able to play while some are just plain awful. people keep calling for difficulty options, don't play a from software game if you want an easy game, im sorry but that's all there is to it. people coming here to brigade because horizon fw got worse reviews need to touch grass. im truly sorry for the people who can't play because of their pc not being able to handle the game because it's truly amazing and anyone who has the time to play this game should try it if they feel they have the patience of dying a lot. if this is your first from software game it will knock you down many times, either you love it or you hate it, i definitely love it though. ps for the people saying the game has no story, there are conclusions and reveals if you actually finish the game dummy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"juegazo, un souls de mundo abierto que tiene todo lo que viste en los anteriores. de lo mejor que jugue en aos. solo critico la caida de frames en pc que a esta altura no tendria que suceder. pero todo lo demas un 10."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"the best game i've played in a long time. probably best souls game. it had a bit of a rocky pc launch, but now everything is slowly being fixed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,ignore the haters. down with online cancel culture! this game is a masterpiece
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"just a fantastic game! i fixed a few things on my nvidia shader settings and voila no lags. could be better but i don't judge technical stand for metacritics. best souls game so far ye ye i know elden ring but for me its dark souls 4  open world, gigantic open world love it died almost every 2min but its so cool! i'm lvl 57 and 40h  in, so i will have more fun with this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"best game of all times so far, a genuine and mature product based on all the fromsoftware's games"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"runs terribly, bad gameplay. would refund if i could. i dont recommend this game to anyone looking for a pleasant experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,stuttery fps locked crap. souls players will be creaming in their pants for a souls game with a different skin whacked on top. same old boring gameplay crappy mechanics as every other souls game. dodge roll slash repeat. avoid at all costs unless youre a souls creampie loser.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"as expected fromsoftware delivered yet another amazing game! the sceneries, details to the surroundings and color usage is absolutely breathtaking, especially on a 4k screen. gameplay is a little different than previous soulsgames but challenging nontheless. it's simply an amazing game, and i recommend all soulsfans to play it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"amazing game very rich full of surprises, content and amazing art design. very sad it got review bombed by the haters"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"massive souls fan but am tired of playing second fiddle to the consoles. performance is atrocious, the constant fps drops, limited 60fps and most importantly no uiltrawide monitor support. from software its 2022, ultrawide gaming has been around for over 15 years and it's ridiculously easy to fix. will not adjust review until fixed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"great game. 1010 if pc performance issues are fixed. ignore the salty 0 score reviews by people who haven't even played the game. rest are the ones who bought the game riding the hype, never having played a souls game before and are now asking for map markers and quest logs. also the ones complaining about reused animations from ds3 a simple calculation of weapon animations destroys this argument hell atleast i don't have aloy talk about how this branch is useful for the 5000th time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"its funny to see people who clearly havent played anything more challenging than mainstream bait titles zelda botw, ghost of tsushima, assassins creed and whatnot, complain about a game that has a 10 year long history of having the same solid mechanics set in stone. they dont realize that the difficulty of these games comes from them being a  player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a  player. they are not used to challenges. they want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. they want a difficulty setting. they dont get what roleplaying means in these games. youre not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, youre playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you do become that strong come late game. i hate that this game became a mountain of hype. sorry but, the souls series doesnt deserve this treatment. i dont know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience. if this game had the same fanbase ds3 had at its release, i guarantee you it wouldve had a fan review score of 9899. this game is literally the closest game weve had to perfect in its respective genre. sorry for the long comment, i just felt like they didnt do justice to this masterpiece of a video game franchise."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"i don't even meet minimum requirements and the game runs amazing. it's packed with content and it's all good. it's incredible how big the legacy dungeons are, stormveil castle, the first one, took me an entire day to clear out 100. npc questlines are very easy in a good way, as they're hard to find, but you don't fail them as easy as in other games. hell, i don't even think i failed a quest yet and i literally beat the final boss. it's as close as a perfect game as it can get. it does have some flaws here and there, but it's compensated by the quality of everything else. only thing i dislike is the last 5h of the game only because they're exhausting. it's like the final boss of sekiro but for 5 hours straight with some breaks, yet not enough. don't get me wrong, it's really cool, but it dragged for too long, and it's not like you would go farm somewhere then come back stronger at the literal end of the game, natural instinct is to keep pushing, it's the final afterall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"i've seen some encouraging gameplays, and since i like this type of game, i decided to spend a lot of money. and when i saw the black bars on the sides of my ultrawide monitor, i realized i had been ripped off."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"yes upon release this game was certainly not perfect, frame rate drops with certain areas were an issue and there is still a glitch were the game crashes when trying to change into certain helmets. but other than that, everything else in the game is amazing. the world is full of so many things to do, and this game has some amazing boss designs. elden ring is without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played in my 15 years of gaming. so yeah if you are not on the greatest system i would recommend holding off for awhile to play the game until they patch up some of the frame rate issues. other than that all of the zeros are from neck beards who just want to hate on something because its popular."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"i spent more than 90 hours in 7 days with this game aside from the graphics optimization issues, overall elden ring is a great game. they have improved on most of the shortcomings of the ds3 gameplay  mixing and adding new mechanics from combat, movement, skills... in a balanced way. it must be said that the combat mechanism becomes much more comfortable than the ds3. and there are many ways to defend, dodge... and more fighting styles for you to choose and mix. keep the old ones and add new ones. make it so much more complete. everything inside seems more comfortable. but the design of boss and enemies of elden ring is more ferocious, more agile, more explosive combos. it doesn't make it any less challenging. you can hardly use the same way with all the bosses in elden ring. fast, strong, defense, massive, swarm,... you'll have to figure out how to deal with each of them, dodging every hit, keeping your composure and making your way through the barrage of attacks. just make one mistake and you will get the consequences. dungeons are everywhere, they always give you great loot. but the dungeon boss was slowly rising. but the traps and puzzles will take you hours to get through. and you will die a lot. story a great story to discover, it's hidden behind everything. stories in item, in ruins, in chance encounters with interesting npcs. you will love some of them, some will make you laugh and some make you sad. multiple endings depending on the progress and npc you went through in their quest. you will find that your decisions have a certain effect on the world in elden ring. both good and bad. a main story with many branches and leaves. you won't feel complete if you just run away and beat the last boss. because the secrets you come across along the way will also contribute to your perspective on the overall story. and don't skip any conversations. talk to the npcs until the end of the dialogue and there are things that surprise you. art the elden ring's overall art may not be something everyone likes. if you like rainbows and dynamic, cheerful, modern colors. then perhaps elden ring is quite outdated for you. elden ring has an ancient, mysterious art style and a great overall tone. you won't feel it's lame. it is in harmony. they have balanced aesthetics into a large world. makes you feel like a part of it. the landscape is filled with a multitude of things, the ecology changes from region to region, the weather and light pervades everywhere. dark caves and majestic castles were everywhere, beneath the shining erdtree's shadow. it is hard to find this feeling in other open world games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,stutters with stupid stunt lock combos that they put in for every single enemy this is not a game that really thinks of what kind of enemies should have what kind of attack it seems like fromsoft just put in a bunch of those combos to make sure the game is harder
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"elden ring has a massive and content dense world to spend nearly hundred hours per play through in. the release version was buggy and prone to crashing, but i'm scoring elden ring beyond these fixable issues, since it will be the game of the decade."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,worst pc port  i've ever played  an absolute abomindation to any true pc player. if you require a controller to be able to play a pc game you should never release the game on pc.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"an absolute masterpiece in my opinion, game does have some heavy frame rate issues and a few crashes for me personally, the online has some disconnection issues as well but my overall experience with how good it is and how expansive and wonderful the world is to explore those issues that i know will be fixed don't bother me, i'm 50 hours into the game writing this and i have no doubt it will become game of the year and it's well deserved. it's sad to see the game being review bombed and given 0's over the issues it has or things like bad graphics the game is incredibly beautiful in my opinion. it's no horizon forbidden west which is fine, the environment and style do a lot for me fromsoft are in a master craft of world building and art style. i have a hard time due to disabilities staying with games i feel i'm not good at and i give up quite easily but for some reason i haven't even had to take a break from the game. i've gotten angry yes but something in me kept wanting to persevere and complete the task i was stuck on and doing so gave me a feeling i can't quite describe. it's honestly been great overall for my mental health which probably sounds crazy but finding out i can actually keep going and accomplish something that' seems incredibly difficult is amazing for me. the massive amount of hate i've seen recently for the smallest of reasons is saddening but it doesn't change how great the game is. the game is also incredibly accessible to newer players or people who had a hard time with previous games. yes it's still very difficult at times but you have the opportunity to explore the entire world and gear yourself and power yourself up for encounters you feel you cant handle yet and it highly rewards you for exploring. if you're too afraid to try the game because you've hard how difficult it is, give it a try anyway i think you'll find a fantastic game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,worst optimized game i have ever seen my life and  graphics.literally unplayable
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"amazing. some stuttering framerates, but minor. hopefully will be fixed soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"so my character says only 21 hours. though, my hours should be around 27. this is because of saving not working. well more so, save corrupting. i am a constant saver in video games, even if i don't go back all the time i'll make hundreds of save files. so i see a new zone in elden ring i walk into it so it saves, i see a grace i activate it to saveor rest, i talk to a vendor to save, etc. so, it annoys me that i lost 6 hours worth of my progress. not to mention all the other glitches you have to deal with constantly. now to go on one glitch rn is that most entities are just invisible. the only ones i've noticed not to turn invisible are the enemies that are so large that they have multiple lock on points and bosses, everything else is free range to turn invisible. ohh you are on the road? well i guess 4 knights are attacking you now. you wanted talk to a trader? better remember where they sit. plus, it does not help when you get the glitch where your light attack does not want to work. at first i thought i broke my new controller that i just bought a month before elden ring came out, but then i tried to light attack with my mouse and it would not work. heavy attack would work fine but light attack just was not having it. does not help to drop down to 2 frames every 5 seconds at some points or areas so you can not advance to certain points. plus, the game just freezes for 5 to 15 seconds at a time like have a chill have some water. which is weird that these things are happening as i am running on low graphics for everything, except grass which the lowest is medium and i put render distance to medium cause it actually ran better. though, my pc is not the best i have put around 1000 usd worth of parts into it, but still it should not be like this. this is not to big of a problem, but in areas with poison sludge when you are well out of the sludge and did not get the poison effect sometimes the effect will still build up so you will end up getting poisoned. if you're leaving an area, or just running through it quickly i can see it messing you up though. this is all i can think of currently, but i know i am sure to encounter more things. i will not be playing this game anymore though till fromsoftware and bandi namco can fix the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,one of the best games ever made. people who are giving bad reviews because they  are hilarious. hate the player not the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this game is one of the best open world experiences. don't let review bombers sway your opinion because they can't handle something popular being good that they don't like. yes, it's hars, but it's made that way so you naturally improve and eventually celebrate when you overcome the obstacle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"bad performance on pc right now and mouse and keyboard and mouse controls are not ideal. as for gameplay and graphics it is nothing special either. a rehash of previous games, particularly in boss fights, without much that is new, especially in regards to models and animations. i do hope this lazy formula is on the way out for future from software games. ironically it seems the remaster of from software's first souls game, demon's souls is the companies benchmark to beat. i would like to see something more along the lines of the first half of dark souls 1 with 80 hours of slow burn and perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, refined level design and a heroic journey. no warping, big lead up to bosses and high stakes. fromsoftware keeps nearly making a great game but is every time an unfulfilled promise. dark souls was almost this but the second half was obviously rushed. demons souls, dark souls i and ii are still the best games they have made and fromsoftware is still to top them. they must take the best successes of all their previous releases and make something great. to me, elden ring is not this. the horse platforming is a kind of fun mini game but overall the open world is tedious and doesn't feel like you are really exploring anything. when the game goes back to the original dark souls style in stormfront castle the game feels much better and after seeing what it had to offer, to me the open world aspect with a huge influence from breath of the wild, of the game is a big waste of resources when they could have been designing a much more dense linear environment. fighting is overwhelmingly tedious compared to previous games and rushing past enemies to the bosses or checkpoints is the best strategy which seems like a flaw in the design. killing enemies does not reward enough souls to make it worthwhile. boss fights no longer have a strategy you can learn over time so you can eventually outsmart them and fights become a war of attrition and based on luck as opposed to feeling like you are actually fighting the enemy in a meaningful way as for example they were in sekiro. elden ring overall feels like it is spread too thin trying to have too much content."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"para comenzar si , el juego tiene problemas de rendimiento a lo cual ya dijeron que estn trabajando en un parche que estar disponible muy pronto y bueno por eso mi 8 pero dejando de lado eso, el juego es una joya con un maa inmenso, hermoso y raro a la vez con infinidad de lugares por explorar , cosa que te ser recompensada ya sea encontrando runas para mejorar tu personaje , hechizos, invocacin y armas , ademas que es esencial si quieres hacer el juego un poco mas amigable , es de esos juegos que si corres a hacer los objeto principales te va ir muy mal , pero si te lo tomas con calma , exploras y mejoras, solo te ira mal xd . un juego que guarda secretos en cada rincn del mapa que te motivarn a seguir explorando. este es mi primer juego tipo souls que me atrevo a jugar y la dificultad a veces me hace sudar , pero tomndolo con calma el camino se hace un poco mas llevadero"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"easily the greatest game of all time hands down. if you rush you can make it the hardest souls game you've ever played. if you take it a bit slower, it will be similar in difficulty to the old games. if you take it very slow and outlevel content it also fits the bit more casual player, although don't think it will be easy. the open world and questing system are the new benchmark for the entire genre. for me it's one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"just awful pc performance on a 3080. story seems cool, could be a good game underneath, but im not gonna play until its fixed. i don't understand how a legitimate pc game review can give games like this a 10, when its obvious it has at least a few technical flaws. i would have given it an 8 myself, but its obvious the company decided to spend quite a bit of money getting game of the year, rather than polishing their game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i love the souls series but this is getting a low score due to the constant connection errors through steam, fix it! literally i almost kill a boss most specifically radahn with a friend then get connection error every time! its a joke"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"overhyped garbage . ps4 level graphics with horrendous performance on high end hardware. terrible stutters and framedrops. the game itself is also pretty boring and bland. frustrating af for no reason just so they can claim it is difficult and soul's like. terrible gaming mechanics and lazy devs. there is no way to keep track of what the hell you are doing and what have you done. halfbaked at best. how the critics gave them 1010 is beyond me. horrible game that frustrates not only with it's halfbaked gameplay but also with its terrible performance. avoid at all costs, don't waste your time and do not support this trash with your hardearned money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"looking at purely from an artistic standpoint, the game is really cool. however this has to be one of the worst pc ports i have ever seen. optimization is just non existent and it has some very noticeable pop in. game really needs to get optimized stat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"unbelievably overrated. easily the worst game of the year.. quite possibly in the running for one of the worst games ever published. terrible garish art. a nearly non existent story, there's nothing compelling or engaging about it. the only thing that makes it challenging or hard is that the controls are so clunky and terribly bad. borrowed from another reviewer but this is spot on and 100 percent what i'm feeling right now some calling it innovative and next step in making open world games, something that shows other companies how to make open world games? i mean, are you guy high or something? actually serious? kidding me? did you even play red dead redemption 2 or are souls games literally only games you play and you have never experienced an actual open world game, so you just assume, that elden ring's open world is something incredible? i'm disgusted with these reviews and i'm sure other companies are as well. this is literal insult to gaming in general."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i cant get enough of this game its perfect, ive always wanted a game like this. best game ever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i have never played a from software game before, so this will be a new player perspective. first of all, the game looks interesting and cool. that's why i decided to buy it. but going deeper and deeper into this game, it shows its flaws. so starting the game something that stood out for me was the bad performance on pc. this was horrible from the start. using my mouse and keyboard resulted in powerpoint like fps which was unplayable. so it forced me to play with the controller which fixed the problem somehow. then still, the game is capped at 60 fps with mediocre graphics for a game released in 2022, there's fps drops when exploring and fighting bosses. even with a 6900xt, the fps sometimes hit as low as 15 for a couple of seconds. then there's the fighting. the enemy locking system is confusing and does not work properly most of the time. getting hit by a boss attack while standing multiple meters clear of impact. getting killed through the wall. using the mount to fight is also very buggy and inconsistent and makes the camera shoot all over the place when getting close to terrain or enemies. the biggest flaw in my opinion is the multiplayer coop. i thought this would be like a whole play through coop mode, instead it's just helping to kill the boss and bye my friend. this is not fun if you want to play with friends. it feels like there is no story in this game, which is making the game feel a bit empty in my opinion. i think this also makes the game more confusing to new players since i have no clue what i am supposed to do and how to progress, get items, level up and so on. the sound design is also not that good. the constant background music which stays the same the whole time you play, the buggy monster sounds and volume balance is just annoying. the world design looks like they just had a pile of assets and threw them into the game without looking where they went. it's very messy with assets going through each other and a lot of cut off edges, especially when looking at the awful water. the game doesn't even automatically change key prompts from keyboardmouse to controller, the menus are weird layout wise and there's not that many graphics settings. not that it matters because the game doesn't look good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"amazing game with a polish and tried and true combat system, with the introduction of posture damage, guard counters, horse combat and a more diverse and interesting magic system, the combat has never felt better. the world carries that classic fromsoftware charm, and there is never a dull moment, and unlike other open world games, exploring off the beaten path seems to always result in a worthy and interesting reward."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,thank you miyazaki! you made a masterpiece! mesmerizing landscapes and bosses! mechanic is awesome! i made some changes settings in windows 10 and motherboard and it's running perfectly
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"truly an amazing game, will probably be goty. this is what games should be, players actually have to pay attention to the story, how to approach fights...there's no open world bloat with repetitive sidequests, no mindless waypoint pointing where you should go next, to yet another mindless fight. each enemy feels unique, characters can be built exactly how you want and fight very differently, a true rpg. there's also an actual sense of accomplishment for getting past bosses unlike most games today, skills matter here, no button mashing allowed. graphics are solid, not amazing but fs games definitely have a distinctive look and feel, almost like a painting, fits the fantasy genre very well. the gameplay is fun as hell and the story isn't completely hitting you over the head every second, you actually have to pay attention and piece things together. the only thing that keeps it from getting a 9 or even a 10 possibly are the micro stutters that still happen, they can be frustrating especially when in the middle of a fight."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"best game i've played in years, very addicting. leaving 10 stars to negate a whiner"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"great game, no lag issues with a standard rig from my end. challenging enough but not too hard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"if you're reading this, and love dark souls. just buy it. ignore all reviews. judge for yourself. if you have never played a dark souls game. this will be your easiest entry. but if you get frustrated easily, break controllers on losses, or have very short attention span... this may not be the game for you. my review will be mostly addressing the review bombers complaints. my pc specs for disclosure i'm running this on pc with a ryzen 9 3900x, gtx 1660ti and 32gb of ram and have been running it on 1080p. i personally have no issues with performance myself, though i acknowledge that other pc users have. i have 50 hrs into this game stutters the stutters that i have seen others experiencing however are not game breaking. they look slightly annoying but seem to happen only on the first load of something you haven't seen before and still only seldomly regardless. if you are enjoying the game you will barely notice them according to a friend who is experiencing them i removed 1 point for that on my score and no more due to the review bombers doing more then their fair share already with zero scores for little to no reasons. just a souls game review bombers are complaining its just another souls game but in an open world. yes that's exactly what it is. and its what we were always told we were getting. this was literally never a secret. from day one of its announcement we all knew that, and its exactly what the fans wanted. everyone saw the gameplay prior to purchase. don't act surprised. combat review bombers have made claims that the combat is clunky. i assure you it is not. as a matter of fact it is extremely precise. as are the hitboxes. what may make it feel clunky, is if you button mash. this game, as all prior souls games have, punishes button mashing rather then rewarding it. animation yes there is truth to animations being reused or in the case of npc's talking. downright lazy on the developers. it would be nice to see an effort made there. i don't mind reusing some old properties on some of the enemies attacks. as there is far more new enemies with all new abilities. graphics outdated looking graphics? this is a lazy complaint. the game is quite gorgeous. could it be better. yes. is it bad. no. and it certainly isn't so awful it deserves a zero score for the entire game. open world the bombers are also complaining the open world isn't rewarding or is dead space? this couldn't be further from the truth. you can't go more then a few seconds in any direction without finding a dungeon, a mini boss, a secret cave, an item or an npc. elden ring is one of if not the most densly packed open worlds i've ever played. story people complaining that there is no story? the merit to this is that no, once again the game doesn't hold your hand and jam the plot down your throat with cutscene after cutscene. as a matter of fact if you aren't closely listening or reading you will very likely get lost in the plot as they don't rehash whos related to who or what things are over and over again. but there is story. and you get more and more of it with every npc interaction you have. and its actually relatively easy to follow if you pay attention. quest log its true the game doesn't give you a quest log. and it can be kind of hard to know where to go at times. however the game tells you exactly where to go right off the bat if you speak to the first npc you meet once entering the open world. and once you follow that bit to conclusion an npc at the main hub round table tells you exactly where and who you need to beat next with lore and story on each enemy. hell your map even marks where you are supposed to go for these with bright golden waves regardless whether you spoke to this npc or not. difficulty last but not least. its difficult. and there are built in ways to make it easier but no there isn't an option on the main menu. while it seems like a troll move. hardcore players only advice to give you is to git gud but that's because its literally the only advice they can give you. there is no secret weapon or armor to make it easy. those can help but what matters is your skill. timing, rolls, parries, strategy and patience. don't button mash, pay attention to your opponents move sets. avoid getting greedy in dealing damage. yes its hard. but in order to push forward, you learn from your mistakes and don't be afraid to get some help from some coop if you need it. git gud sound a bit trolly. but its also the best advice you can be given. conclusion if you enjoy dark souls games you will love this game. it's open world is beautiful. the combat is clean and precise. there are tons of ways to customize your character to be unique to you and like never before. there are a ton of quality of life upgrades, praise the jump take the review bombers with a grain of salt. in my opinion most of their complaints are likely to justify quitting because it was difficult."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,despite the stuttering which for me doesn't happen much i absolutely love this game. i love the difficulty and the open world. i believe this game has tons of replay value with all of the different builds possible. would absolutely recommend this game to anyone.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"the games stutters every few seconds, it is locked to just 60 frames per second, does not offer the option to change fov and the performance is far from good which makes the lack of dlssfsr even worse. ray tracing is also not present at the moment of writing, but it is supposed to be added in a later update. the stutters are constantly present and they plague every system not even rtx 3090 and 12900k are capable of maintaining a constant 60fps at 720p. behind all of these issues is a great game, but the performance issues are so severe it is impossible to look past them. if we put the performance issues aside, calling this game great would be an understatement, but the issues cannot be ignored. heavily recommend, but only once it is fixed, if it gets fixed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,en sierras ocasiones hay un bajn de fps un mundo abierto muy entretenido siempre hay algo que hacer uno de los mejores juegos que e jugado ltimamente
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"people are hating on this game just to hate, it's ridiculous. the game is absolutely amazing! there's lots of people claiming that only diehard souls fans will like this game and ignore all flaws, however this is my first souls game and i'm loving every moment of it. the bosses are hard, but they're not unfair. if i die, it's because i made a mistake, not because the boss spammed an overpowered, unavoidable move. everything is counterable and you just have to find out how, which is what makes beating a boss so rewarding"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i hate this game but it's one of best games i've ever played. hope fromsoftware will fix performance issues on pc asap, so it would be perfect then."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"elden ring is a fantastic game. if you like exploring, getting lost, and don't mind punishing gameplay go ahead. if you want a game that holds your hand and tells you exactly what to do when to do and how to do it, than is not for you. pc has some performance issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"while i am not a stranger to difficult games, i've never took a dive into the soulslike genre. elden ring has therefore been my first proper look at this style of game, straight from the developers that made the genre flourish. now, with 24 hours of play time, i'm ready to lay down some thoughts and provide a rating, though this could potentially change later if my feelings change. open world almost feels like a dirty word these days, and many people struggle to find big open maps engaging. i feel that elden ring really experiences both highs and lows from the open world it adopted it can lead to some incredible moments at times, but can equally leave the game feeling like it lacks compelling content at other times. combat in elden ring is generally fun, with a good range of options to approach a battle from, although sometimes you might press a button and have to wait a while before your character decides to act on it which can lead to you getting hit. bosses in the game are mostly good fights, with many of them teaching you important skills or lessons for later in the game, although a couple of bosses feel like they were not very well thought out. the music... well i don't remember any of it sadly, though when it is used it feels like it fits a situation well. many people have complained about the optimisation on pc. i'm not sure why  my pc isn't the best, and some parts i'm using are the bare minimum for the game to run, but i've only suffered minor dips to framerate which doesn't bother me at all. my whole experience with elden ring has been overall positive, but full of problems big and small. i've only encountered one bug where i got stuck while on the horse and died 20 seconds later. regardless, i think it's difficult to say if i would recommend the game. if you're interested in the genre, give it a shot. if you aren't then it's most likely best to steer clear. edit after beating the game, i don't want to change my score at all. i feel that, as the game progressed, other strengths and weaknesses were revealed to me. while i believe the open world structure definitely excelled at tugging on my sense of discovery, i also think that it resulted in me missing a large amount of potentially brilliant content. along with this, i feel that the game would do well to adopt some potential tips or accessibility options for newer players or those who struggle with these sorts of games. this would help to make sure that even if the game remains difficult, a player is never truly stuck."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"hello fromsoftware. i have to start this review saying we are in 2022. it's kinda obv but i had to say that. in 2022, u can't develop a game with fps cap at 60. in 2022, u can't develop a game without ultrawide support. ok, u never did ultrawide support but before we had mod making your game better. now u put easy anti cheat so every mod we put in make us banned from the game, also ultrawide mod. spoiler modders says make ultrawide mode cost 30minutes, so imagine how long it would take you but you don't care about costumers. in 2022, u provide us a game with a 2gen old graphic it's something like ps3. ok it doesn't matter but let it run flawless. no. it strutter like no tomorrow. i have a 3080 ti and the frame already capped a 60fps drops to 30 in every moment of the game, bossfight included. in 2022, u are lacking every good features existing in the world like dlss, ray tracing, amd fsr etc. where is steam cloud? we are still in the age where if you format the pc you lose all the saves? why if i want close the game i have return to menu watching everytime the from's logo and bandai's logo and only after i can close the game. maybe u could make closing the game just a little bit faster? you didn't find time for make this game playable and enjoyable on pc and xbox also there is exrtemely bad optimizated but u found the time for develop haptic feedback on ps5 the game on ps5 work properly, more or less. that's why u only focussed on ps5 cause u don't care about other customers. u provided us a game in a shameful state and your politics is even more shameful the game itself is good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"note english isn't my first language and if you are going to criticize me for my grammar then maybe come up with a better argument. gotta love how people review bombed this lol. the game itself is a marvel. bad graphic? i don't think so. the texture and details of you and the enemies' armor are well made, the map design is also one best i have ever seen. bad control? these guys probably spam roll all the time and expect to have unlimited iframe invincibility frame and stamina. or in another case find something in the settings that are called key bindings. lazy game design? more than 70 unique encounters and f load of dungeons and catacombs scattered around the map, i wouldn't call that a lazy game. no quest log? having no questog is what makes the game immersive. plus, grace aka checkpoints in the game show on the map the direction where you need to go. the game is too hard? in elden ring, you are free to farm to be overleveled and fight the boss which makes it easier than the previous soul titles, or maybe just quit crying and try to get good at the game. all these people who review bombed this can't come up with an original idea and i'm pretty sure they don't even own the game, all they saw was elden ring has bad graphics elden ring is too hard elden ring doesn't have a quest log. and that's literally like the only thing they review bombed this for. anyway, the game itself is packed with a load of content and a lot of replay potential. it's definitely worth 60 bucks."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is the second time in my life i give a 9 to a game. if you gave this game less than a 9 there could only be for 2 reasons  too difficult for you, go play hello kitty online in that case.  technical issues. sure the game could use some tweakings but for the love of god, what's not to like in this game. amazing world, lore, progression, characters, battle system, crafting... it has absolutely everything. even stealth and assassination. my only gripe is lack of proper necromancy here. which may exist because there is a lot in this game that remains undiscovered."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"giant overhype. first of all, lets talk about the horrible pc port if this game. no ultrawide support, terrible control scheme, capped at 60 fps if the damn thing even runs. from software have been getting away with the garbage pc ports for years and its just stupid. now, about the actual game.  graphics are just the same as the rest of the souls games not good not bad just meh. the ui is especially bad particularly on pc. it is just the same old boring, cluttered silly ui as the other souls games but this time with the addition of a terrible looking map.  gameplay. ive finished the other souls games and i am no stranger to the gameplay and combat but i just dont think it fits an open world. i never found myself wanting to stop and fight some enemies or farm some ingredients or xp because the combat is slow paced and boring. there is 0 innovation on the combat front. the world is empty, when you find a quest its not written down anywhere and is delivered in vague terms so you are at risk of ending up forgetting the damn thing. i shouldnt have to keep a pen and paper next to me write stuff down. a lot of the choices the devs made are just bad user experience not good design.  story. its a souls game story trough and trough but this time with the addition of an extra pretentious writer who wrote an extra pretentious deep story."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"it is now almost a week since the release of the game and still the from software does not move to fix the game, i predetermined it over 1 month ago but i had to get a refund, always the white screen is received with my video card."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"despite the poor performance, it's an instant classic that rivals botw in terms of scope and exploration."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,not support 219 limited frame late 60fps  optimization  keyboard custumization
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,i see people complaining for it being too hard get a grip its a souls game. people came into this knowing who it was made by and what the type of game it stands for. either get good or stop playing it is a niche game market for people who enjoy a challenge if you cannot step it up and make en effort to get good at it stop complaining and go play a game that rewards players for the bare minimum. 1010 game from did it again with an amazing game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i love this game! i've already sunk in over 25 hours since launch. it is frustratingly hard, but it feels like next time you have it for sure, over and over hahahaha. i started out as a wretch class, with no previous soulslike game experience. i died like 10 times to the first creature a wolf i found but i loved it! it felt so fresh and exciting. slowly finding new weapons, skills, abilities was so fun and rewarding. this game would be a great game to stream, so many random ways to die, so many stupid mistakes. i would have given it a 10 but there are some graphical freezesissues that, while i notice them, aren't game killing for me.. yet."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"absolutely amazing game that is near impossible to put down. the massive open world is brimming with enemies, dungeons, loot, and secrets. graphics and art style are top notch. combat is fast and brutal, the best from from so far. this game had a coordinated review bomb from some lonely neck beards living in their mom's basement, don't listen to the 0 star incels."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"the performance issue are nothing compared to the explendid game itself, it's no joke, one of the best games ever!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this game is a culmination of everything fromsoft has done until now. it is vast, ambitious, and beautiful to behold. the game doesn't just feel like the perfection of a souls game, it feels like an evolution of it. this game will be talked about for years to come."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"the greatest innovations of this iteration of demon's souls are mechanics from the decade prior to demon's souls. jumping, horses, open worlds. wow, why didn't we think of that before? like pretty much every from game since around the das 2bb era you can quickly use this game as a proverbial dipstick or smell test to see how susceptible someone is to media hype in video games. it's not a new franchise, it's not a bold new direction, it's just red guys hitting you from 10 feet away and luring you into enemies again. this is like calling quake 2 fresh because you have an inventory like in hexen. there's no reason anyone should care. edit ok, bad analogy, it's actually like if quake came out every 2 years between 1996 and 2009, and each time it had that room in gloom keep where you grab the gold key and the shambler pops out, only this time in 2009 everyone's saying that the shambler's art design is incredible and it's probably the best game they've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,this is the best game i've ever played. graphics have improved greatly since ds3 and there are countless improvements and additions to the old souls formula. the map is massive and there are countless locations to explore.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"a great open world, great creature designs, great bosses and great gameplay, this game is on top."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"amazing game, amazing atmosphere, amazing gameplay, amazing music, amazing ideas. after elden ring we need something new, its everything we have ever dreamed a fantasy rpg to be. 0 only because its 60fps capped instead of 144? lmao i almost believed it but than i heard the crying on dying on margit maybe even before."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i am appalled by people what people is complaining about. i've a slightly above the minimum pc and i'm playing basically without any worries. true, sometimes while running in the open the game stutters, or the frame drop to 25, but usually i'm between 4555 fps and have never experienced this with a boss nor i died because of this. and yet some people compare this to cp77? probably are running a potato or never bothered updating a driver. and this is the medium level of the critic i play on keyboard and mouse and it shows me controller input. to be fair to me these are quite forgettable critics. i mean, come on, does people really get the difference between 60 and 144 fps? long story short performance are fine. they'll likely be improved, because yes they can, but are fine and there is no such thing as a 0, litterally unplayable, if you don't have cognitive dissonance. then gameplay, history, lore, mechanics, aesthetic, everything is amazing and perfect. is also kind of hard dark souls hard and i suspect this to be the main problem of many negative reviews. thank you margit. this along with missing the go there, do that point on the map, but again, as usually fromsoftware does. you can understand what to do and usually is kill everyone and where to go the moment you think about it. i mean, a npc told you go north you go north, even if in the map there is no sign, right? i'm speechless by how many times i read stuff like this. this is likely to remain as a masterpiece in the years and decade to come. it is not a revolution, or a total innovation, but it's the peak of several genres."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"played on a mediumend laptop, on medium graphics. world was beautiful, game play was challenging but fun when successful. game crashed once but i blame discord overlay. exploring the world is the best part, especially when finding hidden stuff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"excellent game. i have had performance issues on a fairly high end rig, but they are nowhere near as bad as reviewers and fans have been claiming for me, anyway. the idea that the performance issues should drop the score i think is pretty absurd as i am pretty confident it will be patched and they have had no impact on gameplay for me. in terms of the game itself, i give it a 10 out of 10 because none of the flaws are objective in nature. there are subjective flaws based on one's tastes but that's not the point of a review. i get bored of most games very quickly but have struggled to pull myself out of elden ring. it has the smoothest gameplay of anything in the genre due to the colossal world. if you are challenged by a difficult foe, you simply travel somewhere else and find something new to do. the art direction and world design, the latter of which has plainly benefited from george r. r. martin's contributions, is spectacular. i find myself very curious about the characters, places, creatures, and environments and eager to learn more. for instance, a gruesome and vile enemy, the godskin nobleapostle, has me fascinated about their origins and whose skin they are wearing. they are perhaps the most unsettling bosses i've seen from design yet. the gameplay is superficially a step back from sekiro, but one must consider the constraints imposed by the gargantuan variety of character equipment, skills, magic and so on. from that vantage point, it is a clear and unambiguous step forward for other action rpg's from has created, and so far has the best fights i have seen in the series yet aside from sekiro, which is competitive or still somewhat superior, although i have not finished elden ring yet. now, if you're not a fan of from's work and related work in this sub genre, i think elden ring may sway you, but it still has incredible challenges and other issues that will turn players off if they bounced off before. i would still recommend it unless you are absolutely not a fan of this style of game. in closing, i'm not sure what the point of having a 10 point scale is if this isn't a 10."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"deadirons you need to shut the hell up bruh you sound so entitled right now along with every other pc user whining about frames.... money grab you say then don't play it, not cause it is that but because you have no shame in mislabeling a beauty  just to fit your own pathetic narrative, this is why i hate pc players. the game is a masterpiece and no amount of crying is gonna change that so keep doing so soyboy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,amazing game from from software and is the best place to start for a souls like game. i can't wait to actually achieve the ending and 100 of this game. i have 30 hours and that is spent exploring and one main story boss.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,gameplay is good but it has many glitches like some times torrent just becomes invisible and it looks like i'm floating and some times the enemy's like some guards become invisible but their hand torches are visible just fix it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,having played some of the other souls games i had some pretty high expectations for elden ring. this game undoubtedly just reskinned several assets however the open world and improved combatenemies just took an already outstanding formula and expended upon it. now i understand many people had performance issues with the game and were disappointed that the game was not especially optimised for pc but with any fairly decent pc the game should run with only a few choppy moments
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"where to start. well let's begin with all the 1010 reviews. i do believe it is a amazing game, and i really enjoy it, but it has its flaws. network code not much improvement from dark souls 3 and in general, online is a bit hard to get into. had one item activated that should summon me into other people their world when they got invaded but never happened. pc buildstable fps it is from software their first open world and mistakes will be made. where i didn't have too bad of a fps drop on pc, i know others did. and i sure had some awful frame drops myself during certain fights. in the end, it will be patched out rather sooner then later so i do not feel like it is too far of a point to judge on. open world their first open world and they nailed it. the moment you step out of the introduction area, you can go wherever you wish to go in a stunning looking world. walk around and stumble upon a cave? well it has some neat loot in it and worth a grab. by far the best open world game for me. difficulty the game can be as difficult or easy as you make it. the first boss people seem to be having issues with is margrit, who is indeed difficult. but it teaches you to do something else. go out and explore, level up, get stronger weapons and then return to properly fight him. everything together, it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. not everything is perfect, but which game is? a true love letter to the fans of the dark souls series."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,this is amazing even if die over and over again but this is a solid great game please play it as long as you dont mind the deaths the many deaths 9999999 out of 9999999 good game! oh and if complain about how hard the game is then get gud or dont get souls games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"decent game, but i would like more to have like guides, or at least visible active quests with information what to find."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"don't waste your time with this dumpster fire. play elder scrolls online instead, it's everything this game wishes it could be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is probably one of the best games ever made. despite some issues on the pc port that the company is improving constantly, the game is flawless to its very core. it combines aspects of open world games and rpg mechanics better than many other action rpgs. fair warning the game is not for everyone as it requires a lot of time spending to learn its mechanics. if someone is looking to breeze his way into the final boss he will be disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,ran better after i enabled this from graphics settings press the window ski and do search for graphic settings browse for the game then put for high performance improved performance
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"from software once again demonstrate why they are so beloved by the fans. they know what they are doing when making a particular kind of game, and they have perfectly adapted everything they learnt from dark souls, bloodborne and sekiro to make an extremely engaging and breathtaking open world. unfortunately the game is held back by its technical limitations. i think there would be a lot less complaints about the graphics if the performance was good, but it isn't. the pc performance ranges from acceptable to poor. a vast majority of the time you won't notice the problems, but when you do, boy is it bad. overall, it is a fantastic game and a definite must buy if you are a fan of from software or open world games"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i see that the game has some notable negative reviews. some are mad and refunding the game. i have three responses 1 i rage quit dark souls back in 2012 after 3 hours of frustrating play. but after putting down the game for a week, clearing my head, and watching guides, i went back to playing what i discovered to be my favorite game series for years. for those initially disappointed, i encourage you to take a break, watch some guides, and try again! 2 if its really not for you, thats perfectly fine! there are great games that i would absolutely refuse to play ninja gaiden series, nioh etc. after trying it out a bit, solely because its not my type of game. i respect those games nonetheless and would never hate on them just because i dont like them. 3 if youre somehow angry at the game for the high critic reviews, im glad that from angered the right people not their longtime fans. as a longtime souls player, im not angry in it in the slightest. some people overhyped this game to be something its not, but its what i wanted as a longtime fan of fromsoftware an excellent game that pushes the genre to another level while keeping its core identity. its not a perfect game by any means. the bugs for many people are horrible, and i hope theyre fixed soon. and though im very happy with it, its not 100 what i expected from the game. i was hoping for a more majestic open world, and not another decaying, postfallofthegods kind of story. the world could be less drab and foggy. but for a guy who impulsively bought dark souls prepare to die edition 10 years ago and ended up loving the series, i can see that this game was made with a lot of love. more room for improvement means more games. i will eagerly await the next fromsoftware game. until then, ill happily get lost in the lands between for the next few years. its a 1010 for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is currently sitting above god of war on the metacritic score. that would be the god of war with the fantastic graphics, story, combat, exploration, acting, and pc optimization. after playing elden ring for a few days now, i'm just here to point that out. read the  reviewer who gave it a 70. apparently he's the only critic who escaped the fromsoft reality distortion field. the graphics, the bad pc port, or the bugs alone should be putting any score above 80 out of reach for this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,this game takes everything that is great from earlier fromsoft games and combines it in an awesome way. it still feels like a souls game. the open world was made in a great way. it feels like you really explore and not just run from questmarker to questmarker like in other games. even if you prefer closer leveldesign the castles really give you that soulslike mapdesign. the amount of content in this game is just insane. overall a great game that exceeds my expectations.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"it plagues me to rate this game like this, truly. however due to deliberately blocking widescreen support, you have to use a mod to properly use your 219 monitor, which then bans you from online play. since i love soulsgames especially for the online pvp and the devs are deliberately blocking me out of it because i have invested hard earned money in a more expensive rig and monitor, i feel extremely excluded."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"all of the complaints are standard. this is tiresome. all of the complaints are from newcomers who clearly haven't played much of fromsoftware's catalogue. the game meets or exceeds the bar set by soulsborne fans. serious but short drops in framerate are easily managed. i have died once due to it and i have played for 15 hours. story... to the people complaining that there is none the story is always hard to understand but it is told through item descriptions and the environment. it is like a puzzle and it is my favorite part of these games. kick rocks. gameplay clean hit registry that is fair. if you die, it is your own fault. 's hard. are you new or something? graphics unfortunately dated but still beautiful."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"going past the stuttering and a horrible port, it is typical fromsoftware stuff  a horrendous grind fest, a mindless slog and rewardless gitguddery. the open world is graphically substandard very much so  think cca 2014, utterly lifeless and uninteresting with often reused enemies and terrible dungeon design. it's a slappedon gimmick and makes cyberpunk's terribly dead open world look lively. the ui is pure horror, as is standard for fs, but surprisingly the game also backtracks on some of the good changes from sekiro, namely a relatively sane combat system and logical gameplay progression. be warned!  only for hardcore souls fans, massively unfun, and terribly ported."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"if you like dark souls, go ahead and buy this game. if not, be prepared this game offers nothing more than endless action in a depressing greyscale world of dead people. the mobs are machinations with shamelessly limited ai for this era. the only reason i bought this game is because the rave reviews of obviously paid reviewers oversold it. these people should be ashamed of themselves. update having played 12 hours, its a lot better than i initially thought. a solid 8. very enjoyable now that i have a grip on how the game plays and have reframed my expectations"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"it's ridiculous that after 2 patches, the invisible enemies bug still goes on, it's an issue that can completly ruin your experience, really it's more important fix the popping or whatever than people can actually play?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"just like breath of the wild did a while ago elden ring shows how a open world game should work. there is no quest log, there is no mini map, there are no directions just your intuition and information you will only get by jumping into the world and start exploring. elden ring map is as beautiful as it is in size, there are many regions each of them with its own aesthetic and each of them more epic then the last, it is just so vast and rich in content that there will be times where you question how the hell was this game produced. there are an insane amount of different enemies each of them with their own powers and fighting patterns and the boss fights are glorious. the only thing that makes this game a 9 instead of a 10 is the performance in pc which to be honest is in an unacceptable state but the game is so good you will try to forget about this. i give it a 10 to compensate the 0, isn't it how metacritic works?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"this game is truly a masterpiece. when you are exploring the lands between, you will have a strong feeling that each part of this world is carefully designed and arranged. btw, this epic game is really massive. i've spent nearly 30 hours on it and only explored about 40."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"its not a souls game,its a sandbox mmorpg game if you want to go on main story you should level up and you should farm for level up. its like ubisoft  its okay.this is a good game but... we just want to better optimization games real score is 9 for me but with this technical problems0"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,just another copy paste deamon souls without any creativity or major development. excruciating long fights where you hit bosses and dodge role and wait for a chance to attack again. there are no chances to be aggressive or creative. inventory and skills could be simplified or made more unique then every other game they have made. it pains me to play and i cant even watch steamers play it because they are having the same negative reactions about the game that i think when i play it. this is a copy paste game that was over hyped. not cyberpunk levels but pretty overhyped.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"a truly masterpiece , try this game before review play with spec i712700k and 3070 ti with minimal shutter when explore open world the world is full of suprise things and sometime you active it without know how to do that again, just wandering around limgrave now but there still many thing to explore. like all of the others souls games , the boss fight is epic , if you want hard it hard , if you want easy it easy. also the music is epic too. summary, i'm sure performance is problem but try it before review please."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,technical issues pretty much ruined my experience from constant stuttering to all out game crashes. how this game has a 95 score on pc by these so called professional critics is beyond me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"really just leaving this to try to balance out all the weird negative reviews. almost all of them seem to be just complaining that widescreen isn't supported or that it stutters for them. you're supposed to review the game. anyway i don't get it i'm running this on a gtx 1080 from 2017 and 16gb ram and getting no stuttering, a smooth 60fps, and i didn't even have to lower any settings. the game is hands down the best soulsborne experience i've had so far"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"why the fck metacritic put 95 on this  game??? i guess metacritic love to play 1520 fps game lollllll massive frame drop massive frame drop massive frame drop lot of issues massive frame drop for a tactical game bandai namco. you not working good on this important issues. i spend 90 for a dumb game,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,one of the best games action open world rpg of the last 10 years. quality and quantity are over the top. the masterpiece of from software.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,this game is dark souls if everything was turned up to 11 one of my favorite games of all time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,jajaja im  at video games and dont have hands or eyes so i give a 010 uninstall the game then  thanks for your cheese clowns.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"honeslty the worst game i've ever played. was kinda hyped by being an openworld, for the great reviews but this game is yet another example of how the review's aren't to be trusted nowdays. you beggin the game, nest thing you get is ultra hard boss, very hard to beat. game gives you literally no pointers. it is very hard to play it, but it's an artificial difficulty, sometimes boss don't even hit you and removes half of your hp, makes no sense. in my experience, dying light 2 for example was kinda harder, in a sense that you, the average player will have a good challenge with it but at the end you'll feel accomplished you beat the boss or whatever and you'll keep playing. this game? straight up impossible. it's not rewarding at all, it's just annoying, and after 8 hours of work last thing a person who's stressed during the day needs is game of this kind. i understand that some people like it, but many gamers got tricked by the reviews and the metascore. this isn't mean for the mainstream gamer, it's meant for one who likes a challenge and has a controller or two laying around to break and a lot of patience. also, did the reviewers even test this crap? performance is absolutely awful, i have a amd rx 6600 paired with 32 gb 3600mhz and a amd ryzen 5600x and this game lags wayyy too much and i don't even have the graphics set to maximum. this pc can run cyberpunk 2077 ultra without a problem. tldr don't trust the metascore, don't know what happened to this getting 95100, it trully doesn't deserve it. if you want a good openworld rewarding game to play in your free time, get dying light 2 or cyberpunk 2077, this is just bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"this port is a joke, an expensive one. one that will cost you 60 euro's. all these fanboys rating 10 should not be able to rate a game because its a  zero... performance is abysmal, 60 fps lock in 2022!? no widescreen support. big and constant stutters that destroy the immersion. the game doesn't even look good.truly no change in gpu usage between low and maximum settings... i knew that the gaming industry was bad and a money grab but really, i did not expect it from from software. but yeah they failed us too. fck em!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,theres a bunch of things that they need to fix for this game on pc version like the movement and mechanics as well as lag but other than that this games looks nice
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"ok. i created an account specially for this because i'm sick of stupid people who don't know fromsoft games and ragequit after the grafted scion leaving 010 reviews. so let me address some of the points that they made. 1. the pc port is horrible, and the stuttering is awful i personally am playing on a 2020 laptop not built for gaming, playing on high graphics, and the game has stuttered once very mildly at stormhill. i'm writing it off, but if your pc isn't good enough to play it on ultrahigh settings, perhaps consider lowering them rather than  about it on the internet. plus, imo, it's no grounds for leaving a 010 review. 2. the graphics are outdated the game is fking stunning, guys. plus, if you've ever played a fromsoft game, you'll know that graphics isn't the main priority. the lore, story, and gameplay are more important  leading me onto my next point 3. there's no lore! yes there is you  donkey. one piece of advice? play the game. 4. it's too hard i'm sorry, but there's an incredible technique  changed my life. you ready to hear it? ok, here goes git gud 5. it's just hype, people are lying and saying that it's good just because they're fanboys nope. i'ts been out for 5 days, and it's already one of my most played games in steam. that's not hype, that's astounding gameplay that forces you to keep on coming back. 6. it's not actually open world it's nothing new, open world isn't revolutionary it's so empty yes, it is open world. the definition states in video games, an open world is a game mechanic of using a virtual world that the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay no, it may not be revolutionary, but it's incredible to see the mix of dark souls and open world. that's what's revolutionary. and also, this is empty? i've never seen a less empty world  not skyrim, not botw, not any game. and finally, people comparing it to cyberpunk2077 did you guys even play it when it came out? it was full of bugs, and was virtually unplayable. now that's an example of overhype. i find it funny people doing no research, spending 60 dollars on a game that was not meant for them, and then leaving a rating of 0  decreasing the average to a measly 6.110 at time of writing. do i think it's 1010? probably not. imo it's 910, but i need to get these reviews up, so i added the extra point. great work miyazaki! keep it up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"interface and controls on pc kbmouse is a pain in the ass. really they didn't even manage to adopt it for pc. b, a, y, rb and lb what the hell it means? had to google for explanation. i though tes v had a bad interface now it seams to me perfect! to call torrent i have to hold e button and press 2 and i have no idea how to change it  unbelievable! world map ... took me a while to figure out how to fast travel and you cannot navigate it using mouse! world itself, game design and all the rest is perfect! really fromsoftware you have to do something about it it's 2022!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"don't buy the pc version, it is in an early alpha state. performance , graphics are part from ds3 with different textures, the engine seems to be the same as ds1. balancing is also not yet finished. story is the same procedure as last year. the ds approach with minimal story does not fit the open world concept. i also think, that no dev has played on pc. there is no other explanation for the stupid controls... i enjoyed ds1ds3 and sekiro on pc, but i start to see why some people hate this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"i don't want to be too harsh and give it a 0  as the majority of the 'game' itself is great. the scenery is good or what we can see of it at 169..... i enjoy that its difficult, i enjoy the world is huge and can be explored. gameplay wise i do think they could have done a far better job with a tutorial. instead of just a golden beam which leads you to an unkillable enemy then fend for yourself  maybe the first few destinations should have been some of the key items and easy dungeons to settle people in. an in game journal would be a great benefit too. but gameplay aside there are the horrific negatives  no ultrawide support or apparently.. its in game, and you render at it, but artificial black bars cover it? i cant for the life of me understand why they would do this. open world games with scenery like this are the exact reason ultrawide exists!! if its some kind of 'fair play' between console and pc gamers then its ridiculous. league of legends, one of the biggest most competitive games going allows ultrawide, and that legit gives you an edge in that game.  no nvidia dlss. a game with such wide open spaces and alot to render would benefit so much from dlss. it literally doubles or triples peoples performance with no visible negatives.  fps cap at 60  so so poor. console gamers find this bad framerate acceptable. pc gamers do not. if its not 120 it just feels clunky and broken.  no native ps controller icons in game when using it just shows xbox. how can they even get this wrong when the game literally is released for ps45 aswell and theyre the biggest sales by far over xbox. no fov options. game feels too close to character especially with no ultrawide!!!! for now im using the mod that took less than 24 hours to release btw!!! to get ultrawide and fps cap remove. which means cant play online  which  because i enjoy the message, blood patches etc. lets hope from games take this info on board  since there are thousands of players wanting it. its no good releasing a patch to fix these things months down the line when everyone has finished the game. i dont want to play through twice. i want to enjoy and play it now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"an extremely bad port, it's actually pretty difficult to even get through the character creation screens because it assumes you're not using a keyboardmouse and normal pc style keys just don't work e.g. the escape button doesn't work and right clicking does something super weird. the help at the bottom is essentially of a console controller and the only way to figure out what to do is to hit all of the keys on the keyboard until you find some that are mapped to the same thing as it's telling you to press on the console. it's the worst experience i think i've had starting up a new pc game and trying to get going."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"gone is the natural progression that was characteristic to previous ds titles. i don't fancy giant empty spaces between the bits of content that are left of it. horseback combat is chaotic and awful. game looks ok, but engine locked at 169 60fps is a faux pas."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"the game is gorgeous and the world is full of content to do solo or with friends, it is challenging for veterans of the soul series but it is also fair for the new players, so if you enjoy this type of games or want to try it, i recommend it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,purchase in preorder. big expectations! big deception! poor port for pc need more time in otimization. expecting more of bandai nanco and fromsoftware.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"aparentemente esta siendo mal visto con reseas de la gente que es su primera vez probando juegos del mismo desarrollador, y esperaban que tuvieran selector de dificultad"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"first of all, i don't have any stuttering issues on my average self build gaming pc and the loading times from my m2 are sweet. while i wish elden ring were produced mainly for the pc, thus having some shiny features like ultra wide support or slightly better graphics, it's not a deal breaker for me, because a good game is not just about shiny graphics paper's please, return of the obra dinn, rimworld and i had hoped, my fellow gamers, would agree with me, but apparently ubisoft's brain washing paid off. i keep reading the word masterpiece and it's true. elden ring as the amalgamation of everything from software has learned from previous souls games is the crowning achievement of myazaki. the poetic story telling, the impressive visuals  the way the brightly glowing elder tree towers over a continent befallen by sickness and distress comes to mind  and finally the impressive arsenal of weapons and well thought out combat  it's nothing short of amazing. i wish from software had these stuttering issues, a bad port and every other minor inconvenience people whine about in their reviews as if it were the end of the world in a different game and avoided this overshadowing their magnum opus, but it is what it is. enjoyed my 50 hours so far and to all the people crying about accessibility, i can only saygit gud and ram your head against the wall until it breaks or leave, level up somewhere else and come back with your newly acquired floppy hammer for more kinetic energy to give them the business."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"there are legitimate performance issues for this game. however the foundations of this game are fantastic. seriously one of the best games i have played in the last decade. there are some minor stutters in the game when exploring the overworld, but it's nothing game breaking. hopefully these stutters will be fixed over updates, but it doesn't take away from the experience as a whole."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"imagine being one of these paint drinkers complaining that a game designed for a controller has bad keyboard controls, absolutely hilarious. the intellectual titans complaining here must also complain that civilization has poor controller support. also, nearly all of the texture issues people are whining about here are the result of outdated graphics drivers and have nothing to do with elden ring, something you'd expect anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of pc gaming to understand. it's a flatout abuse of this platform to give games 010 scores because you are incapable of troubleshooting your own computer problems."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"masterfully crafted game. sure, it has some technical issues, but i give my take with the assumption these bugs will be ironed out their hotfixes so far have already alleviated the issues somewhat, so they're obviously committed to fixing it. i'm not even a huge souls fan, they tend to just stress me out, although i do respect the game design. however, er does alleviate some of the more grating aspects of the souls formula. you can take the game at your own pace, rather than being subjected to the relentless gauntlet that these games normally tend to be. it's still very difficult in places, however, but the challenges are always surmountable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"i cant give an 8.5 so a 9 it is. a rough pc launch held this game back from being damn near perfect. everything from the atmosphere, scope of the game it's massive, beautifully crafted world, unique enemies and bosses, combat is very satisfying as well. story's decent so far. the issues with the game right now for me is coop. it's very janky, sometimes works, sometimes just doesn't. constant dc's but when it works, its damn fun. play mostly solo so it's not too big a deal but if your looking for a game that is bang for your buck, this is it. not sure if it will be your thing if you don't like souls games. personally i'm not really a souls players. i dabbled in all of them for probably a combined 50 ish hours or so but i absolutely love this game. i'm addicted to it and cant stop playing so i would say challenge yourself. it's quite the experience. doesn't hold your hand and doesn't give a fk about your feelings. if you can get on board with that, buy it! if not then go play tomb raider not a bad game just easy mode example or something like that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"best game ever made, especially if you're a fromsoftware fan. don't let anyone else tell you otherwise."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"even though elden ring is a great game, it didn't managed to meet our expectations."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"more of what you've come to expect from a souls game, but with a horse....."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"aside from performance issues, the game is beautiful. those people who hate it are plebs well mostly are so called journalist lmao, get gud booooy!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"game is great but the lack of basic accessibility options from a aaa is unacceptable. camera auto rotation is abhorrent and has no toggle, no ultrawide support, 60fps cap, forced chromatic abberation, forced motion blur. impossible to play due to motion sickness. will be happy to update this once options are added."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"thanks metacritic! today you just taught me to not trust users review! i will tell my honest opinion about the game this game could be easly a 10 game but is a 910, because is true, it has some little thechnical problems and very minor defects btw without compromise the playability of the game, and just because that. in fact, this game is still so freaking awesome!!!! i give 10 in order to compense the other sensless users bombing reviews, and it's really sad because look more like an outburst of frustration than an honest review and these are the same people who tells that this game lacks of content!!! are you kidding me?? guys trust me, i played all fromsoftware games. i missing only bloodborne cause i am a pc gamer and if you like the dark souls saga and also to be more generic if you like fantasydark fantasy, you need this game!! you cannot image the quantities of stuff to do in this game and how huge it is!! the open world its at least more than double of how much i expected to be. can be compared to zelda botw or to the witcher 3plus with an huge vertical extension. the start could seems a little bit quite, but after few hours of gaming elden ring start to have great rhythm. there are so many different paths to take and things to do. you never get bored and some of the places are really astonishing and everything with the dark souls stylei see also a lot of lotr, berserk and of course got vibes in the game but not just a copy rather a new marvelous masterpiece! this game is epic in every single aspect gameplay, art style, level design, lore and in my opinion the author has just outdone himself with this fantasy masterpiece! its true has some little defect but i think they will solve it soon so just give it a change! this is the game we was waiting. thanks again miyazaki. i love you and i hate you, just as always!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,launch was kinda rough for a lot of people. the game ran fine for me and i can without a doubt say that it is the best game i have ever played  a solid 1010.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"the game runs almost flawless on my gtx 1070 msi  intel i79700k amazing game, the game needed some nvidia control panel tweaking to fix the stuttering. but for me its gone almost completly. to all the ppl crying and giving a bad review. if you cant fix the issues yourself why even own a gaming pc ? pathetic."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"this game didn't even run on my pc even though my pc configuration is higher than the minimum requirements, refund. maybe after that miyazaki will learn how to optimize games in which even the graphics do not change."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"big dark souls, fantastic game. stuttering issues, minor boss glitches and inconsistent multiplayer sessions only thing holding it back. immensely satisfying combat, open world is exciting to explore, and the increased depth in spells and weapons make exploration enjoyable and rewarding."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"i hope the pc bugs don't permanently hurt this game public image and from can be able to fix it quickly. honestly, anything less than a 7.5 is nonsense."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"alright, first things first, the port is a bit janky at points, but here's the thing less than 25 of people have beat the first major boss, and by far the most stuttering i encountered was on day 1 against the first minor boss, tree sentinel. i've played 60 hours and haven't had any noticeable stuttering after the first 2 or so hours. i use a 1060 and r5 3600, for reference. everything else is amazing. it's been years since i was so captivated by a game. but know that this isn't uncharted or skyrim. you're not going to have cutscenes where political intrigue is discussed openly. the lore is rich but scattered and it'll be up to you to piece things together. you'll have to be attentive to this game, both in combat and out, there's just so much you'll miss otherwise. i can also admit this isn't the game for everyone. it's challenging. it's made me very frustrated at times. but if you're honest with yourself, your failures are your own and are fair. you're at a disadvantage often and will have to fight uphill often, but if you learn about from's mechanics spirit summoning, magic, coop summons, and enemy affinitiesweaknesses, you'll be able to steamroll encounters by being their exact counter. that feeling of overcoming what feels unfair is the drug that makes these games special. enjoy at your discretion, not at others' prescription. oooooo, elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,i think this game is still very good even though there is a fps error on the pc but it has been fixed in the update
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,a truly masterpiece. una verdadera obra de arte. el diseo del mundo es fantstico.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"it's actually a joke that a company knows the game doesn't run well on pcs, and still release it at fullprice with an 'afterthefact' apology note. seriously, refund this mess and don't invest time and money in from software games unless it's on special."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"it smell like  in here. haha. for real though, wonderful game and would've been a 10 if it had not been for the gamebreaking performance hiccups."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"perfect game, speechless. the ones who are crying here are rat children who have never played souls, or who worry about nonsense. what fromsoftware did with this and its open world, for any fan, it's amazing. if someone does not think the same, let them return to fifa."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,terrible performance it's barely playable absolutely unadvised. just don't buy it's terrible
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"ridculo um jogo de 250 reais rodar desse jeito, fora o suporte pra pc que parece brincadeira, para sair do menu precione bolinha, que bolinha?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"the game is not a 1010 as reported by these so called professional reviewers. the engine, graphics and mechanics is simply reused and at this point it's extremely outdated. it's 2022 and pc gamers and forced and locked to 60fps and 169 aspect ratio, performance issues, stuttering  compatibility issues in a difficult game like this is should have been a priority but it wasn't, sales and launching was. this proves 100 that even companies like from software is not willing to keep up with the fast moving technology of pc. having top end gaming gear only to be limited by a lazy developer is not acceptable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,released a patch but all the enemiesare still invisible the game is   the game is   the game is
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,elden ring elden ring game of the year 2022 i really love this game elden ring elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"as the first souls game i have played, elden ring is a brilliant game for an introduction to the series. while the game's difficulty seems daunting, after every death, it still pulls you back in to give it another try! sad that this game is being reviewed bombed because it's one of the first games in a while to not have an abysmal launch."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"a gorgeous game. expansive world dappled with secrets, lore and combat. it is more than meets the eye. definitely recommend."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"incredible game.. there something very special here, elden ring is one of the biggest games i've ever played, it's truly fantastic."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"they completely ruined the pvp in this game. while the zones are amazing, and the combat is fun, the pvp was ruined. the player doesn't scale properly, you are always matched with people that are 2v1 or 3v1. the net code is awful, so bad that you are literally attacking people in the future."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"constant stuttering regardless of hardware, watch digital foundry vid on youtube for further context"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i have never played any of the souls games before, but being a connoisseur of rpgs and hearing of this supposedly legendary rpg series i felt it was time i finally bit the bullet. i figured with martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. having grown up on dd and crpgs i expected to have a fair idea of what i was getting into. much to my surprise, i found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. i created my character to wander around some lifeless void. oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with popins as well. i am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true rpg. i however did not find one in this game. i'm not sure what constitutes for an rpg these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills. all problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. no noncombat or social options in this supposed rpg. the exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the mmo sphere influenced this trash itemization. the dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and i killed margit after ten or twelve tries. the game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed rpg hint it's not an rpg it's just combat pornography your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. there's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is. all in all this game is not an rpg, there are no roleplaying options. it's just combat pornography for the youth's violent  sadist rituals. if you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! i for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but i hope to save others the expense. we all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score. roleplay 0 out of 100 music 20 out of 100 story 0 out of 100 gameplay 0 out of 100 don't let reviewers beholden to the gaming industry cheat you hard working folks out of your money!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"masterpiece! the game is just incredible. the atmospheric story telling combined with the tough but fair challenge present fun and enthralling experience. the graphics and style are just amazing, with a plethora of breath taking moments and landscapes. the combat as always is just plain fun, with hundreds of different ways to fight your enemies. tough but fair. so if you like a challenge and don't just want to mindlessly mash buttons this is the game for you! a lot of the bad reviews stem from players who desire to be held by the hand with every step they take. you will have to keep track of the pieces of information you acquire and find your own unique way. i think it is very refreshing that there is no large arrow pointing into the correct direction."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"much more friendly and less awkward than ever. has it's technical issues, but who doesnt at the launch? overall very worth the time and money"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"yeah, that's it. we ate at the peak of gaming. this is it. it's all downhill from now. elden ring is, with the lack of a better word, a masterpiece. don't play it if you like skyrim, button mash and hackandslash games. this game is harder than you can probably handle. the game also does not hold your hand, at all. it's your adventure and your own path into becoming an elden lord."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"congratulations cyberpunk 2077 a new game has taken the spot for the most broken game ever made. 11 fps, automatically going back to the home screen after you load in and that's when it let's you log. they should have named it broken ring bad as this pile of crap is and this is on the ps5. i can tell the publisher spent the year marking budget on buying reviews for this game because it's pure garbage in it's current state. save your money and don't buy broken ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the optimization its horrible but the game its really innmense and cool. if you're a souls lover, you will find the way to make run almost perfect in the pc and you will enjoy every  moment of this masterpiece. if you're an very exigent rat gamer, wait for the next version of the g america. but if you wanna a get a lot of soulsborne, get it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"no ultrawide support? performance problems? are you guys  out of your minds? the only true excuse would be the fps lock otherwise game runs silky smooth on most hardwares, if you are complaining about performance problems, hope you get stuck on rtx hell where noone could play it properly. i have a gtx 1070 and the game runs much much better than it should tbh. first off, game has no denuvo. port as it may be but developers are actually showing respect to the players. sekiro had many many mods and community support beyond launch and this is no different. game itself is amazing beyond what these whiners deserve. 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i'm gonna start with the critique, then get to the compliments. my real score 80, b, pretty good. first, after playing 20 hours of this game i can safely say, it's a souls game. for better or worse. i think with the hype train pulling into the station it's very clear that fromsoft has hit pokemonnintendo levels in the eye of reviewer's. it feels like false advertising, as i can see most people picking this up as their first souls experience thinking there's finally one with story and accessible combat and that's just not the case. this is fromsoft's masterpiece, but not an masterpiece . starting with the graphics, i understand that souls games besides demon souls remake usually look not great. it's the style, but as the years go by theres no excuse for lazy hair cards, bad tree imposters, and truly some ugly texture work. i think this is one of the spots where you can see them resting on their laurels a bit, the overall quality is a aa studio maybe. the foliage is some of the ugliest in games, the trees are antiquated in their design and have clear ao outlines on the leaves. they also are hyper poliginal, and lack in variation. the character is stiff and unatural still, clearly the same rig they've had forever. i understand the whole, if it ain't broke don't fix it, but it doesn't mean you can't push things forward. blue point proved that. lighting an open world is no easy task, and there's quite a bit of light leaks and strange artifacts but overall cudos to them on that. combat is ds3, i do love the new additions of magic being more accessible and the ability to change weapon traits. this is the only part where i'll talk about the frame drops, it's definitely annoying, but not unplayable. it's just crazy that a game that looks like a ps3 hd remake can't coast at 60 when thats the only job it has. without buttery combat, elden ring shows the flaws of not really offering more beyond frustrating deaths and exploration. i see that people want an easy mode or something to that effect, but i think without a strong narrative theres no real way to offer such a thing. if it existed, it would expose the places where fromsoft has always been lacking which is true narrative. an normal gamer picking up this may enjoy a bit of the dive, but it has no real meat to bite into. the game literally starts like most souls games. you boot up, make a character, go die to hard enemy, and wake up in a new place with insert female character telling you you need to reignitereassemble insert lightsource. it would not shock me if they just had george r.r. martin fill out an mad lib they typed up. got one of the best writers in the world, and somehow still couldn't make something unique. the game doesn't really say anything. not all games need to, but with they way they hypedpresented it and what it actually is, it removed some of the luster immediately for me love that slider though. as far as being an open world game, it's okay so far. i can't believe that in 2022 the praise a game has gotten for adding in an jump button, an ground mount, and literally adding nothing else to the genre. not that it needs all the bells and whistles of other open world games, but it seems very strange. though, torrent is a cutie patootie and i have died to save him many times that all being said, i still love it! thank you fromsoft! truly, no easy feat to make a game and not easy at all to do it in a global pandemic. time for compliments the music and sound design is impeccable. i actually love the overworld music and have gorgeous audio ques has actually helped me dodge attacks when the frames drop. i love the sense of urgency and adrenaline that really only monster hunter can provide besides this. the horror of exploring an area, waiting for something to pop out and keep you on edge is unparalleled. this is masterpiece for them, it highlights all the amazing design and combat that they've cultivated over the years. i would not recommend this game to most people, but i know the ones i do are gonna love it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i don't think it's a good game. the game has an extremely thin story and almost no guidance in terms of what you should actually be doing. the game purports to have a high level of difficulty but the truth is that elden ring requires you to do an enormous amount of grinding before you approach much of the content. and as you grind, and as you get abilities that let you escape the games horrible combat system the right weaponsspells you start to cheese the game as easily as any other. i wouldn't buy the hype or buy the game until it's on sale."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"if you look past all the bogus reviews that are complaining about things that will most likely be fixed on a later patch no ultrawide, frame cap, low frames in certain times. you will easily be addicted to this game. i'm not a previous souls player and absolutely love this game. i cant stop playing it and getting better items to take on harder foes. i will say i was a huge breath of the wild and witcher fan, and this one is the grand daddy of them all. a game where progression in single player is actually a thing. boss fights are so well thought up its quite impressive. this is the perfect game for me post 17 years of raiding in wow. i cant recommend this enough. just buy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"very good game. essentially dark souls mechanics  items  quests stuffed inside of a botw style open world. it's fun to alternate grindingexploringdungeons. a lot to do in every single region, lots of interesting minibosses, sidequests, and general fun exploring. the open world does not feel copy and pasted like other open world games i've played. a lot of people are complaining about the graphics, but i completely disagree and think this game looks fine. would much rather sacrifice graphics for good gameplay eitherway. i think with the pc performance issues this deserves a 910, but giving 1010 to combat the ridiculous 0 score bombs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"after playing through dark souls remastered and putting in some time with dark souls 3, i was ready to jump into elden ring. what an improvement. being able to fast travel right from the start is a huge upgrade and the many checkpoints make exploring a joy. the combat is improved from previous souls games but more or less the same, so if you've played any of the previous games, your skills will carry over. i will be putting in thousands of hours into this massive game. great job again from software. thank you for this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"everything i wanted it to be and more! some issues on pc such as crashing or stuttering, but that's the only bad thing i can say about this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"first fromsoftware game i play. i didn't adapt to any dark souls or demon souls games because in addition to the already known difficulty, the linear world was very limiting. the open world in elden ring is amazing and rewards you for the time invested in exploration and grinding, even allowing for a mixed build. i started as a hero and str build, i'm adapting to strdex and i should put some points in int and mnd too. note 10 despite the bad performance on pc i have an rtx 3070 ti and i hope they fix this and other problems soon besides releasing expansions."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"el juego es dificil mucho mas accesible y claro que el resto de los souls, muy parecido a sekiro en ese sentido, pero el juego cumple como en su momento lo hizo dsiii, el problema de optimizacion puede ser bastante desagradable razon por la que no le di 10 se puede corregir dandole permisos de administrador el .exe del juego y del anticheat, poniendo la pc en modo de alto rendimiento. el panel de control en opciones de energia, apagamdo la superposicin del dvr y para nvidia usar el panel de video y en ajustes globales poner el cache de sombreadores en infinito, a mi eso me ayudo a ganar los 60fps, puede que solo tengas que hacer una o dos cosas para que vaya mejor, pero definitivamente no tendriamos porque hacerlo, tanto para lo bueno como lo malo miyazaki sigue haciendo de las suyas xd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"people calling the launch bad either have terrible pcs or need to go outside. game has some strange lag when transitioning across zone borders which isn't really that big of an issue most of the time. game is otherwise probably the greatest open world game ever. its like if breath of the wild had depth to its gameplay. story is amazing, visuals are breathtaking, combat is super fun and custimizable. just about everything i want in a game is here."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"this game doesn't live up to the hype, it absolutely destroys it! if you got drawn in by the hype without knowing what a fromsoft game is like, that's your fault. if you complain about performance issues and are trying to use a 780ti, that's your fault. my only complaint is how invasionssummoning work, i wish they were more like previous fromsoft games. stop being a baby and get gud."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"absolute scam article. shameful exploitation of the open world hype train. the game is unplayable. even without the abysmal pc ports issues, this game is like a bad unity 3d mobile game project with clunky contols, inexcusably bad ui, horrible graphics and animation, constant glitches and textures from 1999. digital purchases from retailers are nonrefundable and i for one am 50 euros out of pocket. i feel like my hardearned money has been stolen from me by dishonest game reviewers and the game publisher. i'll be filing a complaint at my national consumer protection agency unless my money is returned to me. theft is illegal, i believe. for shame, from software, bandai namco and you dishonest, despicable game reviewers that you bought, for shame for you treacherous, dishonest and bought reviews. goddamn cash grab. never seen anything this shameless in my 36 years of gaming."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"lamentable el estado de optimizacin de ste juego, me encanta from software, pero es que es siempre lo mismo, acabar mejorando algo seguro, pero de momento se queda con un bonito 3, stas cosas hay que ir dejndolas atrs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the pc port really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. sure there are framestutters, but nothing gamebreaking. the actual game itself is an absolute 1010 experience too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"another game like 2077, good marketing, trailers, reviews, but the game bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,stuttering and freezing were ok to me. but the bosses were just terrible. fighting was not fun at all. hitandrun strategy is not working but that one is the one i would like to do mostly when i play souls.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"in my new souls fan recently opinion i've just only played ds1, 3, sekiro 1. advantages  about gameplay is drawn from previous games, less stamina cost, you can teleport without required sitting in the bonfire lost grave but not of that the game is easier cause the bosses are adjusted challenging similar to previous games. visual art, dark atmosphere, environmental sounds, storytelling, it's just strangely beautiful, it plunges me into a dark fantasy world. 2. disadvantages  admittedly, optimization is really bad, fps drop happens quite often, low to medium setting is not much different, i hope in the future fromsoftware will release more patch to fix this. this is a game that reminds me of a real sense of adventure since the last time i played skyrim. like i said, the above is just my opinion, no matter how many different opinions, i still enjoy this game.  and i have an advice for you, who spent time to read my opinion  don't listen anything or anyone says, including me, all review whether good or bad are subjective, you should experience this game for yourself to get your own feeling. trust me, you'll find it well worth it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the game is too hard. i have a fulltime job, i don't have time for this. i don't understand how a niche game like this can be praised so much. some people don't want to waste their time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"buddy told me to check this game out i used to play some action games back on the ps2. not really my jam these days, but i figured what they hell why not. let me tell you this is no god of war. booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. must be a good story or something. speaking of story i guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. figured since it had the game of thrones writer on it it may be cool, but i guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. he must not be very good, probably another sjw propped up by the hollywood elites. dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. seems like your character's hit box is larger than nancy pelosi's slush fund. clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. i presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. the alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. now that i think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters. maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. play god of war any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game. i'll be taking this back to gamestop and telling them the damned thing is broken to get my money back because it's just awful."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,all of these 10s are paid actors trust me. game  in every aspect. don't buy it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"never played any souls games, but this is the best game ive ever played. its a bit buggy, but compared to what aaa titles have been like lately its perfection. i love this game and i will happily sink hundreds of hours into it and pay for whatever dlcs they release."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"this game is basically the definitive souls game idk what else there is to say. if you like fromsoftware and their souls games you'll love it. yes, there are technical issues but i've no idea how people are actually bothered by this all i've experienced were framerate drops which lasted for a second and happened so infrequently that i always forgot about them until it happened again. im talking about a slight inconvenience every twothree hours or so. if this and the admiralty outdated graphics imo art direction is more important than graphics anyway is enough for you too give this game a bad score then you just value these things more than i do"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i'd give it a 10, but direct x 12 . this game is amazing a true culmination of everything fromsoft has learned while crafting their previous titles. elden ring being fromsoft's first foray into open world building only makes this experience more impressive. i've never seen a more organic open world. the only caveat is if you didn't like their previous titles you're surely not going to like this. this game will test your patience in all the right ways. if you've been a fan of fromsoft games then prepare yourself for an awe inspiring journey through the lands between."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,game with too many technical problems controller not recognized lags no 219 ect. multiplayer works when he wants from software missed his departure another game released too soon
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"one of the most beautiful type of media i ever saw, a truly crafted masterpiece. the addition of stealth makes you think extra in your decisions, and approach with creative ways to surpass your obstacles, the challenge of the game is mainly on your ability to explore and prepare yourself to greater dangers. is very beginner friendly, but has yours ways to gatekeep content, putting very strong enemies to protect certain areas. the sound design is superb and the world is vast and mysterious."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"there is no reason, for all this my game does not even enter i have an rtx 3090, when it enters gets less than 50 fps, we are in 2022 has no excuses!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"gameplay and sound is great. however, there's a lot of issues. no ultrawide support, capped fps and stutter issues to name a few. cannot recommend in it's current state with it's price tag if these are things you care about."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,it was the worst idea to make ds as rpg. lvl design is bad you have 2 bosses that you can't win in early game it was unnecessary to leave them in start. and ready to play in 15 fps
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"first time i play a souls like game. i like graphics are great, the monsters, the world  it all looks amazing. lore  the story and atmosphere is appealing. i don't like its very difficult and you cant change the difficulty setting anywhere i know some people will defend that, but to me this is either willfully to discourage casual players from playing the game or just lazy cause it takes more time and energy to change how hard the game should be. the combat is clunky probably subjective, i defiently did'nt like that there is no type of lockon system. so you feel like you are aiming right at your target but then instead you end up taking a swing right next to the enemy. the whole combat system feels clunky, other similiar games have done it way better. its got some serious performance issues on pc. as it stands now, its not really playable. this might be something they fix later on. the game does'nt have a pause button  even though its a singleplayer experience. the stupidity here just blows my mind. the game seems quite repetetive and like it has'nt really evolved much from its predecessor. all in all, i feel like i gave this game a fair shake but ultimately its just to hard and frustrating to be fun. it dose'nt help that the combat system is poor as well. if these things were fixed as well as the performance issues, it might be a more enjoyable experience. unless you feed off of frustration and are willing to put up with a janky combat system, i would recommend you stay away."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,everything a souls player wanted and even more. not a 10 because of the performance issues on pc.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"no 1610 display support for a game in 2022, it's so bad... these black strips on top and bottom destroy all the experience from the game! i have to install apps to play in normal resol, wow, thanks, and i can be banned for that, btw, so bad..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,une ppite !! ce jeu est juste incroyable !! je n'ai jamais autant kiff un jeu comme celuici
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"this game is the best game i have ever  to be quite frank, the review bombs are unfounded in my opinion. everyone i have talked too who properly updates their pc has had 0 issues, or only very minor ones, with the game. if you are on pc.....update to the latest drivers. nvidia released a new driver specifically optimized for elden ring last week. you need it. it helps. do not ignore it. 2nd.....turn off the steam overlay. steam overlay causes issues with all kinds of games, not just elden ring. just turn the dang thing off and watch your performance improve. i did both of these things and have had 0 issues with frame rate, stuttering, or anything else that everyone is griping about. it is amazing to me how many pc gamers don't do the basic maintenance of updating drivers to help their game and pc performance. the game itself is fantastic. it is the classic dark souls combat, mixed with an incredible open world with secrets and items to find everywhere. literally their seems to be secrets and things to find on every inch of the massive map. oh, and boss fights galore. if you like fromsoft games, then it is the perfect mesh of all their past games. the lore is great, and while there is a clear cut overarching quest, most of the indepth lore is still very cryptic and can be discovered through reading item descriptions in true dark souls fashion. i haven't been this into a video games in a lot of years. it ticks all the right boxes, is super addicting, and i find myself thinking about the items, worlds, bosses, and lore even when i am not playing it. it will forever be one of my top 5 gaming experiences, hands down. so to conclude, ignore the review bombers, update your pc, and enjoy one of the greatest games in recent memory. you will not regret it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"drop frames, slow motion when i start fighting, and there is no arabic language."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"la verdad me parece la repeticin de los souls, sin una mecnica nueva atractiva, fui fan de los souls pero creo que ya es abuso de la formula a tal punto que se vuelve montono y aburrido."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"don't be fooled, most of those people who gave the game negative reviews never played it. just compare it with the note on steam, where there are only people who played the game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"one of the best games thats ever been created by from software. my only issue with it is that ive had this bug that wont let me change my screen mode, whenever i switch it to full screen, the game pauses and goes back to windowed. its very annoying and i would sometimes get stutters. ive heard from software is aware of it and when it is fixed, it deserves a 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"since i'm playing on pc it's only justified that i write a review for the pc version. elden ring is a beautiful vast open world with plenty of things to explore and bosses to fight but at the same time it just feels so empty. following the same format of the previous souls games you are thrown into a barren world bent on a task to restore order. there is nothing new or different about this game when compared to the other games released by fromsoftware. sure you have a vast open world to explore which is new but the world just feels empty, don't you think that with doing a open world you might have thought about adding in a passive fort or village fighting just to make the world seem more lively. there are a few npc's to be found throughout the world, some of which have quests to give but don't expect the game to tell you where to go for that quest. in all my 45 hours of playing i have come across just one quest marker and that was to show me where to find a portal, other than that you better either be taking some notes or scrounging the wiki for the answer on where to go next. the variety of bosses in this game is great, some optional and some mandatory to continue the main story. the music is phenomenal with my favorite being during the ancestor spirit boss fight, that fight alone just reminds me of the dancer fight from ds3, not as hard but just as wonderful and graceful. this is the perfect game for any newcomer to the series to start off with just because of how the open world provides a sort of play at your own pace feel to it. with as good as this game is though it's not without it's issues, i can't even begin to count the amount of times i have died due to stuttering or random fps drops, the game is locked at 60 fps which is fine but when it just randomly drops to 15 fps it can be a bit jarring. beyond that i've had my game crash on me a couple time and had a few enemies break to where they just start spinning. this game is fun, don't get me wrong. it's not deserving of a 0 but also not deserving of a 10. down to it's core it's just another dark souls game and nothing new."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"elden ring, the latest offering from fromsoftware, is a game that is as challenging as it is captivating. the games high difficulty is a doubleedged sword. on one hand, it provides a sense of accomplishment when you finally overcome a tough boss or clear a difficult area. on the other hand, it can be incredibly frustrating for players who find themselves stuck, unable to progress. the steep learning curve only exacerbates this issue, making the game potentially inaccessible to newcomers to the genre. the technical issues at launch were another major drawback. the game suffered from bad optimization, leading to performance issues that detracted from the overall experience. the 60 fps cap was a disappointment for players with highend hardware, and the lack of ultrawide support and upscaling implementation felt like missed opportunities. however, its not all doom and gloom. elden ring shines in its openworld design and storytelling. the world is vast and filled with secrets to discover, and the lore is deep and engaging. the games world is a joy to explore, and the sense of discovery is one of its strongest  of the most touching aspects of elden ring is its tribute to kentaro miura, the author of berserk. the art style of the souls games, including elden ring, was heavily inspired by berserk, and the game includes several references to miuras work. this serves as a beautiful homage to a man whose work has influenced the genre so profoundly. in conclusion, elden ring is a game of contrasts. its high difficulty and steep learning curve, coupled with technical issues, can make it a frustrating experience. however, its openworld design and storytelling make it a game worth experiencing. whether youll enjoy it or not will largely depend on your tolerance for its more frustrating aspects."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the culmination of dark souls, sekiro and bloodbourne make this the best game fs has ever made. the open world is beautiful with loads of secrets to find and nooks to explore. the bosses are satisfying and well designed. the story is well written with lots of intricate and juicy lore nuggets. there are some performance issues on pc at release but none of them serious enough to hinder my enjoyment of this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the game is being slammed for almost no reasons. most of the time, the players that i've seen complain haven't made the nvidia driver update, or checked that the game is running using the graphic card instead of the processor's graphics. if that's your case, you definitely should try doing so before adding the review. as far as the game's content is concerned, it is a masterclass. althought the graphics are somewhat outdated, the artistic direction is just incredible, and it is the most important point in my opinion. the gameplay is just as good as the previous souls game, with new mechanics which integrate just well, and reward playing aggressively, to break the poise of the boss and deal huge amounts of damage. you have many options and ways to play. the story and lore are really interesting, although mysterious, which might deter some, but is really rewarding if you love digging into the game's mysteries. the bosses are really good too, some of them being just insane, and will probably end up being just as cult as sullyvahn or gael. and to finish with, the most important part, which is the open world aspect, is also it's strongest point. you have a total freedom, like in breath of the wild. but where it stands out, in my opinion, is regarding the loot. your exploration truly is rewarded, as most items you find are unique, giving a true feeling of finding something precious each time, be it a weapon, a spell, a npc, an invocation, an armor, a unique item... the game also always surprises you, with unpredictable events happening regularly, which is great for an open world, as i often find that a routine quickly settles in in most open worlds. not in this one. to sum it up it is a souls game, and probably the best open world i've played, despite not being the most graphically up to date game. a true masterclass in my opinion"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,",   ,    . ,   ,          .             .  . 1.02.1 patch r5 2600x, 3060 ti, ram 8gbx2, ssd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i cant rly belive this is after release. the game is literally unplayable on pc, it has terrible perfomance, awefull controls, random crashes, invisible enemys, the cow also goes invisible, its simply a master  its unplayable, yet we still paying 60 euros or whatever. this on pc its a scam!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"in the past, the game content has made little progress compared to the past. badly optimized old engine ditched dx11"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"this game is my favorite soulslike and probably my favorite game. it's impossible for me choice a note that isn't 10, so... congratulations fromsoftware."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"its crazy too see so many people giving this game 010 because of some minor technical issues, i understand the 60fps frame cap is an issue for some people but i dont get giving it a 010 because of that, honestly its a 910 but doesnt deserve the hate its getting so i have to give a 10 to bring back the score a bit. combats great, lots of weapons choices and more customisation than any game in the series before it. the world is massive and beautiful, absolutely nailed the art direction of the game again. bosses are certainly the most interesting and difficult the series has had to offer. there are negatives, some people are having mild performance issues, small amounts stuttering in certain areas, the frame rate is locked to 60, and theres no widescreen support this one annoys me a little. the games hard, duh, its a souls game, i think a lot of the review bombing is due to its difficulty and pc gamers incessant obsession with frame rates, as if you need anymore than 60 in a non competitive title like this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"sincerely people who put 0 are really not objective, considering this, im forced to put 10 even if the game has defaults, but if i was objective, i would have put 9."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"best game ever, the patches will fix it in pc so no worries. and of course i played it on pc i'm not coming from a console."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,amazing game. the bad reviews are just people review bombing or giving it 0 because of minor and rare stutters. this is crazy. the game is absolutelly a 8 or 9 even when taken the stutters into acount.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i've put in around 40 hours in to this game and it is by far one of the best games miyazaki has ever made, if not the best. people complaining about issues on pc are most likely running underpowered systems. i've not encountered a single issue with this game, at all.. my system specs are an rtx 3979, i710870, 32gb of crucial ballistix 3200mhz ram. i'm running it with a 300hz panel at 1080p because you don't need anything else. ultra wide and 4k are completely unnecessary for a game like this. that being said, this game is brutal, it is incredibly difficult and rewarding. if you are not able to put in the time to learn or a souls veteran stay away, you're gonna have a bad time. however, if you're willing to put in the work the game has so much to offer and so much to do. i feel like i haven't even scratched the surface and, like i said, i've put i'n 40 hours. the game is a definite buy if you like these kinds of games, if not, just ignore it and save yourself the trouble of getting rekt."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,i hate this  its hard to move its hard to attack its hard to play. i hate this  damn too much and anybody who pretend to love it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,minus few stuttering issues i'm certain they will be fixed soon in certain parts of map... game is amazing!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,great game. this is a masterpiece from fromsoftware. really great game design and flow to the game. reccomended
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,where is the patch????????? three days after the last patch you did nothing to fps
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,20 hrs in and love every second. community fixes remove all major slowdown. balls deep in the game and who cares about reduced frames? cry babies...
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"the official account told us that there is an arabic language, but after the release we were surprised by the opposite! no arbic language ! there's no reason ever let you to not adding our langueag respect us"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,great game play but you wouldn't be able to experience it because of the garbage performance
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"this has been my favorite game in such a long long time. honestly the open world  dark souls style is amazing so many things to do. while i have only had the game for a couple days i've already put roughly 40 hours into the game and there still feels like there is a ton left to complete. there has been a ton of qol changes and new additions which makes the game better and arguably easier than previous titles. however, there is still plenty of amazing, challenging, and fun bosses all over. i don't know the exact number but i'm already about 60 bosses in and while some are basic bosses a lot are really cool. i've been playing on a midtier pc that i bought last black friday and i haven't had any real issues with the game frame rate or lag. i am only playing on medium settings though because i don't want to nuke my pc since it's really nothing special lol while the majority of the game isn't really too difficult there are some bosses that may take a while to beat. i'm giving this a 10 simply because i cannot remember the last time i played a game anywhere near this good. i can't say it's a perfect game since i haven't 100 it yet but it truly is amazing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"there is no arabic language despite the promises made by the developers of the game before its launch, it does not mean anything to me now and is not understood"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"pc port was sick. but the game is amazing, after all. i dont care about graphics or smt and every soulsgame always locked at 60fps bloodborne only 30"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"es increiblemente increible, todo lo que diga es poco, y encima en mas de52h ni u solo bug, para ser su primer mundo abierto todo va genial"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"so much vasted potencial. this game is just for a few gamers with unlimited time and inclination to masochism. no pause, you cant crouch when opening chest and maaaany other bugs from 90ties."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"my machine has no problems with it but it is pretty beefy. asides from the technical stuff, it is the best fromsoft ever made."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,i'm saying this as someone who never really like any of the previous souls games. elden ring is my favorite game of all time. i would 100 recommend this game to everyone. i honestly never thought i would fall in love with this game so much. it's kind of ironic comparing myself today to myself a few days ago. elden ring is literally my life now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,ow
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,easily one of the best games of all time. if i could give it an 1110 i would. the bad reviews are just trolling and from people who want their hand held throughout a children's game. the highest rated game in modern history and rightfully so. well deserving of its place in the conversation as the best video game of all time. congrats and thank you miyazaki and fromsoft!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is a big adventure with a lot of areas to discover and amazing designs. there are a lot of low negative reviews that are unjustified. i have no problems on pc, no lag, although i have a highend rtx 3080. also make sure your gpu drivers are uptodate. i have connected an xbox controller to my pc for the controls. the 60 fps doesn't bother me too much, but higher would be nice. no reason to give a low score while the gameplay is amazing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this review is for performance section only. tldr game runs great, only minor stuttering. first of all, see those performance bad reviews? it's greatly exaggerated. the game runs very fine, in fact it's like a miracle that it could run on my rx580 4gb  8gb ram rig in modified high preset. the game do have minor stuttering which is not gamebreaking at all. and no, the game does not support windows 7. please upgrade your os. in case you're asking for ray tracing or dlss support, it will be supported later in a patch, just wait. also, i'm certain these review bombers are those discord users who planned to review bomb elden ring months ago."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"if you've never played a souls game, please do not start with this one. every other game in the series is a better place to start, i worry that for someone who starts with this game, they'll miss out on the rest of the series because hey, this is the newest one so it must be the best. it's not, it's near the bottom of this great series. maybe at the bottom entirely. so... another souls game. not saying that's a bad thing. the combat is fair and challenging, the presentation is solid, the graphics are... alright, certainly not 2022 stuff unless this is just a bad pc port... which now that i look over the reviews, it sounds like i got off light, it just looks old and blah, it's not stuttering anywhere near as bad as many are experiencing this is not a bad game, 710 is not a bad score. it's alright... but i'd wait for it to be on sale for like 20... while it retains many of the elements that made prior souls games great, what it cuts out was essentially the heart and what it adds in simply doesn't work. the open world is boring, the enemy placement is lame, i didn't feel any sense of wonder or world building that even comes close to the rest of this series. the game feels rushed and more like from was told to make a game they didn't really want to make. as a huge fan of demon's souls, dark souls and bloodborne... i'm not disappointed per say... but i'm certainly not wowed either. i don't care for how open the game is, it really ruins what makes these games great. i don't care for the setting, take bloodborne for example, the setting was the best thing about it. i don't care for the random hodgepodge haphazard placement of enemies, it honestly feels like an early 2000s mmo when you look at how things are laid out...i certainly would put this near the bottom, maybe just above ds2, in terms of souls games. that being said, 710 doesn't mean this is a bad game and ds2 isn't bad either. it's just not anywhere near their best work, which i'd recommend 10x over this title. again, not horrible but it's not worth 60 and from software clearly didn't put much effort into this port. sigh... maybe i am disappointed, writing this really made me feel that way. 610, skip it. 7 is too high of a score for how much of a fall from grace this is, especially with how bad the port is for pc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is part  that may not be for everyone, but if you are willing to give it a chance, it might grow on you. i have a 12600k and 3070 on windows 11. i have not experienced any huge frame drops and only one crash in nearly 20 hours of playing. this game requires imagination. the story is not just fed to you and requires piecing together. again, this may not be for everyone, but if you are the kind of person that likes to actively think and let their imagination run, you will find lots to explore here. i wish they would have smoothed out the launch so that everyone had the same, more or less smooth experience that i did. i am hopeful they will patch it soon. 910 because of the launch issues. otherwise, this would be a perfect score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,i habe keine probleme mit dem spiel es luft sehr gut bis jetzt und so wie immer hat fromsoftware ein sehr gutes spiel geliefert.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"buen juego, aun con mi pc que no cumple los requisitos va bastante bien, ojala mejoren el rendimiento para los dems para que suba la calificacin"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"so basic issues with the game performance is horrible, even on a rtx 3090 game is locked at 60fps game does not support ultrawide keyboard and mouse menu navigation is counter intuitive and should be standardised there's a good game there somewhere, which is probably worth a 7, or 8 out of 10. it would still not be a perfect 10, but no game really is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,i think guys didnt play this game because this game is awesome and 1 or 2 week fix for optimization
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the game is a combination of all the other works of the studio, a wonderful and attractive work, but not for everyone. it is a game that harshly punishes mistakes, but magnanimously rewards victories."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is in short, a nearly beautiful masterpiece. it perfectly shows what from software aims to achieve with each and every iteration of the games they develop and growing with each new one. while the pc launch port of the game is suffering from some technical issues like frame drops, they are fully aware and are addressing these issues. its amazing how the game has launched in almost every platform in a near complete state which sets the bar higher for games that release at launch to be broken only to be fixed later coughcyberpunk 2077 this is truly worth the 60 dollars in my opinion."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"no that high fps? some stutters? no ultrawide support? low optimization? those mean nothing when the content is so extremely good has this piece of masterwork, some people is kind of crazy giving this game a straight 0 because of some technical issues i have to say."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,the game on pc is litterally unplayable with a high end pc. this should be illegal il 2022. after 8 hours of stuttering i decided that i'll not ruin my experience with the whole game until from fixes the mess they released.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the critical reviews for this are all correct. this is just dark souls again now with goathorse!!!. including the trademark artificial difficulty that the games are known for. there is a difference in a game being hard because it takes skill. and a game being hard because the character moves like a boulder, and all your enemies have overinflated hp bars. this is game design 101. and i cannot believe the developers are being praised and awarded for this crap. but if you've already played a couple from software games, aren't you tired of doing this yet? the lore in this game is really some standard convoluted jrpg trite. only this time it's trying its best to look like skyrim and witcher 3. the new open world is just big for no reason and it has a very amateur design philosophy. the controls feel like you are playing a ps2 launch title. and the stiff animations don't make it any better. just a boring chore to play. i feel like this game is intentionally wasting my time and has zero payoff. i really don't get how a person can play this and be amazed. unless it's the first game they've ever played. you'll probably like this if you're pretty slow and aren't capable of deep thought."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"git gud, praise the sun git gud, praise the sun git gud, praise the sun git gud, praise the sun"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"an excellent soulslike with a much bigger world and giant creatures! we have all the familiar ingredients in demon souls, dark souls trilogy, bloodborne and sekiro, but now with some additional abilities including mount to navigate an open world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this is an utter  game. a retrodesign that fails in every regard. only reason to like this game is that you enjoy beating a crap design. looks okay on a pc, not good in the least. no tool help, the tutorial is a laugh, take a wrong turn and you're  it's about grinding, progression is worthless, spend as much time ingame as googling wtf is even happening and how do i use my stuff, story is fragmented, controls  up because it's a lazy console port. worst i've played in a long time. only zero on here, so far. all my money down the drain."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,i just can't play with the recommended fps settings below 20... 97 for this game is a joke. once again these game critics are paid to rate
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"litteraly one of the best game game ive ever played. im a huge fs fan, but didnt expect er to be that good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"how a 2022 game can look so terrible graphically? it looks like light, rocks, foliage are from a 2012  lore is not interesting, the audio is poor. the animations are really really bad. a lazy job!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"when they said i doubt you can even imagine it, they were right. and because i didn't want to imagine it, i didn't watch any trailer apart from the 2019 e3 trailer, i didn't read anything about the game, tried to avoid every type of information about it. i wanted to experience it. i wanted to be surprised by what this game has to offer. and man! this game has a lot to offer. it hits all my weak spots. the ambiance is so captivating, the architecture and landscapes are breathtaking, the setting, the way things are presented, how small you feel before the challenges that you face and before the environment, it makes this adventure feel epic. that mix between soul's and sekiro gameplay is done in a clever way. all those surprises you find here and there along the way are so rewarding. and as always, a deep sense of mystery that just makes you want to know everything about this world. i love this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"ok so, i launch the game, i try to navigate menus and fail. i somehow get back to my character, and try to figure out what r means. i press r, drink something, then nothing. i begin to understand that the tips on the screen are not for me, a classic pc player with good old keyboard and mouse. i manage to push through tutorial, find how to jump and do other actions by several times going to the keyboard shortcuts. then i'm asked to wield with both hands with a combination that is not present in the keyboard shortcuts, i had to go search online how to do that. then i'm asked to do some other special attack on the poor undead fella. i try something, it looks like a regular power attack, so i have no idea if that's what the tutorial was talking about, but the fella is dead now, and i don't know if i'll ever see a tutorial on how to perform this special attack again. i move on, another attack with undecipherable keys that are simply just not present on my setup. i do not even have a controller configured on my pc... keys assignments are terrible, tutorial is terrible. it just made me want to stop playing. it was painful. i'm not supposed to feel pain from figuring out how to translate console messages to pc world for a game released for pc. edit before sending the review, i went back to explore the full content of options, and yes, you can set the screen tutorials to display the keyboardmouse version. why was the game setup with controller by default even when i have no controller at all is a mystery to me, but it definitely ruined my inital contact with the game, feeling unwelcome, a relic from the past that had to move on to controllers. i'm not saying that's the intent, i'm just saying that's how i felt. i understood nothing at all the intro scenes, except there are gazillons of names and concepts being thrown at you that make absolutely no sense. i usually love slow pace narrative, but this is just slow to make it look epic, but there is nothing epic about it. you land in the world with a character assigned to a class that tells you nothing about it. it really feels like different teams designing different elements of the game and no one was ever in charge of making sense of the whole package, the user experience. maybe if i had reached that point where i understand all mechanics, i would enjoy them, but i'm not supposed to suffer that much from the start, and the small details that are off are triggering my alarms, and as an old player, i tend to trust them now. if there is smoke..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,absolutely stunning game marred by the lack of ultrawide support.... let's fix this now!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this is a true from software games with all of the previous titles' features and some new ones. it is a difficult game and may not be for everyone, but there are some game mechanics summoning other players is one of it to make the experience easier. it has a wide variety of character builds with decent character customization. the environment design and music is to be highly commended too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,hot garbage. not good enough. utterly abysmal and gutting play any other from software title even once it is patched the biggest gaming disappointment of my life.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i'm playing on a mobile gpu which is way below minimal requirements with relatively stable 40 fps most of the time. only stutters and freezes that i have seen were during horseback open world boss fights, especially the one with the gold knight in the very beginning. the game is great and looks beautiful, feels a bit like botw in souls world. introduction was kinda harsh though as i was able to completely miss the path leading to tutorial and skip it without noticing so i had to find out everything myself. definitely recommend."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,nenhum jogo com essa otimizao porca merece sequer 1 ponto de score. parem de normalizar esse tipo de atitudes dessas empresas
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"for a 2022 game the issues can't be accepted, dropped frames and game freezing on bosses are the most serious issues but it's an open world game npcs look like dummies maybe it's the lack of open world experience, but a game delivered like this at full price is not worth it, i hope they solve the most serious problems and manage to save the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"peeps seriously need to chill about the frame rate. it only dipped a couple of times during the 20 hours i've put into the game so far and a fix is surely coming. i'm a serious fan of souls games especially bloodborne and dark souls i and can honestly say this is the greatest game i've ever played. i love it. i think about it when i'm at work, when i sleep, when i poop. it is unhealthy how much i am into this game. send help."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,one of the most immersive and beautiful world's i've delved into in a long time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,elden ring is absolutely amazing and i'm having a great time and also getting my ass kicked. the open world is amazing and the enemies are awesome. i'm running this on my pc without facing any problems and i'm getting 55 to 60 fps consistently.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"there's no a good story, there's no a good musics, there's a disappointment graphics, there's a lot of performance problems."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,an actuall masterpiece in my opinion. the only problem this game has is the performance. its only truly horrendous at the tree sentinel boss fight after that its mostly fine. other than that i dont think ive played a better game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"haven't had any technical issues, but the game to me is just boring. sekiro was such a good game that brought the genre forward. elden ring is a 180 turn back to rolling around and cheap mechanics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"simply wonderful, i think is the bedt game i played... ever!!!! hard, bosses, super strong foes, weapons, armors and a huge map!!!! this game is soooooo goooood!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. don't buy the hype from the same people who told you cyberpunk was a 1010 masterpiece. just another generic fromsoftware game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"one of best games i ever played, the freedom to choose where to go is what makes this game so unique in the genre, enjoy until the last weapon or outfit discovered!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,solid game. my toaster of a computer runs it just fine. ultrawide is not really necessary for this game to be good  this game is great. classic dark soulsfrom software at their best.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"loved it! it's dark, gritty, cruel, and incredibly beautiful, exactly what you want from from software!! the story is so interesting and every tiny bit of lore you find is hype the music is once again amazing. best part for me was the open world, because it is huge and detailed and there are so many hidden secrets and things u can find, its impossible to find everything in just one playthrough... i play on pc and yes at max settings it can get choppy but with lowered settings it runs just fine. as long as the game looks great and the story is interesting, i dont really care if it runs at max settings or not, graphics aren't everything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"personal opinion the way any game performs is a necessary condition for me to enjoy such a game  it doesn't suffice to make an otherwise bad game enjoyable but it provides a set of conditions that allow me to proceed evaluating other aspects such as gameplay, art style or story. if it doesn't perform well, it really doesn't matter whether it is an artistic masterpiece redefining the medium or a cheap shovelware, i simply don't care. the former is the case of elden ring for pc. the game might indeed be a criticallyacclaimed masterpiece, yet it performs so badly i struggle to enjoy t regardless of how fascinating piece of work it is. imagine having a pc that runs comparable gaming titles at 1080p and stable 60fps when applying the highest graphical preset available. i've built my pc with the exact same consideration, to run most of the games flawlessly using these conditions. there are many demanding, resourceheavy titles my pc is too weak for to run flawlessly using the settings, yet the games from the same branch such as elden ring are certainly not the ones among them. i can run star wars jedi fallen order  a game that looks much better than elden ring  flawlessly, and the same applies to sekiro  a game that looks basically the same as elden ring and that uses a slightly modified engine and shares similar assetselements. however, in order to enjoy this game at 1080p and stable 60fps when applying the higest or just high! preset, you not only need to wait for the developers to release a patch that will likely eliminate the omnipresent stuttering that is common across the whole spectrum of pc configurations yes, all the users regardless of their rigs are affected, you also have to own a pc that was built with at least a 1440p type of gaming in mind. that is, you are expected to own now very expensive gpuscpus to enjoy the game in a way a user with regular midtier pc configuration enjoys most of the current games available. so you have to lower your demands to play the game flawlessly unless you own a superexpensive gpus such as 3080 ti or 3090. i don't like this attitude and i refuse to speculate whether it is an incompetence of the developers or some hidden intentions leaking from underneath, it really doesn't matter at the end of the day. bad optimization is a bad optimization. to all the players in denial  the stuttering is probably going to be fixed soon with the upcoming patches but the resourceheavy, poorly optimized segments of the game causing your performance to suddenly go from 5560s to 30s40s, not. so you better spend at least 1k to upgrade your gpu or purchase a ps5."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,overrated trash the ai is rubbish graphics are like from 2007 and soulsfans should get a life.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this game is a masterpiece. if you like souls games, you are going to love this! that being said, if you dont like souls games, theres a chance you may not like this. there is no journal, your compass isnt flooded with random markers. you just explore. every direction you go in will have something unique and interesting. the story is not shoved down your throat, but unlike other souls games you do not have to go looking for it. the game does a good job of explaining story elements as you go along. the combat is amazing, including the horse combat. while the horse combat is very simple, it feels good. fighting dragons on horseback is epic and feels amazing. i play on a 1650 and have had next to no issues. however i know a lot of other people have had serious performance issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,arabic language should be available by default.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"as a fromsoft fan, i had to play this game on release day, and it's been so hard to put down!! i actually love that it's become more accessible, with more safe spots before bosses for example. the exploration of the open world is addictive, i could run around for hours just gathering! you wouldn't believe how many little secrets you can find, there's just sooo much stuff! graphics are stunning, especially in the environment, and the boss animations are truly another level above ds3 or sekiro. i think this game had more repeatability than any souls game, and i will probably be playing this for years..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"what an experience! i expected much, but got even more than i could ever hope for. the world of elden ring is simply beautiful  it's harsh and unforgiving, but exploring it is the most fun i've had in months. is it perfect? no, but nothing really is. the things that i would improve are very minor things like some hiccups with coop disconnects understandable now that everyone's playing it that i can easily overlook in favor of how amazing the music is, the graphics, the combat gameplay, the boss design, the story.......i loved every second of it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"great game in scope, but not as much personality as the first dark souls or demon souls. it seems the more budget there is, the less memorable it becomes. at least the gameplay is really polished this time around. this game would be worth a 7 if not for the pc version technical shortcomings  lack of ultrawide support, capped framerate, constant stuttering. the fix for all of this is easily available but comes at the price of giving up all online mechanics and features. i will update my review if that changes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i am an average gamer with an average pc and have played all souls games before. elden ring far exceeded any expectations. it runs fine on my pc even without the newest hardware so i am not complaining about that for sure. i enjoy the beautiful graphics, the story, the amazing music... i was skeptical about the open world aspect, but they did it so well! there is so much to explore!! my favorite game ever is dark souls 3 but elden ring might top even that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,el mejor juego de from los que le ponen un 0 de calificacin son casuales que prueban por primera vez un souls entiendo que hay algunos a los que no les gustan este tipo de juegos pero darle un 0 es tonto
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"definitely not a game to make negative comments. but also it's not an exaggeratedly good game. the majority of recent games have ended in frustration. that's why the game is somewhat highly rated. a longawaited game. personally, i can't say that it fully met my expectations. it also did not disappoint. let's take a look at the good sides of the game. the game partially meets dark souls. it has a nice game design, although it has some missing parts. it promises a long playtime. open world trial successful. let's move on to the bad parts of the game. it definitely, as a 3a game has poor graphics for its release year. it has optimization issues and sometimes it affects gameplay badly. while the open world was partially successful, it was too simplistic and inadequate. it's a bit difficult to compare compared to dark souls games. because the boss designs and schematics look a bit amateurish. although the game difficulty seems to be simplified a bit, the open world is extremely timeconsuming and the main focus of the game, the bosses, is not very attractive. there are tons of problems i've encountered after 50 hours of gameplay. i just played it like a new dark souls game. this gave me some pleasure. many people have had problems with the game controls, which should be taken into account. in short, the game seems a little early released to me. if the optimization issues are fixed with a new update, my max score will be 7.5."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"tagline  most overrated runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that gta and assassin's creed are popular what specs you need to run it 60fps  1080p or 4k, without stutter or lag?  honest answer is that, no matter how good your pc is, no matter, if you have ps5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches. this game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. other examples would be cyberpunk 2077, fallout 76, anthem, battlefield 2042 and elden ring is another fine addition to that list. so what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers?  pretty much none of these. graphically for some weird reason this game goes back to 20122013. but 20122013 had lots of great games and at times elden ring even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. for 2022 aaa release this is bad. game that gets metascores 9597 in 2022, should have way more work put into it. next up is open world design  there's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. this is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. this is literally runescape game design 101, i have been playing runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about. quests if you can even call them are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. it's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. why i'm talking about runescape and not skyrim, you might ask  well because lore wise, skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game. combat is extremely similar to dark souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. same animations, same everything. anyone who says in that case that innovation is overrated has no right to criticize rockstar or ubisoft ever again, just saying. anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting. all in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights  margit and godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design. 1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for margit boss design and 1 point for godrick boss design. overall score 310  not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"game is a masterpiece. if you're a fan of the dark souls trilogy, bloodborne, or sekiro you'll feel right at home and notice heavy influence from games like breath of the wild."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"only reason i'm not giving this game a 10 is because the pc port is buggy and needs improvement, luckily we are in th early days of release so i am hopeful for fixes. as for more game related issues... the story so far is compelling and interesting, it follows the same formula as its dark souls predecessors player character is tasked with restartingextending age of some godlike figuremythos but the way that the open world has lent itself to exploration and discovery of this story is amazing. npc interactions are better than ever and the world feels very lived in with details to discover on every end of the map. like in other fromsoft games guidance is sometimes necessary to discover more minute details but i've come to expect that after playing the games for so long. elden ring is an evolution of the fromsoft formula, and i think the extreme hype given to the game has attracted a crowd the unfortunately has not experienced a fromsoft game before and was put off by either its difficulty or inaccessability. all in all though... review bombers git gud lol. no maidens?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"its amazing, ignore the other negative reviews, people are review bobbing it because they  at the game, its worth a shot if you like soul like games or want a challenging game that isnt piss easy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,it's a dark souls in an open field with a huge lighted tree in the middle.graphics are medicore and cutscenes are just drawing cards and there is no voice acting. it wants to combine breath of the wild with dark souls and people should demand evolution to all games even if they are fans of a specific game style.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"good game  if your a souls fan great graphics feels very open and free world nice horse mechanics the game is overrated. it just is. for souls fans tho. i get it,it get it. its a huge improvement and the game have alot of qualities. but overrated ?? hell yes! and of course git gudd is the only argument that fans will throw at you for not liking it. it just is not a game for everyone ok? and lets face it,there is basicly no story. it is breath of the wild with a more mature setting and alot higher difficulty. for many this sounds amazing. for me  not so much. i feel games like red dead redemption 2 or the last of us 2 are better games than this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i have about 20 hours in this game so far and i'm nowhere near finished with it but i wanted to go ahead and post a review now because i don't expect my opinion to change much from here on out. a lot of people are complaining about performance but i have been able to smooth my game out and get a consistent 60 fps with very minimal issues just from adjusting all my gpu settings and running in borderless windowed mode. is it disappointing that from software doesn't push the boundries with graphics or even attempt to optimize their games to run at 100 fps? yes, but do i care .... nope not when they keep putting out quality products. graphics  feels a little dated but overall still solid  810 controls  as a soulsbourne fan its got that old familiar feel, nothing wonky, works well  910 gameplay  its been very challenging and i like the additions of the mount and plenty of checkpoints so you can teleport around with ease. the game has been super enjoyable for me. having a full world to explore within a soulborne game is epic  1010 story  thus far it holds similar to most other from software games where you need to talk to a lot of npc's and read item descriptions and whatnot to get a good grasp on whats going on, but i find it very interesting so far  1010 the game is a lot more polished at release than most titles are these days, even with the few issues with performance here and there. they will patch the issues as we move forward and the game will only get better. a large chunk of the bad reviews are going to be people who experienced performance issues or people who didn't realize what they were getting into. i would not recommend this for anyone who couldn't hang in a previous soulsbourne game as its much of the same. for the rest of you, good luck tarnished."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,masterpiece! this is easily the best game i have played. everything is perfect
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"its really strange not a single critic mentioned how buggy this game is  they gave this game perfect 10 fake high scores fooling fans around the world. i think the people who reviewed this game were actually blind or they reviewed different version of this game with zero bugs  problems dont buy this game right now, save your money . wait a month or two until the annoying bugs are patched. truly disappointed with fromsoftware this time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"estou bem acima das recomendaes da from e mesmo assim, problemas atrs problemas. em 2022 no vou deixar isso passar, principalmente porque estava ansioso por isso."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,lmao at the maidenless scrubs. yeah the game has 60 fps lock and framerate stutter but it's not enough to ruin the experience. game is awesome.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"'when you've finished your 4th black forest gateau  here, have another, and try not to puke' putting 510 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of dejavu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat  of overly sweet cake. if, like me, you have played this series since demon's souls, you will realise elden ring is dark souls 4. or demon's souls 2  it doesn't really matter at this point. other than the slightly more open world structure the 'souls series was always somewhat open in structure and torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from bloodborne and sekiro. same player classes and animations? same enemy design, including enemy typesclasses? same pseudomediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere? same deadeyed, hollowvoiced npcs? same controls and combat system? same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions? same, boring, grindy progression system? same dieanddieagain repetitive gameplay? enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago? 'yes' to all of the above. mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. this is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' i have ever seen. it used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again. utterly sickening  i hope you like cake. and then more cake. after a palate cleanser of cake. all washed down with a warm glass of cake, chewed up and regurgitated into a pint glass by hidetaka miyazaki."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,even with some slight stutters. 1010 i have beaten all the other fromsoft games and this is the perfect blend of them
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this is probably the best action rpg i ever played so far, it's challenging, always surprising, artistically stunning, i can't really find any gameplay flaws, it's just a joy to play for hours and hours. tech wise it has stuttering problems right now at release, but luckily for me i had almost none, it runs at solid 1440p 60fps at ultra quality with an rtx 3070ti and ryzen 5 5600x, for the ones who struggle with the game performance don't worry because the developer already confirmed that fixes are coming soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is a masterpiece, this game is absolutely amazing. anyone leaving a negative review on here is just butthurt that they  too much at fromsoft games to be able to enjoy it. currently have 30 hours into the game and have experienced zero lag or stutter issues. people can't complain about the difficulty of the game so they make up a lame excuse to review bomb. this game is legendary."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"60 fps lock no ultrawide support clunky pc menu and keyboard layout can't keep a perfectly stable 60 fps even on low settings 800x600 thats when you know its gone too far graphics are the same as any other souls game that just adds to the fact that this game should run on any potato with stable 60 fps and 100200 fps on modern machines i'm glad the community isn't letting pure lazyness on pc ports get through like critics do, this is a fast reaction time based game, smoothness is fundamental for a nice experience, if console players can't see the frame drops because they already playing on 25 fps with insane amout of motion blur that's not my problem. souls game are the type of games to have performance mode run at 120hz and on pc have settings like nvidia reflex like gow did. is it possible to play the game on pc and enjoy it? yes, after 1.02.1 i'm playing the game normally but i can't make my mind around the fact that we could be getting a much more enjoyable experience, imagine paying 2k for a gpu just to get a game with midtier graphics lock you at 60 fps and still have drops lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the actual game content does not match the advertised content!! locks 60 frames, does not support 219, the picture performance is not as good as it should be in 2022 , my god, this is a game that requires highprecision operation, but its input lag is also very serious, the usual game is the keydown triggers the action, and you can rely on your reflexes to operate, but in this game it's the keyup that triggers the action, which is pretty bad."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is probably the biggest let down in a while with gaming, and its once again because critics hype up a bad game. the open world is really just closed areas with individual sections for everything that actually happens. it doesnt feel open world when playing the game. the stuttering is extremely bad and the people who say it is running fine are lying, as i have had multiple friends say its fine and then their game will start to freeze. dont buy it for the open world, and dont buy it unless you are a hardcore souls fan."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,can barely get the game running. much stuttering. looks great and gameplay seems nice and probably would be a great game. but all of that doesn't matter if i can barely play the game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,you guys are really crybabies . not gonna lie i have problems from this frame drop but it's not that problematic. i have a low budget pc and still can play really well. the game is amazing. the story is complex and the game is challenging. if you rated this masterpiece 1 or 0 you are a totally troll . souls games are my favorites and i am really a judging person and i can't see something bad in this game. the only problem this game has is you guys that can't get over a small problem and can't wait a little for a patch . this is not cyberpunk. the game is playable and doesn't have major bugs so maybe git gud!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"a big map doesn't make a better game. uninteresting, bland and boring. doesn't deserve any of it's perfect scores. heck, doesn't deserve more than a 6 if you stretch it a lot. the controls are just as bad as the story and visuals. the character feels heavy and moves so slow. feels clunky. sound was also uninteresting. nothing sticks to mind. so, a very below average game that was overhyped by possibly one of the most toxic fanbases there are. this kind of game needs to stop being produced."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the game has failures in too many aspects to make it playable, it seems a lie that pages dedicated to analyzing games can overlook these obvious problems if not because they directly charge from the publisher and give the notes without testing the game, hangs, outputs to the desktop, inability to maintain a stable frame rate, pulls for problems when loading areas in the background, control and camera problems"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"best souls game yet and so accessible, for someone who's very average at games this is still really fun. also the art direction is top notch."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this game is neither a magnum opus nor a pile of turd. tldr great game terminal case of consoleitus portus. i would give it a 9 if it weren't for the god awful, horrific, actual crime that is the pc port. playstation buttons instead of actual controls, i could only figure it out by trial and error since i already knew the ds control scheme. they decided to move the crucial keys to weird combinations cough 2 handing then release the worst pc port i have ever seen i fortunately did not encounter any issues playing on a gpu that's below the requirements, which confused me more than anything. mechanically the game is ds iii but more, neither copying or transcending it's predecessor much. the major change is the open world which makes it far easier to level up for a boss if he is legitimately too difficult, something that ds never dealt with well. i would say, whoever, the people who complain and give it a 0 because they think they have to grind for 20 hours can go git gud, since this is a souls game, and struggle against superior foes is a part of it to attain a sense of achievement. you do not need to 1 shot a boss to kill him. i do admit the game has it's flaws, like the movementcamera feeling dated by now, and torrent being a motorized pile of turds, but they do not overshadow the souls experience here. the plot in souls games never really was more than a vague purpose with a lot of disconnected lore, and while the whole grrm made this was a marketing stunt, the world isn't lacking in detail. it's there for you to draw your own conclusions, like any souls game, but without esoteric item descriptions that don't match their items. it's perfectly serviceable graphically it's also serviceable since the focus is on gameplay, though i had to admit it looks dated and even dark souls ii gives it competition. the style however, saves it, looking distinctly more alive and hopeful than the other souls games, which were decay at it's best. i would say elden ring made by fromsoftware is a great experience if you are already deep into dark souls. for newcomes, the open world makes it easier to do other things than in dark souls where you will face brick wall bosses where you pretend you're a crash test dummy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"pura magia, el mejor souls hasta el momento. los que se quejan no saben jugar d"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"this one is easy to analize. if you like souls games, you will love this one, it's like ds13, but bigger, open world, with a horse, and better graphics. if you don't like souls games, this one won't change your mind. yes, it a bit more accesible, it has more save points, like before bosses, fast travel. that's all good. but the gameplay is the same as in the ds and demon's souls games, it's still quite clunky, it feels like a game from 10 years ago. it's not like sekiro that was fast, precise, fluid. finally, the pc port is not good enough. it has slowdowns even in the best of computers, like mine. so, if you love dark souls, get this one, you know already, but get a console version if you can. if you don't like them or know what they are, stay away."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i would give this game a solid 10 if the pc port weren't this bad. no ultrawide support and 60 fps lock is just not acceptable anymore. it's even more enraging, because the game actually renders perfectly in uw resolutions, but they artificially block the already rendered 219 view with an overlay of black bars that forces a 169 look. behind those bars the gpu ist still rendering in uw. it's just unbelievable that they downgrade their own game on purpose. after playing dark souls remastered, that was developed by a third party studio qloc and had native ultrawide support, i can't belive that fs did again such a horrible job with the pc version. game itself is a masterpiece and i will edit this rating to a 10 if they patch out this overlay to let people play in common uw resolutions."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"games have never been as adventurous as this one. the breadth and depth of elden ring's world in incomparable with anything else. plus the gameplay, while challenging, is a blast. fyi, i thought dark souls was a tedious chore. elden ring, whilst on the surface not that different, somehow is the opposite. by the way, i have a decent but not great laptop and the game runs supersmoothly on high graphicssettings. no complaints at all actually. i'm lucky i guess, it's a shame lots of pcplayers do encounter perfomance issues. personally this is a masterpiece, a 10. the widespread issues make it a 9."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the hype was pretty much justified. yes, it has its problems right now on pc, which i hadn't noticed that obviously, so for me this factor had 0 influence. it's a beatiful, handcrafted open world in all traditions of soulsborne series, towards which i am totally bias'd and will enjoy every second playing it for years on."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"now over 40 hours into the pc release and this game is a banger, this is the perfect skyrim meets dark souls. you get that open world and exploration of skyrim but you get the methodical and meaty gameplay the souls series is known for. in elden ring fromsoft definitely cranked the difficulty meter up to an 11, some bosses taking 20 attempts but i always feel like each death is a learning experience, luckily fromsoft was nice enough to give us very close spawn points to many of the bosses. some of the smaller optional dungeons are interesting, the early one not posing much of a challenge but the later ones have some very cool unique bosses. speaking of bosses, i love the design for so many of the new bosses, the combination of delayed and quick attacks really keeps you on your toes. now, the game isn't perfect. the most notable issue if the frame drops reported by many on pc and i've had some connection issues when in other players worlds. but these are very minor problems that will probably be patched with the net week or two, so i wouldn't let it deter you from buying the game or rate it a 010 like a lot of people. overall, elden ring is a great game. there is so much to explore and so many unique bosses you can encounter in the game that will provide you with plenty of challenge on your way to becoming the elden lord. but it's just darks souls with horse and jump button! i fail to see the problem here."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,absolute peak of from software games. the sheer amount of content available for the player to explore is absurd.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"my mind is blown at the negative reviews. to me the game works just great on pc, and i'm playing in a laptop. the game is incredibly amazing, the best game i've ever played. rating a game a 0 because it doesn't support... ultrawide or whatever... that's a technical aspect that i don't care about, and it doesn't speak of the greatness of this game. this game is an 11, if i could give it. i hope the trolls giving the game a 0 get overwhelmed or balanced out soon by the 10 scores. they are just little kids shouting at a game because it doesn't run at constant 144 fps and at ultra wide 4k screens... just stop crying and enjoy the game. or buy gta or call of duty if this is what you want. this is the best video game of the 2020s no doubt. and also best open world. this is leagues ahead of breath on the wild or even dark souls. buy this now and play the hell out of it"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,this game is totally overrated. character animations are like wood. gaming media gave this game a high rating for money. i definitely do not recommend this game.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"when this game released, a lot of us have been met with a rocky launch due to performance issues. so my first hours of playtime were spent optimizing, trying out different settings both ingame and out. after a while, i decided to live with the frame drops and dive straight into it. now, 27 hours into the game, i can say with confidence that this is one of the best games i've ever played. the amount of exploration, variety, npc questlines, boss fights, mobs and dungeons is astonishing. legacy dungeons are some of the best fromsoftware has to offer and will go down in history as some of the most memorable dungeons in gaming. there is a ton of choice in combat with many weapons and viable playstyles. mounted combat, stealth and jumping attacks add extra layers of depth to the good old souls combat formula. all in all an enticing experience, wrapped in a beautifully crafted open world that feels much less like a checklist and offers a lot of freedom in organic gameplay approach. a 1010 should be used on extremely rare occassions, but is without a doubt justified in this game."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"it's fine. i'd like to see less open world and more dungeons. give me a big sprawling dungeon, or an open world undead parish with multiple routes. also some of the bosses are incredibly unfairbased off of new gimmicks mainly riding and leveling, rather than skill. you spend the eight hours beating ulcerated tree spirit without leveling, potentially the second boss you can run into. the first fight is also like ten times harder than vangard demon in dss. also some of the open boss fights may put the enemy in unfair positions during attack animations, and make something potentially undodgeable mainly the dragon so far, though sometimes the knight bosses anyway, my feelings are complicated. i'd almost say it is a misguided effort, some of the new features aren't very useful or fleshedthought out, however the gameplay works much better than it has any right to, certainly better than what happened with botw. i'm giving it a 10 because the user reviews here are insane."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"for soulsborne fans, especially dark souls 3 fans. this is great new expirience where you get to feel the empowered when the bosses moveset finally clicks and you kill the boss that you have been dying to for too long. for people that are new to the franchise, dont give up."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring is a culmination of the mechanics presented in the souls games, bloodborne, and sekiro, all wrapped up in a depressing highfantasy open world. the good while some optional sidebosses can be pushovers, the main bosses are well designed, intense, and challenging. finding brief moments to breathe or windows to punish within the bosses flurry of blows are all the more rewarding, and victory is as exhilarating as ever. the art design continuously inspires moments of awe, disgust, and morbid fascination. the player will witness abominations with grafted limbs and tree roots absorbing dozens of corpses as food, but in the same minute, will emerge to see a beautiful overview of vast, twisted landscapes of golden trees, spiraling castles, misted swamps, and beckoning ruins. progression blocks are nonexistent, as paths are innumerable. if a player cannot beat a boss, they can excuse themselves to explore dungeons and ruins scattered across the world, where they will discover upgrades, gain experience, and continuously grow stronger until they are up for the challenge. the entire map can be explored from the beginning. magic is more beautiful and satisfying than ever. the variety of spells at a players disposal has grown greatly. miracles and sorcery have received the biggest visual buff in this iteration by far and hit as hard as they look. swordplay has been made more diverse and interesting. players can discover ashes of war, special weapon skills, throughout the world. these not only affect the weapon scaling, but allow the player to customize weapons to their playstyle. hold your dagger to the sky and buff yourself and your friends. quickdraw greatswords like katanas. call down bolts of lightning with your warhammer. experiment to your hearts content. more good qol open world features. this open world game respects your time. points of grace, the checkpoints of elden ring, offer a fast travel system immediately with no cost or consequence. stakes of marika exist right next to nearly all challenging areas and bosses. when the player dies, they may choose to teleport to these stakes instead of points of grace, allowing them to avoid wasting time repetitively traversing the same long path and rechallenge the boss or encounter immediately. the player receives their horse in an hour or less. the horse can be summoned anywhere in the open world from an item on the players belt, can double jump, and can be ridden in combat. there is no stamina loss outside of combat. infinite sprinting and jumping while traveling from point to point. crafting can be done on the go, anywhere, anytime out of combat. this includes arrows, bombs, consumable buffs, and elemental weapon buffs. no special stations needed. basic materials are abundant, plentiful, and respawn on rest. tears, the health and mana potions of elden ring, refresh on enemy pack kills. players can seek out enemies to replenish their health instead of resting. nitpicks certain enemies were directly ported from dark souls 3. the infamously annoying thralls from dark souls 3 have been reskinned as stout imp gargoyles that populate various catacombs and caves throughout limgrave with zero changes to their movesets. the giant crabs also reappear from the previous title with zero changes to their moveset. it would have been cool to see the developers renovate these enemies a little to make them distinguishable from previous iterations. i would have liked if the horse controls were tighter. the horse cannot turn a sharp angle without first moving forward, meaning the player cannot turn the horse around on a narrow platform without walking off the edge. certain jump puzzles are also an unnecessary headache for this reason. the developers laid it on a little thick with the difficult encounters right from the beginning. while i personally love throwing myself at a difficult boss until i can overcome it, players unfamiliar with the souls genre that encounter the tree sentinel or dragon just a stones throw away from the tutorial are in for a jarring experience. while i find many performance issues to be overblown at the time of writing this, they aren't nonexistent. while in confined areas, the frame rate is completely stable. while in the open world, however, the frames will often dip into the 40's or 30's. this will hopefully be improved with further patches, but it would have done the game justice if optimization was up to a better quality before release. players cannot ride horses while in coop. they are also confined to whichever area they have been summoned to, and coop is dissolved once a boss has been beaten. while this is not new to the souls genre, it's a little strange when implemented in the open world, as field bosses are often not too far apart from one another. all in all, i cannot stop playing this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"elden ring.... its a mesmerising and fantastical, fantasy world, ready to explore! but  not what it seems!...repetitive landscapes, cant climb, water looks like its from minecraft and you cant swim in it! oh and pc controls are a massive pain in the butt!... having to hit g for the map key because it wont bind to another key just highlight some of the ridiculous and lazy issues that really shouldn't exist with these aaa games!..supposedly made for multiple platforms! reminds me of the usual pc port goofiness that the other souls games all suffered with, so i kinda expected some issues, but not as bad as this. this game like so many these days has been designed for consoles..with a slightly raised two fingered gesture to pc owners! so not off to a good start with the lack of keyboard configuration options. on a positive note, it runs and looks coolish in 4k on a 48in lg oled 120htz screen, though it needs an i910900k, 64gb ram and rtx 3090 to achieve that! though weirdly its still got a 60fps cap in the pc version, just like the consoles! that's just  fact there is mod out after a day to bypass this, asks the question, why couldn't the developers have offered that option too? ive only put just a few hrs into the game so  one thing ive noticed and its already really, really starting to irritate me! its just too damn  a painful and irritating grind!!! i like a bit of a challenge, am used to setting any difficulty level at the start to accommodate my ability and style of play, but this game has no difficulty settings, just its one level  nightmare! its starting to take the fun out of an otherwise amazing experience. its also a bit repetitive and boring... enemies scattered about as if its a chess game, just placed willy nilly by whoever programmed it!, wolves spawning from the sky in front of you! wow its just ridiculous! and other weird creatures all just waiting till you get within their attack  forget stealth, its almost non existent, so creeping about is a pointless exercise and option. their is no real ai, just animals and enemies scattered about the landscape with their own specified attack radius, step inside that radius, they come at you, step outside it again by running away, they stop. i think skyrims ai is better! and that game is 11 years old! i initially and overexcitedly gave this game a  am afraid the lack of pc controls with irritating binding issues, coupled with the game destroying insane fixed difficulty  more than a  a painful and self torturing experience to even want to push on after dying so many  save options, just respawn back at your last 'grace' location which could be 3040 mins of gameplay behind you! wasted!....like i said before, the difficulty just feels like its set to nightmare, especially after a few hours in, the fact it cant be changed is a complete game breaker for me! its just making me want to stop playing it. such a shame the gameplay is repetitive and grinding, because the artistic creativity and amazing buildingscreatures in elden ring is a work of pure art! this game could of been great...lets leave it at that."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"c'est un chef d'uvre tout simplement. l'univers que fromsoftware  faonn est grandiose, immersif. l'exploration de la map est tellement addictif pour vous dire, j'ai pass environ 10 h  explorer l'entre de terre avant de m'attaquer au premier boss. en parlant de boss, ils sont charismatiques et bien fichus. l'architecture du chteau de voilorage est  en perdre la tte, il y a des recoins partout. pour le moment je n'ai que des petites baisse de fps, mais rien de bien mchant donc quand je lis que le jeu est injouable, qu'il n'est pas beau, je me pose des questions ou sois on ne joue pas au mme jeu. je pense que c'est le meilleur jeu auquel j'ai jou jusqu' prsent et j'en suis qu'au dbut aprs 20h de jeu. pour tous les fans de challenge et d'exploration, foncez !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"the year is 2022.  20fps dips on a 12900k, 64gb ddr5 ram, pcie 4.0 m.2 and an rtx 3090  no ultrawide support  60fps cap  defended to the death by souls fans and i'm not even complaining about the difficulty... no excuse to not support those things when i can fire up indie games from 10 years ago and they do."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,probably one of the best game ever. never mind the haters they are probably noobs that do not have the skill to handle this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"amazing game, only had minor stutters and not very often. the world is beautiful and the enemies are amazing and a good variety"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,git gud. good graphics good weapons good story good characters monke aprove
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game os simply overwhelming, fromsoftware is again elevating the concept"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"after getting so angry reading the dumb 0 and 1 star reviews, i made an account to share an honest opinion about the game. here are my responses to the common complaints. pc performance. i have had very moderate frame rate drops into the 3040 fps range. this only happens in the open world, and only when moving between large sections. so this happens about 2 of the time during my 45 hour sessions. the game runs perfectly otherwise. no ultra wide support. this has to be the dumbest reason to give a 0 score. i could see this knocking one or two points for an average reviewer, but to give this game a 0 because there is no ultra wide support is ridiculous. playing in 4k on a 55 oled tv is absolutely amazing. empty world  boring  no story. there is an absolutely amazing story being told in elden ring. from the start, you are encouraged to become essentially the queenking of the lands between. the voice acting is genuine. the atmosphere and environment is very encapsulating. conclusion im only 16 hours in and feel like i have scratched the surface of what the story is and what powersweapons i will find. i feel like im playing ocarina of time all over again. the story there wasnt obvious from the very beginning, and neither is it here. just like many other open world games, until you start leveling  finding new items  and gaining new powers, you have yet to see what the game truly offers. absolutely 1010. in a day where over saturated dl2, horizon fw open world games are still being made, elden ring is a breath of fresh air that allows you to discover the world and have fun, just like the legend of zelda series has."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"a positive evolving of dark souls franchis, but still not suitable for everyone. i'll give a 10 out of 10, only if fromsoftware were able to fix the input lag and framerate issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"best souls game to date, this is a combine of all previous games with new mechanics that make the formula better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"really great so far. i don't really have any technical issue but i can't sleep playing this game, masterpiece indeed, theres always something new to discover, and boss fight? get me going all day."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"anyone who rated this game a 0 either has a garbage pc, or theyre trash at challenging games. this game is legit breath of the wild exploration with the best combat in any game ever. 100010 game. perfect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"no russian or ukrainian voice acting, no support for ultrawide resolution 5120x1440 to 329 format"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,the game is super satisfying with it's two sided gameplay loop of exploring a beautiful world and then finding and fighting cool monsters. it's so easy to just explore to your hearts content. ignoring the main story path and without beating godrick or exploring stormveil castle i managed to explore all the way from dragon barrow to mt. gelmir on the other side of the map.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i understand people complaining about the difficulty curve. i was actually hesitant about purchasing elden ring because of the same thing. last souls game i truly enjoyed was demon souls, since then i lost patience to really learn the mechanics. that said i found elden ring significantly easier, just dodge a lot and you're good. i am 70 hours in and still havent bothered with parrying, just dodge. i would actually compare this to breath of the wild, also a higher difficulty curve, but the fun of the game is the exploration and just going wherever you want, there is a sort of structure to follow, but like botw you actually should do a lot of other things before hitting the main points. and because i chose to just explore, i didnt have to grind any mobs or cheese my way to level up, i just naturally was the level i should be. on to story. the story is actually quite good, i wouldnt say a song of ice and fire storytelling good, but it kept me interested. the way story telling is done is what i enjoyed. in a normal rpg i may skip past the dialogue of a random npc to save time. in elden ring, every random npc is the story progression. so you will get bits and pieces as you play, and without an intended order of receiving those pieces. i never felt lost or confused, and every new person, faction, and secret region i discovered taught me so much more about the world and its inhabitants in a meaningful way. in conclusion, elden ring isnt a typical rpg, if you want the next elder scrolls this isnt it. however if you want a dark grimy world that has a surprising amount of beauty and are willing to put in some time to struggle in some areas but persevere then elden ring may be a good fit for you. watch a youtube video or 2 before purchasing anything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"full of bugs, gameplay is meh. even cyberpunk was better and worked better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,a cheap reskinned dark souls suffering from extreme consolitis and cyberpunkism. the paid shill reviews are plain laughable. not even worth peerating.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"choo choo, hype train has left the station. all the controls are shown as console buttons, makes it extremely confusing on pc. it was also heavily advertised as a coop game but it took an hour to figure out how to gather the supplies needed for coop. after joining with a friend, he kept dying which disconnects him from the coop server. this means you're also forced to reset and die and have to find each other again. on top of that, the whole time my friend was just lagging and flying everywhere. basically coop is impossible in this game and there's no way i'm playing this pos by myself. save your money and play something else."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"it's like if cat mario was the only mario game, sure some people have the time to die over and over again, but that's just not how the modern gaming works, give us normal mario. big monster dodgeandroll games have been done before. it's based on archaic outdated game design. give us something new and innovative. elden ring does nothing to improve upon similar games, besides a minor graphics refresh. just like cod and fifa. ask yourself  is the game actually fun to play or is it just fun to finally kill the big monster after dying 100 times? if 90 of the game isn't fun, it's not fun. is it too much to ask to be having fun for most of the time while playing? the gaming industry is a lot bigger and more accessable than when previous difficult games were released. game reviewers need to take that into consideration, niche millennial games deserve low scores, or at the very least a very clear warning that it's probably not worth playing unless you've played previous soulslike games. plus all the menus, interfaces, and controls are counterintuitive and awful. have they played any popular modern game? they should be getting low scores for the controls alone  space should be jump, shift should be run, c or ctrl should be crouch, m should be map, and tab should be for regularly used menu items. just admit that you want to play more dark souls, don't pretend it's a good game worthy of new players picking it up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"elden ring has to be the most overrated piece of crap i have ever seen in my life. this game is garbage in every way graphics, combat, story, physic, music, frame rate, enemy design and so on. even so, ign and metacritic give it 1010 and 95100 lmao. at this point game journalist are a joke. i can't believe that elden ring devlopers are those who made the legendary game sekiro."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i bought this on pc with a geforce rtx 3070 gpu and i9 cpu. your mileage may vary, but i have ahd very few technical problems with the game 1 crash in 16 hours of playtime, had trouble summoning other players in a large nonlegacy dungeon last night. overall, i am stunned by how richly detailed from software made a world this big. it is ana bsolute joy to play. i have avoided spoilers up to this point and suggest you do as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is a masterpiece, the optimization is its downfall which will hopefully be fixed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,this is the ultimate game of all time. this is not an exaggeration it's undisputed fact.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game is absolutely fantastic in every way but one the pc performance is quite bad. i can live with a 60fps cap, but the frequent stutters really sour the experience. i've been able to really enjoy the game despite the severe optimization issues, but i'm really disappointed in from software for releasing the game like this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is great if you're not severely effected by a variety of problems. nobody is affected by all of the problems, but everyone typically has at least something that affects them. most common is that the game dumps and loads areas as fast as possible which tanks performance briefly. you can probably find the invisible triggers for the loading of areas with trial and error. another common one is that the game might run fine on highend hardware for some people, but then run terribly for others because of something going on with the computer's priority settings. though i suppose it goes without saying that vocal minority of course exists with common complaints about ultrawide support... when ultrawide is a minority within a minority. regardless there's a mod that fixes it apparently, which begs the question as to why it's just not default in the game? but the anticheat doesn't like the mod i guess so no multiplayer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"almost perfect game, leveling system feels weird compared to other souls games but amazing game overall. beautiful world, fun enemies, and amazing bosses"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the combination of sloulsborne  sekiro gameplay is such a experience that's feels something like playing dark souls for the first time. making it an open world also is such a experience in this game. it's ain't rdr2 levels of open world, but it's fitting for this game. the only thing i have a problem with is the enemies kinda loose sight of you really quickly even though i'm in their line of sight. some mini bosses have a couple of exploits, but it's not new in these types of games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i go with the logical if horizon forbidden west isnt a 10, there is no way this game should be a perfect one.!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"um excelente jogo em termos de jogabilidade , grfico e histria porm em termos de desempenho no pc  realmente uma vergonha stuttering , quedas de fps a todo momento ou seja desempenho medocre mesmo em hardware de alto desempenho."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"if youre a fan of high fantasy, open world rpgs and the soulsbourne genre, then this is the game of your dreams. the world  character design is amazing. the scale of the world, the density, the verticality are incredible. theres nothing else like it. ignore the trolls reviews binging this game, its a masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"so i played all the souls game at the dawn of time yes, the original dark souls 1 and 2prerelease of sotfs, dark souls 3, original demon souls, and slightly bit of bloodborne at my friend 's house since i don't have a ps4 and is a pc geek after i sold my ps3. i haven't play sekiro  any sooner in the future. you could say, i am a huge soulsgame enthusiasticexcluding the sekiro part, i am not huge fan of samurai, ninja themed, and since then very few game that could satisfy me like these game did. elden ring, however, managed to do it, and  live up to the hype. the major point is, the game's a mixture of skyrim and witcher, which's not a bad thing to start off those who said, it's not creativity in 2022, it's not original in 2022,...blablabla is literally braindead and ignorant of how they see things. like, every literaturepart that was put in the gaming industryexcluding gears ofc, is a copy cat of each others from the start, so shut the  up. however, it's more likely skyrim than witcher, the amount of freedom you get from elden ring is incredible, you can literally do anythingwell not exactly anything, but roam freely to anywhere on the map, randomly encounter everything in the game, while keeping the challengecore part intact, like many of its predecessors. yes, these hardcore challenge  open world mechanism had made the game unplayable by some peopleand the game is 100 quest free no pin point or glue to find but using senses, you can keep your opinion on it. but judging the game by not having stories, not having,.... and is boyscotting a certain game, is literal braindead. about the game's main problem, stuttering and fps dropdown, i just don't think it's a problem since i am playing it on an x o s series then compare it to my pc, consoles ported games sometime have problems and it's fine to have it if it was minor, not some critical damage to the device which run it lol, probably all the huge scores came from consoles critics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is a complete masterpiece, excellent gameplay and graphics, large open world and full of details, the only complaint is in fact the bad optimization that results in frequent fps drops. easily the goty of 2022."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"negatives terrible pc port can't navigate the uimenu without both keyboard and a controller  wtf gameplay is so overrated good if you like that console lock onto an enemy style of fighting capped at 60fps the game shows the xbox controller only in game press y. no ultrawide support terrible stuttering it's like the rev limiter keeps bouncing off the 60fps cap and then major drops for no reason  this is critical in a game like this which is difficult and requires accurate timing. even when the game is running at 60 it feels like it is 30fps i don't know why. drm issues positives lots of content  huge game. maybe something like major stuttering could be patched. on the whole it's nice to have a game which has a lot of content, but for me the pc port is unforgiveable. it is obvious the pc was not a consideration when developing the game. if you like dark souls get it on a console."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"don't listen to all these complainers. yes, this game is taxing on the machine but if you have a decent one you're in good shape. what did you expect. other than that here are the facts 1 enjoyment it's incredible and fun. all the best aspects pulled into one 2 graphics gorgeous. i understand if your rig can't play at max then lower the settings 3 sounds music and effects are great this is an instant classic. don't fill your head with everything people are saying and just try for yourself"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"as a huge fan of fromsoftware who has played every single release since ps3 demon souls i can no longer call myself a fan of this developer. they have dropped the ball on the pc port more than cd project red has with cyberpunk when it comes to performance and optimization. horrendous stuttering, fps ranges between 2040 on a machine that should be able to keep a steady 60 at least, awful glitches with enemies, npcs, and torrent the mount flickering in and out of existence, and texture popping in and out as they load. meanwhile the games journalists call this trainwreck of a pc port a master piece. not to mention the last minute drmanticheat that was added due to the hackers in das3 a month before release. i have nothing to comment on gameplay itself since i dropped it due to it being completely unbearable, imagine having healthbars attacking you out of nowhere while you riding an invisible mount at 20 fps, how is that enjoyable? shame on fromsoftware for screwing over its fanbase and releasing a game at its current state."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"was a horrible experience with multiple crashes, a lazy system in menu using controller prompts instead of keys it just felt like a very poor port. the fps went to 15 alot of times during boss fights and even some standard battles. no ultrawide support. don't believe all the professional reviewers who were paid for their opinion or the fan boys who were so awe struk by another soul's clone that they needed to occupy their time. completely unacceptable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"feel  could be the best game i have ever played  never played dark souls and just started sekiro a week before elden ring release so im learning and it is an incredible experience. around 20 hours in, the closest i have ever felt to this was in the 3rd grade when mario64 came out and i couldnt put it down, it was just so unbelievable to me at the time, and that is how elden ring feels to me now. worlddesignscomparisons  morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, witcher 3 have all been incredible games of a similar type that ive played and elden ring is in its own tier above them and unbelievable in comparison  the combat and in game systems are incredible, the open world is the best open world experience i have ever had  the scale, the secrets, the detail, the art style, the adventure and exploration.... you can tell this world is handcrafted. the level design in the first legacy dungeon is the best level i have ever seen in a game verticality, hidden secrets, aesthetics, scale, enemies, stealth. the lack of in game systems to aid players is one of my favorite aspects  you have to learn on your own, i am very much a self learner though. optimizationperformancecontrols  i spent some time optimizing my pc beforehand  tweaking various setting in windowsnvidiamouse cpi and in game controls mouse sensitivity after first patch to make sure i would run it fine. i could use my controller and it might be more intuitive than the mouse keyboard, but honestly ive gotten used to the mouse and keyboard and it feels fine. i'm playing in the high graphics setting and fps is 5760. i don't really notice any issues with the prep i did beforehand. graphics are breathtaking and beautiful, the ray tracing is amazing. also of note  i have not experienced any noticeable bugs in the game  it already feels very polished to me. if you understand pc's and know how to change settings on your pc and not just in game, or are capable of learning how to and are above minimum requirements to play the game, i don't see how you could not achieve desirable performance running the game. character  im not typically a spell caster in rpg games i typically go ranger types, but here i went astrologer and magic is incredibly fun! although i cant wait to play numerous others character builds at some point  the customization feels like a sandbox. all in all, this game isnt for everyone  but if you are ready in your life for a true adventure and put the effort and time forward to learn and explore  it will give you the time of your life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is an absolute must play, 1010, im playing on pc with a gtx1080, ryzen 5600x, 32gb ram, at 1440p, ive had barely any issues, 2 crashes to desktop in 40 hours played, no progress lost, so a minor inconvenience at worst. slight frame drops in some areas but nothing that severaly impacts your enjoyment."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"immense, absolutely full of attention and detail on every corner. its dark souls open world, its crazy to think about the fact i'm playing this game masterpiece. its unreal. too bad the performance on pc lacks some polish, but in the long term, i already know this will be another eternal classic. well done fromsoftware, well done!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"un juego de 10 con sus defectos como cualquier souls en lanzamientos que con un parche se solucionara, por el momento estoy aplicando ciertas configuraciones para reducir el stuttering doy los pasos q me funciono a mi presiona la tecla windows busca configuracin de grficos agrega el ejecutable de elden ring, presiona opciones y escoge alto rendimiento para graficas nvidia ve al panel de control nvidia  controlar la configuracion 3d tamao cache sombreador ilimitado"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,the best work that people all over the world should play. it's so funny that i forget the passage of time. games in this studio are always genius.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i wont go into the obvious pc issues that have already been mentioned numerous times. i'm sure most of these will be patched eventually. if you like dark souls games, which i do enjoy, then elden ring is like dark souls on steroids.. it borrows soo much from the dark souls series, i'm thinking they should of named it dark souls iv. that's where my issue with the game comes in. i do like the dark souls series, however with george r.r. martin writing for this game, i was expecting a story rich adventure, in the world of a new franchise. elden ring does not feel like that new franchise offering a new experience which i had high hopes for. it's an ok game, but doesn't offer anything original. if you want to play dark souls 4 then you'll love elden ring. if you are expecting an original experience to immerse yourself in the writings of george r.r. martin. then i recommend passing on this game, or wait for a sale."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,ya estubo bueno de que nos vendan juegos rotos y se los perdonemos porque son obras maestras eres una caga de persona miyasaki
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game is a 9,9 game which will be a 10,0 when the next patches to fix more performance come out. for me it runs smoothly and i think wide screen support would give unfair advantages in pvp due to the fov. this game is definitely phenomenal below the surface of issues many other users were pointing out like missing wide screen support and performance issues. i don't think it's fair to rate a game as poor as 010 for just one or two issues, even if it's unplayable for a certain amount of time, it'll soon be and you will definitely enjoy it. it's not fair to rate a game poorly for only one or two issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"lots of performance issues, it makes the game feel off compared to the console versions."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,one of the worst pc ports possible. disgrace to see critics give almost unplayable game these scores. elden ring gets 0 on pc. critics get 100 for their obvious bias and probably paid for reviews.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,easy goty! runs perfect for me and most immersive addicting game i have played in years. game is a vibe!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"todas y cada una de las reviews positivas del juego son acertadas, una impecable banda sonora, direccin artstica, combates e inmersin de su mundo abierto son merecedoras de dieces. soy consciente de los problemas tcnicos y bajones de fps en pc, pero hablando desde mi experiencia i5 4570 1050ti 16gb de ram tcnicamente no debera ni cumplir con los requisitos mnimos, pero estoy disfrutando el juego perfectamente, en los combates contra jefes voy a 60fps, mientras en su mundo abierto a 30fps."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"do not buy if you play keyboard and mouse. all the input prompts are designed for an xbox controller style input. finding the keyboard key that is mapped to the action for the button it's indicating will not work, leaving it impossible to complete some actions. in addition invisible enemies, stuttering, and input lag on the keyboard and mouse may be a result of stuttering? idk make this extremely frustrating to play. i'm playing on a 5950x w 64 gigs of ram and a 3080. i shouldn't have any stuttering so it's obviously some issue. maybe it'll be patched complete one day. it's not as disappointing as cyberpunk was on launch, as long as you want to play with a gamepad. if you really want to play this game get it on console or wait for a salemassive patching."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i don't ever give a zero on metacritic, but i am for elden ring cause the game won't even launch if you use a controller. if you disable xbox controller configs and steam input, then the game will launch, but hitting any controller button merits no response from the game. when you then swap to a keyboard, the game will permanently display controller buttons instead of keyboard keys, so you have no clue how to do anything. there's no fix. having watched my fiance play it gives me more complaints. the game will often drop to the single digit framerates when you get too close to the border of a new major area of the open world and it will certainly end in your demise if you happen to be in a fight at the time. the pc the happens on is using an rtx 3090 and a ryzen 5050x, so you can't blame the hardware. it's a well know problem that you can find via any google search from the very first result. even bing finds it. furthermore the story is bland and has been used by dozens of other games and the character names are so bad they make me cringe. this is nothing but a reskinned, partially replaced 3d model clone of demon's souls on ps3, just like every other souls game. there's nothing special about it and it doesn't even remotely deserve a score like metacritic gives it even when it's working. this is a huge slap in the face to the truly great games who have upper 90s score, like the legend of zelda breath of the wild, ocarina of time, and others. i strongly suspect bribes went into this as well as a societal obsession with george rr martin who only gets notoriety for managing to get full nudity and sex a dozens times per episode onto hbo. i suppose it saves on porn subscriptions. personally, i'll choose the latter option any day. porn stories are somehow less cringeworthy than elden ring's story and i could never in my life have imagined saying any story is worse than clist porn."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i find it hilarious tht i am forced to give a 1010 to a game tht i havent even finished because of the reviewbombing of ppl tht did not also finish the game, tht dont even own the game and are salty because a game genre they dont like is being successful, and performance issues malders. performance isnt good but its not unplayable to the point of giving a game 0. funny how for one time in your life you should actually listen to some game journos and not the community which is appalling. this is like the situation where italians would reviewbomb games a 0 because they didnt have italian dubs. my thoughts having 12hours in and defeating the first two main bosses are tht the story seems pretty interesting like any other souls game, the combat when the game runs smoothly is really great especially with the new weapon arts, open world is somewhat empty... and thts someone who hasnt played the game would tell you. i dont want to spoil the open world but there is a lot to uncover in it trust me. bosses are amazing. world design is great graphics arent tht good just a bit of a step up from ds3 and the performance isnt good. when you load into areas the frame does drop in pretty much every pc which is smthing tht needs a fix. if you like any souls game you should absolutely get this one. let the haters, which unfortunately exist for this game, cope harder and just enjoy yourself its a really good game so far."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i honestly don't care about the lack of ultrawide support, locked fps, and i didn't make it far enough into the game to experience the stutter everyone is talking about, which i am confident i could ignore for the most part. in fact, i only made it as far as the main menu screen  several times in fact. why? because the devs couldn't do a basic thing that most others have figured out decades ago controller support for pc games. seriously, what is this disgrace? not only did my ps4 controller not work on steam by itself tried big picture mode and enabled the configuration in settings as well, still no response in game, but even after i installed ds4windows and got it to work, there were only xbox prompts provided... this game is available on ps4 as well you muppets! just include the configuration from there! in fact, you could even just use different icons, replacing the xbox ones if you felt lazy, but noooo, you were super lazy! well, guess what, i am not going through a 60100 hour game trying to memorise what button fits the prompt shown to me. i got a refund, and you lost a customer and get a negative review now. guess i'm watching a let's play now, since from what i've seen, the game is actually good. too bad you couldn't even do the bare minimum for me... but you got all the 1010s from the incompetent game journalists, so everything is good for your shareholders... next time, try harder!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game itself is fantastic. its truly open world. the decision to alleviate all map markers and quest markers was at first daunting, but, ended up being a fantastic choice. it truly gives you the freedom to not be too tied to any questline and instead incentivizes the player to freely roam the world. from entry, theres no hold handing at all in this game. its truly up to the player to piece everything together and get combat downpat all by their lonesome. this leads to an incredibly rewarding feeling when you finally beat a boss or even simply defeat a group of goons for the first time. speaking of enemy variety, elden ring exemplifies enemy design and some enemies truly are nightmare fuel. theyre so imaginative but also strangely believable in this weird world. this game is definitely not for everybody. it requires immense patience, persistence, and sometimes will downright frustrate the hell out of you especially if youre new to from software titles as i was. but when it clicks, it is truly a one of a kind game. the variety of combat is excellent. you can play this game in pretty much every way imaginable and theyre all fun. timing a perfect parry or dodging just at the right moment is so incredibly rewarding when done right. learning how to not be pummeled by a group of enemies and single them out is also rewarding. the challenge in this game, though frustrating, really gives out those dopamine hits once you complete something correctly. its made so well to frustrate you just enough but always make you want to keep playing. graphically the world is straight up gorgeous but also dark and harrowing. the aesthetic of the game matches the challenge of it. all of this said, there are elements to this game that feel dated or weirdly lacking in polish. for one, its clear the pc port is definitely an afterthought. the settings leave much to be desired with no option for higher refresh rates than 60hz or widescreen support. its so laughable how little care they gave to the pc port. they didnt even have the time to switch the display for controller button inputs to mouse and keyboard button inputs when playing. this means when going through dialogue, itll still show as though you should press x button to continue or exit the interaction on a game pad. i mean come on, changing this is the least you can do. on top of it, the button mapping on pc is just awful. shiftleft click for alternate attacks or using the arrow keys to toggle quick items feels unbelievably bad. if youre playing on pc, do yourself a favor and buy an xbox controller to play the game with. they clearly did not have pc players in mind when coming up with the control scheme. the interfaces and ui feel extremely dated, unintuitive and clunky. while i completely disagree with players saying they feel as though the graphics are from a ps3 game, the ui and interface definitely feels generations behind. i understand this game is going for being difficult, but i didnt foresee that difficulty leaking into frustration with ui such as an unreadable mess when opening your characters stats. it makes the game so unapproachable for new players which is really a shame. leave us up to our own in combat, sure, but at least let me understand what the hell im looking at when im in my inventory or looking at my stats. i understand i can open a menu for explanations on stat breakdowns but the breakdowns are awful and explain nothing. on top of this, its just downright ugly. when opening any options menu it really took me out of the beautiful game and was just off putting. its drab, dark, grey and doesnt have 110 of the charm or thought that was clearly put into the rest of the game. i know you have a small staff, but please for the next game hire somebody whos forte is ui. itd truly level up the game. all of these downsides dont take away from the fun i have, though. i dont usually love open world games as they typically are super broad but have no depth and this game has both. there is so much packed into this game that im sure theres tons ive missed while playing and that definitely ups its replayability. which means you may be playing this game for a long, long, long time. definitely just dont feel tight giving this game any less than a 910. a few hiccups here and there but all around stellar and a step forward for open world games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"constant fps drops, stutter and horse, npc invisible. i exceed the requirements. trash port, fix your game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,look at all these scrubs rating this masterpiece a zero. get gud losers
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"un gioco stupendo, con qualche problema di framerate e mi sarebbe piaciuto che ci fosse un bestiario alla the witcher 3, ma il resto  praticamente perfetto. le critiche per il framerate fanno ridere, non  ottimizzato cos male come molti pensano. ma alla gente piace criticare"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,this game is amazing. all most completely perfect only complaint is that there are very small glitches where the frame rate drops a bit when fighting but it doesnt really change much
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game has so many shills that are so quick to dismiss any legitimate concerns or problems, it's hilarious. the game looks like dark souls 3, runs like turd. 3090 at 2k resolution drops frames left and right. no dlss. it's probably not a zero but to offset those shills i'm giving this title a zero."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"3060 ti 36gigs no issues seen. it's taken the best of everything from from's games, then had a baby with skyrim. they had me at jumping, let alone giving me a horse that can double jump and non linear maps. story? don't care. i think ones happening, haven't really looked. i've been riding around the map all weekend picking fights i shouldn't and loving it. it's a souls game, i can read the story on youtube later, there's a horseyboy to be cheesed!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,cognitive dissonance runs high with this one. this game is trash. insanely difficult fights make you think this game is better than it is. the grind makes you justify the time you have spent on this hot turd. it has no story. how can a game with no story get 10. so many bugs. it is just a poor port of dark souls 2 in an open world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"let's start off by saying i'm a huge fan of dark souls. now that we have that out of the way, let's get into the core reason for a 210... performance and proper pc support. gameplay for this game, as well all know, is excellent however, the lack of proper attention to the pc release has ruined the experience for many. everything from ctd at launch, to launching into a blank white screen, variable stuttering on everything from low to highend systems, lack of widescreen support they render black boxes over the edges, yet the game still renders behind those just fine, lack of vsync toggle, an artificial framerate limit some claim animations are tied to framerates, yet it's been unlocked by breaking eac, among other issues. with all the games recently launching on pc with abhorrent issues, gamers can't let it slide anymore. it's 2022 and this game launched without proper ultrawide and superultrawide support, things supported by various games on smaller budgets going on 20 years ago. this is the first mainstream game don't kid yourself stating that a multimillion seller is niche that i can recall that not only does this, but doesn't have a vsync toggle and caps framerates on pc. it's pretty clear that fromsoftware put minimal effort into their pc release. it's bad enough to have those issues, but to have crashing issues plaguing so many and horrid stuttering due to them not optimizing their shaders when they have such a huge budget is just a shame. lord knows if they'll ever fix it either, as they didn't really address much with dark souls 3. unlike dark souls 3 though, we have easy anticheat to contend with, which disables our ability to apply community made mod fixes to address the issues. so now we're reliant on a developer that's historically disconnected from their fans on pc, as evidenced by their past releases. i gave them 3 days to address the lack of ultrawide at least, and all they did was send out a patch to fix stuttering that didn't resolve stuttering and actually caused the white screen issues. since then i have refunded the game and will not return until they fix all other issues. if they fix all the issues, then i'll update my review accordingly. my specifications amd 2700x 32gb ddr4 4x 8gb red devil 6900xt ultimate 256gb western digital black nvme lg 34 ultrawide 3440x1440 160hz freesync still stuttered all around the initial spawn room. black bars covered 13 of my screen. did not crash personally but know others with issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"as someone who has played all previous souls games, elden ring tops them all. although made noticeably easier than previous games to appeal to a newer audience, the open world experience is a delight and i really hope every game they make going forward is open world too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,really good game with a bad pc launch. let's hope fromsoftware can fix these performance issues soon because aside from that the game is really good. i miss the posture gauge and parry mechanic from sekiro tho
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"a lot of stutter and frequent fps drops, no ultrawide support and can't use the uw fix else risk eac ban, 60fps locked which on my monitor will not trigger freesync premium pro. been waiting on this for ages.. this might have been fine in 2010.. this is one very disappointing port.. i'll give it a week if it isnt fixed, then this is another refund coming through."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"its the worst souls game in the series including sekiro  bloodborne but its still a souls game so its fun. get it if the performance ever gets fixed. here are the biggest issue godawful performance  atrocious game looks awful on low settings, some of the ugliest shadows ive ever seen, some of the worst performance offenders like weather cant be turned off reused assets  a lot of them  multiple bosses are the same  show up as regular enemies treebosses 4 times!!!, certain dungeon parts get reused more than 3 times! the horse is bad  some bosses basically force you to use it but especially hitting enemies with shorter e.g. sword weapons off horseback is incredibly imprecise there is a lot of dead open world but its somewhat tolerable  the map is quite good! if there is nothing on the map to see then theres nothing there to find either so theres really no point of searching every corner which is contrary to how souls games usually work a lot of the pve bosses and enemies are much weaker than in regular souls games with the exception of the elden ring bosses. the pvp is as laggy and wonky as always  nothing improved here. its fun but i found myself going back to other games before i finished it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"a masterpiece made by from software, they have created not only the best open world game ever, but also the best game ever made. this is a game that everyone should try."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"overhyped garbage. i'm amazed, bewildered by reviews of this game being considered a masterpiece, etc, etc. runs terribly on pc, confusing  poorlyimplemented ui. this game could've come out 10 years ago, and i would've believed it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"easily one of the best games of all time let down by a very bad port. good things the open world is incredibly vast. it has many secrets, dungeons, and other things all around the world. the terrain feels realistic and it always seems like there is something next to you. the hitboxes are very good. there have been times when a sword has just barely missed me when i was attacking. i have not died once to bad hitboxes. enemies are varied, have many attacks, and have good ai. some of the bosses will hunt you before attacking. the bosses are phenomenal. they feel as though you are versing someone who is stronger than you. the horse, jump, and crouch feel very good. stealth feels like it works this time. great story as always i am always trying out something new, which is very good the rewards you get at the end of side content are meaningful mixed things the graphics could use some updating. while they are not bad graphics, they are not as good as they could be popin can be very annoying but is not super noticeable when you aren't paying attention. some dungeons and minibosses can feel copypasty. bad things there is constant stuttering and low frames. people with the best pcs are still having this problems. i've heard people are unable to launch the game there is no ultrawide support the fps is capped a 60 all in all, this game could have easily been one of the best if from software had they put effort into the visuals and playability of the game. i have a feeling that this may be their final time doing this before change happens. elden ring is easily one of the worst games that they put out in terms of optimization. with a large influx of players coming in, people are talking about these problems more than ever. i believe that from may see these problems and finally fix them for the better. i've heard that these things are already fixed by mods"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,the game is a masterpiece but the technical side is outdated. no ultra wide support 60fps lock mouse and keyboard controls are terrible lags and stutters
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"el inici del juego siento que debera ser mucho mejor, lleno de stuttering en la zona incial, sentia que el mundo abierto no aada nada sustancial, como mximo le pona un 7 de 10, pero 5 horas dentro ya comenc a entender el mundo y realmente veo a elden ring como la culminacin de los souls, no le pongo 10 porque an hay la ocasional bajada de fps y que an no haya layout para teclado me parece absurdo luego de tantos juegos. me cuesta pensar hacer otra cosa que no sea jugarlo luego de salir de trabajar."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"hay algo que no entiendo. la ayuda de los medio especializados con algunos estudios. le dan un 10 a un juego que en ninguna de sus versiones est terminado. le queda bastante para que el juego funcione bien principalmente en pc. otro problema hay estudios que hacen los mismos juegos una y otra vez y los viven criticando por eso. miyazaki hace los mismos juegos con un mapa ms grande y lo alaban saben quin ms hace eso y le llueven las crticas ubisoft! otro tema, criticaron a a horizon por unos bugs pequeos que no afectaban el juego, pero a este ni mencionaron el mal funcionamiento y rendimiento en todas sus consolas. penoso lo de los analistas de juegos apoyando estudios sin importarle que somos nosotros los que pagamos por ellos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"elden ring is a game that will make your jaw drop every hour. the level of creativity the developers have reached is spectacular, i can't imagine how they achieved that. combat mechanics are very fluid and diverse, there are so many ways to approach it. it is the best action rpg to date, so if you like this genre you should absolutely try elden be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"formulaic storytelling that feels extremely derivative. it was acceptable to a point with the previous titles, but with elden ring, it feels like it's gone past that and now it just feels cheap and lazy.  this game is a galore of reused assets, animations, and everything in between. there seems to be very little to this game that's wholly unique almost everything you see has been ripped shamelessly from dark souls 3 or bloodborne and changed slightly if even that.  no benefit to the addition of an open world. it serves no purpose to enrich the gameplay and in fact hurts the game as fromsoftware has had great level design in past games which can't be accomplished as well with an open world game. furthermore, the world feels extremely empty and dead as there are ridiculously vast amounts of lands filled with nothing.  crafting adds unnecessary bloat to a game that doesn't really need it and mounted combat trivializes the vast majority of fights, which is probably because the overworked developers didn't have time to design any of the fights against it. in conclusion, elden ring proves that fromsoftware is no longer the innovative game developer from a few years ago that was afraid to take risks and give us something fresh and new. elden ring is an exact, formulaic repeat of every souls game that came after dark souls 2 that feels mediocre at best. this isn't elden ring, this is souls 2k22."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"glad to see there's other people here who get it. these games since 2009 have been the same  with a different skin, and idiots pay 60 for it every time lol!! this is modern gaming for you, nice to see there's people here calling souls fans what they are. plebs who pay for the same crap over and over"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"great port, nothing works like it should. i just hope it won't take a month before they fix the game. how do you make something that stutters on a 3090 is beyond me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the bad things about dark souls 3 are solved in this game, less stressful and with more freedom. in resume its better in many ways. one of the greatest games ever."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,insane stuttering even on my strong pc. fromsoft yet again refuses to put even a modicum of effort into their pc ports. there's absolutely no excuse for this. fromsoft have lost all of my trust and respect as a consumer.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,performance is terrible. stuttering and frame drops will get you killed. controls just don't feel fluid even with a controller. graphics quality is pretty subpar. i've played plenty of indie games that look and run better. this is overall just some mediocre looking terrible console port of an unplayable souls game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"everybody myself included wants to love this game, but it's from software's biggest pc port disaster since dark souls prepare to die edition. in addition to the performance and control issues that most pc gamers are writing about, the game has no ultrawide 219 or 329 support at all. historically, this hasn't been an issue since the modding community fixes it within minutes after release. with elden ring, however, fromsoftware has decided to include easy anticheat while also going to extra effort to hide large portions of ultrawide users screens without their consent. this means we have to choose between playing online with most of our displays disabled, or playing offline with the usual community fixes. either way, we're missing a huge part of the game, and for 60 that is not okay. this is a terrible, halfbaked pc port missing fundamental pc features and optimizations. no pc gamer should recommend this mess in its current state, even if the underlying game is very good. as it stands, many of us are being artificially prevented from enjoying it untainted."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"unplayable trash thanks to massive frame drops stuttering. not to mention the 60 fps cap, lack of ultrawide support, controller prompts, etc. from software just doesnt get pc gaming. perhaps they just used an old ps4 dev kit to code and dont actually own a pc. im sure its fine for consoles, where there are very low technical expectations."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"lots people over here review bombing the game, i guess the discord troll numbers is growing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"besides the classic from software games pc ports being sometimes glitchy and laggy, the game is amazing, its basically dark souls 3 with open world and i love it, the amount of builds you can do is incredible, instead of following the story straight up you can pretty much do whatever you want first, then do the storyline. even on low graphics the game looks amazing, the dificulty is perfect too, it just feels way to easy sometimes. totally a 1010 most play, easily goty!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"awful pc port. no 219 support, 60fps cap, decadeold graphics, archaic coop system, stuttering, and connection issues. the game is the first in the series with easy anticheat so any modification to the game including enabling ultrawide or uncapping fps requires the game to be played offline. no reason to give these devs your money."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game needs some optimization yes but is not unplayable like many claims, not even close. the rest is perfect!. the wolrd is magnificent and huge, secrets everywhere. never felt so driven to explore in a open wolrd, i just can't stop playing. best souls game ever. i give a 9 because of the optimization."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"fromsoftware is an insult to gaming and especially the pc market. being extremely difficult and grindy does not constitute a good game. 60 fps lock... no ultrawide, terrible ui in classic japanese fashion, ps3 graphics in 2022. unacceptable performance and stuttering for the lowfi graphics. it is the weirdest phenomenon that so many gamers are so forgiving to fromsoftware's many glaring flaws. they need to be held to higher standards."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i did not play elden ring longh enough to give it final thoughts but there are many zero scores that simply tell lies or are frustrated. i have no big performance issues. and its so a 10 out of 10 in all aspects im 20 hours in
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i am not one to write reviews, but seeing all the disingenuous reviews i feel the need to throw in my two cents. i have about 20 hours in this game and it came out like three days ago and i'm not a souls veteran either, having only played bloodborne most of the way through previously. this is one of the greatest games that i have ever played. it's not easy, but i love it. the world is gorgeous, the combat is great, and i couldn't be happier with the gameplay itself. the stuttering is a thing, but it's not game breaking for me. if you are concidering trying this game i encourage you to, but be ready for a wild ride."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i don't like this game so i rate it 0. simple as that. also runs very poorly and i don't want to spend my free time trying to fix it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"from software is almost at square enix levels of terrible pc ports. the only reason they are higher than se is because they didn't dare charge 70 like se did for ff7r. 60fps cap, terrible performance, and no ultrawide support. i'll be nice and give just a 5 though."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"it seems that pc gamers prove, once again, that they are the most fragile and pouty people on planet earth. the slightest issue and they will review bomb a game and completely disregard its content. the openworld is breathtaking, the combat works flawlessly, and everything that from software has learned over the years melds together to create an addictive world that you want to be in when you're not playing. so i give elden ring a 1010 to counter the disingenuous 010s."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"elden ring ... more like witcher souls 3.5. their focus on open world has ruined many aspects we've loved from other souls games. a souls game where you gather herbs to craft things ... are you serious ? don't even get me started about the broken ai, choppy horseback controls, mediocre graphics, annoying kbm controls and bad optimization. admit it, open world does not work with souls formula. 3 hours into it and i'm bored out of my mind, can't believe i am saying this for a miyazaki game. please go back to your roots ... or better yet, port bloodborne to pc to make up for this sad mistake ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"there is a large audience that pours free hate on the game just because it received high marks, i'm not that hypocrite i'm here to talk about my real experience. the only real problem with the game is the optimization, the other complaints are hypocrites frustrated by the fact that the elden ring has a higher rating than their favorite game. masterpiece has nothing to say 40 hours of gameplay and my experience has been incredible, it's been a while since i felt so immersed in rpg games, a mustplay game for everyone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"masterpiece. nothing less than that. elden ring is a complex game, you will love it or hate it, is a souls game in a beautiful well made inmersive openworld that reward you for high exploration. now, i understand people will not dig the git good part of the souls community, but in this part, after seeing how bad kids put a 1 or a 0 just cause they are new or dont understand the games mechanics, is just unfair. this game brings all the best from all fromsoftware games, even sekiro, to build up the best game you can ask for. there is a reason but souls games are not for everyone, the game doesnt hold your hand, doesnt babysit you, it challenges you, it brings the best of you, not everyone are truly comfortable with this kind of liberty, many need a hand on their shoulders. pc seems to have some problems, but honestly im runing it without problems on a notebook, so is your desktop hardware problem, dont blame the game that bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"no puedo decir ms que una cosa, obra maestra. critico al videojuego como tal la historia, gameplay etc... entiendo que hay gente frustrada con la optimizacin que ms que mala optimizacin parece un fallo que parchearn en poco. por lo dems, actualizad drivers de la grfica y debera ir genial. no hagan caso a las crticas negativas de gente que no sabe jugar un souls, no sabe perder y menos a las que dicen de la mala optimizacin, el juego es una experiencia que uno tiene que probar una vez en la vida."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,this game deserves more than 10 it is perfect masterpiece but there are too many stupid review bombers
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"combat is excellent and bosses are fun to learn. there are a bit more default attack moves which allow for more ways to approach every fight, not to mention the open world giving you more angles. cooperative is very fun given there's an immediate bossobjective before us. unfortunately the pacing isn't as good as the more linear souls games due to some bad open world designs and how gathering materials has bloated the map. crafting and gathering is just not good. i'd rather more materials be dropped from enemies instead of being gathered on the ground. sadly the open world adds considerably less content than the space it takes up and the introduction area doesn't do it any favors. the rewards for exploring aren't comparable to the effort it took to find and get there unless it's to progress the main story. if there's no point of returning to an area why allocate such huge space for it? this is without mentioning you cannot use mounts in coop. the pace becomes incredibly slow at many times. luckily many of the enemies are engaging and rewarding to defeat. it makes you wonder why there is so much space between you and the actual fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"massive stuttering and a huge input delay!!!!! it is a very very good game, but in the atual state of the game, i recomend you to doesn't buy it and download the cracked version, because it is running better, and when the game is fixed buy it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,almost every single bad review is complaining about performance. that can be fixed. most of these reviewers that are giving negative reviews are expecting the game to run on their potato machines. the game definitely needs optimization but it's definitely playable. game is amazing. if you want more accurate reviews check steam reviews where people have to own the game to be able to review.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,extremely poor optmized tons of stutterings nd fps drops the game doesn't has stunning visuals so it s ridiculous being so demanding in cpu
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game is so good. its like botw and skyrim with soulsborne combat. it seems like a lot of people have issues with the pc version, which , but i personally havent noticed much stuttering, and ive had zero crashes. it helped when i found the game in window graphics settings and set the setting to high performance."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"esta critica es sin dar opinin sobre el psimo rendimiento, pero en general el juego es la obra maestra de miyazaki."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is so broken on pc, i am getting mid 30 frames on a 3090 with amd ryzen"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i have minor framedrops but this is an amazing game. the gameplay, vastness, and hours of replay ability speaks for itself."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"had 21.9,32.9 when it first released then changed. if you wanna play in uw it's only single player now. the clowns at from made this decision. also 60 fps lock. all you clowns that think uw is a niche need mental help."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,jogo perfeito 1010! no tive nenhum travamento ou bug! melhor experiencia e impossvel.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"nobody should never take game reviews seriously after this. the evil within 2014, amazing game, had some technical issues that were patched very fast few days got very low scores, pc got only 68 i think. days gone 2019, not perfect, still very fun open world zombie game, got score 70, elden ring 2022  outdated, boring and empty, gets score 9597 ...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"if you release a game on pc, it should preferably actually be playable on pc. not only are the graphics broken as far as performance goes, but most unforgivable to me, is the lack of controller support from a game that claims to have full controller support. none of my controllers work at all with this game, and this is just not the kind of game that works well with a keyboard and mouse. completely unplayable on pc at the moment, perhaps if fixes come in the next few weeks i will give it another chance. if it takes longer than that i'll have moved on already. we pc gamers are pretty tired of getting shafted by game creators that release games in an unplayable state recently, i think. at this point you will just lose my support and attention entirely but pulling this crap."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"elden ring is a good game, but... the game has a big optimization problem. looks like it's from 2017 on the graphisc. musics bad. you should be ashamed of bluepoint. if we leave this aside there's a lot of sloppy work in the game. they enlarged a normal enemy in sekiro, bloodborne and dark souls and added it to the game as a boss. the venues were the same. how many more times will you use anor londo? even the animations are the same. aren't you ashamed to do this? i don't understand how they give 10 to this game. did you get any money from the producers? horizon f.w. 88 elden rind 97. engrossing..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"lazy open world, technically outdated, outdated graphics, outdated animations, assets reused everywhere, genericreskin enemies everywhere."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,even above my high expectations. dont listen to all this guys who cant even beat the first boss or poeple who never played a souls game before. it is the best souls game and the best game i have ever played. perfect!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,o jogo t divertido mais mano no para de travar sempre q t jogando o fps despenca o jogo kita do nada o servidor fica caindo com meus brod por favor arrume isso n!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,ok optimisation is verry bad but the gam does not deserve 0's because the world is vast and the lore is incredible
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i really wanted to play this game after my love of bloodborne, which i am still trying to finish, damn it's hard. all i heard was that this game is more easier, more accessible and less punishing. they lied. was i expecting the game to be easy? no. but what was all that talk about? so, i had stutter, stutter, stuttering so bad it was unplayable. bugs everywhere, and bad hit boxes made this game a big no for me. i am back on bloodborne, i think i'm almost finished it, and then i will play sekiro. fromsoft released a broken game and the meta critic scores, why the hell didn't they tell us about how badly the game runs, don't show this. what a shame such a small 39 group of obvious souls fans reviewed it and decided to not disclose just how bad it runs. even if they love a series they shouldn't give it a pass. do your job next time! other games in the past have been ripped apart because of releasing with these same issues. yet this is goty? can i also point out that in this day and age you'd think even a souls game would up its graphics and physics system to the industry standard for aa and aaa games. walk through foliage and nothing responds which breaks immersion. the graphicsassetstextures look like it came from 2013. i'm not joking. the style of the game is more of the same. the game does nothing new, even copying breath of the wilds open world format to a t. if you are a pro critic i ask that in the future you stay consistent with your reviews. this way people can get a proper read on what a game is without your obvious childish bias masking a broken game just so it sells well or whatever your reasoning was. signed disappointed gamer. what a shame"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"extremely poor experience on pc, what could be easily a 1010 game is tarnished by mind boggling stutters, low fps and input bugs even on a pc well above the recommended specs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i feel my self like a dumb when i'm fighting against invisible enemies under a tons of lags.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"masterpiece. challenging and beautiful to explore. graphics, music, gameplay all stellar! ignore all the review bombers who dont know how to use a pc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"estou com certa de 20h de gameplay no computador, e est sendo uma das melhores experincias que j tive, me sinto jogando um rpg de mesa, recomendo. estou rodando com uma configurao que  um mix de qualidade rysen 5 3600, e uma rx 570 4gb, 16gb de ram. configurao mdia, no ssd. i have about 20 hours of gameplay on the computer, and it's been one of the best experiences i've ever had, i feel like i'm playing a tabletop rpg, i recommend it. i'm running with a configuration that is a mix of quality rysen 5 3600, and an rx 570 4gb, 16gb of ram. medium configuration, on ssd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i'm gonna be honest, this is my first ever metacritic game review. but given the huge hype for this game, and the polarizing user reviews almost 5050, i feel the need to say something. why 810? pros  graphics. so what if it looks outdated? i'd rather have a game that looks crisp like witcher 3 and gothic 3 2 amazing rpgs even for today's standards than some blurry, glowy, photorealistic crap like ac valhalla and cyberpunk 2077. and whoever says it looks just like ds3 is not looking carefully enough.  accessibility. finally we get a map, fast travel from almost anywhere, switchable control schemes, less vague dialogues, quest location aids, dungeon location aids, as many summoning helps as you want as long as you have enough fp, no more health regeneration after enemy retreat, an additional block counter move, far more doable than the parry, item crafting on the go, easy resource farming. horseback riding and fighting. jumping. these are all things that previous from software games simply did not have. makes the game so much easier.  exploration. you can go anywhere and see where you're going, no more fog of war, and reaching places can be done from so many angles. it's impossible to get lost.  mystery. this game uses your brain, not just your reflexes. it gives you something to do, something to wonder about. your curiosity is at its peak everywhere you turn. what if that cliff is hiding treasure at the base? why are there so many monsters over there, are they protecting something valuable? is that castle moving?  fairness. it doesn't pit you against an impossible boss without the possibility to level up somewhere else instead of backtracking to farm the same monsters over and over. cons  fps drops i learned it's a general problem, not just my system's fault, which means it's patchable. also, i don't get any fps drops in dungeons, just outside where you can run away from danger anyway. those drops are reduced if you reduce the grass quality, but for now it's a con.  early stages. you need essential items for levelling up, crafting, item upgrading early on in the game if you're gonna make your life easier. but sometimes it's almost impossible to find them without an online guide. it can get frustrating when you get ashes of war, bolstering items, game hints, but you can't piece them together unless you spend a long time figuring it out. in the end we also want to have fun, not go to dark souls college.  soundtrack. major downer for me. it takes away from the atmosphere. you had time, this could've been a masterpiece, making exploration so much more enjoyable. i'm really sorry about this one. in the end i hope this review is helpful. i can say that it's a highly addictive game and i can't stop playing it even when i should. please help"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i'm so confused by the 1010 scores from every publisher for this game. i've never seen a game overrated in this scale.. fromsoft gets away with no innovation, while every other franchise gets bashed for repetitiveness. elden ring is an already outdated soulslike game with worse than ps4 graphics, a barren openworld that offers nothing new. animation quality is as bad as some indie games that were made by 2 people. the reviewers and community is so delusional that they see openworld, mount and jumping as groundbreaking features. it's time to wake up and realise graphics like this, with bad animations and same old combat mechanics does not deserve 1010. it's unfair to games like rdr2, death stranding and gow and such. time to wake up and play other games that actually earn praise.. if this game gets 1010, than rdr2 need to get like 50 out of 10."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is actually a masterpiece. it has a huge open world full of things to do, the gameplay is wonderful, the lore is magical. but i can't point more than this because the game at this point is almost unplayable at some points. i hope fromsoftware release an optimization patch soon"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,don't believe the negative reviews. most people don't have a good enough pc or don't know how to play the game. elden ring is without a doubt the best game ever made by mankind.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game is a masterpiece and is exactly what i would want in terms of an open world dark souls game. no quest markers, no hand holding, and amazing exploration. i'm constantly finding new side bosses, areas, npcs, and other mysteries. nothing is straight forward and the game rewards players for being inquisitive and taking their time. i get chills jousting insane bosses on my horse with an enchanted two handed sword. this is the type of gameplay i dreamed about when i was a young boy, and to see it finally come to a reality is an amazing experience. i have a very high end rig, and i will admit that i have ran into a couple of stutters. dark souls pc ports have always been rough around the edges when they first release, and this one is no different. the lack of widescreen support was also a disappointment. i know both of these things will be fixed through the modding community or by the devs themselves. however the game is just so amazing in every other way that these minor issues are very easy for me to look past. this game is easily in my top 5 games of all times, and may end up being my favorite rpg of all time by the time i finish. 2022 is an amazing year to be a gamer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"aside from the performance bugs, there's a great open world soulslike here. i would give an 810, but i'm giving a 1010 to counteract the review bombing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"must play is laughable. most consoleitis infested title i've ever had the misfortune of putting my hands on. absolutely horrendous interface and control scheme that is beyond unacceptable for a pc title, even a ported one. bad performance compared to the graphical fidelity, unsmooth movement, gameplay lacks fluidity. possibly the worst port i've seen to date."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,hello. casino is on fromsoftware side. they got zero. thanks to no ultrawide support and infinite stutters
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"60 fps with drops on 5600x6700xt, no vsync in setting, no ultrawide support. graphic like dark soul 3. yeah, if you are on hype train and love ds games, you will probably love this one too. but poor optimation, only 60 fps lock, ugly graphic, fps drops, bugs, crashes, problems with xbox controller, horrible menu and settings. shader quality doesnt work it did nothing, same issue with autodetect best rendering setting. half of the changes like grass quality do virtually nothing. i asked for a refund. it makes no sense. from software  on the pc again. the game can be great, but if i have to rate the pc port, forget about it. 60 fps with graphics at least 6 years outdated, nonfunctional graphics settings. if you have a ps5, you may enjoy it more on the console. it's a horrible experience here. and as for the game itself. it's just another soul game. nothing more, nothing less. but it's definitely not a game of the century, as some are trying to suggest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"best souls game, game freezes sometimes, but overall excellent experience and amazing world"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"bad port, no ultrawide suppport, 60fps lock. 2013 graphics. poorly done without any effort. i feel like most people rate this as a soulslike game and not a game. is is an ok on pc soulslike? yes it is. is it a good game? no it is not. its boring, graphics are several years old, voiceacting is bad, story is bad. combat is as wooden as my cooking spoon. this game is just another soulslike nonrevolutionary stuff with 2013 graphics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,no ultrawide support in 2022 is just a lazy port from the developers. i have games released years ago that have this day one. any new game that comes out in the last few years and beyond will not see 1 dime of my money if this is left out.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"tehcnical side playing with a strong gaming pc, i had some fps drops, but nothing game breaking. gameplay i don't want to drag it out, a lot of people already said what i think.this really is the best game i played in a long time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"simply a masterpiece, nothing less. people complaining about the game optimisation are wrong, the game could be more optimized, yes, but you can't just simply pass this amazing game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"a performance embarrassment. the game is full of bugs, graphically, not artistically, it is a mediocre game. incomprehensible the notes that are being given"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i have absolutely never in my life hated anything more than this game. i hate it more than star wars last jedi and last of us 2 combined.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this is literally worst aaa game of past 10 years. this is absolutely awful, pathetic, insanely bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"playing this with trainer that has infinite hp and one hit kills for all monsters. that's the only way this trash is playable and even with this cheat, it's still boring. i just kill one boss, move to another, etc. so you telling me that's the whole game? that's the game that gets almost perfect metascore? better metascore than basically any game ever made? this game is complete joke."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the game is just wonderful. this is my first experience in this genre and i just can't stop. there are technical problems, and i hope they will be fixed soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"if bosses have literally endless amount of combos and special attacks, one after another and then you can maybe get one hit and most of the fight you are just in defense mode, rolling around endlessly, trying to escape, not fight. this is pathetic. this is not good combat design. this is awful. unless you love to just endlessly run away and feel how pathetic you are, maybe you gonna love this combat, but i like games where you can actually truly fight back or have cool battles. rolling around and hoping to get one hit between 30 seconds is not fun or good design. jesus christ this game is overrated."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"dispite some bugs, and frame rate issues i got rtx 2060 so i'm reviewing it from my point of view this is one of the best games i've ever played. this game is a culmination of all the best aspects of the souls series with awesome, breathtaking open world added to it. elden ring deserves respect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"freeze, lag, known issues, bad port, still released. nothing ever changes console port with no effort or care taken. 60fps lock bad. no ultrawide support. no vsync disable option. no 144hz support. also bad performance and stutter and poor controller support. shameful!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,one of the best games i've ever played and suprising world with lots of stuff to discover.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,a lot of these people leaving negative reviews complaining about the difficulty must be playing their first soulsgame with elden ring. it's ok to not like it but some of these reviews feel extremely unreasonable and written out of anger one of the best games i've ever played and suprising world with lots of stuff to discover. just don't expect to be held by your hand and be led to all the things to find. gameplay is very similar to other fromsoft games but feels a lot more fluid and less clunky this time. some of the optional bosses are not that memorable but the main ones are. and that is ok in my opinion as it's optional. the only thing keeping me from giving it a 1010 is the microstutter on pc.. but it's honestly not as bad as people make it out to be. playing on a ryzen 3700x and rtx 2060 with 16gb's ram
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"no ultrawide support. you can even select ultrawide in graphics settings, but then it just put's black bars, which just seems ridiculous to me. just put it in properly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"one of the worst performances from an aaa game. stutters like crazy, input delays, no ultrawide support and 60fps lock. the game and the world are amazing but if you cannot even provide the basic necessities, it shouldn't be rated 1010. particularly for the pc version the review scores are misleading."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"honntement trs du ! j'tais trs hyp et je ne m'attendais pas  a. le jeu est vide dans l'ensemble, on ne sait pas vraiment quoi faire  part explorer. la difficult est trs levs et la progression du personnage est ridicule par rapport au temps pass a farmer. j'ai mme farm dans une zone spciale ou les mobs donne plus de 1000 runes pour voir si a changeait quelques choses. bilan  aprs 20 niveau gagns en 2 heures les mobs ne sont pas plus rapide a tuer et notre rsistance est toujours  coup quel intret de monter en niveau?. ce qui m'a frustr ce n'est pas de mourir en deux coup par un mob lambda, non, a je le savait ds le dbut et j'ai accept bien volontier le challenge , non c'est plus le fait de devoir grinder comme dans un mmo coren free to play sans avoir la satisfaction de voir un rsultat a ses efforts. je joue a des jeux vidos depuis plus de 30 ans maintenant et la premire de toutes mes attentes c'est d'y trouver du plaisir. l , aucun plaisir  l'horizon....dommage pour mon argent perdu...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"no ultrawide support, stutteringperformance problems, no sony controller support, wrong button display ingame"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"capped at 60fps  no ultrawide support  massive frame drops when visiting new areas and consistent micro stuttering everywhere. do not buy this game if you wanna play it on pc, if only reviewers talked about its performance on pc, i wouldve waited a little bit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"2022, no ultrawide, and a 60fps cap, not to mention the stuttering. cant believe they think this is ok to release."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,overrated. graphics are outdated. not even ultrawide support no vsync disable option no 165hz support. totally faked score.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,you can't cut the grass with the sword. very bad game 010 i did not like it. every game should add a grass to be cutted
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this perfect game.over the past year, no game has attracted me so  atmosphere reminiscent of the lord of the rings universe."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i'm lost for words how users have rated this game so low. sure its not next gen graphics but that's because of covid. the gameplay is incredible and surely anyone that rates a game should base their review on gameplay before anything else. the variety is huge too. this is easily one of the best games i've played
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,so poorly optimised to the point where it is literally unplayable. fix the game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"please do not but this game. if cyberpunk or the gta trilogy remaster had a spiritual sequel then there's no doubt this game would be a proud reward owner. we cannot let devs disguise crowdfunding campains as a polished final release , or else the good games are going to end up rarer than anything in this world, which you really don't want unless you hate games for some reason."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i have played the pc version for several hours roughly 1215. if you have liked souls games before elden ring and it is really your cup of tea, i guess you might like this still, if you are ready to overlook the many shortcomings it has. but if you haven't like any souls games before this one, then just keep walking because this isn't for you either, definitely. these are the facts on pc so far  right off the bat, no ultrawide support.  no 120 hz support in 4k i don't know for other resolutions, i haven't tested.  barely hitting 60 fps sometimes, if i'm lucky!  the difficulty once again is ridiculously hard  unless you don't many responsibilities in life i guess maybe you'd have the time to put to maybe want to finish this pointlessly hard game?  and last but not least, that no one really talks about the story is awful and doesn't make any sense at all. i know, i know  the souls games have never been known much for story in the past but fromsoftware should really have learn from their many mistakes at this point. i mean a lot of us have been playing fs games since the lost kingdoms days. and it feels like somewhat we're almost back to this. the art style chosen is ok but it's not stellar and graphics overall sure even feels updated in many places for the times we currently live in. all in all, this is definitely not the game i was hoping for. it's a bit better on console  mainly ps5  but still suffers from mostly the same issues across the board. i will keep walking for that one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"pc performance is truly abysmal with constant stutters, drops and lack of accessibility. poorly localized prices are an another problem"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"trash game. and fanboys who are justifying this mess launch are delusional. lots of bugs, freezes, xbox controller's not supported, i can't even exit options menu because keyboard some keyboard bindings also do not work, can't read in game messages because some keybindings do not work in game too. locked framerate. and the gameplay is  f too. innovative? pfff, same old boring souls game, roll hit 247, with already seen monsters and boring map. this isn't rpg. it's just open sandbox, open world game at best, with some inventory and simple leveling. don't even bother looking at those so called critics reviews. they are either getting paid by game publishers to write great reviews or are delusional just like fanboys, who will defend game no matter in what state that game is. aaa game for such high price tag like this joke ring is expected to be playable and decent at launch  day 1, without any patches. saying wait, they'll fix this soon doesn't mean . from greedware company just went down the drain with this fiasco product release. gg."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i don't know how these people like this game but it's total health issue game. it feels like my eyes bleeding. same company did similar games in the past but somehow this company have fans and continue of making games. probably these gamers have no idea how these games are eating and melting their brains out of their skulls. warning there is many new troll accounts created to give point 10. just check their accounts and you will see only game scored is elden ring!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the way bandai namco and fromsoftware consider their customers is complete shame. in the current state the game is unplayable for most of ppl. they changed the pc requierements at the last time, just before release, so they knew what was about all this stuff. from software follows the cd projekt's path. this is purely disgusting. metacritic blocked us to tell the truth. shame on you, you are disgusting too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"xbox 360 game ported to pc. this videogame is overrated.same animations as ds3, same grapics etc..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"juego sobrevalorado como todos los souls, graficos de la pasada generacin con un rendimiento penoso y una dificultad frustante, est bien para los nios rata que se pueden permitir intentar 200 veces matar un boss pero para los que ya tenemos una edad se hace soporifero, no hubiera costado nada poner un selector de dificultad. lo que no entiendo es la prensa cascandole notazas y obviando el mal rendimiento y aspecto tcnico del juego"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"another good soulsgame. it had a few frame stutters, but with the right settings you wont experience those anymore. it wont take long for fromsoft to fix those issues. stop crying you sore hating losers and get a life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"all the issues are tripartite categorically performance, quality of life, and camera gets its own category. performance needs to be uncapped, 60 fps is mediocre for a decade ago, and with all the stuttering and whatnot, shouldn't be unattainable these days. quality of life includes support for the pc port, like more communication or an actually intuitive kb and m experience. this is the most antagonistic control scheme i've seen, not only is the prompt for keyboard controls hidden in the settings, but q, e, and g as main navigations don't make any sense. the camera itself makes me ill. literally physically ill, i threw up after playing for only a hour and i'm afraid of going back in. viewbobbing, built in motion blur, and a floating movement swiveling camera violate my sense of equilibrium like poison. wait for a performance patch if they care enough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"amazing game with an expansive world, introduction of horse mechanics and simply great artwork. the benefit of this big open world is it allows the player to change the location when stuck facing a difficult boss and doesn't stop giving in terms of beautiful landscapes. highly recommended, patch to support ultrawide monitors on pc is long awaited from developers, other than that, perfect game. tested on nvidia 3080 ryzen 9 3900x."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"elden ring has surprised me in every way, one of the best games i ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,is it in a playable state? kinda fixes the stuttering and fps issues so far good but need improvements and better optimization
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"just another souls game, plenty of useless resources with absent story......"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i am desperately looking for that masterpiece so many critics claimed to see in this game. from a technical point of view, its a desaster. bad controls, laggy input, enemies stun locking you, microstutters all along. menu handling is atrocious, quick slot management is a bad joke. there are so many items, that are hardly explained at all  you are up to trial and error and guesswork to figure out how things work. enemy difficulty is all over the top and while i know, thats part of a souls game, the enemies here are unfair. you either play perfectly or you die. period. nothing much inbetween. you cant run, cause you run to slow. when you are trying to mount you are likely to be hit during that. if you ever get smashed to the ground, you can reload already, you are not getting up again alive. hits are often nor registering and you are driven by a constant momentum, that easily moves you out of an enemies hitbox, while the visuals show your swort going through the enemy just fine. as the controls are so bad, playing perfect is pretty impossible to pull off, so the only thing remaining is frustration. visuals are nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. story... well, what story? i have been playing for nearly 10 hours now and the only piece of story is you are a chosen, grab the ring, save the world presented in like 2 minutes? the story is pretty much on par with super mario from the nes times so far. i have been runnning around, killing  dying a lot and looking for an actual sense in what i am doing. exploring feels interesting, but usually only rewards you with death. i have yet to find any usefull gear, well actually any gear i can use at all. drops are scarce and so far not matching my class or just worse than what i had from the beginning on. overall, my gameplay experience is kill and be killed, rinse and repeat  because thats all there is to this game. unfortunately i went way beyond the refund time to look for more in this socalled masterpiece, but as far as i can tell, there just isnt more to it. summary  a soulless shell with lots of grinding and frustrating controls, sporting tons of technical issues and a tedious interface. absolute dont buy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"actually the best game ever. vibe, mechanics from dark souls. dynamics, adrenaline, rush from sekiro. adventure, sense of freedom from botw. the only game that deserves 1010. pc performance is not perfect, it's better than fine. stutters are minor, unnoticable, pretty old pc 1060 6gb, i5 8600 has stable 60fps."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game is diluted souls, plain and simple. the souls formula doesn't benefit at all from the open world format, and what you have are long horse riding sessions through an unimpressive world full of a lot of green plains and rocks, with the occasional ruin. the optional dungeons you find throughout the map are woefully short and underdeveloped. it's a competent game, but in any reasonable reality this would've scored 710 with most critics, if it didn't have from software's name backing it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"bandai namco stated and confirmed on the announcement year of the game that the game will support arabic ui and subs, and thousands of arabs pre ordered the game.. anyway.. on the day of release we were shocked that the game doesn't include a single arabic word.. they didn't bother to tell us that they've canceled it before they lunch the game they just went silent and lied to us.. i hope that you gamers out there support our community as gamers to make our voice reaches the developers about bandai's lies and manipulation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,just brilliant. the game runs good on my pc while it is on the lower end. amazing game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"zero to help balance the obvious paidnda reviews. game itself is a solid 78. on the game itself.. this is easily the best damn soulslike game i've ever played and i'm having a blast. being open world fixes the vast majority of my gripes about previous souls games. dark souls should have gone open world long ago and this game proves it. having space to dodge and roll around your op enemy is like the first time you've tasted your favorite food. it makes you realize i'm the problem, i just need to figure this out vs this is impossible. i absolutely adore the ds method in an open world environment. mad, mad props to fromsoft for going open world. this is likely where the reviewers stopped and posted omg100100 greatestgameofalltime!!1!11! cons that warrant my rating? most overrated game of all time? easily. i'll skip over the massive performance issues for now as they're well documented. as a game ds was very niche to begin with. it followed a steep learning curve of figure out your enemy's move set and work around it to win formula. in this elden ring has shined. the problem is enemies have zero ai and it shows in an open world vs standing in a hallway. stand on a rock and they're completely broken. i was able to defeat several bosses and many mini bosses by abusing the terrain while completely ignoring their move set. not to mention if you range hit a mob his buddy will completely ignore you while you gank your target. worst ai in history. sidenote throwing knives and arrows move like they're going through jello but ignore gravity. even fcking minecraft takes gravity seriously. the menus, oh god the menus. they're about as intuitive as building a piece of ikea furniture with no instructions and 4 screws missing. every spell, weapon, or item you equip has almost no description, is clunky to equip, and has no stats outside of weapons. in a game where stats are crucial this is a massive failure. this was solved 30 years ago in games and only makes fromsoft look incompetent. there's no popup tooltips when you hover over stats and you have to resort to looking up stuff online to make any sense. i don't mind trial and error when fighting mobs. it shouldn't be in the menus too. fans will claim realism to defend it.  i'm killing waterlogged zombies stretched out like a rubber chicken with their flesh literally falling off their bones that magically can overpower me if i get too close. don't talk to me about realism. good luck figuring out how to change native control popups from xbox to kbmouse. it's under sound controls because that makes total sense. settingssoundonscreen prompt device if you need to fix this i mean, what's the chance a pc user would want to use a keyboard and mouse instead of an xbox controller? that's unheard of. s this was solved a decade ago on pc but fs wasn't at that meeting. targeting. why is there no target tabbing? if there's a little bastard in my face but a hulking monstrosity trying to annihilate me standing over him guess what gets targeted? i have to move my mouse a full screen swipe towards the big guy to get the target to change before i can dodge meaning i'm already dead. ironic when you need to turn the mouse sensitivity to it's absolute minimum to make it even usable. my last con performance. we all know how  this game runs, and it's well documented. it can't maintain 30fps on ps4, can't maintain 60fps on ps5, stutters wildly on a fire breathing pc, but looks like an early ps4 game? when i see suggestions that it's best played as a ps4 disc lowest quality on a ps5 that's a problem. there's no way in hell this is a 100100 game and this proves reviewers were either paid or under a hard nda to not mention performance prerelease. when i'm playing on a pc that runs cyberpunk 2077 at 60fps in 4k but this runs at less than 60 with constant dips into the low 20s while looking like a game from 2016 that's a big issue. i honestly can't name another title that runs this badly. maybe rdr2 but that looks vastly better than this. as a dark souls game this is easily 1210 and everything i could hope for. when you take all other games into account? solid 7, maybe 8 and that's being generous. there's too many problems here other studios solved decades ago. all my problems have also been all over reddit so i'm not alone. any reviewer that calls this a 100100 game meaning perfect should never be trusted again. tldr i absolutely love this game, but it's far from perfect and ds fanbois need to be honest with themselves. hard does not equal good. now you're playing with the big boys and this is mediocre at best."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"once again the so called critics showed how unqualified they are when it comes to understanding what makes a game a good game and amazing gameplay. it is not the brand making a games with past achievements, it is the gamers themselves, no one else. majority of these critics don't even spent the bucks for those games which cant' generate a bias opinions. now here is my opinion this game is boring after few hours. different model of a boss with different combos of the more or less same attacks you've seen before. stuck in an empty open world which wasn't made to be amazed and looked at, just to traverse in and walking forward is not a good gameplay. game is not optimized, tested on pc systems properly and i had issues on ps5 as well. i don't care they can patch games, this game is expensive and i expect working title when it's released. so where did the money went before the release? marketing it seems and to all those fake critics hyping it and making us disappointed before it is ready to be played by those who these games are made for. gamers.. in the end, make a roll and attack, make a roll and attack, make a roll and attack, use special attack, call for help of few ghosts taking agro, stab them in the back, make a roll and attack. well that gets old very quickly. i don't care if you are hard on souls fan or not. i like game when it makes me feel like i am playing and getting my ass beat as much as i am beating the game's ass and here the only thing that beat my ass was poor design, and low optimization of the elder ring world."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"no ultrawide support, 60 fps cap and one of the worst anticheats  eac which don't give people option to patch their game with community fix that already solved above mentioned problems. it's just unacceptable to charge full price and claim that game is aaa and in the same time lack such common features"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"almost nonexistant optimisation . much better looking games run much faster than elden ring on my pc. other than that , great game . formsoftware basically built upon every game they previously made and also made it open world . i'll change my review to positive when they patch the game . properly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this game worths to called as 'game' at all. i admit that there are some perfomance issues in this game, but i think that problem occurs only to old pcs. because me and my friends didn't experienced any those problem at all. stop crying. game is magnificent. despite i never played any of games that made by from. there are no other opinion."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,none of these reviews from users are legit. its obvious they havent played the game or theyre running it on a turd. game doesnt look dated at all and in fact the game looks way better than previous games. no issues with connecting a controller and in fact ive had no issues at all with using my controller. and uhhh meta critic is a cess pool and no one cares about ultra wide support i hope you strain your neck
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,this game would be one of my favourites if this game was the reason why we didn't get a breath of the wild 2 release date
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"it's dark souls 3 with an open confusing world. don't buy it if you're not a dark souls fan. but the low score is because of the pc version, how could they launch the game with 60 fps cap? not only that but the 60 fps aren't stable, it drops do 30 many times. this with a 3080 and 5600x."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"the amount of 1010 reviews and calling it the greatest game of all time makes me sick. the amount of bugs and poor optimization just won't let you enjoy the game. even if you ignore the poor performance to give the title of greatest game of all time is just a scam. to call it the greatest of all time you need more than just a good game play, it's missing the graphics, story, music and optimization. story wise it didn't have any deeply crafted story like the witcher or dramatic story that bind you and the character like read dead redemption 2 did with arthur. i feel scammed by the reviewers and toxic soul fans. can't give this higher than 8 but i will leave it with 0 because of the poor performance."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"im not entirely sure what to write here. i mean, id love to review it, heck id love to play it, but the game simply doesnt work. no matter what fixes i try the game simply will not recognise any controller inputs. how can a aaa game be released in such a shoddy state!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,the game suffers from stuttering in the open world section up to a point it interrupts your timing to dodge and attack and you will die because of it. the game has been in development for 23 years and with all the knowledge of releasing their previous games on pc these problems shouldn't be there. or they learned nothing from it or got greedy and released it in this poor state on purpose just to make money from it as soon as possible. it has nothing to do with my pc since i can run cyberpunk at 80fps at ultra settings so it should be able to run this ps4 game easily above the stupid 60fps cap. and this is not even the only issue since there are many other pc gamers with even more issues. my love for fromsoftware and their amazing games does not justify this. i will have to refund and buy at a way cheaper price in 1 or 2 years when hopefully the game is in a playable state.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"the best from software game from miyazaki, and a masterpiece of an openworld title with a heavy soulsborne feeling with a spice of shadow of the colossus and breath of the wild. the scope is much larger than i hoped, and everything is here you ever hoped for. the pc version runs a bit rough. played on 5600x and 6900xt, both heavily undervolted via bios and mpt with powerlimit at max 200w for the whole system, and everything maxed out the game runs most of the time 60fps locked at 4k, with some hitches here and there."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"it's a good game and a decent open world attempt, but it's completely ruined by a horrible, poor, lazy and inexcusable port that made me regret spending 80 euro for it. the setting is intriguing, but while some enemies are cool and interesting, many are just unimaginative, extremely repetitive and boring, e.g. undead with lance, undead with swordshield, undead with axe, etc. graphics is previous generation and the performance are abysmal with frame rate drops, stuttering and freezes. sound effects are fine while music ranges from average to good i bought the deluxe edition to get the 67 soundtracks but honestly i can't remember a single track i'd like to listen to again...disappointing. ui is made fro consoles... it's old, lazy and awful to use with mousekeyboard. you can't use your mouse to interact with it. it is inconsistent, sometimes you use enter other e, sometimes esc others  decided to waste one of the most comfortable button q to use it just for closing a menu!? you open a menu with a button but you can't close it with the same button, you have to move you hand and reach another uncomfortable one. why? who knows... you can't rebind many controls, so you're stuck with a poor layout. you can add markers on the map but there are less than 10 icons and you can't add text, a very poor and lazy system. when you mouse over a location the tooltip doesn't pop out, you have to move a target icon with wasd over the location. when buying items you can't compare stats with what you're using...i have no words for 's just pathetic for a 2022 aaa 80 euro game...pathetic. while you can accept quests from the very few npcs you find around, there is no quest log to remind you of anything you're supposed to do. in order to quit you have to open a menu, select an option, switch to the right window, select quit, return to the title screen, watch the titles, press any key, scroll the menu, select quit again...tedious. controls are crap, some of them you can change others not and the default layout makes you think that whoever made it has never played a pc game before. to use quick items you have to hold e and press the arrows letting the mouse go...instead of simply pushing comfortable buttons like 15 or qerftgzxcv. sprint and dodge are on the same button instead of shift and at, this will lead to often dodgeroll instead of sprinting or you having to release the sprint and push it again in order to dodgeroll. you have to manually select mousekeyboard prompts inside the audio menu why!?, otherwise the game shows you xbox controller shortcuts, even though you don't have a controller. it records commands while you're character is stuck in an animation and when the animations ends it fires them one after another... can't climb which has become a standard in many open world games. the trailers let you believe you get a flying horse of some sort, but the reality is that there are only a bunch of jumping pads positioned here and there. camera is terrible and when you turn it, it keeps trembling and stuttering cause the script is fighting your command trying to constantly reposition the camera and giving you headache sometimes it goes completely crazy and keeps turning in circles for no reason. ai sometimes is good others poor, for instance enemies can see you trough walls and attack you without checking the line of sight, e.g. archers keep firing at you even though you're are behind a wall. combat doesn't have fixed rules, they keep changing so they can kill you easily. some enemies get staggered when you hit them or block their attacks, others don't, and keep hitting you like nothing happened. sometimes you can avoid a frontal attack by dodging towards the side or the back of an enemy, others the enemy while already in an attack animation, suddenly performs a 360 turn and hits you anyway. projectiles like arrows, bolts, ballista shots, etc are guided missiles that turns midair following and hitting you even if you've moved sideways or dodged them. if while attacking your weapon hits a wall you get staggered, but when and enemy does it nothing happens, theirs animation isn't interrupted like yours. spells are completely unbalanced and 95 of them are useless cause they deal much less damage then the basic one, making you think they didn't even test this game properly. they said you could play as an archer, but you simply can't cause you have to craft arrows and in order to do that you have to grind materials wasting more arrows, not to mention that sometimes you're going to die for hours while fighting a boss, which means you're going to waste thousand of arrows. a simple solution would have been letting you craft quivers with infinite arrows and enchant them to cast firepoisonmagic arrows, etc. too complicated for these devs i guess. as i said, it's a horrible, poor, lazy and inexcusable port."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"that hype train for 0 rating is annoying, this game don't deserve it. elden ring gave me feeling of old true adventure, which was unobtainable for a long time, and now i finally get it. it returns me to my school days, where world was much more colorful. we played games and shared our achievements on them to each other. spoked about interesting secrets and emotions we found. and we didn't complain about fps and graphics, because game must be game to play, not the beautiful movie to watch, that vast majority here wants to see. but this game is not ideal. here we have not the the best controls on pc. for example, i must unpress dodge key to start dodging, its annoying sometimes. we have 60 fps lock, so i just use mod to control it by myself it's not critical for me. sometimes game have stutters, while loading grass or something, but 99 of time i don't experience them. and... seems like that's all the problems for me? i was surprised by narrative, i like how it goes. gameplay is challenging, and i like it too. i can't get bored while i playing it, cause this game can surprise you in sudden times. we must confess about how the game feels in it's genre circles, not about how it don't serve you and your expectations if you had them before play session. so narrative  1010 was surprised not about the exact story, but about how it goes art style  1010 boss mechanics  910 adventure  1010 true adventure is when you don't know what to expect next open world  910 got botw and skyrim vibes while playing combat  6.510 just because of not the best controls on pc, where i'm playing. need a lot of time to get used to it soulslike  810 it's open world experiment, so i think it's pretty nice and almost friendly for newcomers i was thinking about rpg, so i guess free leveling it's just part to make game playable within souls genre for newcomers. 710 after all, 910 goty for me. stop expressing your inexplicable decisions, or do you really think that pokemon arceus better on graphics, open world and innovative mechanics? nonsence."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"one of the best game i have ever played! quite hard but i believe that by training, the experience will be much better. i hope this game will win as game of the year. besides, the game needs more update and optimizations. for now, i would say that this game is fantastic!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"so good so far. only negative is it has some frame hiccups at some spots nothing too bad, and will prolly be patched up. literally everything else is godlike and this is quickly becoming my favorite new souls game. and the open world is the closest to breath of the wilds quality that i have seen yet. so much good here that i cant care to knock it for points."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"if you're playing elden ring because of the open world, you'll find it's not even as good as dragon age 3. yep, not even as good as the game in 2014. elden ring has a terrible low degree of freedom. please, it's 2022, the game still has 95 points for souls, and a bunch of full points? it's a joker game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"it's remarkable how much from improves upon their foundations with every new soulskirobornering game release. even demon's souls found it's true potential once unshackled from the limitations of old tech. elden ring is no different, as we all expected and dared to hope, after the fateful release of cyberpunk. what's felt like a disappointing few years for video games, with companies focusing more on squeezing every dime out of their game systems instead of focusing on content, from software's elden ring is the complete opposite.  the world an impossibly scaled, breath of the wildesque realm with secrets, story, and rewards in every corner. the game itself practically begs the player to explore every inch of it's handcrafted world, which anyone who obliges will find themselves doing for hundreds of hours.  the weapons as always, from is taking all the best parts of their old games, mixing it all together, and adding new ingredients into the mix on top! with the return of power stancing from dark souls 2 and weapon arts from dark souls 3 which can now be mixed and matched between weapons, instead of being bound to a single one and heavy charging from bloodborne, we now have all the previous tools at our disposal to go forward with. not only that, but with the addition of jumping attacks and guard counters, there is never a time where you'll find yourself lacking an option to attack. for anyone who is new to the series, or has indulged in past souls pvp, you should know that one of the main ways a game keeps it's audience for such is options, and now we have plenty.  the online speaking of pvp, let's talk about the changes to how the online systems work from from's last game, dark souls 3. in 3, a host the player upon which helpful and destructive players called 'phantoms' alike converge was able to bring up to 6 people into their world, with the use of an item. now, in elden ring, the maximum number of players that can ever be in a single world falls to 4. additionally, destructive players invaders seeking to kill the host and reap the rewards will usually find the host flanked by a helpful player a summon. this is due to from making it so the only players invaders can encounter are those with additional friendly players already in the world to help them. many people who enjoy invading dislike this change for obvious reasons, as it makes their lives and their 'success' all the more difficult to obtain. i would remind these players, however, that invaders are supposed to be at a disadvantage, and are usually supposed to lose. while the occasional upset twoonone victory is obtainable and feels amazing, the invader is more geared to sap the host and summon's resources, making whatever boss they aim to face even more difficult than it would already be.  the system requirements call it a tough pill to swallow, but i believe that from made the right choice boosting the system requirements for their new game, and would support them doing the same in future game releases. the same way old cutting edge, mind blowing graphics quickly become obsolete, the same can unfortunately be said for the tech that runs it as well. if we want games to continually get more and more outstanding and vast, more detailed and intricate, then that will come with sacrifices for the older systems which can't run it. imagine how much longer this game would've taken to come out, or how much less time the team would've had to fill it with interesting characters, storylines, environments, enemies, etc if their time was eaten up by making sure the game managed to function on dated tech? you've gotta draw the line somewhere. elden ring is a oneinageneration game, goty nomineewinner for sure, and might even be considered the game of the decade when 2030 rolls around."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"derivative souls like, with lame open world, reduced challenge overallfor from game, and neutered pvp way over priced and over hyped. plot is cringe not sure what paid martin for lol graphics look like from 2014 animations from 2008 voice acting is awkwardno surprise with from game there sound, level design etc, is good but nothing wouldnt expect from them especially the dungeons were cool however, even for a souls game the difficulty is all over the place, map isnt really that open nor large and pretty much done after a single major boss. you hurdle from one area to another poking around for largely useless gear or at worst baffling what to do with, is for etc, and again even for souls game, or to see if can stumble on same set of recycled enemies in the open world with diff colour and more inflated or sometimes way deflated stats to original mob youve fought. lather, rinse, repeat with odd story element tossed in. its okay, but due to amount of marketing nonsense and to spite anyone saying this is best game of anything ever 410, wished listened to haters and never preordered this and just waited for a sale. oh and one lucky ones didnt have major performance issues, id get into all that but two things 1. all over the net go read up, no one is lying 2. its a from pc gamei meannot defending it just should know going in what to expect in that regard, tho too 23 didnt have problems for most people versus this one which is really bad performance and even worse stability for others than myselfseen it first hand at a friends place, yeesh thank you old 1060 card i guess lol final thoughts its okay, neither terrible nor great overall prob best to get on console. wait till on sale, avoid if dont like souls game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"dont believe the hype, elden ring is terrible. im not even talking about the glitches, ran well on my beast gaming rig. no, im talking about the total lack of pc optimisation. pc gamers are pretty much forced to use a controller, as the devs have decided to provide very minimal mouse  keyboard support. this isn't 1985, i'm not trying to play nes. why do the devs force pc users, who're perfectly happy with mouse and keyboard far higher skill ceiling  superior fidelity, to use a controller? from software just don't get it, its 2022, every other new aaa release has pretty much the same pc controls and user interface, which have been standardized over decades. why does elden ring look like something from the 2000s? the devs are lazy, andor incompetent, couldn't care less about the pc market. lots of souls fanbois and paid reviewers making weak excuses for this garbage. i dare these shills to make a direct comparison between elden ring and god of war or hzn, theres just no comparison, its absolute garbage, elden ring falls well short of basic expectations."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"for a franchise that is known as souls, no such thing is to be found in this product. generic, distateful, a souless corporate cashgrab with no heart, passion, charm, personaliy, beauty or grace, written by a man that needs over 10 years to write a book and designed by a man that think masterpieces are whispering girls and getting killed by the first boss so you can come out of the dirt as a zombie, elden ring manages to literally be a slap in the face to the fans of the masterpiece that was demon souls by being a post ironic statement on modern contemporary america. this game is a poor imitation of akira kurosawa's masterpieces, it's just sad really."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i am literally unable to play the game. that's it guys really i can't play the game that i bought already months ago and that's not because it's hard or smth it's because elden ring crashed everytime when i try to launch. people complain about performance, graphics etc. and here i'm facing white screen crash whenever i open it. it has been two days since it's launch and there is no proper answer came out from developers. there are many people like me getting the same crash problem and it's still persist i mean what kind of game developer you are when your game doesn't run at all. forget cyberpunk 2077's or any game launch you have ever witnessed, i have never been in this situation before i can't play the game that has been already released. elden ring managed to being the worst launched game that i couldn't have imagined. i have tried every solution on the internet, updated every driver, reinstalled the game and even the most absurd ones like it's crashing because of the epic games launcher i tried everything and my situation remains the same this is the first moment in my gaming history that i couldn't find a solution to run a game properly with a decent pc. you may ask how do you review the game that you can't play atm and i would say this review is the most deserved answer to the current gaming industry."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"as a soulsborne fan that started the series back in demon's souls era, i can feel the love and passion put in this game. i played for 10 hours so far, i am absolutely hooked. this is truly the combination of every soulsborne sekiro game and it just works. pros the world is beautiful and intricate, from its inhabitants to its castles and forts. i couldn't help myself and wander around randomly only to find out ruins, caves, minibosses, mysteries to solve, and quests. fromsoftware, again outdid themselves with the art design. the combat is brilliant, fun and fastpaced combat from bb and ds3 is back and improved further. from the jump attack mechanic to blockcounter combined with many arts of war weapon skiils you can find to customize your weapons, while some animations from former titles comeback with improvements, there are also lots of new animations. my biggest concern is scythe's backstab animations, as i've only played for 9 hours, i haven't tried them yet. i do hope they have an unique animation. the music is amazing as always, composed by talented yuka kitamura. the graphics are also very beautiful, from light poking through leaves in a dense forest to the early morning fog after rain. the npcs, faces, armor textures, details on weapons. the game looks fine even on low graphics. neutral  performancewise, i didn't really have much problems except some stutters here and there. i'm running the game on 1080p medium settings with textures on ultra, i am receiving 5760fps on caves, hubarea, ruins and the first legacydungeon while receiving 3540 fps on overworld. i am happy with the result since i am under the minimum requirements.  the game runs fine with 8gbs of ram although i'd recommend 12 or 16gbs cons even though i haven't experienced many performance problems people have been reporting, this is currently a common problem even occuring for people with highend systems. controller issues eac no fps options, you can neither limit nor unlimit. stonefang miners from demon's souls are back the game itself is fkn phenomenal, the only problems are technical but tbh i didn't expect a fromsoft pc release without problems looking at you ptde"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,pc performance is extremely subpar. the lack of ultrawide support in 2022 is unacceptable. the pc version of this game was obviously an after thought in the development process and it shows.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"this game catched me and i would say elden ring is a better version of dark souls  demon's souls. i don't have many frame drops, and if they drop, it goes from 60 to 50 fps, which isn't disturbing at all."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"performance on this game is horrible, drops in frame rate, stuttering, bad graphics, no support for large screens, etc. wasn't this supposed to be a whole new franchise? just a glorified dark souls 4, same animations as ds, same mechanics, same ui, the george r.r. martin thing was pure marketing. sorry, but open worlds and riding horses is not innovative at all."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,by far one of the best games of all time let alone 2022. the game runs constantly on 60fps for me. i have no idea what majority of the people in here are having issues with. the only time i had an fps stutter was when i was fighting the tree sentinel.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this game is amazing idk what you all dumbasses in the review section are talking about but this game is immerive and beautiful. from software already said that they would fix the framerate issue. i myself have not expierenced any frameratestutter issue just here and there but not that big of an impact.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"unfortunately it was a hard pass for me on pc. this is a poor pc port, play it on ps5 if you must. my review is for the technical problems game is facing on pc overall 5 out of 10 at this current state on pc. 1. game locks fps at 60. 2. game does not support ultra wide  intentionally developer actually blocks the ultra wide by drawing black on screen to increase fps 3. game graphics are somewhat worse than witcher 3 and a bit better than zelda breath of wild. 4. by default it will use controller mappings even when you do not have controller attached to pc. you may get stuck in settings ui easily. 5. there are frame rate drops in open world on any hardware type 6. there is a 250 ms microstutter in first time enemy encounters. list goes on and on if you must play this, give it a try on console. not here. you are warned. ignoring technical problems aside it is an addictive action game with skill progress. i would not call this story driven rpg. so not this is not skyrim or witcher killer. it is a different game all together. now lets talk about story. what a lazy guy he became. he basically wrote the story  that doesnt really have much of a story? it's a serious question, what exactly he wrote? i am playing the game on ps5. it is unacceptable on pc right now. it is a good game, with nice combat mechanics and difficulty. graphics are ok, if you remove the glowing trees, it will be more apparent it is closer to oblivion quality then skyrim. it's nothing to write home about. but settings are interesting. i am about 10 hours in so its a bit early but. just like other soul games, story is not the focus here, if there is one, one can omit it. so i am asking again , what did grr martin write exactly? lazy guy who stopped writing got and stopped in the middle of war, obviously prefer writing stories for games that actually dont have much stories. peace out"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"os crticos que s deram nota alta pro jogo s podem ser cegos ou ter sido pagos para avaliarem to bem, jogo todo mal polido, mesmo na minha 3090 o jogo apresenta quedas de quadros terrveis e travamentos, fora que pra ser um jogo de pc os preos esto muito fora do padro, criei tanto hype que at comprei na pr venda, e mesmo o meu pc estando bem acima do recomendado que a empresa pede ele no consegue rodar o jogo, muito frustrante."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,perfomance issues are ruining my pleasure. it's sad. i just want to play normaly.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"unplayable game stutters on pc. i am a huge fan of the franchise, and greatly disappointed by this release. shame on you from software. you should be embarrassed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"its amazing. this game is basically open world with the dark soulsbloodborne formula. for souls fans this is amazing. for new players, not so much. there isnt a lot of innovative design etc as other people are saying, but why innovate when it aint needed? the pc port itself is bad, the game is amazing. if you can, play it on console, but if you have a high end pc like myself you will have a blast. im talking 3090 high end pc, the framrate is locked, but thats easy to circumvent with a mod, same with eac. i honestly dont care about the technical challenges as they are easy to solve, annoying, but easy to solve. the game itself is 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"the game is cool. i don't talk about optimization because of old pc. i like it and can't stop playing it, because the world is big and this is similar to dark souls and i like dark souls"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"really bad pc port. bad performance, no ultrawide support, 60 fps cap. it's a triple a release, there's no excuse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"simply put, a horrible pc port. absolutely shameful. insane stuttering even on a high end system. absolute garbage controls on mouse and keyboard with very little options to change them to how you like. very noticeable input lag as well, and in a game like this, timing is everything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,software and game industry should hire more testers and qa engineers to avoid buggy and terrible performance launches like this
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"terrible controls for pc. who was in charge of setting up the keybinds? did they ever play a pc game before in their entire lives? or did they perhaps use a random letter picker to determine which key should do which action? who binds backexit to q but not to esc? also, why is the lowest sensitivity still spinning my camera like a beyblade? i can't see anything when i ride because my camera is dancing out of control. this is not a pc issue, but what's up with the dodge? why would you make the character dodge on button release? it feels wonky and bad. it's not even about getting good at this point, it's just plain annoying when your entire muscle memory is based on dodging on time instead of before. not to mention the animations are recycled from ds. there is no ultrawide support. game stutters in the open world. jesus, which team of individuals decided this was an optimal gaming experience? punish me through actual mechanics and combat, not by making a game that is inconvenient to play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"as a multiplayer fps guy, i was very skeptical about picking this game up. but i caved into the hype and eventually gave it a go and i can confidently say this is one of my favorite games to release this year. the multiplayer bloodstains and messages give it that charm that is missing from other games, and the invader concept is also pretty interesting and definitely gives the cooperative play an interesting drawback so that you can't just get carried. the difficulty also makes this game not feel too jarring. a lot of the boss fights are well designed apart from one of the first main bosses that brings a huge difficulty spike and are fun to fight against. a great thing about the openworld aspect of this game is that you can always go back to a boss you can't beat if you're not ready. speaking of the open world, this game's openworld feels like it belongs. some games that boast an openworld usually don't do it well, with the world feeling empty and soulless. this game however breaks that streak. there is so much to do and explore in the open world. the currencyxp that you use to both level up and buy different items is awesome, as it encourages you to try to take on a boss that you failed to beat, or explore different areas. a criticism i have of the open world is that it doesn't feature traditional townsvillages. the ambitious open world clashed with the traditional npc town system and made a single big npc gathering area with vendors across the map. unfortunately, i do have to knock a point off for the framerate issues on pc. while turning off certain settings like motion blur, global illumination, and depth of field largely eliminates them, they are still there and are enough to make me put the controller down for the day. overall, this game is really good. if you are on the fence about buying it because you don't like souls game, i would say try it out for a few hours and decide if you want to keep it or refund it through steam. if you don't like souls games, it's possible this title could be an exception. this is my first fromsoftware game, and it's safe to say this title has made me a fan."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"the design of the game is impeccable. however, the release is pretty shoddy. the game is nowhere near graphically intensive enough to run this poorly on high end hardware, and the stuttering is insufferable. i have a 3080, 58800x, and 32gb ram, yet this clunker often struggles to hit 60 fps. cyberpunk 2077 ran smoother, had much higher end graphics, and also had an open world. that, paired with the 60fps cap and the ham fisted lack of ultrawide support kind of ruins this. it's even more annoying because the game is rendering everything behind the black bars on ultrawide as has been illustrated by many people, yet you have no option to remove them and they're entirely cosmetic. just poor decision making and planning."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,please play the game before writing a review. best souls game by far. fromsoft exceeded my expectations
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i5 6600k, 1060 6gb and 16 gb ram, game working good with a few fixes. truly a masterpiece ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,the game would be perfect without the freezing. rn its a 710. if the fix the issues ill updste these. also the steam stats and consistancy speak for them self.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"another generic trash rpg where you can't do anything that is not pc. compare it to last weeks lost ark, pure trash. where are the games where you are free to create a character? the last game was skyrim where you were at least able to suffer in jail for being a problem in the ingame world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this game makes time fly. its so immersive and beautiful in every way possible. this game is love.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,how is this game a 1010from critics?? it has an empty boring open world with graphics from ps3 and the worst performance as well as outdated animations. couldnt even put in 2 hrs and ive played every souls game. do not recommend
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,frame drops now and then but its not unplayable either acceptable a game which costs 60 bucks must be polished no matter what it must be top quality and keep in mind that elden ring is not even near a bad game the world is beatiful it really is but i saw some people complaining about it not being as good as demon souls i dont think its possible to do such a big game with that much care because demon souls is not a open world game there are some passages and ways they have to do so it is easier its like expecting last of us tier graphics in an open world game although we have red dead redemption 2 which is amazing graphics in a big map but it took them serious years and money so i admit elden ring is not the best looking and best textured game but it is neat i have no complains about graphics the gameplay is near the same as the dark souls game with some things added i guess no one has any complains about it now for the difficulty i would say its neither the easiest nor the hardest soulsborne game i wont even bother to talk about the story but  must say the atmosphere is really good those godly trees really look good so f we come to a conclusion im playing on a pc so it really has some performance issues but most things beside that are generaly possitive for me also im sure from software will fix those issues in some time
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,its pretty much perfect. need one ore two patches and then ist absolutely perfect.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"good has amazing open world design. probably best designed open world i have ever played, the map is huge and never feels dull to explore. the combat is solid and when you get used to it is really fun, the music is so good and i cannot wait to buy it when it is out. the difficulty is balanced and doesn't feel unfair. kind of like previous fromsoft games. the bosses are probably the best here than they have been in any other souls game. the attention to detail in this world is superb. bad the performance issues. sometimes this game feels borderline unplayable. the stuttering and frame drops in a game where you need to be perfect is bad. the minor dungeons feel the same and not varied. the game needs an activity tracker. some way to tell what quests i am doing because you start to feel lost and confused while playing and end up missing questlines. thoughts elden ring can be best described as the accumulation of everything that fromsoftware has learned in the last decade or so. barring a few issues, it is an exceptional achievement in open world design. very few games create that curiosity within players to explore their worlds so successfully, and elden ring is one of those games. i dont know what the future holds for fromsoftware and whether they will continue to make open world soulslike games, but if they can literally pioneer a whole new genre, then they may very well elevate the open world genre, which has been afflicted so commonly by bloat and blandness, as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"am big souls games fan  am telling you don't buy the pc version until that fix it  yes it is that bad low fps , stuttering  so much lag that make the combat feels clucky  unresponsive in a game that known for its great combat animation.just wait till they patch it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i don't understand why this game gets a 10 out of 10 from the media. the pc version is in a disastrous state. obviously, fromsoft is aware of the state of the game and that hasn't stopped them from releasing it anyway. i see the potential and really tried to give the game a chance. however, it is impossible for the game to be fun in its current state. i also don't understand why everyone is defending the game. fact is the game is pretty broken at the moment. anyone who claims it runs smoothly, i would like to see a video with the frame times displayed. preferably a video of the fight against the tree sentinel. so rather wait for a patch or buy it for the console. the performance should be better there."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,trash game. switching between xbone controller and keyboard and the prompts for actions remain tied to the console controls.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"unplayable due to poor performance on a good pc. tried all graphic settings. expecting the customer to tinker in windows settings in order to somehow make the game run 'smooth' which didn't even work is unacceptable. that is your job, from software! developers and publisher had to knew about the state of the pc port and still shipped and sold it for full price. absolute no go. refunded the game. from software and bandai namco are now officially on the same level as all the other screwy companies like bethesda, bioware, cd projekt red, ubisoft, ea, blizzard etc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"honestly, graphic is not amazing, just compare with the witcher 3 that is older. gameplay and physic, witcher 3 is better this one is still like other the games of this company, cant understand why people bolded this game as a big wwoooww i refunded from the steam!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"performance on this game is horrible, drops in frame rate, stuttering, bad graphics, no support for large screens, etc. wasn't this supposed to be a whole new franchise?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"currently, the pc port struggles with stuttering. if you are sensitive about technical issues, wait for the first stability patch that is expected very soon. the game is great. if you like the souls games, you will like elden ring  but this time in an epic scale. tons of places to discover, different bosses to fight and items to find and craft. in regards to open world games, this game smokes breath of the wild. elden ring surprises you with interesting places to explore on every corner and theres always tons of things left to do. the story is, as we know from dark souls, very losely told. its on you to find your way in the world and you will often stumble into new places which seem to open up into endless new possibilities. i can't believe how big this game feels. ignore the low ranking on metacritic for the time being. people are upset that the game doesn't run properly on pc, which is valid, but you can find many 0 scores saying it's a good game  so yeah, the score should, and will, sort itself as soon as the game is properly patched."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"what can i say, the game is literally broken and wont launch...atleast i could play cyberpunk 2077 at launch..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"it supports 329 and 219 aspect ratios, but then after a bit of gameplay hides it behind black bars to obfuscate this pc ports ongoing performance issues. had to run a community fix to play it in 329 and it ran great! you can tell off to the sides where it blocks the gameplay with black bars that they are throttling enemy animations in order to reduce performance. then they added a vignette to the sides to hide that and at the last minute clearly didnt think it was ready for release, so they added the 169 black bars to cover it all up  but you cant cover up the poor performance. stop releasing unfinished games! fix this and allow ultrawide ratios like with dark souls remaster!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,playing media outlets to lie to the audience is just not acceptable. game is mediocre at best.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"hilarious to see people complain about the difficulty, missing quest logs or the combat system when soulslike clearly isn't their genre. it's like attending a rammstein concert and complaining about the lack of techno. put these foolish ambitions to rest. elden ring is everything soulsborne fans love  even better and bigger. l  maidenless  plumb out of luck  fully divorced from the strength of runes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,massive stuttering issues and no ultrawide support. those are deals breakers for me.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"overall i think this is just dark souls with open world, but with ability to jump this time which isn't really utilized from what i feel so far like in sekiro where you have sweep attacks for example that can only be dodged by jumping etc.."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"missing ultrawide support and has too many stuttering and frame rate issues to be a great pc port. the game is good, but how are they going to fail at delivering ultrawide support and optimization?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"a true masterpiece, the best souls so far!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"for those who were wondering is elden ring dark souls 4? the short answer is, yes, everything is basically dark souls. there's a new coat of paint, the world has expanded, the names have  everything is essentially the same. the combat is the same. the animations are the same. there are bonfires. there's souls. the biggest change is, they switched the jump button to a and the 'use' button to y. i mean, don't get me wrong, it's still a good game but if you were hoping for a fresh, revolutionary experience, this is really, really not it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"el juegos es una maravilla una lastima la optimizacion. espero una pronta mejora. de ser asi le pondria un 10, lo que es su contenido! elden ring es la evolucion de from software hacia la grandeza, despues de este no se que puedo esperar. es juego que cumple totalmente con las expectativas e inculso las sobrepasa. utiliza muy bien el mundo abierto a su favor ya que todo es explorable y genera curiosidad y misterio con su misticismo. las mecanicas son la evolucion de sus antecesores con lo cual tenemos una jugabilidad de alta calidad. el caballo es una gran incorporacion ya que puede darnos combates cabalgando sobre torrentera, incluso muchos enemigos se facilitan si combatimos montados sobre este. otra cosa genial, es como podemos moldear nuestro personaje a gusto, con una gran variedad de armas, hechizos e invocaciones. si hay algo por lo que siempre se destacaron son las opciones en las que podes enfrentarnos a los jefes. los enemigos son duros y este juegos es un reto, pero con voluntad, paciencia y centrandote en la exploracion para luego avanzar en la trama podras evolucionar a tu personaje para hacer el juego mas accecible y disfrutable. hay una gran cantidad de enemigos por todo el mapa y eso extraordinario. es verdad, la potencia o calidad grafica no es algo nunca antes vista ni altisima pero si hay algo que siempre nos va a garantizar fromsoftware es que su apartado artisitco es increible y este si que deslumbra. estamos ante uno de los grandes de la industria ser sin luz."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"it is the best game i've ever played for certain. wherever you step, you explore new things over and over. when i play this game, i am in the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,dark souls but open world! needs a bit of optimization.. i mostly get 5860 fps with the odd framedrop here and there when loading world sections but other than that my experience been pretty good!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"overrated game elden ring is a worst copy of dark souls. worst optimisation, worst graphic, broken gamedesign. totally faked 95100"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"who cares about performance when the game is good. just wait til fromsoft fixes it, don't rate it 0 and give it a go. that's sad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"dear miyazaki, i wish you had spent the money you spent on advertising to develop the game technically. thanks to this game, the game press has not been trusted. they drop points for assassin's creed because it has the same fighting mechanics, but they can't say the same for elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"huge, empty open world that is too lazy to explore. i'm tired of the sluggish gameplay from ds series. the intro video was replaced with sketches. no graphic, but frequent friezes. i'll put that hat away for later."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"bad keyboard controls adaptation in main menu.  average performance despite pastgen graphics.  lags when loading a new location on its borders.  lags in the boss fight in an open air location. setup i58400, gtx 1060 3gb, 16gb ram, ssd, windows 10. it seems like the game wasn't ready for release, but they decided to publish it anyway."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,yes teh perfomance is pretty bad but this game is so incredible that i honestly don't care. everytime i am not playing i wish i was. it truly the greatest fromsoft game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"graphics from 2013 year. cant play with lags, freeze, black screen. i wait it game 2 ?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"there is absolutely no excuse for a game releasing in 2022 to be totally gimped like what from has done with elden ring on pc. the pc port is truly atrocious. no ultrawide support in fact it appears it was intentionally removed, with multiple people saying it works, then soon after is replaced by black bars, fov messed up, no porting over of playstation button icons, poor performance, fps capped at 60. this was pure and simple lazy developing with the aim of making as much money as possible, while screwing over people who paid 60 expecting a competent product. inexcusable, and 010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"myl e ostatecznie gra bdzie fajna, jednak stan techniczny w tym momencie pozostawia wiele do yczenia. na razie ocena negatywna, moe si zmieni jak naprawi gr, aczkolwiek wtpi, bo wida e to leniwy port z konsol. spadki klatek w przernych miejscach, brak moliwoci wyboru oznacze przyciskw dla kontrolera i wisienka na torcie... max 60 fps serio?... nie jest tak, e gra jest niegrywalna, mona si dobrze bawi, ale szanujmy si  ps. moglibymy w kocu dosta multi, w ktre da si gra? ten system kooperacji tylko zniechca do gry ze znajomymi, a szkoda bo gra si a prosi eby gra ze znajomymi"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"another terrible port from fromsoft. nearly unplayable with the lag, stuttering and freezes, locked framerate, no ultrawide support in 2022. they said they'd do better with pc, they didn't."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,absolute masterpiece. best of all soulsborne games mixed with a wonderful open world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,people that give 0 score are just mad that they cant beat anyone lol also complaining about graphics? a good game doesnt need great graphics. graphics are the least important thing in a game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,aside from the stutters this game is a masterpiece. once you get away from the first boss the stutters are not as frequent and the the framrate drops are hardly noticeable. the game itself is a masterpiece and the critic reviews reflect that. don't listen to the haters. most of them have no life and don't know what good games are.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,console port with no effort or care taken. 60fps lock bad. no ultrawide support. no vsync disable option. no 144hz support. also bad performance and stutter and poor controller support. shameful!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,the game is amazing and its working just fine on my pc high quality settings and 60 fps on r5 1600  gtx1660. it was worth the wait.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,it is fun game. but this is not open world. it is just open field. and frame drop is disaster
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"um jogo incrvel que todo mundo vai amar jogar, porm... h de ser otimizado... se a bandai consertar os stuttering aleatrios que ao decorrer do jogo vai se exibindo, o jogo ficar perfeito de se jogar... pra quem nunca jogou um jogo da from software, essa  a chance de jogar e se emocionar bastante com um grande jogo que elden ring ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"95 reviews for a game, that does  not support 219 in 2022 lol  has terrible optimization  doesnt even automatically change key promts from controller to keyboard when you play on pc are devs this lazy? game itself looks pretty dated  visuals are mediocre, ai is horrible, animations looks like from 2010. i miss times when reviews actually were objective."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"there is no arabic language, just kidding. i'm laughing at arabs who are giving 0 points just because lack of arabic language, lol. the game has a bad optimization, that's not a lie but there is no point in giving 0 points just because of bad optimization. it will be fixed anytime soon. my 5600xt can handle it just fine so far  i had fps drops . there are newcomers who think the game has no story at all. the story lies hidden in the items, characters, locations, bosses. you gotta discover it yourself, if you want. gameplay and graphic are polished just fine. game design, i love it. user score will never go up as there have been huge ad campaing on this game and newcomers will not understand the game as they've never played any souls game before. highly recommend waiting for updates, then starting the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"what can i say? a ps3xbox360 graphics. i definitely dont recommend this game. the gameplay is awkward and repetitive, not satisfied playing it. the world is totally empty, not vast and rich as some reviewers are saying, everything looks flat and same all the time. the graphics could be better, physics and animations are very poor, considering the recent high quality games, npcs animations during conversations not exist. it is a joke! sound fx are below average and repetitive. as link the character cant speak, combat is not responsive, story is too weak. really a lazy job. so it is a disappointment and totally below the expectations of the new gen games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,one of the best open world games made to date. they just need to make a normal coop with no hoops to jump through and it would take this to the next level
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"frame rate drops and graphics aren't as important as the gameplay. this game is amazing. the story, the music, the art style, the gameplay itself is all absolutely amazing. if you are debating on getting this game and love other fromsoftware games get this game! it's incredibly fun, has good stealth, lots to do, great coop and a lot of fun. seriously, it's the best game i've played in years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"a great game, but has to be a zero due to the stutters and performance issues making pc port crap. look at the df video for more deets."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"one of the greatest games ever made. amazing world, amazing combat, exploration is fantastic, the enemy variety and diversity, the bosses and minibosses, the travel on horseback. it's got so much going for it, its so incredible. never knew that having an open world rpg mixed with dark souls could be this stellar. obviously it has some performance issues, but that can always be fixed. if you have that issue, i suggest waiting on reviewing it until they are fixed. wich should be happening rather soon. if you get past that, youre in for a massive treat! what a game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes lags and freezes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"disappointingly amateurish open world design, feels like i'm playing something from 2013, but it's not even top level 2013, more like somewhere in the middle. awful framedrops, worst vegetation graphics i have seen in very long time, boss movementsanimations seem to be some random combo from all previous souls games. sky looks nice, but that's about it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,from software with yet another solid entry. many will say their best piece of work yet. but this experience is unfortunately plagued by stuttering issues and terrible optimization on pc. id give this game a pass for a bit until the issues are fixed. will update the score once the game is fixed.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"elden ring is in my opinion a 910 game if everything works as expected. but the game is extremely poorly optimized on pc, its not even funny anymore. its a souls game and you have to deal with constant frame drops. unacceptable. which makes me rate the game 610. thats not all. 1 for if we look at the history, fromsoftware games are well known for terrible pc ports, the company doesnt learn from its mistakes. 1 for devspublishers knew very well about problems but still decided to ship it in such state. final rating 410 paid medias giving this 1010 is a joke and i pity people who take their opinions seriously."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"dark souls but bigger and even better. best open world design i have ever seen, it doesn't feel like everything is the same like in other open world games. performance issues are a thing but its still the best game i have ever played so far, so i cant justify giving it less than 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"outdated graphics, very bad optimization on both ps5 and pc yes i have both versions, ps5 runs a bit better, but still not perfect. huge random framedrops, camera goes into slowmotion randomly, open world feels dead, boss fights are not fun and you hardly get any meaningful rewards after the fights. overall this game seems to be another victim of overhype and critics didn't help either with their 9597 scores that would indicate that this game is close to perfection, sad reality is that it actually feels like indie project."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"just simply not a very good game. little to no story. most content is missable and untracked. very outdated and disappointing on accessibility. unimpressive visual and audio design. sluggish combat. no climbing. janky horse. poor optimization and performance despite very minimal technical ambition. lots of lazy corners cut, like the slideshow opening."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"ubisoft needs to innovate, but when it's souls game, then innovation is overrated, it's okay that it has worst controls of all time, it's okay it has 2014 graphics, it's okay that.... finest hypocrisy i have ever seen. i agree, far cry 6 is extremely outdated, but so is elden ring. same animations, worse controls than any ubisoft game. if fromsoft doesn't innovate and gets 97 on metacritic, why do you think ubisoft would even care to innovate at this point? even if they try, these hypocrites still sht on them and praise this unfinished trash elden ring as next generation of open world games. gaming is dying and believe it or not, it's not thanks to ubisoft. it's dying thanks to games like elden ring and cyberpunk 2077. both overhyped, both underdelivered."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"the pc version is just terrible. unoptimized with gigantic stutters, capped at 60fps. shortcuts that don't make sense i love the shortcut for accessing the map is g!, ancient ui, unintuitive in every sense. boss fights are currently impossible as the stutters prevent you from blocking at the right moment. an underwhelming slideshow intro. outdated and lazy. i had 0 fun. refunded"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,i've got the very latest drivers and elden ring has also received a small patch which was supposed to target the framerate issues that hasn't fixed the main problem. 410
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"the developers have intentionally disabled the 219  ultrawide support. if you want to bypass it with a hex fix, you have to play offline, otherwise the anticheat software kicks in. it's 2022, this is a 60 full price aaa game. it's really an unbelievable cheek! also, even with the most modern hardware, there are frame drops and a 60fps lock. simply unbelievable!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"tiene todo para ser el juego del ao, pero la optimizacin para la versin de pc al menos hasta el momento es nula y lo hace injugable de a ratos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"from the few hours i've played, i've had a lot of fun, challenging bosses and good lore"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"as many others pointed out, the game is overflowing with little problems and performance issues due the lack of polishing of the game. this game could use a few more months for better optimization. gameplay wise, the combat is what you would expect, exploration was a let down, as the critics led me to believe there would be more interesting stuff around the map, not just week monsters and lame rewards. the graphics are good, but could be better. i know it never was a priority for the studio, but its ridiculous to think this is an current gen aaa game . now what really turned me down was the story, or lack of... they talked so much about george r. r. martin world building that at least a nice plot would be expect, but nah, none whatsoever. it can be fun, but is not worth the money right now. buy with a great discount."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,first jogo muito bom nem gosto de souls mas gostei parece zelda mano whaaaa
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"phenomenal game that is likely going to stick with the industry for many years to come as a shining example of how to do open world games whilst maintaining challenge and a core sense of adventure. currently the game suffers from performance issues due to certain bugs that affect people on a varying spectrum, but these are being addressed and as soon as they are, this is a game you must absolutely play."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"controls on pc are worst i have seen in any video game ever! worse than resident evil 4 pc port from 2007. how can video game in state like this get metascore of 95 makes absolutely no sense. it truly makes me question logic behind it. graphics? are we back in 2013? is this game supposed to represent games from early 2010s? i'm really, really confused, because i haven't seen so bad grass movementplacement since 20122013. i think even assasin's creed 4 2013 had better looking grass. sky actually looks beautiful, so i'm assuming ground and sky had completely different designers? but whoever decided that combining these two into one game was ok, should maybe look for some other job. just saying. world feels absolutely lifeless. i was free roaming for hours 10 hours, killing every enemy i met and more i went on, more i discovered how lifeless this whole world is. all enemies are just conveniently placed all over the map and they are simply waiting for you to go and kill them. they hardly move, they hardly do anything tbf. i really, really tried to like it. i wouldn't spend 10 hours in a game, that i don't care about. atmosphere was there, bad graphics were distracting, but it was tolerable, because at times it looks very beautiful. castles actually look very cool, but they are not as detailed as i would expect aaa 2022 game to be. if only reason you play this game is killing one boss after another, good for you. i was expecting actual 2022 aaa video game, because hardly any game gets metascore 95 and in my opinion, it's not even slightly justified and i'm extremely disappointed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"fantastic game, the natural evolution of the dark souls genre. don't be dissuaded by reviewers crying about performance issues. those issues that do exist are minor and will be ironed out. i'm running the game smoothly at medium settings with few hiccups on ancient hardware core i7 950 and rx 470. so i really don't get what all the whining on the steam page is about. fromsoftware hit it out of the park with this one, i'm looking forward to seeing where they do with it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"fromsoft delivers yet again. please buy this support this company, there one of the very few good ones left."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i remember calling out the graphics as ps3 on steam and my post was removed in 5 minutes, because apparently it was bait. no it wasn't bait. i was completely honest. why does rockstar have to innovate and come out with ground breaking world design to get that 97, when some other studio can come out with 2011 graphics, worst control scheme of modern era of video games, flat textures and pretty much empty open world and get 95? i was dying to get the horse, because moving around was so slow and boring. but when i finally got the horse, it didn't help much, world was still boring. overall i just feel bad for other video game companies i really do, because i'm pretty sure rockstar is making something incredible with gta 6, but what the point even, when some other studio puts hardly any work into their games? elden ring fans calling innovation overrated, while whining about other companies for not innovating is most hypocritical thing i have ever seen."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"are these souls games just big meme? i'm just curious, because that's the only thing that would make sense. is this some kind of inside joke between reviewers? some calling it innovative and next step in making open world games, something that shows other companies how to make open world games? i mean, are you guy high or something? actually serious? kidding me? did you even play red dead redemption 2 or are souls games literally only games you play and you have never experienced an actual open world game, so you just assume, that elden ring's open world is something incredible? i'm disgusted with these reviews and i'm sure other companies are as well. this is literal insult to gaming in general."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"elden ring is a joy and a masterpiece. it's not only one of the best rpgs, but it's one of the best games in general."
