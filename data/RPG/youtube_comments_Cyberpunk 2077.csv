RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,"having beat the game without it breaking when it first came out, i would have given it a 610. but now with 2.0 its genuinely a 9.510 and phantom liberty is one of the best spy stories told period. goated"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,"after 500 hours of gameplay in this game, im not really shy to say that this is easily one of the best stories ive ever played ever. the attention to detail of the city simply blows my mind, and the story will literally have you question your entire life. plus for my nerds that love to deep dive into the universe of games like these, the amount of world building lore is insane, and is rooted so much in reality. you simply cant find another gaming experience anywhere like this. buy it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,"just wanted to say the quality of this video is amazing for someone with under 3k subs, great video thanks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,"it is so worth to save and playout all the options in the endings. the combinations are vast. sidenote  when you start the game, try to collect the money for the upgrades at victors first by engaging with streetthugs to gain some experience and points before you start the real storyline. this is especially handy when playing on the hardest level."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-22,cyberpunk was worth it after patch 1.5. it's a 910 experience after phantom liberty and the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is the obviously cut content and shoddy launch.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-08,"with each generation of new gamers, this will be on their list of must play games ...it will never fade away because the story and world just so much fun to experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-12,7 playthroughs in with diff builds and i don't see myself quitting anytime soon
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-21,"i just finished kingdom come deliverance and bought cyberpunk today due to the discount on the xbox store. i was hesitant because of the negative reviews at its launch. however, the comments i see now about the game say it's one of the best. let's see if that's true."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,"my favorite game now, but its lightning in a bottle in a weird way. i just dont think they can bring it in a sequel. the launch version was very rough but i kept coming back because clearly it had a solid base that needed refinement. 2.0 did just that. the gameplay and world exploration is easy to get lost in, and writing in the 2020s that's not preachy, pretentious garbage is a godsend. i'll keep this installed well into the future, just as i do for doom, starcraft and a couple others whenever i get a new build done."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,i went with a gunpowder build. spamming grenades and the arm cannon regenerates grenades pretty quickly and while any of those were on cooldown i'd switch to a revolver to finish off the remaining low hp enemies.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-25,"im glad i stuck with the game for more than a few hours in lol. i just bought it about two weeks ago. it went on sale. and quit after two hours in because oh my gosh, it is so slow in the beginning. but it picks up quick after you get out of the prologue. just stick in there for about four hours of the most agonizing four hours of an intro ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-11,"i specifically waited to play this until the ultimate edition glad i did, because i got to skip all the drama and am playing it for the first time with all the patches and dlc patience is a virtue"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-07,"excellent video! i held off on buying it until it was on a discount, the bought it but didn't immediately start playing. finally fired it up four days ago and completely forgot that the real world exists. what an incredible gaming immersion! just taking my time through the game and enjoying how fresh it is but i know i will be playing through several times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,you talked me into it i've just parted with 22 of my hard earned for the base game. i've been umming and arring about this game for a long while and that's the cheapest i've seen it on xbox series s. you've convinced me it's a worthwhile purchase
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-02,i decided to buy this after your video thank you ill start it tonight! cant wait my first game on pc too
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i bought the game in 2020, and it was unplayable on my pc, dumped it to the side and never looked back. four years later, i built a good spec pc and also ran out of games to play, looked back at my steam library, and gave it a try just to test the spec with rt, and omg, the game has blown me out of the water it is one of the best story games that i have played within the decade, with excellent graphics, great character development, awesome gameplay, and a beautiful narrative, one of the few games that i follow all the lines of the characters without skipping, and i love johnny."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,"it was broken but still fun when it came out, now it's great. they honestly should have waited to release"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"thanks for the thorough, well thought out review! i wasn't sure if i was going to purchase cyberpunk after all these years and now that it's on sale, you've convinced me! excited to try it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-23,"i just started playing it yesterday last days of 2024 and let me tell ya, i'm addicted!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,i bought it 2 days ago and thus far have been hooked. i can run around and screw with other criminals or the cops. i enjoy the story so far and the missions allow me to use my playstyle the way i want to. in other words the leveling and the gameplay allow me to be stealth instead of saying you can do it and taking it away once the action starts. it may change but i love the world so far.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"friend of mine talked about cyberpunk and made me watch edgerunners which i loved. i then watched some gameplay with him and i couldn't stop being reminded of deus ex human revolutionmankind divided in a very good way and that the void the non existing third entry left wanted to be filled still. so i bit the bullet and bought the game and started playing. never regretted one bit, full enjoyment from start to finish, made me realize how incredible the cyberpunk universe and its concept were and how deep they could run and i'm probably going to go back to it every few years because the itch will need to be scratched. and while i've heard about the abysmal launch, you know there was a dedicated dev team in there because a game like that doesn't turn around without passion and it shows. i can't wait for orion or maybe a bit, just to be sure the game releases correctly, but i want to know what they're cooking already. next time i plan on making a ky kiske inspired build and using stuff like sandivistan has a pseudo roman cancel and the double jumpair dash options for movement. gonna be great i bet."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,"finished it this weekend, in about 95 hours, needed to recover emotionally a few times, specially after the phantom dlc and the face in city endbut perfect end after reload, fully in love with panam. what a masterpiece! you shared so much of how i experienced the game, thx  probably will restart the game because in the beginning i really had now clue what was going on"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-12,"best ever, makes u laugh, cry, feel sorrow, love, and everything from warfare, crime prevention, friends, relations, dressup , tactics, racing, boxing, exploring, and whatever u can think of is in this game. to me 1010 and every modded game u play changes the game play..so u can change the game as u go along and makes it a different game. played 1.6  2.12and now 2.2  dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,"i can always respect a small youtuber who knows how to edit and concisely present information, i didn't get this game because of the bad reviews four years ago but definitely interested since i fucking love future stuff, will pick it up at this steam sale, good video"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-26,i'm on my fifth playthrough since buying it in january 2023. hands down the best game i've ever experienced. it will be the bar i judge other games with if i ever stop playing. having just as much fun now as i did my first playthrough. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-17,"as someone who bought cyberpunk 2077 day one release and maybe i just got lucky but i didnt see too many of the bugs from my side which was weird, anyway, ive never been hooked on a game like this game had me, one of the best stories and gameplay ever. so much to see and do. visually beautiful 1010 back then and now after the patch updates 2010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,"got it on steam at early december 2024. i have been on the game for 110 hours so far, done with act 2 and halfway on phantom liberty missions i keep overlapping between these 2 and other side missions throughout my playthrough. i gotta say this is some of the best games i have been playing recently. there's still glitches in graphicvisual on npc in some occasions, but to me they are bearable so long as they don't break the immersion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,"i think what i love most about cyberpunk is that it can be any game i want it to be depending on my mood. if i want a cozy experience i just drive or run around the city at night and take in the sights. if i want action, the game gives me so many options for incredible combat. if i want a story this game's world is so unbelievably big and detailed that every time i play i feel like i discover something new even hundreds of hours in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"i've had this game since launch, and i'm just now playing it. omg! i've never been into these type of games, and at 50 years old, i think i've been gaming wrong all this time. i've been attached to my duel sense edge, non stop for about a week."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,playing a net runnerkatana build was about the most fun id ever had in a video game. might be time for a replay.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,started playing on pc finally in 2024 and im still playing and having a great time. playing it methodically to where it makes sense with the pl dlc and its been pretty amazing. night city is so cool and the detail is just unreal. sometimes i just find myself walking around and taking it all in. you know its immersive when theres a fast travel on every corner and you never use them.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,absolutely! am just 50hours in and no bugs. 2.0 is superbly immersive and the stories are all brill.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"in cyberpunk, the world, the characters,feel so alive just like in the old gta san andreas. i just wish they would release more dlcs. one of the best game of our era. 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,exactly the review i was looking for. gonna pick this up on sale today!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-19,i bought a copy 10 days after the release at like 30 and launch it a month ago. one of the best game of the last 10 year. 9.510
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-05,"thanks for this great video! i just started playing the game and i have to admit that it's been a long time since i played a game that is so good i travel between quests instead of teleporting or take the time to speak with many side characters to learn about them and the world. this is a gem of a game, nothing but mesmerizing. awesome video again, thanks a lot!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,even though it was the most hyped that i'd been for a game in over a decade i still haven't played it. looks like i have something to play finally.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"i have to say m someone that really has a hard time getting into games these days, this one had me fully invested, truly loved the story to it and gameplay, definitely worth at least a play through if youre considering it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"just bought it and about to play it for the first time. now after all the updates, very body said, must play before you die. hope it lives up to the hype!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i've played since day 1 on pc. always liked the game, but after my last playthrough, where i got all the remaining achievements, including all the endings, i can honestly say this is one of my favorite games ever. it's up there with mass effect and bungie halo, and that's saying a lot! i haven't been this interested in a universe since i was a young boy playing halo 2. i'm 29 now... this game deserves all the praise in the world. from the music to the setting, the visuals, to the story, acting and worldbuilding, it is perfect. every character is just so damn interesting and with some of them, you'll slowly start to build an opinion of them like they were a real person. without spoiling too much, expect a dark story regardless of your choices. night city has a way of... twisting one's perception. it's almost a therapeutic experience, not even kidding. if you love scifi stories, then buy this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"great review. about to beat the main story, cant wait to start the phantom dlc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,i beat the game when it first came out on pc without major issues on a 1050 gpu. now i'm going to get the dlc and play it again in 2024 on pc with rtx 3060. i liked it even when it first came out
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,i played this game when it first came out and beat it. i redownloaded it a couple days ago because i wanted to play the expansion pack and i forgot how great it was.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"two of my friends told me this game is boring and like gta but in sci fi, but i think it looks fun. this is why i binge watch cyberpunk videos now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,will do buddy i'm enjoying it so far
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,playing this again right now. love the game and the world. as the updates came in the game got better and better. i did complete this when it first came out and enjoyed it then but now it is one of my favourite games of all time and worth anyones time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,great review! im going to get it today while its on sale!  you also have a new subscriber!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-12,started playing about 3 weeks ago and already have 47hrs into it. im not trying to mainline it but its just that fun and immersive after 45hrs i finally got to dogtown aka phantom liberty which im told allows you in after about 50
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-06,"if youve not yet played this game yet, then youre a fool. its a feckin gem and the dlc is just as good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,"i was a netrunner when i played this in ps4 slim, id say i enjoyed this game even before 1.5"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-28,just bought the game a couple min ago and after watching this video i can't wait to play it and have fun with it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,i loved this game... when it was released i was using a shitty laptop with only 4gb video. i bought a new one with 8gb the moment phantom liberty was released and man i've enjoyed it so much!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"what i would like is way to skip some contents of the game, they get really tedious after the first playthrough. skip options i would like to have 1 all braindances. tutorial and otherwise. 2 johnny's memories blowing up arasaka, alt's story in the blackwall, etc. 3 romance final quests. i can't tolerate anymore to have to dive with judy, or play with river's kids. sometimes i would like to play it again, but i can't be forced to see all this unskippable stuff once more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,the game is so good i cant even play other games without jonesing for night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-11,i hadnt played video games in a long time before i impulse bought an xbox last year in anticipation of ncaa25. the first game i downloaded was cyberpunk. it single handedly got me back into gaming. i was in shock. it is so so so good. the game i will compare all other games i play in the future to
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,"looked at the video and i know very much consider purchasing cyberpunk 2077, thanks a lot 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,"been playing for 4 hours. absolutely amazing, wow story, wow graphics, wow gameplay, theres a lot to learn but i find that nice to be able to exploreb"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,"new subscriber! its so awesome that actors also play games, i loved you in xmen as beast and in warm bodies!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,"trying not to get into spoilers, having been affected with seizures 40 years by the time the game came out the way the game depicts what i go through is almost spot on but more so the emotional toll and the sense of of wanting to never fade away. i break down in a good way every time i play. i'm going to start my 2nd play through since pl and 10 th overall, i like to take my time, i enjoy it and it gives me the feeling that even i can matter in a world that has given up on me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,what a great breakdown but even better are the hundreds of comments your video generated...all praising the game. made my decision much easier. new subscriber here
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,"bought it for my ps5 like a week ago. glad i did, im hooked. gonna buy dlc after main game. merry christmas everyone!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,"i have not replayed any single player game ever. in cyberpunk i have over 280h and i still am thinking about my next playthrough. this world is just so captivating, the characters so memorable and the story has so many branches you want to explore. best game ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-02,"i played it at launch on pc and had some fun with it before i moved on to other stuff. now that ive gone ahead and downloaded it for ps5, im really looking forward to enjoying this experience on the couch and really excited to see all the positive reviews for the fixes and patches that seem to have corrected the issues that the game suffered from on launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,"i purchased this game when it was still plagued with glitches on the original xbox version for my series x before the next update. i distinctly recall encountering a glitch during a shootout match where i found myself trapped inside a box. i attempted to reenter the game, but the issue persisted. a few months later, i was still stuck in the box, leading me to abandon the game altogether. additionally, the graphics were quite subpar during that era. after watching this video, i decided to dig through my closet, found the the game, and put it in my xbox to download it the new version"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,started playing the game last week and im very much enjoying it. its my first cd projekt game. the story and voice acting is amazing and the combat is fun too. my only issue is sometimes enemies can glitch out where they just twitching in place and its happens to a couple of boss fights.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,hot take  i thought the game was a masterpiece at launch i played it on pc on my old rtx 2080ti with the very first iteration of dlss and never experienced anything game breaking like the consoles had. this game will always be something special to me because it got me through the pandemiclockdowns i didnt even care about going outside!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,a masterpiece! cyberpunk 2077 and red dead redemption 2 are the 2 games i tried to squeeze out everything i could before finishing that final quest. and both games i play almost every week. cyberpunk i am playing daily again with the new patch!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,i bought the game  dlc for 45 on sale earlier this week. it has been one of the most enjoyable and immersive rpgs i've ever played . i am just level 25 and haven't even progressed the main campaign much... i've been having such a blast just doing gigs and side jobs lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-07,"i don't like to play first person games like this. only first person game i like is battlefield, but it's because games like that work better in first person. games like this i want to see my character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"i absolutely love cyberpunk. down to every little detail of gamplay, world, music, weapons, skills, tech, characters, all of it. i got the game when it came out and i was disappointed i will say. but cd projekt red have put so much work into fixing the game that it is 100 one of my favorite if not absolutely my favorite game of all time. i didn't play much when the game first released, but i did play once they started fixing some of the issues. i did a play through as a nomad and ended with the panam story. maybe 60 to 80 hours. then i eventually replayed the game as a corpo and did every side mission possible and 100 the game as far as i could and had every ending possible except takamura. had around 170 to 190 hours. i haven't played since they've released phantom liberty and the massive update to go with it due the dlc and update wasn't available for ps4. but i can promise the moment i get a ps5, whenever that may be, cyberpunk will be the first game i play and i will try to 100 again. anyways i just wanted to take a second to say that i love the game, and i hope that anyone who didn't like the game or didn't want to play the game due to its original release, i highly highly recommend giving it a chance. i truly don't believe you'd be disappointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"the new, updated cyberpunk is quite literally , my favourite game ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"honestly, i hope they add little dlcs andor more side stories throughout the years. i know its a long shot dream but its such an amazing game with a pretty good story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,"no third person really kills the game. and even with a third person mod, it's not good because the bodies were not meant for third person, so they look deformed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,"been playing since launch and i can say this game has come along way. play it, you owe it to yourself. night city is awesome to explore on your kusanagi"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,"i'm going on playthrough 5 lol. 3 times on the ps5, now twice on the steam deck. i can't seem to leave night city for long, it's just too damn good. i'm so glad that cdpr and the devs took the time needed to fix what was broken, and continued to improve on it even when they technically didn't have to after patch 2.1 i'm like you, i didn't play the game on launch and after i heard of the botched release, i decided to not play it. boy was i glad i waited! i played it when it was on patch 1.6 or something. still a little buggy but very much playable. then the rest is history. easily one of my all time favourite games to play"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,"first version was an alphaearly access title. it was unfinished. but since 2.0, its one of the best games ive played. its the game they should have launched."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,got the game this december and just finished with 90 hours. it's a mindblowing cinematic experience and one of my best games overall.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-05,played this game since launch. one of my favorites
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,"im with you on the witcher 3. ive never said its the absolute best game ive ever played, but id absolutely put it top 5 games of all time. every aspect of it from the story to the combat are awesome. its the only game ive ever finished and then immediately played through a second time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,"i bought the game after 1.5 and i got bored or overwhelmed with the world at first honestly not even giving it a fair chance. until i got really bored months later and said let me actually try it and was blown away by the story when i realized i had to get past the few missions that are basically tutorials. i was under the impression that the rest of the game would be as random and as basic as the first few moments. boy was i wrong, the story literally makes your jaw drop with the intensity"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,"i bought the collector's edition on pc back on the day and played it. enjoyed it a lot, but i made one of the greatest mistakes ever... i took the end it my way ending and... well, my life was destroyed in a second with that credits section. still recovering."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,"absolutely! and if it's not on sale, you can wait a week or two, and it will be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"i started playing last night on ps4 and so far, it hasn't had anything crazy, just some visual bugs. as soon as i get my hands on a ps5 i'll probably replay or continue playing depending on where i'm at"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,for me graphics  9.5 also i have seen some mod on utube dont know if they are real but damn ...  gameplay  7.5 story  8
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"i'm truly glad that i waited to play this game. i've heard about all the prior bugs and was hesitant for a long time, but when it was on sale 2 weeks ago i caved and bought the bundle. i ... am ... hooked! what an amazing game! i've played it for 30 hours now and am truly hooked! so yeah.. hell fing yes! d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-17,"i need to actually give this game the time and attention it deserves, every time i see videos it looks badass but when ever i'm playing it it doesn't feel that way lol."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,"just recently beat it, and still wanted more lol. running welcome to night city mod collection. so i installed a new game  mod, a all life paths open mod, and enemies of night city mod for increased challenge....and, went right back into a new game. very rocky start, but the finished product is amazing. add on a mod collection like welcome to night city, and the game is like crack to me. highly recommend expanding gameplay with the above mod collection. installed a modded militech canto  militech apogee sandevistan  chrome compressor all at once for max cyberware"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-22,i bought this game two years ago and i still havent finished it lol. thats the best part about it. so much to do in this game and explore.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,"cyberpunk2077 is more of a immersive sim with rpg elements than a full rpg, but i don't mind. from the soundtrack and the city layout to the characters everything is just top notch and worth experiencing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,honestly was rethinking this for a while. this vid changed my whole view on it and im going to buy it. sadly im a couple of bucks shy of the dlc as well but thats all good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,i couldn't finish watching this video and had to quit halfway through. you sold the game so well that i just wanted to experience it on my own.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,"fabulous review. thank you very much for taking the time to make this. super informative. i'm playing through ghost of tsushima, which is absolutely incredible. i have this game ready to go, once i've finished it. i can't wait to play it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"yeah, one of the best games i've ever played. i'm on my third playthrough and i'm still finding new things."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"looking better. i think i will wait longer, maybe until next sale, and hopefully, it gets even more fixes etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,the best game period. maybe i was lucky but i had only ever found 3 bugs since the day it launched. sure some content was missing from what was promised but it was still a great game. phantom liberty just made it even better best dlc there has been. good story with great characters. this game is an experience not to be missed.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-05,28 hours into the ultimate version right now and am completely hooked!!! buy it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i find the fact that pawe zawodny literally means paul untrustworthy to be extremely hilarious in the hindsight.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-05,i bought this game on launch day on steam. instead of refunding or complaining about the game i waited until i was happy with the updates and started my playthrough. i finally started playing on their latest patch and i know have around 40 hrs into the game. this is probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-23,i played on day one of release on ps4 lol. performance was a little bad but i didn't get any crashes until almost 30 hours in. i had a few initial disappointments such as the lack of minigames and a bunch of random open world doors being locked but it was understandable considering it was already struggling on that old system. back then i honestly did almost cry at some part of the game. it was winter time and i was alone in my apartment going through that story. i knew it was a banger if it made me even somewhat emotional. it's in my top 5 games of all time since then. and it only got better with updates. i would even say the expansion was just as good as the core game. 910

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-21,"btw for anyone who is currently struggling  nash's container was updated! it now requires you to have 40 street cred! it will pop up as a side mission and will spawn any time of day! i learned this from another video after losing my mind looking for this damn container for 30 minutes reloading the save, skipping time, reopening the game, and driving through the damn tunnel about 18 times"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-17,there's a hidden quest in watson called i'm in love with my car you can look it up online for quest location. it gives you one of the best cars in this game basically a quadra type66 but with guns. so don't miss it if you haven't got it yet.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"11  some junk vendors can sell perk points and skill xp shards 12  food vendors sell items that permanently buff you. these are very small, like 2 sta regen, but still."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,dash and katana bullet deflection deserve honorable mention as well in 2.0
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,"the real quickhack you shouldn't sleep on is sonic shock at tier 4 or higher. it effectively erases an enemy's presence from their allies, allowing you to take them out without anyone noticing via whatever quiet method you want to use, a silenced weapon, a quickhack, a thrown knife, or a blade. it's like memory wipe, but better, and cheaper."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-22,im so proud of cd for nit giving up. absolute studs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,"if theres one thing i learned from the dlc, it's that misty is the pnly friend who will stay with you through thick and thin, everyone else moved on and no longer wants to be associated with you after your 3 years coma. amazing how v sacrificed many things for these friends and was there for them in their times of need but they arent there for you in your dire time of need."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-13,"best balance i've found for me in terms of crafting mats  credits any tier below what i'm equipped with meaning if i have blue weapons and chrome i sell at vendors in our example of having blue gear, we'd sell green and white weapons and dismantle blues i get for crafting materials to upgrade to the next tier. soon enough blue gear will be replace and any blue items get added to the sale pool. the reason this works is that i pick up enough broken weapons for lowtier crafting mats that i can just craft them into higher tier materials when combined with the weapons i dismantle. once i hit 500k eddies, i dismantle everything and rely on payouts from gigs to keep it afloat from there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"the quest for the free caliburn used to pop up at 40 street cred with a marker on the map. i don't know if i missed it this time or they moved it to hidden quests. there is also a weaponized quadra, a tribute to ken block, for free in watson. and if you are a bit patient for money when you hack into things at 40 you get legendary quickhacks which sell 20k a piece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"regarding 8  i had the perk where hacking a netrunner who is hacking you spreads what youre quickhacking onto multiple enemies. a netrunner was hacking me and i hit them with cyberpsychosis. next thing i know, 8 of them were all cyberpsychos fighting each other."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"here's a tip don't put off finishing the game. you get some bonuses for finishing the game that carryover to your character after you finish the game. for example, if you loot the final boss, you can go to his ship after the game and get a crafting spec for an incredibly powerful smart shotgun that shoots rockets and gives you stack of pyromania if you have that perk. depending on which ending you do, you can get exclusive iconic weapons, such an assault rifle for doing the final mission with rogue or an iconic revolver if you do the final mission with the aldecaldos. as i said, you can continue to use these weapons with your character after finishing the game, and use them while doing phantom liberty. the smart shotgun i mentioned earlier is incredibly useful, especially on very hard and even more so if you have pyromania."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"man, been playing the shizz outta this game again since phantom liberty dropped, and it just flat out slaps. such a great game!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"i cant remember the perk names but its in intelligence and it allows you to hack the net runner through cover and then that hack spreads to all the enemies around. theres been a couple times where ive had a whole base do suicide at once. really fun. totally recommend. i think its 3 perks, one to identify them, one to hack them through cover and one to spread your hack to all their friends."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,i don't know why but i always thought big dan's outra i should go was hilarious. not goodbye or see you later. big dan knows where he is needed. great videos!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,i skipped out on this game cause of the rocky and negative release and kind of just forgot about it cause of all the other good games there are to playwhen i saw this huge update and the improvements i immediately bought the game and am having a blast! thanks again for the tips!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-17,"915  alternatively, call up any of your available vehicles, as they have a storage at their back even the motorcycles, which you can access at any time and unload anything you don't want to carry at the moment. just gotta make sure to be near a road and not in the middle of most missions as they tend to disable your ability to call your ride."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"disassembling clothes instead of weapons is bad advice for gaining crafting components, because clothes always give 1 component, while weapons give 5 or more if the weapon had mods on it. a 5 tier weapon gives 15 components compared to 1 from tier 5 clothing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"that free sports car in the cave is also part of a huge batman reference easter egg, so have fun with that lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"quick note for anyone just starting to use hidden dragon you need airtime to get it. it used to be that double jumping right beside the target was enough, but it seems that after 2.0 you need a bit extra height to make it happen."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-28,"thanks dude, i only started playing this last week and i've really been struggling to get into it. purely because it just throws so much at you all at once and it's a lot to take in and understand. but i've stuck with it and videos like yours are a godsend and the more i learn about how to play it properly, the more i'm growing to like it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,dang i wish i wouldve known about how big the sleep buff was. i knew there was one in the game but i didnt think it would be big enough to be worth picking it up. i always do all of reginas gigs before going to the heist so having that buff wouldve been nice before i did all the missions lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"the double jump out of the vehicle also works with fortified ankles, as well. the one that you hold the jump button for greater height."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,addicted as i am watching this video now i want to play again. here goes another 8 hour straight session.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-31,"best quickhack in my opinion, is contagion. throw it on a couple of different enemies in a large pack, and sit back to watch it spreading and wiping out the whole bunch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,anyone goin for the rayfield just know you need 40 street cred for it to appear
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"crafting is super usefull, the engineer build was before, now tech only upgrades the amount of cyberware you can get, that you use in all builds, you need the mats to upgrade the tiers for the iconics weapons and cyberware that you get, so the mats from the weapons are very useful, the creds you get a ton with just the missions"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,i love how you put absolutely no effort in avoiding spoilers throughout the entire video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,"as a net runner i can't remember the last time i was anywhere near the line of fire, thus weapon glitch was fairly useless. using a combination of intelligence, tech and cool i'd approach a building by stealth from a neighboring roof if possible and hack into the cameras. using contagion, and a raven cyberdeck i could clear an entire building in under a minute in most cases. any stragglers were marked, pinged, and zeroed curtesy of the rounds my tech sniper rifle shot through their skulls. before the phantom liberty patch, i didn't even need the rifle."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,i personally liked the fortified ankles cyberware upgrade for charged jumps. you jump way higher with that mod compared to reinforced tendons.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"for the free car, pretty sure you have to have a street cred of 40 so thats not early game anymore. i just started a new choom and there was no car yet with a street cred of 32"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"i use the sprint speed legs instead of the jump legs. i just find it more useful, especially with a squishy build since some perks make you harder to hit the faster you are moving."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,for the raycaster you need to unlock the crate first to get the car. regarding enemies trying to hack you they have a proximity to their hacks. if you run a good distance away from them you could cause fails because they don't have a good range to effect you. i normally don't use cameras to hack enemies because you would always alert everyone and blow stealth. it's best to room to room deal with guys that way although it's harder but you won't blow stealth if you're good enough. i play on max difficulty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-07,"do ncpd missions. they're quick straightforward objective, generally pretty easy, and you get a cash payout as well as the weapons the enemies use, plus a boat load of skills shards and occasionally a iconic weaponschematic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-14,this game is so raw i sure hope they do more dlcs or another game after they fixed it. it is exceptional
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-12,"805 i installed the selfice chip, never had a problem with a netrunner again at least on hard difficulty."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,some decent tips but 1. can't buy crafting materials anymore and 2. directing newreturning players to piss off panam just to get a car that you can buy later is kinda shitty. missing out on far better options right away and down the line.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-16,the hidden dragon is really pleasant to use with samurai swords ! i think it's called  air strike  but i have to check to be sure. the fact that you can jump and split enemies in half is fantastic.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,"i have to disagree about not dismantling weapons. you get 5 component piece instead of 1 when you dismantle clothing. as for money, craft quickhacks and sell them as you can get a lot of quickhack components from access points."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-20,with netrunber builds you can save lots of ram if you trigger the netrunner first with a silenced weapon. using an intelligence skill you can spread a quick hack to all enemies through the netrunner while he traces you. excellent for using blackwall gateway
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,so glad to get double jump cyberware and i got to get that sleek neon katana!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-17,adding to your 8th point. there's an implant that disrupts any incoming netrunning hacks. this was golden for my playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-19,"been playing cp2077 since its launch date back in dec. 2020. how did i not know about that free rayfield from the panam mission?!!! going to go get that right now!! also, since i never played patch 1.5 and later did my last playthrough when 1.3 was the newest one i had no idea about the fixer rewards. i always do the sidequests anyway, but now i have something extra to look forward to."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-25,550 the best fixer reward is from regina jones in watson. the axolotl cyberwars is insanely strong if you can afford the capacity
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-19,there are so many secrets to this game. makes you want to play it over and over again.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-16,i really like  weapons giltch .  reboot optics  and  cyberware malfunction  are pretty good too. i always love to see the enemies being completely blind and lost when i shoot them in the face.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-15,"theres cyberware you can install in your brain that keeps netrunners from running a daemon on you, fails to upload every time. im surprised he didnt bring it up"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,i swear double jumping has been around since the dawn of video games and it never gets old
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"using the dash with the double jump then air dash, you can clear alot of ground using this technique and pull off some cool kills"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"haha yes, reinforced tendons asap! i was about to comment how i always start a playthrough with them and you already had them first."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,two more tips pick up everything  you can convert junk into common crafting componenets and then convert them to green components for a 5 to 1 ratio. this will give you more components and level up your engineering skill. winwin visit food vendors  there are some later food and drink items that give permanent bonuses
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-08,"i played the game the first time ever the past month, and i found the immobility quickhack super useful in the base game don't have phantom liberty yet. i found it insanely useful against melee enemies if you get the perk to, i think double, the length of control hacks on 100 health units. i've had situations where i root one in place with the last of my ram, and smart gun the now worthless enemy from max to dead with just one use of that quickhack, even on very hard."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-28,here in 2024 in prep of my first play through
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"clothing only nets you one crafting component of the associated tier, weapons grant you either 5 or 7 if it's a  tier, and once you get into tier 5, the give you 15. money is way easier to get just through breaching access points and selling the plethora of quickhacks you acquire. i easily sell enough to take all of a vendors money while still having a shit ton left over."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"don't listen to the advice against breaking down gray weapons for components, you can only upgrade iconic weapons however all cyberware is upgradable and there not cheap on component costs and components are harder to acquire in terms of farming especially after 2.01"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-19,would of loved it is this didnt contain spoilers for main quest. looking to send a friend a video with some of these tips.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-26,"there's another free car that you can get which has become my favorite car in the game. it's a hooned out police cruiser i think and it's so much fun. i found it during one of the delamain missions where you have to find the rogue cars. there's one that you follow through a warehouse and while going through it silverhand appears and says you should try to get into the car. it's locked but the keys are nearby. once you find them, the car is yours. i don't fast travel anymore because it's way more fun to rip through night city in this thing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-16,"you can call your car and go to the truck to access your stash. you can then drop off any gear weighing you down. then, head to a vendor and access the stash again to sell what want."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"i like the broken weapon loots, prior your inventory would fill up really fast, especially with heavier melee weapons."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"the new rules for hacking, including stacking quickhacks, are the bomb. you can often get bonuses for stacking one of each type of quickhack and weapon glitch is a good starter."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-23,"there's actually a way to access the ladder in the kerry quest without double jumps, you have to use the wall in front of it and sprint jump. tested jenkin's tendons in 2.1"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-28,a lot of vendors in phantom liberty sell permanent stat boost items as well.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"playing as netrunner, don't focus too much on straight damage hacks but don't drop them entirely, they have their place too, focus on those like weapon glitch, cyberware malfuntion, reset optics, sonic shock, etc. combo hacks are much more fun in gameplay than just straight dmg spam. and monowire with added hack is also dope when you get used to it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,you can get a free car with guns attached to the front after jackies death. its north west. there are a bunch of open warehouses and its located in there sitting alone... no quests needed.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-02,"lol at 700 those big lmg mofos don't spawn in behind you, in fact, no enemies spawn in around you, they spawn as you approach, and are all already there! if you use ping or the oracle kiroshi's, you'll see em all. only thing is main quest, story momentsset pieces."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-11,138 there goes panam
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-14,theres actually 2 set of perks in the intelligence tree that reveals enemy net runners when they are hacking you and the 2nd perk adds to that if you hack them back it cancels their hack and gives them and others around the hack you put on the net runner and throughout my play through the hack that spreads to other enemies is massive youll probably clear the entire combat scenario by hacking back one netrunner
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,who else did all of reginas gigs before the heist?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-15,"for those wondering, here's the fixer rewards regina jones pre 2.0 legendary neofiber 2.0 and up axolotl, the iconic variant of newton module. also the only nonos iconic cyberware that can be acquired outside of dogtown. wakako okada byakko, an iconic katana that grants leap attacks and an attack speed increase after each kill. padre sebastian ibarra seraph, an iconic liberty pistol that fires explosive rounds. el capitan muamar reyes bloody maria, an iconic m2308 tactician shotgun with greatly increased chance at dismembering opponents. dakota smith thorton mackinaw saguaro, a cactus colored truck built for off roading. dino dinovic a quadra type66 540 with a bullitt mustang paint scheme dark highland green with black rims. mr. hands 2.0 a sterling silver quadra sport r7"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-12,"couple extras 1. if you turn down panams choice, you get the archer quartz car, but it locks you out of a lot of stuff as its necessary for her side gigs and romance questline. theres also an iconic weapon during the revenge rampage you go on that you wont get otherwise. the car will be added to the auto fixer a couple days later, so youre way better off just buying it. 2. if youre doing a netrunner build, you can use one of your relic perks to add the weapon glitch quick hack to your monowire and apply it with charged hits. personally, i think doing the movement one is better because applying it improves follow up attacks with the monowire, but the option is there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"regarding the double jump, another option alternate is fortified ankles. these don't let you double jump but they do allow you to charge up a single but much higher jump"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-08,"can you please avoid spoilers, and if you need to say something that is a spoiler just give a warning. as this is a 10 things i wish i knew earlier video and a lot of people who watch these have just started or are about to start the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-20,"i liked it when it first came out, my copy was great i had no bugs or crashes. now idk i liked playing different all the time and now i have to pick one style and stick with it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"i wish there was a veteran mode like in the stalker games. with brutal, visceral, and quick combat, with none of that bullet sponge rpg shenanigans. i also wish that shooting all the enhanced cyborgs would look and feel like binary domain or at the very least, gunblade ny. just chunk flying all over the place and baddies trying to pick up their arm, still holding the gun. or just shooting randomly cuz you blew their head off but their implants keep them going for a while. you know, next gen shit... c'est la vie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-03,"cripple movement stuns people in the same way weapon glitch does, and the legendary version reduces the target's armor by 25 45 on the iconic one. plus it freezes them in one spot, giving you plenty of opportunity to make some distance, or wait for some more ram to generate."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-03,346 that car isn't there in my new playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-09,"the best enemy netrunner deterrent is the self ice cyberware and the perk where you can upload a quickhack through walls against netrunners trying to quickhack you. there's also a perk where you have a chance to spread your quickhack to other enemies within range of the enemy netrunner. i was lucky enough to system collapse an enemy netrunner, which spread to 6 additional enemies around them. all of them instacrashed, which was exciting and rewarding."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-20,"great video, i still tend to forget to sleep before missions and i'm on my second playthrough d couple useful things that you didn't mention came to mind regarding enemy quickhacks, selfice is a must have no matter what type of a build you're going for, it negates an enemy quickhack every time. well, it has a cooldown of course so maybe not each and every one but most of the time its works perfectly and upgrading it decreases the cooldown and it's one less thing you need to worry about in combat bloodpumpbiomonitor combo is another must imo because it's essentially an autoheal so that's also one less thing you need to worry about in combat. and furthermore, if you invest perk points improving healing items and health regen, you can make v almost invincible d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"why fast travel to unload your gear? just summon a car, put the shit in the trunk which lets you access your stash."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,we cannot buy crafting components anymore. so useful to save some guns to disassemble
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,why would you give spoilers without warning in a tips and tricks video that would attract new players??
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"one of the biggest quality of life recommendations i could ever give to a netrunner build is to run the blood pump cyberware with biomon and take the health regen perks as well as adrenaline in the body tree, specifically pick up the tier 1 body perk dorphhead, which causes you to gain 2 seconds of 100 mitigation chance, this in conjunction with adrenaline lets you very easily spam quickhacks while somehow tanking the everloving crap out of incoming fire. this lets you constantly spam quickhacks, i like spamming tier 5 synapse burn and use it in conjunction with the cox2 cybernetic for easily upwards of 2k damage per quickhack since it makes all quickhacks autocrit truly amazing cyberware for netrunning, upgrading it to tier 5 decreases the max ram penalty to only 4, so it's super worth it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-13,the car is gone unfortunately. i ran and drove through the whole tunnel 2x and its not there at least on ps4 katana is also gone.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,"a neat trick is using ping then weapon glitch on the farther enemies, then switching quickhacks before they notice you to lethal to take down nearby bogies is pretty damn efficient mostly if theres a mech, always use suicide on mechs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,i never worry about enemy net runners because the anti ice cyberware is so convenient for them
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-07,has anyone found skippy the ai talking gun while you played for the side quest? coolest thing ever

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,i have 100s of hours into this game and not one second of that time have i wished it was in 3rd person. first person is so much immersive in my opinion.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,i find it fascinating how people want first person on third person games and third person on first person games. we humans are so interesting...

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,honestly since i am on ps5 i would love to have a in game mod type menu
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"i bought this game at launch, but after hearing about all the bugs, i decided to wait. best decision ever! i finally played it this year and just finished a 110hour playthrough. it was an incredible experience. so glad i waited and got to enjoy the game in its current state. if you were hesitant to play because of the launch issues, now is definitely the time to jump in!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,i bought this game 2 years ago and i'm just now getting around to playing it and fully immersing myself in the cyberpunk universe and lore and i'm loving it. i just bought some of the lore books and i haven't been this deep into and games universe since the halo days
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,just here to support buzz! keep on keeping on brotha in arms!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,ah finally a different video instead of 55 videos about helldivers 2 in 2 months.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,ng is the only thing that will bring me back at this point. i've replayed this game from scratch far too many times.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"ive been experiencing some really game breaking bugs lately, and i have the ultimate edition of cyberpunk 2077. bugs like cars falling through the ground into limbo while driving, npcs suspended in midair, while others are halfway stuck in the ground! crashing issues are also happening so if there is an update coming, hopefully its to fix these gamebreaking issues."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"multiplayer, flying vehicles, air combat, air melee combat, building destruction, businesses, more cyberwear, more epic battles. more inspiration from techno mechanicus ott cyberwear ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"i think the real question is, did bethesda abandon starfield ?."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,new game and mods on console pleeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaase
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"i would absolutely love some minor dlc preferably free that adds questlines based on some of the unused locations and concepts that never ended up in the final game. have you seen the militech tower's insides?? my most requested feature, though, is a way to personalize your arsenal with custom color schemes and names. maybe even some new scopes or the addition of stickers that you can stick to your iron."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,im calling it now when we hit the 5th anniversary this year well be getting 2.3 and more news on the new anime
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"what a beautiful experience to be immersed in cyberpunk, it's stamps you forever, i'm learning to make games and i can assure you that the devs have done an astronomical amount of incredible work in this game, i'm so grateful to be able to experience this massive piece of art"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,new game  would probably break the immersion. maybe give new game plus perks after jackie dies
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"for the next game would be cool to see more destructible environments, 2 player coop roam, and a flamethrower."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"cyberpunk is the prime example of what happens when a company actually cares about their game, compared to the numerous slop games that are shit out with their entire focus just being on microtransactions..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i played cyberpunk 2077 at launch and it was crashing so much and i was very sad. shelved the game until jan this year, and got the phantom liberty dlc when i decided to give it another shot. it's now one of my all time favourite games! i'm around 40 hours in and still want to do so much, and definitely will go for the hardest playthough after i finish my first run. cdpr really kept polishing the game into a diamond it is today."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"3rd person is a nono. big no. 1st person is immersive, because it creates the impression that you are the main character. 3rd person makes you see that you controlling somebody else. its a matter of taste for sure, but speaking of immersion  1st person all day everyday, no 3rd person, not even the option."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"personally i would love to see us get more cut content like quests, iconics, and encounters for it. these are ideas that are pretty well developed that had to be cut for time and launch dates. with whole areas that are locked away in the files awaiting to be unlocked and released into the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"im not gonna make the argument that its makes the game more immersive than others because it restricts the pov, but its a very clear and intentional creative choice from cdpr that they want the player to feel like they are v by limiting how much of v we see and when. id rather devs commit to a vision rather than chase a trend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"never understood gamers' obssession with 3rd person, it's instantly less realistic, even old fashioned, imo. 1st person is flawless in this type of game, but maybe having the choice between the two...?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"ng is my top wish. everything else is a bonus, but this is a necessity."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,new game plus is what i need more than anything
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"they should stick with they in house engine, that way they continue to have they distinct feel and look to the games they make"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,cd probably still showing it love because as soon as a new gpu comes out everyone wants to see how it performs in cyberpunk so it stays pretty relevant
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"all i want is more body customization like having chromed out legs, arms and possibly something that changes your face drastically if they add that i will spend hundreds of hours on cyberpunk doing multiple playthroughs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,i want to be able to loot any npcs clothing or outfit
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,ng for cyberpunk 2077. also don't forget witcher 1 remake coming next year!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"im still playing it but doing alternate ending and choices that i never did before. i really cant wait for the sequel, this game is awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"just a thought. a lot of cdpr's veteran develepors left the company. many of which worked on the redengine. now, cdpr has to get new develepors, who never worked with the engine, so they just had to switch to ue5, because nobody knows how their own engine really works anymore...?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"hey, i noticed your tposing shadow at around 0957  i had that too but found a fix for it. i was using the lucy hair mod and that caused the broken shadow, but moving it to a slot other than headhair to back or some other accesory slot through equipment ex fixed it. every now and then the shadow tposes again, but a quicksave and quickload fixes it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"make all the characters romanceable, supposedly the data for it already exists so not sure why they cut it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,introducing the elements that the dark future mod adds would be peak
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"another wicked vd, choom. keep 'em comin'!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"video normal thumbnail hey, valerie, i'm a cyberpsycho by the way, regina will tell the details"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"just an idea, but like how you do hd2 mod segments, you could do short videos or shorts on cool cyberpunk mods. just an idea"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i personally run over 400 mods in cyberpunk 2077. the majority are clothes and cosmetics, but mods really complete the game and make it a much better experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"from helldivers2 to cyberpunk 2077, you're making videos about the 2 games i'm currently playing lol. i have 500 hours in both games and a big reason i keep coming back to these games is because of the constant support these games receive. big props to devs who clearly care enough about their games enough to keep supporting them for years!! great video, mr.buzz!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,this is so a damn good game in all details... for me is story and dialogues the star of this game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"honestly i'm quite okay with them sticking to their guns on the first person only argument. they've made some really good points in favor, and i don't think it hurts the game in the slightest to be limited to first person only. it helps immensely with immersion, too, which imo is the singlestrongest argument for the limitation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,had this game for awhile but actually started getting into it. great game and it has me immersed into their world. love it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"the biggest thing that cdpr could give to the community for cyberpunk 2077 would be to opensource the red engine  since they are sunsetting it anyways and moving to ue5, unlike some game studios that make a couple of changes to their decades and decades old game engine and give it the designation of 2. could you imagine what the modding community could do for the world of cyberpunk 2077 if they had the actual game engine for it?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,nothing beats a hot green tea cocoa.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"the issue with implementing 1st3rd is that both cant have the same level of quality due to engine limitations. don't be fooled by the unreal engine demo...a demo that was designed from the ground up for 3rd person only and animation based movement. your camera choice is highly dependant on how you want your engine to handle movement. you literally have to cater to one even if you've implemented both. so you end up in a situation where you can clearly see that one of the 2 is favored from the game design. gtard2 and skyrimfallout more recently avowed as well are perfect examples of this. its so obvious that skyrimfallout is 1st person designed, everything is made to cater to 1st person like 0 animation base movement which is why their 3rd person camera looks stiff and the character feels floaty. vice versa for gtardr2. they both have animation based movement and the entire design of the game is based around that, then you switch to 1st person and it looks like you're playing a chucky cheese arcade shooter since the camera is slogging around with every input because its tied to animation based movement. if anyone tells you that fallout 3rd person mode hits the same standards of your avg tps game gameplay wise then theyre lying to you. same for if anyone says rdr2 1st person mode hits the standards of your avg fps game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"honestly, if they want to pick a different engine rather than maintain it themselves and require one that can handle crowds then they could do a lot worse than speaking to saber interactive as their saber3d engine seems a lot more robust than ue5. no idea where epic went so badly wrong with the shift from ue4 but something happened."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,with witcher 4 in full production i'd think another cyberpunk game would be yrs after that launches. i certainly won't be complaining about more witcher and cyberpunk games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i think the element of cyberpunk being first person to make you feel like you are v is awesome but i dont think adding the option of third person would take away from that and with how much fashion is emphasized by the community it would be nice to see yourself aside from the menu and photo mode
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i need orion to have at least a coop mode. it would be so awesome to play cyberpunk with my best friend.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i am playinv this game right now and i can say it has graphic details and soo much complex content up and beyond than any recent releases in gaming.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"appreciate the continued support for cyberpunk 2077, but man, i only have so much internet bandwidth. playing the 2.1 update and game is stellar there. cool new features came since then but they werent needed. devs had finally perfected the title then."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i think there slowly building another dlc tbh cyberpunk is still striving right now we are going to have a cyberpunk rave in la next month
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i completely understand and appreciate how immersive 1st person perspective was in cyberpunk, but there is a lore friendly way to incorporate 3rd person with a personal drone. it would give you more situational and environmental awareness in missions, but you could also just have it follow you around when outside of combat allowing you to see your character in the world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i'd be satisifed if they just gave me the e3 v hair officially in slot 22. yeah, i know there is an almost the same in 22..but i want the actual version with the two lines in the shave. then i can free up hair slot 01 for something else in swap i like using wingdeer's stuff but all the ones i like are all in slot 01 lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,bread
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"haven't played much in a year, but if ng was released, i think i would be back and playing for at least another 50100 hours, redoing the whole experience starting with all the cool items all the way through. i could be wrong, but it's something that would draw me right back."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,never really saw a point to ng since its so easy to immediately become op powerful and run around doing as you please right now even on hardest settings. i always thought it was kind of weird we couldn't switch between the 2 perspectives third and first person given how many games in the past already had this feature. the only thing that probably would've required a lot of work done on it to be implemented correctly was multiplayer and that's the one thing i was holding out for. anyone who is the slightest a fan of gta5 understand why cyberpunk 2077 players might want basically a cyberpunk skinned gta5 sort of gameplay loop where you can log on every day and run around the city with your friends.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"witcher and cyberpunk used the same engine, but the character rigging for v was definitely not set up to view third person  just watch your shadow when crouching... it's not that it's not possible, but that it would change various behaviors if they adjusted the rigging to look good, which would likely require several environment changes to accommodate the different crouch height, or maybe some other broadreaching tweaks that would be a lot of work. hopefully the new game will have a third person option, or at least live reflections since ue5 can certainly do this efficiently."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,man that footage of the third person cyberpunk looks incredible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"the only 3 things i would want from a new update on console thats what i game on. is ng plus,a new clothes vendor were u can buy the legendary clothes sets u find in the world map replace the ones u buy with lumps of cash or something so u can still collect something if u go to those places. and a new gun vendor that has new guns and let's u buy all the legendary guns u miss in the main map. not in dogtown i know one exists there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,sorry but people asking for 3rd person are complete idiots. the entire point of cyberpunk in an immersive 1st person experience that is the most immersive 1st person experience in gaming. they should 100 dive deeper into that to diversify itself from other rpgs and games. implementing 3rd person would hurt the 1st person experience. go play fallout if you want 3rd person. cyberpunk is its own unique experience you cant get on any other game. stop trying to take away this games identity for a gimmick feature that most people wouldnt even use anyways.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"this is a good concept to give the game to another studio to update it. the game stays alive while you can focus on other projects, and the other studio gets some experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i am not a fan of cyberpunk 2.0. it have some good ideas but take away a lot of freedom and now dictate how to play it. sneaking and netrunning was such a perfect match, but now it takes too long and you are too restricted, and still just the option to take over cameras and mark enemies remotely and throw here and there a quickhack at someone make it superior to berserker and sandovistan. i hate that the cyberware capacity shards count on drop not on collected, you can't always loot everything, for example doing this car missions, first you don't have the time to drive back if you drove too far the loot dissipier anyway and second if a body sit in a destroyed car you can't loot them anymore. than the compressor as operating system, wtf why not a special slot for it you can unlock via techie or a quest... you can't change the elements of your arm weapons anymore without going to the next ripper, and than they are bound to scaling... make special scaling so you can use it no matter what is a cool idea but take away the blades and monowire as changeable items is just stupid. and what i hate the most the bs looter shooter crap. you can only upgrade iconic weapons and they work all on a very specific way but normal bp for weapons are total useless now, cause you can't upgrade the normal weapons to  variants or the endgame so you are totally depend on drops. but you can't overwrite mods anymore, what means if there is a mod in a weapon specially in the endgame  weapons cause the highest i ever saw was blue so mid tear, and some mods make weapons straight up useless its just trash, so you need to get lucky that a weapon you want to play drop in 5 without any mod and in the best case a style that is ok  this is the most bs forced looter shooter mechanic i have every seen and it is double frustrating because the iconic smart shotgun for example you can get at the earliest if you play at least 1 time the ending... in a game without ng... so yes the responded to it by bringing in the iconic xmod weapons with 2 open mod slots, but not for every weapon. i see a lot of good ideas with the 2.0 version, but the 1.63 version is much more fun to play, cause you just get a lot of stuff and be free to combine it as you like  the 2.0 version is much more streamlined, very much if's and requirements how mechanics work specific. before it was just here do what ever you like now it is like someone sitting next to you and tell you if you want play that way you must do it so and so i still don't get there is so much sneaking and boni for sneaking and than they straight up nerfing it into the ground so it is no fun anymore..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,the only thing that sucks is most of these mods and tools are for pc users smhh im a ps5 guy but still enjoying the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"no! bad! no third person! have you seen the mods that give you 3rd person? it's all jank and weirdness. stay away from 3rd person, i'll throw anyone who wants it for this game off the damn bridge! i honestly don't know why people are so enamoured with third person camera mode. you want to see your character, go into your inventory, you want to take a picture of your character, we have photo mode! what. do. you. need. third. person. camera. for!?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"do you think virtuous will make the casino accessible for the 5 year anniversary thus december? that'd be soooooo cool. table games, hangout  bar spot, possible fixer  gigs, etc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"ive played 2077 in its entirety 5 times starting at its launch day , every update is an excuse to go back and drop another 100 hr play through"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,the only thing i want is ng. there's no reason not to give it to us as v is able to go from a noob merc to one who can take on the entire military by themselves within a couple of weeks. that means that v should have no problem getting to that level in 6 months.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,it would be nice to see the next cyberpunk game being a multiplayer game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i would like the beach party to not vanish after the first time you visit it or the unrelated quest next to it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,they need to allow players to customize height and build of characters and have more cyberwear.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"as a modder on nexus for cp2077 i can say we already have redmod, which was provided by cdpr and helped a lot with audio modding i'm even using it for parts of my own biggest project  and we have a tool comparable to the redkit, called wolvenkit community made. there are also several other community made frameworks for all kinds of modding. i'd say right now nothing is impossible to mod or integrate when it comes to cp2077 because several amazing people created powerful tools, frameworks and scripts for other modders. and honestly... this is my biggest hope for cyberpunk 2  that cdpr sticks to the formula of making it easy for modders. to the whole 3rd person discussion it's 100 better to have it based on fps like cp2077. and most people def. enjoy is like that as well. 3rd person is always a nice addition for spectating like in skyrim... when you run around or stand somewhere during a conversation with an npc and you just want to see your character. if they would include that in orion, i'd be happy as well but the very quick and complex combat 100 needs fps. i think ue5 is def. a big step but it will help them in the end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,all i want for cyberpunk 2077 robotic limbs male v romance judy more endings
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,they really should consider more dlc's for 2077. i know i would buy it. it would keep folks engaged in the ip while they make the next one.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,am i the only person not excited about every game switching to the unreal engine? its going to make everything feel so 'samey'
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"would still like to see some sort of coop play. new, maybe slightly more difficult gigs or jobs or expansion story arc that could still be done solo, but might be just a bit easier with someone helping. or, a version of multiplayer a bit like apb reloaded. join a corp or a gang or something and have missions to do with real player opposition?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i finally got this game the other day and wow, i'm blown away. it's the first game in awhile where i don't feel the need to rush through things and can actually enjoy the environment without any concrete plan"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,first helldivers and now cyberpunk? this channel is the gift that keeps on giving
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,if they added a built in mod system for consoles like bethesda did with fo4 it would bring in or back a whole new flood of players too. cyberpunk is the game that made me finally jump from ps5 to pc due to modding but many are still console only players
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,id love to see vehicle customization
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i just hope quality doesn't go down , since it's not the poland studio and the switch to unreal engine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"i must be the odd man out, i feel cyberpunk is better in 1st person view, would make sense with the cyberware that adds a hud, and give scale around you"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,i'm pretty sure they are just using 2077 as a test bed for new technology so their next launch isn't nearly as buggy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"they could honestly just release dlc's and other smaller end updates and people would be fed until cyberpunk 2 is released, like i promise you, ask anybody and they'd say another dlc would be nice, people love cyberpunk 2077, and adding more dlc's, or hell ng would be awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"if they actually care about mods then they'd release mods on console, but they won't because of course"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,imagine if they dropped another major dlc along with fsr4.....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,next playthrough ill try to design my v as michael jackson its only then lacking the iconic  veehee!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,i pray to god they dont switch to 3rd person as a lot of the close up nerve racking moments will definitely be diminished in its effect
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"what i want to see is them taking a page out of grand theft auto's book, where, when you steal a vehicle or a motorcycle, you can go to a garage and get it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,by far the most visually impressive game ever developed. only one or two title's in the past decade had me feel completely immersed. this was one of them.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-02,"this game has such an effect on me. i remember i had nights, when i came home, little bit tipsy, started up cyberpunk, opened up another beer and was just cruising the city in the rain at night, sitting in the desert, watching nc in the distance...damn i love this game. and the whole panam arc..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"god. this song, hearing v, the story, the characters? night city feels like home"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,"this game hit me harder than any other game. it's so muchso much of everything. friendship, solidarity, and also the loneliness that comes with it. it's so freaking powerful. thank you for the best moments in gaming stories i've ever experienced in my life! the impact this story had on me is absolutely insane."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,whenever im burnt out on gaming always goin back to cyberpunk and listening to music fixes it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,the effect this game had in me is crazy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,"there will still be nothing quite like what 2077 inspired for a while. taking over a parking lot for a party with random people speakers blasting music so loud you could feel it in your bones. enjoying the small moments of victory. or a night of heavy rain inside or outside. being surrounded by so many people, yet so alone. until you find the people you'd bleed for, as they would bleed for you. it inspired part of my own punk attitude, along with a special someone i know as well who'd help that blossom. rage against the hopeless dark, never give up who you are. the best choice is something you fight for with your heart."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,i can 100 say this confidently that cyberpunk 2077 is my favourite game ever created
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,has dethroned the amazing deus ex series as my new favorite of all time. true masterpiece!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"it takes me forever to play through games like this because i know the developers and artists worked their butts off and i want to soak it all in. i think i must have taken about 1000 screenshots by now. while i had nothing to do with this game succeeding, i feel this sense of pride that this game is now the 'baseline' for when people want to build a new pc. i want to play cyberpunk. i have bought this game 4 times already. xbox one, ultimate, steam and ps4 for a choom i want everyone to experience it. everyone wants to see the sequel but take your time, cdpr, i want to live in this world a bit longer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,yeah someones gonna have to post that song. i need it on replay while i cruise in night city

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,"i've been gaming for about 25yrs  cyberpunk is the only game i still have a constant itch to play after i've already completed it multiple times. just something about that world, the characters, story  gameplay that doesn't compare to anything else."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,there are only few games like cyberpunk 2077 that pulled me into the world and made me feel like i'm a part of it

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,050 notice how v is the only letter in front of the hands
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,"not since i first played mass effect had a game captured my mind, and soul like cyberpunk 2077 did. theres something intangible, something i cant quite put my finger on, that makes traveling the streets of night city so unforgettable. to be honest it took me more time than i care to admit to even realize that there were fast travel points."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,been hearing a lot of good things about this game. might finally give it a go
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"i love how this game aged well. from cyberbug to a masterpiece, ive already passed it like 4 times and im still amazed of every part of it. the level of details is amazing and with mods the experience goes even further than excellent. thank you cpr for this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"why does this game resonate so deeply man, gonna be a cherished favorite forever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,hearing the 'goodmorning night city' in the beginning of that song never fails to give me goosebumps. cyberpunk is by far my favorite game of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,poor male v. dudes been sidelined for like 2 years xd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"this song is one of my favorites in the game, especially when you're cruising around the city at night."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,so glad i believed in this game since the beginning. went in blind on pc at launch with zero expectations and had the biggest emotional blast and attachment i've ever felt from a videogame during two whole weeks. what a masterpiece.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-18,v and johnny. best duo in gaming history.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,whoever was in charge of vibe for this game just nailed it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,"i dont think ive ever played a game like this. the music, the first person views, the atmosphere, the aura. night city seems like a real place to me and i absolutely adore it. this game will forever hold a special place in my heart."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"the only game i play on repeat and never, ever get bored. truly, a wonder of storytelling, emotion and action i never thought possible."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-02,going down in the history books as a legend in night city is what cyberpunk is all about. love the game lots and it will only get better from here.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,preordered this game back in 2020 and was absolutely disappointed when i first started the game and couldn't even create my character or drive a car for more than 5 minutes before it would crash. now it's 2024 and i gave this game a chance once again after all these years and i was completely blown away by this game. it was like i was playing a completely different game it looked better and gameplay smooth as butter. ofcourse the game still needs some minor tweaks but it's definitely in my top 3 favorite games now. good job cdpr!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,greatest cyberpunk video game of all time ever! long live cyberpunk 2077!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"the best and my favourite game i have ever played, 400 hours"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"i have a feeling the time and place this game was made was in the end of an era, i dont think any sequel could possibly live up to this greatness"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,playing through it now for the first time and can confidently say this game is a masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,literally just bought this game and its actually so incredible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"one of the hardest game for me to put down, as i find myself kept coming back to night city every now and then, despite having reached the conclusion of the main story. while i wish there would be some form of new game plus mode, i was able to just create a new character and keep playing as a form of new game plus for me, since i already have some prior knowledge of what happened in the main game, now i can just experiment with different builds and play styles, and see where that takes me. though i do every so often find new random things that i never thought i'd encounter , when loading up some of my older saves, and that what kept me coming back to night city, and i really enjoy playing this during the night, as it makes me feel even more immersed in the mood of night city, just an ordinary person in the day, but as the night falls, i can become anyone i want to be, in night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,we need one for our boy vincent
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,i want the world to know that i was here you were. and you were a legend. i can't wait to see how they make v legend in sequel. it has to be anonymous character cuz otherwise you have to cannonise male of fem v. i hope they don't. v was basically the player in this one.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,"say what you will about the rocky launch, cd projekt red literally revived this game with the extensive hard work. i fell in love with cyberpunk and night city when i first played this game. it's absolutely brilliant."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"it's not a game... it's an experience seriously i just feel like the story is part of my own life, like true memory ive never had in real life but it's there. i can't imagine how u can top that in sequel ... i just can''t"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,"this is a beautiful way to go about an ultimate edition, thank you for reminding us you still care 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-10,i love this game! so proud that this is a polish production!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-11,"from being buggy and unplayable videogame, to becoming one of the most popular videogame. cyberpunk made a huge comeback with their first update and phantom liberty dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,105 that's why we are so in love with this game

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,jump the world of outcast now httpswehy.pey5afrosenjuxl
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,for the love of god make this a series please
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"did they fix the driving my guy, they fixed, everything"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,yo i need this to be a finished series. cyberpunk is peak.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"just an fyi when it comes to sidequestssidecontent  some of them transform into storylines that continue as you progress in the main story. one big problem in this game is when you say no, it genuinely means no. you literally cannot enter that mission or storyline unless you got a save before it. if a character calls you about a mission, best bet is say yes  you do not have a time limit or anything for all of them, but saying no locks you out of it also game is save based like skyrim so make sure u find a comfortable quicksave  quickload button"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"corpo start is definitely the best one as far as v and jackie go. that scene where they work together after the prologue is the same on all 3, except for the clothes iirc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,i left a comment already but this game is top 10. immerse yourself and make this a series. is too damn good to not complete. the dlc is so good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,love the sudden wave of youtubers playing cyberpunk. it happens at least once a year and i end up watching like 3 diff people go through a playthrough. this really is one of my favorite games of all time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"we need this to be a series, cyberpunk 2077, and its dlc are goated. to anyone who hasn't played, go buy it now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"got this game myself 3 weeks ago and have almost 200 hours in it already. truly so much to discover and so many different ways to play the game! as a headsup make sure you play this game several times, different experiences every time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,just a helpful tip try sleeping in the game before starting a quest or every hour sleeping in game gives you double exp and it hell of a boost in the gameplay to early open skills and improve faster
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,i'ma be real ma dude i'll always be excited when you do a full series on a game. the one offs are always a fun time but the series are what most keeps me locked in 3
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,please make this a series. one the best ganes of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,please make this a series! 1. blue dialogue does not always progress the conversation but it does help lore and info for the story 2. important you do side missions and gigs along with story missions because they help develop your character and story experience 3.all good weapons can be found by looting and not buying 4. the updates on the game only fixed bugs and the skill tree story has been the same except for the new dlc addition 5. its important to figure what build you want to do for this story as it will effect your playstyle and health i recommend a sandevistan build since your gungho like david in edgerunners anime 5. hope you enjoy the game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"did they fix yes, if it was a glitch or issue, they fixed it, heck, entire systems were completely overhauled to the point where patch 2.0  the dlc turned cyberpunk 2077 into one of the best open world games ever imo its crazy how cyberpunk on release to cyberounk now sre basically two entirely different games"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"love the vid, please make this a full series. here's a couple spoiler free tips 1. pay attention to side quests not only can they affect the ending you get but it can help increase your street cred. 2. your dialogue choices do matter it can effect your relationships and if certain npcs do or do not give you quests. 3. street cred is important, certain cyberware like sandivistans are locked behind higher street creds."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,715 looks like you're beating the game then!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"i'm glad you're playing this, i recently replayed it myself and it turned out to be one of my favorite games of all time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"110 you're not alone feeling that, lot of people bought or played the game to do that to him for what he did in the anime. speaking of the anime i am wondering if selecting the no copyright music options means we won't get the song from the name. you know what i'm talking about"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"1100 yes. these moments matter a lot in this game. if you have to make a decision on anything before the time runs out, then its going to have huge implications later in some way"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,a few tips from a launch player  1. only way to encounter smasher is to beat the game. there are multiple endings. 2. ncpd gigs on map are ez xp and money sources with lil to no effect on the main story. 3. do side quests. the city is dense just explore in general. 4. some side quests are timed. 5. loot all the things. they all have a use. 6. do not delete iconic weapons. 7. attributes max at 20. spend wisely you won't be able to max them all without mods. welcome to night city choom
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"bro you a natural already, at 2508 that be the exact type timing i'm on whenever i'm on this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"here we go chat its time for peak and afro if you do decide to make this a series you gotta try to do atleast most of the side quest, they tie into the story and just some of the stories they tell overall is amazing every side quest hit like crack i promise you"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,2524 ah i feel bad now  yeah go ahead and make it a series afro
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,1405 resident evil 5 inventory management music. thats crazy. got immediate flashbacks.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,i remember playing cyberpunk back when it first came out and was disappointed too. didn't even get past the prologue. but during september last year i decided to give it another try and i finished it within that month. game immediately became one of my favorites right then and there. cyberpunk actually had one of the greatest comebacks for a video game i've ever seen. the game is so peak now i boot it up to start a new run sometimes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,series me brotha pleaaasseee!!!! i was just about to redownload this game to see what the dlc is hitting like and i'm so excited to see you play this. i played when it first came out and luckily had no major problems. the games story is amazing and truly got hoed out by the rushed release. this game is truly top tier all time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"i dont even need to watch to know this series is going to be fire, you need to check out the mantis blades for sure"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"during the launch, it was a mess for console players i barely had issues on pc, but the story was fuckin phenomenal! if the launch wasnt so messy, it could've been up there for goty tbh"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"i recommend the dlc as it adds a whole new plot, quests, and new area to the game. instead of a loading screen into the new area you just get scanned through the border which makes it feel more cleanimmersive. only time you really get a loading screen is when you load up your game and fast travel. fast travel also is like one of my least used features cause driving in the game feels so natural. it definitely improved since it first came out, plus they added a lot more cosmetics in the new update, including being able to change certain cars colours."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,great video. some things to know when continuing is that blue text mostly adds more context to stuff and can open into more dialogue. the life paths mostly have similar starts but give access to alternate dialogue based around the path you took. and moslty every mission has an alternative way to complete them.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"id love to see ng, cosmetic cyberware, more clothing options and a fully functional vehicle garage where you can display and edit your cars. it needs to happen!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"mod manager, and ng are the two biggest things i see people asking for. but man?! id be down for a crafting overhaul that lets you upgrade normal weapons to  status, and allow crafted weapons to have any of the in game skins you can find."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,i play cp77 quarterly every year. this game has this very strange nostalgia in it that pulls me but never bores me. i am very glad that cdpr didn't completely abandon the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i dont even care if the updates break my mods. this game is the only game ive been addicted to consistently since launch. idk what it is about it, i just keep playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,i could see them dropping another phantom liberty level dlc. there's an entire chunk of the map that they straight up abandoned and could finish. especially to coincide with other types of content that's already been announced.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,cyberpunk 2077 is right up there with skyrim fallout 4 and rdr2. none of them are ever being deleted off my computer
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"030 technically , they didn't lie. cdpr said they were done updating the game, so they outsourced. they had to because there's no one left at the studio who understands the redengine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,i went to the comments and i didnt realize the vid was posted a minute ago. i need more cyberpunk tho man i cant get enough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i feel like when they made the decision that phantom liberty would be the only dlc and the game wouldnt be supported afterwards, that was before the success of edgerunners. since then player numbers have skyrocketed and remain healthy. i dont foresee them changing their mind about more expansions but it makes sense that we could continue to see cosmetic type updates here and there that tie in with upcoming animeshows. full mod tools would be insane"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"please make more expansions, something like helping panam with a massive gang war, or something to do with wakako, or a massive high stakes casino heist. or fk me getting harrison ford or ryan gosling for an expansion would be nuts"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,i think if you can keep cyberpunk as a game people keep coming back to until the next cyberpunk you'll end up with awesome sales numbers for that game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,theyre looking at the growth of no mans sky where theyve garnered amazing good will for a ten year old game. they update it. and add new content. and when they launch their next game theyre going to make a boatload of money because of all the good will and marketing from no mans sky. its a no brainer.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i think i'm on that new dlc train now. a year ago, i woulda said hopefully we get mod support  now i'm of the opinion that not only are we getting mod support, but i think we're getting our casino, boys and girls. also, i cannot tell you how bizarre it was to put on this video, leave the room for a second, and walk back in to post malone trying to sell me hunt showdown. he should play with general sam sometime, that'll be a hoot."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"very happy were not getting an edgerunners 2. i really think the charm of night city is that countless people find themselves at the top of their food chain, but sooner or later the city gets the best of them. its a consistent theme in the game too and i think the core of what drives the universe there is no main character just characters who cross paths in their own stories"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"as much as we love all the new updates that may be on the way, i as a member of the community must thank you for posting these kinds of update videos covering the game as it draws much attention and helps keep the game relevant. heck, when i first took interest in purchasing the game it was thanks to your videos about the steady updates and fixes the game was getting to lock me in and buy the game. so thank you and keep the videos coming!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"as i'm playing, i can't help but think of the many cranes, freeway expansion and seemingly ongoing construction in nc in relatively underutilized portions of the map. as if it's a living city. building on this potential would keep many playing including myself. there's practically another game's worth of unrealized content that could play out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,all i want in cyberpunk is an actual casino or if i could actually play pool in my glenwood apartment
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"it would be beneficial for them to continue expanding cp2077, as delaying the release of the next cyberpunk game for several years could lead to financial losses in the long run. with the current high potential and freshness of cp2077, further expansions and promotional efforts, similar to edgerunners, could elevate its success even more. mod tools would just increase the success even more. cp2077 with another expansion and more updates alongside the mod tools could be insanely successful. people are attached to the world of cyberpunk and to characters like v and johnny, judy, panam, etc. i want more v and more adventures and more closure in cp2077 and more alternatives to the story to alter everything like they initially promised with the branching storylines. imagine being able to have a new start, being able to save jackie, work with dexter or kill him, completely alter the story, get new and different endings, maybe worse or much better, etc. i think them adding more alterations like that would be interesting and also adding 3rd person support for the game including cutscenes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i literally just started a new play thru. im about to download the phantom liberty dlc when i get paid, friday! lfg"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,people underestimate an individual's loyalty to a single game for very long periods.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,i would love a mod or update that would turn  increased criminal activity locations in to redoable rifts with ever increasing difficulty and loot drops or even just a score tracker instead of loot if theres too much worry of too good loot unbalancing the game. that would be sick.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"having more stuff to do with v's love interests would be nice, like going to a restaurant for burger or a bar for a drink. there's a drivein theatre and a rollercoaster ffs, let us use them! and it always pissed me off to see npcs dressed better than v, the assests are already there so just give us access to all clothes options!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i wish they did another dlc. i really liked this game, i just wish it had endgame content"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,i find the video game industry business model for actionadventure openworld games to be broken. keep expanding the freaking game and charge for the expansions? why are they forever letting these massive ips die?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"if they update night city to the quality of dogtown i would pay big money for that. i want them to resolve endgame so you can continue after the final mission as well, without going back to an earlier save and have all the final mission stuff stuck in your quest log. improve ai and give people a little more to do. couple more big patches and i think it would be a great title."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i feel like every single player game, or otherwise moddable game, should focus on mod support after release. mod support is one of the biggest things i look for when looking to buy a game. the issue with moddable games today is that official updates break a lot of mods. this is because a lot of mods rely on utility mods. those utility mods dig into games deeper than what was designed for, but give modders the ability to do way more than what was designed. if the default modding api were good enough, utility mods likely wouldn't be needed, and mods would no longer break each update. it would also make it way easier to mod things in general. i think new applicable games should be created with modding in mind from the start. it's a lot more work to go back and make the game moddable vs designing the game that way from the beginning. i think it's both a good habit and also makes it faster to add the same type of content in the future, even for the game developers themselves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,theres legit so much they could add to this game from dlc perspectives to just content upgrades
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,300 jackied kill me if i got so much as a scratch on it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"the best thing for their next cp game in terms of marketing would be to keep this cp game alive, though small dlcs, updates, modding support etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,it's such a good time to be a cyberpunk fan
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,considering what netflix has done to the witcher show seeing them involved into more serious cyberpunk content is maybe not a reason to be happy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"mods on console is the thing that we miss and could get this game up until orion. of course, on pc with official mod support but we always have options on pc, what is missing is the consoles"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,i sometimes just like walking around the city doing ncp events. the setting is so immersive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i just want more phantom liberty tier dlcs pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase at least a few more cdpr please, just a few more.. just... give me a fucking ending, let me go... please... let me rest..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"tbf, patch 2.1 was the last update from cdpr. patch 2.2 was done by a completely different company. so maybe future updates will be outsourced."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,last major update was so far correct. 2.2 wasn't major in any way. they never said all development would cease.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"there's tons of potential left in night city. lots of unused space, potential for something akin to the what i've read about sega genesis shadowrun having a sort of sandbox that generates new runs for the player, some kind of fixer mode, i believe a multiplayer expansion or dlc was announced and later scrapped, etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"getting redkit 3 so long after the witcher 3 launch, basically telegraphed that they planned on releasing redkit for cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i'd love some gang warfare dlc, bosses for all the gangs with a hierarchy of gang members, and hit lists for and against v, i'd also love some more quests and music updates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,skip the sponsor 221
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,im glad they update again feel like im playing a living game again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i love this game. i hope i can visit the moon and meet lucy from edgerunners, or explore the crystal palace space station in the next game or through another dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"what i would actually really like is a gigdlc because of how good the phantom liberty gigs are, with highstakes gigs that are only unlocked after hitting 50 street cred. rescuing a target from a maxtac black site, stealing an employee's identity and smuggling a weapon prototype out of a militech facility, going on a clue hunt throughout night city to find a group of scavs who kidnapped someone's family member, breaking into an underground, highsecurity research facility to steal samples and data, something like that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"cyberpunk is my favorite game of all time. ive never watched anime. but because of cyberpunk, i will be trying it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,"i still play cyberpunk, i love to just walkdrive around. i love the cars, city, apartments and the dangerous vibe of an 80's90's style futuristic megacity. as a kid i loved future sci fi so naturally i love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,is it possible that this new anime will be about v's journey with jackie in these 6 months before the heist?.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,with cdpr embracing esg i don't see a good future for cyberpunk...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,more companies should do this! hiring other companies to keep their story games alive. not only does it give time for them to focus on the next iteration but it also gives the players a reason to keep coming back and the grey period between games is reduced.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"619 side note, i would love to see them implement full body implants or limb implants. example davids gorilla arms, johnnys silver hand, morgans black hand, etc. in edgerunners, david starts off as a short, scrawny kid, who can only really keep up because of his sandy. but after maines death, he basically goes full borg and gets full body, and limb implants. id love to see that in cyberpunk, but as a customization option. maybe allow us to change our height, muscle definitionamount of muscle, metal arms, simple things like that. i think it would be sick . im not a game developer, but surely it cant be that difficult?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,im hoping cp77 gets updates for next gen consoles such as ps5 pro and beyond next gen xbox in 202728. its a beautiful game and deserves to get next gen hardware optimization
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"if people are going to lie to me, i prefer the 'we're not adding any more content' lie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,i want them to add mod support to the consoles. seriously.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,"i hope they expand on open world faction interactions. a wanted level system for gangs and corporations, like in saints row, would be cool. or maybe random vigilante activities, where you can save npcs from criminals. more car customization would also be nice. and hey, maybe we one day get access to the casino andor the waterfront. one can dream."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,i just want separate save folders for characters on console i play multiple characters and switching between them is a logistical mess
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"ng would an incredible adition, just make the ng start in the middle of the konpeki heist, maybe with a new cutscene where its explains some things cause us the players know the story already. when the failed heist ends, we have everything in the map for us to play, the gigs, side missions and activities, everything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"love hunt showdown, don't mind that ad"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i wouldn't be surprised if they use an outside studio, like they did with virtuous for the recent updates, to work on more substantial dlc for cp2077. that way it wouldn't require moving significant staff away from their new projects."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,cool i am still enjoying the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"i've been facing a lot of bugs since update 2.1 playing since 2.12 with cars that disappear, an invisible car that i always end up crashing into, a trash can that fell from a building in the middle of jinguji avenue and all the cars are destroyed when colliding with it. in the racing missions with claire, the monster gets stuck in the wheel and slowly loses speed, making it impossible to finish the race. a body that i need to put in a trunk for dakota smith but even picking it up doesn't mean i have it. my chance of doing 100 is lost."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,give us multiplayer and this game lives on for another decade.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i think theyre gonna do a limited new game plus. like you can only carry over perk points and and you get 10 extra starting attribute point, you can only carry weapons over locked behind choices in missions. like erebus, chimera weapon mod, and other iconics."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,i just want a third person camera mode.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,511 that backflip was clean
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,remember all those years ago when the original trailer dropped.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,yes please keep updating this awesome game. my next playthrough will be on vr. a native vr version would be a killer app.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"i do hope they add more missions, never really got to explore night city with panam. kinda hoped v would be doing merc jobs with her prior to thr aldecaldos quest"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"i wish we got more games like this in general, not just from cdpr. i know these gta style games are insanely expensive and take a long time to make, but they sell really well and solidify your name forever in the industry"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"ive seen three youtubers doing first time play throughs within the past week, im sure this is going to bring more new players and bring old players back."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i love cyberpunk. the thing i noticed was for a single player game, theres just not enough content to completely level your character and their skillsperks. thats a big one. solution? what everyone wants, ng not just for more exp. but to experience different paths without repercussions."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"i started playing it again after the latest update and already have 100 hours in this new play through. i never finished it before, and i just got phantom liberty when it was on sale. ive been really loving it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,reminds me of back when fantasia 2000 was released. we found out that after the original movie had come out that disney animators had ideas for new movie segments if they ever revisited the project.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,elder scrolls and fallout franchises people are still playing and buying these bethesda titles years after release are a perfect example of modding tools increasing the longevity of a game. cyberpunk 2077 as a sandbox for creators could be epic.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,everytime an update comes out i do a new playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,i am completely delusioned that live action will be about reed bond 8 years before phantom liberty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-16,would love some weather options on console to give it a more atmospheric blade runner vibe..
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,game died after the 2.0 update in my opinion. i preferred the clothing have stats. and the skill system the way it was before hand. dont really care for cdpr products at this point.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,"i hope they shadow drop mod support with mac release, and outsource a new dlc for the future here. cyberpunk has so many open ends they could extend into full on content, and it could be great to see."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,any day to run around nc and throw hands is a good day. bring on the updates!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,the world is oddly nostalgic for some reason. it's like we know that's what society will look like in 100 years. maybe less.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,i also would like and find it interesting if they would start implementing new quests that either foreshadows or our missions that are somehow connected to the show so both players who have already played get new content and players who may want to learn things about the show through these quest which would also give the game more life and give the show more eyes from the people who are just there to really play the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"what i would want is a vr cyberpunk game where you play as adam smasher throughout various timelines like when he killed johnny silverhand,  during edge runners."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"the game is basically a sandbox at this point, they should just go all out with the updates, to basically just make the city feel more alive, more custom options. one main thing ive always felt is a missed opportunity, is picking up gigs at the afterlife, it would be cool if they dropped an update where u can pick up random gigs from npcs, like that one mission where u find the body in a fridge surrounded by tyger claws. itd be nice to have something like that, with every mission having a small chance of ending up in a mini boss fight, depending the gig obv."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,man literally only hyped for cyberpunk orion and ff7 part 3 these days
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,"another thing worth remembering is that cyberpunk, despite its age, has one of the most cutting edge ray tracing implementations on the market, and is still used by nvidia to show off their latest tech, which no doubt benefits cdpr. the recent addition for dlss 4 is a massive upgrade over the old upscaling model. with the recent addition of mega geometry in allan wake 2, which not only increases the quality of ray tracing, but also dramatically boosts ray tracing performance even allowing the 2080 run their heaviest rt settings at 30 fps it wouldn't surprise me if this tech eventually made its way to cyberpunk, which would open up path tracing to a lot of people who couldn't run it before. there are also rumours that cyberpunk will come to the switch 2 within the launch window not on launch day"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,my theory is that they decided to work with other studios for future projects like orion. them making updates for an existing game is a low risk way of testing how well the collaboration with another studio will work before getting them on board for a fully new game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"all i want is a mod that keeps night city alive after having cleared every single quest, gig and ncpd scan. there are important rewards that are hiding in unmarked places but the game doesn't entice the player to explore the city by feet."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,official mod tools would be a huge w. i honestly think they should look into doing paid expansions like the creation club but theyd have to do it right. like only hiring small groups of modders to specifically make official dlc and expansions.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,lol very fitting showing the native driving quality during talk of mod support
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,i want an update where the radio station doesnt constantly change and it wouldnt be constantly stopped by combat or phone calls. like friday night firefight would be awesome to fight while listening to.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,this is good to see. i almost wish bethesda would do this by hiring moddersfans to do things as well. they definitely pulled cyberpunk back from the grave. i can't wait to replay it again. it seems like every time i go to replay there's something new for me which is great
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"it's amazing that a single player game from 5 years old has about 40 k online, and that's only on steam! it's a shame they stopped its full support and cancelled the following dlcs, the game has a huge untapped potential."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,we want the abandon casino open!!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"really wish we finally get working scopes where you can zoom properly, like when using snipers."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,0626 i really wish they would add stretched ears
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,"i played through the whole game with no mods. i've been gaming for a long long time and i thought mods would be daunting for me to install. it was so easy. after that, the entire game changed for me. i keep playing, and i keep finding things i didn't find before. this is my favorite game of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,vr patch would be gas
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,sorry this part took so long. flu had other plans for me. thank you for all the support the 1st video got. i love yall teamsenju
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,hilarious how he went out and did all 23 gigs before even meeting with vik.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,realizing that everything youve played in this game so far was only the prologue is a peak gaming experience
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,oh we in here! adam smasher actually got buffed due to devs thinking he didn't fit the anime version of him.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,doing all of regina's gigs and the ncpd hustles before anything else so you can pay vik upfront is a true choom move.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,making all 23 regina gigs without crome is crazy work
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,doing every regina quest before seeing viktor is crazy work
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"fun fact in the afterlife there's a drink named the david martinez, and you can find graves for most of the crew in the columbarium."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,thats what im talking about! my son and i have not been this hype for a play through since your elden ring series! thanks and hope you have a blast like we did!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"i felt that that was the prologue?! in my bones. took me back. i super look forward to seeing how your playthrough goes. as a sneaking netrunner myself, i will overlook the slights against my playstyle and am super excited to see how a more guns ho playstyle may change some things within the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"yo afro, remember that little detail about if a legend dies in night city, they get their own drink at the afterlife? go get a drink there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,honestly it deserves so much more recognition its honestly my favorite game ive never been so invested into a character and gameplay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,im so glad you are actually doing a series of this
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"half way in your video, how long is this game? i'm like lol you haven't even passed the intro xd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"the way afro went off on dex at the end had me screaming. felt so in character and i could definitely see v feeling the exact same way. shit, i felt the same when i first got to that scene. lmao"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"this isn't a spoiler but something you're not just gonna find walking around nc not only can you pet the cats in night city, you can adopt one for your apartment. it's on the same floor of your place, turn left out the door and walk around the corner. if you have catfood in your inventory, a prompt comes up to check a note on the ground. read it, and a cutscene will play where v feeds a stray kitty before it runs off. after that, there'll be a little laundry hamper that appears next to your bed where they sleep. keep up the preem vids, choom. happy to have stumbled onto you with the last video the other day."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,2326 this is literally like the anime brother you have no idea how right you are
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,4240 most valid reaction to losing jackie.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"hey afro, since youre using a sword build, you can find a legendary one pretty early on. in the heist mission mission, instead of going out the window after tbug gets fried, go up the stairs to the helipad. there u will find saburos legendary sword in his helicopter"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"letting jack decide you throw down instead of barter, nice move. it feels and breathes cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"answers for afro doing all the main missions in cyberpunk can be a very short playthrough 15 hrs, but doing side quest w reoccurring characters ie judy can really change how you view the world and offer different endings. doing all side quest can easily be like 60 hrs. if you want to fight smasher, i think all ending paths fight smasher except 1 dlc ending choice and the arasaka ending. fighting smasher is a good fight, but mastering your character and creating your own playstyle is probably a more fulfilling like some people combine sandevisan and stealth and found that you one shot most bosses. so definitely experiment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,hell yeah it is!!! ive spent 300 hours in this game. feels like home.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"as an og cyberpunk fan, i can say, it's so nice to see someone jump into the scene this late in the game, and genuinely having a blast, is an amazing feeling."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"one of my top 3 games ive ever played. i was hooked for a solid 2 months on this game, went to bed thinking about it and woke up thinking about what i wanted to do next. not to mention phantom liberty is just behind the witcher 3s blood and wine dlc for one of my favourites of all time. cdpr know how to make a great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"the side missions do interact with the world but in nonobvious ways. for example, regina's last job were you have to break into the russian fixer's apartment. you walked right past them when you went into your suite during the main job. the game is full of stuff like that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,bruh this game only gets better and better you gotta continue this afro one of the best games of all time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"i would defo recommend showing most of the side quests if u want to make a series. the side quests are just as interesting and some of them go incredibly deep and also link in with the main story. some of them wont rlly go that deep and u wouldnt need to show them. its up to u at the end of the day but most if the side missions are incredibly interesting also, if u werent planning to do it, i would recommend phantom liberty. even if u just did it in ur spare time"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"there's a hint about smasher knowingly sees you, by having an optic upgrade to show any enemy noticing your presence by glowing red. in that scene, he's looking right at you and glows red. try it out"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"fun fact afro , when you hid in the corner , if you have a certain optics , you can highlight people who detected you in red . and adam is in red. so he knew you two were there but he did nothing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,intro already had me hyped for pt. 2
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,"just so you know after your done with the first act of the story, some of the main missions will have important dialog options that will lock you out of a certain mission towards the end of the story but you got time to kill so its recommended to just grind up and complete side gigs to maximize the build of your choice. so go crazy for now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,listening to music and just walking down the streets was such a vibe
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"for the sandevistan build, i'd highly recommend you complete all of wakako okada's side gigs as she gives you a katana called byakko that increases in attack speed with every kill you get. the byakko plus sandy build is one of the most fun ways to play cyberpunk in my personal opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"when you complete the vodoo boys quest line, you'll unlock the dlc missions. if you complete the first mission, it will unlock dogtown, where you can find the best cyberware and can also get the sandevistan that david used in the anime and is also the best one ingame, it's called militech apogee, your sandevistan build would go crazy with this sandevistan and byakko katana."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,gigs offer some of the most interesting decisions and fun things to dosee in cyberpunk. theyre my favorite part of the game and would love to see more
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"1. show gold missions we want to see your reaction 2. some blue dialogue options advance the convo and give you a different gold dialogue option 3. most blue dialogue give you extra lore 4. some side missions but not all are important to the story so you should show them 5. dont skip certain missions like evelyn parker and judy wed like to see your reaction 6. play the dlc before u beat the game, it impacts the ending and gives u new weapons, clothes, upgrades, cars, lore, etc. 7. enjoy the game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,where do i live in gotham?

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"one thing about trauma team secret event that i've seen no one noticed is that if you successfully complete trauma drama minigame quest and help tt members against tyger claws afterwards, right at the path of glory ending, you'll get a secret delamain av dialogue telling you that delamain united forces with trauma team. very little, but interesting detail."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,wow the fact trauma team sends you a thank you makes me like them even more.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,do not do ironclad until all skills are maxed. he will give 2 perk shards instead in the chest. perk shards late game while you can get a bunch a couple more might push a few extra things in your build you might have thought not possible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,"i wish there was more to the predator character with more encounters throughout nc and a deeper lore, but thats just me, i also think you should be able to kill them for some unique mantis blades one of a kind and even a unique cloaking mod called predator or something."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,you also get components if you physically disable the cameras.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,the fact there is no flashlight or way to see in the dark in the base game was completely stupid by cdpr
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"these past few weeks i've been absolutely hooked on cyberpunk 2077 and it's universe, story, and lore. i just bought 'the world of cyberpunk 2077'  'the official cyberpunk 2077 strategy guide' from amazon . and i plan on working my way over to the novels or chapter books  soon. i haven't been this immersed in a videogames universe since the halo days"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,leaning is a fantastic tool but with maxed out stealth there's nothing like openly slowwalking around an enemy base on your lynxpaws and frying everyone before they register you as a threat true ghost in the shell
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,do not close the laptop next to that robot. it'll lock you out of finishing the quest....and softlock your gamereload will get you back in the game if you try and interact with said laptop that is now closed!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"if youre intelligence is high enough, and you select the correct option, he will send you a photo of a place where you can find a shotgun. thats also in the stadium but during a different mission."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,345 i need a mod that allows me to pick ironclad in chippin in
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"a few days ago i noticed that robert wilson, the megabuilding h10 gun store owner, always talks too loudly over the phone. this is likely because he spends all day every day ten feet away from a shooting range, and is hard of hearing as a result. i also suspect that he's named after robert anton wilson, who was an editor for playboy magazine, founded the discordian movement, wrote the mother of all conspiracy theory books making fun of conspiracy theorists, which itself then became gospel to the people it was making fun of it's also very good, called illuminatus!, and if you've ever heard of the illuminati and are under the age of 130 then it's because of him, and was generally a very interesting guy with a lot to say. i think i've read everything he's ever published, so if i notice any references to his work by the gun shop guy, i'll come back and update with them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,i don't know anyone worried about the ram for shutting the cameras off
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,trauma teams should be added in the game lol itd be cool to have some random gang members or civilians getting a save lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,the bridge one with the head guy. is a reference to johnny mnemonic movie.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,juicehead your factor ads are why i joined. i love how you craft them! and i love this video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,yes!!! man i love these secrets videos.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,i think it would be cool to have a trama team origen or something
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,1009 this one i remember stumbling across this randomly in one of my playthroughs but for me it was around day
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,anyone feel weird about the video without an intro?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"that camera thing is great if you can get to them. and get to them without being seen. i noticed on a new game that turning cameras friendly now has a cool down. in my original save from launch, they stayed friendly once turned.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"000 cool trick, didnt know that. but i never needed it either, even as a sandevistan user. great thing about this game is that its level design is nuts. not as condensed and detailed as deus ex games but they were of much smaller scale than cyberpunk as well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,skip the sponsor 454
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"the ironclad quest isnt new from 2.2, its been part of the game for months. at least 89 months, maybe even longer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,when i went to fight ozob in pacifica the trauma team were being attacked when i came up for the talk with ozob. it was very cinematic and i thought it was part of the fight. lol i'll have to go back and see if i can find some juicy logs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,so this video should just have been where to find or start these secrets. not go through and tell the whole stories and conclusions. making them moot.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,that ironclad thing annoyed me. i walked away 'cause i didn't have enough intelligence. so i wanted to level up a bit only to find him malfunctioning with a dead body in front of him... cool.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"okay, this video gets a thumbs up for that first tip! i never would have thought of that! i guess it's like in movies when they use someone's hand or hold their face up to the camera to get in somewhere."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,i've noticed through replaying the game that certain npcs from gigs like in backs against the wall have ties to phantom liberty if you check their computer messages.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"as a schulz, i am traumatized! dont decapitate me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,love the secret features!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,i helped trama team they attacked. cops do that do sometimes they thank me but most of the time they see me as the bad guy idk why
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,613 thats marine actors name is bill duke
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,in petrochem as in petrochem stadium btw
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,115 a extremly old secret ..people who havent done this.. havent played phantom liberty
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,when you have done a certin quest for panam theres two bikes. and you can actually pick unless thats bin changed but i remember me picking a bike without the extra storage space. short version you get to pick your pike. unless im remembering incorectly. its bin a long time sins i played that game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"the caliburn is still not there. panamas mission is done. max level, max cred, max money."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,v hitting that quickhacking lean.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,is there a flashlight? it looks like you turn on a flashlight at 519 when going after the cloaked figure with blades out. did i play 100 hours not knowing there was a flashlight?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,not gonna like being a beat cop or other life paths would be cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,gregory schultz seems to be another johnny mnemonic reference.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,i hope they keep updating it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,first one blew my mind guess its time to hit the tower and reconsider vos postulo ut mihi
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,the game just feels so ... imprecise and clunky. are there any mods that can help with that?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,034 what kind of camera 50 years into the future can't even cover such a small angle to begin with?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,which more fun use controller or keyboard?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,thats not scorpions bike at the end
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,how are you using a flashlight?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,what if cdpr is leaving clues in cp2077 with updates on project orion
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,biggest secret here is that flashlight you are using
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,kinda disappointed about ironclad i felt everyone knew about him. i help that old robot out all the time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,bro i keep seeing and hearing about this balatro card game. everybody is enamored by it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,balatro in cyberpunk?! raaaaaaaahhhh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,how did you get a flashlight??!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"and, sadly, on both my ps4 and steam versions of the game, i have most of the side missions completed before you meet with takahata at the restaurant. for some reason, i don't want to progress the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,0353 isnt that a reference to anything?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,is this how i find out there's a balatro quest???
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,038
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,nice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"bro don't warm up the plastic container in the microwave, use a dish is more healthier for you..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,i thought the video was about features not spoilers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,hi juice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,dont microwave in the plastic
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,why did u show the other bike but talk about scorpions ?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,factor is not avaible in mexico so cant get it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"sorry, what are the '10 features'?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,straight to the point eh?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,no spoilers here... instantly yaps out major spoiler. thanks man. thanks. nice of you .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,yes time stamps
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"923 yeah, trauma teams dead to me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,these aren't features
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,how are these secrets?...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,first
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,i have 500hours so far in this game nothing is new to me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"er, he totally spoiled these 'secrets'. he practically explained everything that you would have liked to have discovered yourself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,the security thing seems less of an intentional feature or secret and more of an exploit of ai detection...i mean when the detection is working correctly i mean and doesn't immediately fill the eye thing instantly.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,comment for al gore rhythm.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,851  who else noticed values values?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,0235 wow that is so amazing... looks like in transformers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,019 disappearing npcs is really creepy plus the background sound that adds the creepiness
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,if they would have released this version initially then cyberpunk would've been one of the biggest games ever
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,i feel like that scan and replicate feature on the cars would work perfectly in a transformers game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,it's actually crazy that the cops didn't follow you in cars in the release version
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,520 that porsche
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,but the npcs in the release version are the most smartest npcs ever. why run away from a gunman when you can just disappear from existence??
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"hey, thanks, man. you made me buy the dlc. i was wondering why some features were not available in my game when i realized that they're only available for the dlc, like painting your car."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"i only played cp2077 after the edgerunners update, after which i watched the anime and played again. but since 2.0, its been too heavy for my laptop to handle, i did some missions but still not good enough. maybe it will take like 23 more years but when i build a proper pc, ill def do it with whole rtx ray tracing and everything for sure. i love this game and i wish the game director didnt left and stayed to do the sequel but i pray that cdpr doesnt mess orion up"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,they added train system and a lots of other things i can't really count in my head how many things were added. also on pc the graphics looks much better the path tracing implementation is perfect and graphically transformative. i don't know how the game looked when it released i only played the game with path tracing when i bought it and for me cyberpunk is the best looking game since.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,ill wait for couple more years until the game is finished
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"to be fair the floating fire bug still exist, they just fixed it in certain places. sometimes you find piles of trashbags on fire. those are still susceptible to the issue. if you run a car through the trash or toss a grenade at it to collapse the pile the fire just floats. also, i wouldn't say most cars can be crystalcoat swapped cause that's not correct. only a handful of cars can be recoated currently. not a single thorton at this time can be recoated and some of the cars don't have the coats applied to them correctly. for instance the vtech, using basic color coats on it results in portions of the gold decals on the base paintjob to not disappear so it screws up the whole look unless you use the base coat or a unique for it. btw, you missed a feature of the traffic improvements. not only do they now navigate around. if you hold them up for too long, they'll eventually just go into road rage mode and try to ram you out of the way. also, the leaning back and forth on bikes isn't just for stunts, it actually affects the weight of the bike. if you lean forward, it will pull the back wheel off the ground. if you lean back, it pulls the front wheel off the ground. this is really useful for faster bikes like the kusanagi that usually have issues turning. by leaning forward, you put the weight on where the bike will pivot, so it turns more cleanly. basically, just lean into the turn like you would on a real motorcycle. you can also use it to brake faster if you tap your input to lean back while using breaks since it forces the rear wheel against the ground it makes it stop faster. that might not be intentional but it works. i did a lot of testing with bikes on my last playthrough. difference with bikes is night and day."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"i bought cyberpunk for 10 right before it started becoming popular, best decision ever"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,npc's don't disappear anymore but they still run like there's sht in their pants.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,047 he still tried to disappear though
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"cd projekt red. changed a lot about the game. improved a lot. when i think of relase, what state the game was in at the beginning. i bought the game for the ps5 and i have to say that since 2.2 the game is a lot of fun. i've already spent many hours in night city completing all the side quests. hats off to the developers who have turned the game from a broken game into a very good game. that's how it should have been at the beginning. but many gamers forgive the developers. cd projekt also said that the next game should be better than gta. i think cyberpunk is already much better than gtav. but there are also 7 years in between."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,i still get npc's and multiple vehicles disappearing when i look away lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,in the release gta 3 easily destroyed cyberpunk
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,another reminder how luvky i am that ibwaited to get this game the week pl came out.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"700 i can't see where the problem is, actual and old forklifts got auto brake when you jump down so i supposed in 2077 we got a safety function too for cars and bikes"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i really hope cdpr don't ditch night city in the next game. game is so epic, but most of the interior locations are underwhelming, and many buildings aren't explorable at all. the phantom liberty locations are so much better. i'd love to see that level of detail put into the main city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,now this is cyberpunk gta!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,i kind of liked it when it was bugged the stuff we could do was just amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"if you treated the release bugs are part of v breaking down due to silverhand infecting him, then it was really cool to see the t poses and palm trees folding in half. it's all about perspective lol."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"been a cyberpunk fan since day 1, actually since year 3 from the day i saw one of the teasers. i have loved the game from release version to now. clocked in 850 hours."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,wait in the jumping out of a moving vehicle by holding your enter keybutton you can do something cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"700 i realized that nothing has changed, there must be no camera roll here, it was too lazy to fix it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this is gonna be on switch 2 can't wait.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,never liked cyberpunk but immediately became a fan since 2.1 update 4th year anniversary
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"i've always never had any interest in playing this game, mostly because of how immersion breaking it was back then and just how buggy it was in general as well. but after watching this video, i think think this game looks really cool, actually! i will buy and play cyberpunk soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,044 not the trains up separating for no reason
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i don't know how you managed to show both scenarios with the same save file since they aren't compatible with both versions. and graphics did improve a lot, the release version came with the first iteration of ray tracing. today you can play with path tracing which is a huge difference from standard rtx."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,bro we got cyberpunk 2077 new updated before gta 6?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,105 god in the machine confirmed?????
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,its so crazy seeing how my current favorite game was a pile of slop to begin with
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"cool video, thanks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,i'm waiting for 3rd person version in the next update.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,1050 i died.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,that npc ai still look dumb. like you can't interaction with them and they did nothing just walking till death
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,car customization 1.change colours 2. lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"announcement of cyberpunk 2077 as a video game adaptation 2012 first ever teaser trailer 2013 initial release of the game on december 2020 release of the 1.6 update, arguably the update that revived the game 2022 release of the phantom liberty dlc 2023 moral of the story aaa games are not made in 7 years. they take longer"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,its theres any improvement on the fps? because me with the 3080 i get 60 fps on 1080p everything on ultra! lol! some places they have like a 30fps down! its a shame because i really love this game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,very good video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,most underrated game ever
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"i wish i could play cyberpunk 2077, looks like a fun game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,can the next gta just be what cyberpunk was aiming for.?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,is that a mod at the start of the video that changes how the car looks????
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,what about performance? is it still cpu intensive?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,any possibility of a video on the console versions ?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,a lot of these are nice to have. but the game was a masterpiece from day1 unless you were on older gen console. it was bug free for my playthrough and sad to see the massive amount of issues everyone else faces.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,they tried but ts not acceptable ....not let go for fame and money when they screw up they just did it nothing make it perfect again greatest companies make a perfect game at release not debugging it after all these years to gain acceptance
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,they really did a great job patching this up. now the game looks properly released.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,do assassin's creed odyssey video game. also assassin's creed mirage game. comparison. saints row the third remastered. shadow of tomb radier game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,it would be cool if there was a cyberpunk coop option but that's probably a lot to ask huh?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,since patch 2.0 cp2077 is easily the absolute reference in the rpg segment when it comes to combat variety in an open world game... the combat system is even better than the insane complex lore and the beautiful  dark story. for me it's the best story oriented game i played in more than 20 years of gaming....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,dlc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i feel like a car in 2077 should auto stop if the driver is gone...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,i think cdproject is the only game developer who cares about pc optimizing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"patch 2.2 is the actual 1.0 release, game needs to be fixed from here onwards"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,still waiting for the 3rd person patch.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"if anything, more companies need to be like cdpr and fix their buggy games in a way cdpr did!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,game released 2 years too early
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,after watching the photorealistic mods
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,many imitate cyberpunk 2077. many imitated and then they fixed the game from glitches and bugs when it was released to the public
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,nice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"bro, the studio basically created a universe, a matrix, and people always have something to complain about it, it is normal to lounch a game and fix things in the next versions! cp2077 is an awesome game, the storyboard is kinda poor but the game in vr is really immersive!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,i'll play this game when it has third person camera on foot... doing all that character customization only to be on first person camera view all the time except when driving sucks for me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,its crazy that after all those updates to add detail and life to the game and yet they still cant match a game from 2008 with gta4. cyberpunk just isnt immersive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,is release version 1.0?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,the police system was disastrous and a reason for me not to play it. it's nice that it's now a great game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,even at the very release with all the bugs i still played and enjoyed this game. i never put it down
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,i love lucy kushinada
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,my all time favourite game i dont even play games. almost finished my second playhrough in six months.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i'm glad i played this late and had the complete version. great game, excited for orion but gonna be years from now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,this game still need to fix xd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,yeaaa!!!!!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,el auto de boquita
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"they were late on so much of the game that they released a half baked game and blamed it on covid. many businesses did that so cdpr was not alone but covid affected other businesses more. cdpr still could have the people work from home in isolation. anyway, they rushed an unfinished game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,so the game is playable now?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,it's been over a decade in development and this game still can't give you third person pov!? ridiculous considering how you can customize your characters appearance with different clothes and tattoos. what's the point if you never see it?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"mindseye will be better than this game at launch for sure. also, its basically a comeback from saints row since its based off in los vegas which is redrock."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,cyberbug 2077
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,are exama???
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,este juego sali en estado subbeta
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"no sou f de gta mas a cd levou 4 anos para entregar o mesmo que gta 5 entregou no ps3, fora todas as promessas que nunca foram cumpridas."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,not gonna lie i love the game yet i feel cheated by the developers. i literally go around looking for easter eggs only for them to put lvl 5 components in a box as if its some valuable treasure
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,the beta game for path traycing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"the fact it took years for getting like this by fixing basic bugs and adding basic features it's so laughable, i mean props to the devs to not do the ubisoftea to left the game to die and actually give support to fix their mistakes but common, people are comparing it to no man's sky, a game made by an indie team, i can't believe there's people that conformist"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,everybody is correct this game was so unplayable before these changes
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,only thing this game is missing is the 3rd person option
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,if cyberpun didnt had gta 3 tier npc with trash vram optimizing then i would buy this game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"wait, is this game also 3rd person?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,541 live matter
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,can't wait for you to get hands on gta 6
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i had fun with cyberpunk 2077 but let's be real, it's pretty mid compared to deus ex."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,try playing this game on 8gb vram u will crash like every 2 minute
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,still crap on consoles. ghosting is crazy bad
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,calls that fire physics... lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,cyberpunk has been a dumbed action game since 2.0
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,they released an unfinished game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-18,cyberpunk and no man's sky really pulled off one of the most amazing comeback in gaming history
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,i had this preordered from day one. cyberpunk 2077 is now a completely different game and absolutely love it. the dlc is fantastic. credit to the developers for not giving up and putting in the work and time to not only fix the game but deliver a fantastic experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,cyberpunked the industry every way possible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-31,"i am so glad my introduction to this game was last weekend, its genuinely one of the best games i have played in a decade"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,to see the game improve is beyond amazing. december 2020 was like yesterday and i've love it until now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,"only played this last month. i cant even imagine the work that it took to bring it from trainwreck to the current state. it is currenty one of my favorite games of all time, mostly for its world and story. i havent been this invested in an open world game in a long, long time. whatever happened before its launch, i am grateful now for cdprs work in letting this game exist."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,i'm glad i waited until yesterday to play this game for the first time. luckily i never paid attention to it and forgot about until it went on sale and i absolutely love it. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-26,i just started playing cyberpunk. i watched the hype and blowback and i'm glad i waited 4 years to buy it. it's the best game i've ever played.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,being a patient gamer really paid off on this one
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-15,"even with all the bugs and glitches ive been a fan of the game since launch back in 2020, its became one of my favorites."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,i absolutely love this game now. i was one of the people who actually enjoyed it at launch but at the time it was just good for me. coming back to it after the expansion released for a second playthrough made it go from a good game to one of my favorite games of all time. especially the phantom liberty ending. there are very few games that can really make me feel emotional about an ending and this was one of them. this game has perhaps the best narrative of any piece of media i've ever experienced. not even just games. god is this game so good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-19,"i avoided this game for so long because of this. i recently just beat cyberpunk and phantom liberty, and i cannot recall a single bug i encountered. what a wild comeback."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"this is my favorite game ever, no story ever captured my interest like this one and the gameplay is just as great and then, phantom liberty just makes it so much better, amazing narrative and great expansion, everything on the game, right now feels like a complete game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,"my experience with cyberpunk at the initial launch was a lot different. besides some ai bugs and getting soft locked one time that i eventually got through i thoroughly enjoyed the story and the world. was the enemy ai pretty easy to beat, yes. there was also some great mods early on, that fixed some graphical issues and the terrible feel of driving the vehicles. my initial experience was a 710. and i enjoyed my time in the game. but overall i'm glad cd projekt red stuck with it and fixed it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-30,experienced cyberpunk for the 1st time over the last week and it has gone down as my favorite game of all time. i sure enjoyed the base game story a lot more than phantom liberty. absolutely beautiful game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,played the game last year. apart from the amazing weapons and graphics the story was outstanding for me. also there was good vertical details in the map where we can enter few buildings. had a great time with it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,i got scared away from buying it at launch because of... well the launch. but recently picked up the ultimate edition and i honestly have never been this addicted to a game in years. it's truly a fantastic game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,some of the best characters in gaming. a comeback story for the ages. so glad cdpr was able to redeem their name with these last few updates
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-10,cdpr definitely were not tight lipped. they were promising all sorts of things that were not in the game at launch. they were the ones driving the hype train. that's why our expectations were so high.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"as one of few people who loved cp2077 on launch, this comeback will go down as one of my all time favorite things to ever happen in the gaming industry."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"in a timeline and generation where keeping people's attention for longer than 30 seconds is objectively difficult, in a world where no matter what you discover there's something else as cool or cooler, in a realm video games where the markets are so oversaturated with content and clones and attempts at all genres... i'm really really happy you guys made a video about the comeback story of this game. this game ended up so much better than i could have ever imagined."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-30,"i played cyberpunk twice right after its release on pc. the excellent plot, beautiful world and amazing music drew me deeply into this world. there were mistakes when playing three years ago, but i don't even remember them anymore and they didn't stop me from having a great time. now with the addition of phantom liberty, i played the game again from the very beginning and had even more fun. i love driving the quadra type66 javelin around a crowded city, it gives me more satisfaction than playing forza horizon. good job cd projekt and i'm waiting for your next games"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-25,"im 47, been a gamer since i can remember, since pong i guess, but latest years i havent played that much due to work, etc. and i was starting to think my gamer life was dying...because i didnt enjoy games the way i did with the witcher 3, resident evil, assasins creed,etc. but then i got cyberpunk 2077 and i am back...im over 60 hrs into the game and i cant get enough..i feel like a child again...the landscape...the open world...soooo many quests i feel i have attention disorder lol . thanks cyberpunk 2077 for saving my gamer life...thanks cd project red for creating and fixing this game. i cant wait to get a ps5 to play the dlc. you did it again cd project red. you witchered cyberpunk. btw i play on ps4....no bugs or issues yet. i already watched the series and loved it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,i like cyberpunk being in a good place now. i was a fan of the game from launch because of the amazing world they built and the gripping story they created. i know and dont deny the issues the game had at launch but i still thoroughly enjoyed it so seeing others see what i saw possible from the beginning is incredible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,"at it's core, cyberpunk 2077 had a lot of great things going for it. the narrative was very strong and the combat was a lot of fun so there was always a good game there. if it didn't release on last gen consoles it probably wouldn't have received all the flak it got. this game really turned around when edgerunners was released on netflix and they implemented some much needed fixes and cool content from the tv series."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"i only recently started playing on v2.02, it's honestly one of my favorite games of all time so far. what a blast. i'm glad i didn't start playing at launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-07,"i picked up cyberpunk just last week, oh my v, now i doubt my own existence"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"as someone who played this game when it first launched back in 2020, it's amazing to see this crazy comeback and refreshing to see devs actually care for their game and understand that they messed up and did everything in their power to fix and boost it into what it is now. personally, i never really experienced any issues with the game other than it randomly crashing on a constant basis but to see where it is now is mindblowing, and as someone who does not like firstperson games, cyberpunk 2077 is easily one my favorite firstperson games i've ever played. from the story to the characters to the world to the combat, just an amazing experience from start to finish. can honestly say i'm looking very forward to cyberpunk 2, especially with the switch to ue5."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"i only just bought cyberpunk 2077 this year 2023 and it is one of my top 5 favourite games currently. then with patch 2.1 and i recently upgraded to an rtx 4060 ti gpu, the graphics are wow. but it's the story and characters that make it the experience that it is. also, it gets top marks from me for having no happy endings, no matter what choices you make. one thing i don't get with people is the obession over character outfits. really, the only time you can look at your character are in the wardrobe, in the mirror or when you are sitting on a motorcycle. so the outfits really aren't important, especially as the npc's don't react to your outfit. it would be more interesting if you were dressed in a corpo outfit, walked into a santo domingo bar and someone tells you that you aren't welcome there. but still, one of my top 5 games!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i bought the game just before phantom liberty came out because it was on sale so i decided to give it a chance and my god this game is so good. i knew that on launch back in 2020 the game was in a nearly unplayable state, but i didnt know so many of the features i'm seeing and experiencing in my playthrough were added after the fact. i cant imagine how it is for people who played the game at release and then seeing it now, it must feel like a completely new and different game entirely. i never followed the hype for this game over the years leading up to it's release, i didnt really know it existed until that e3 where keanu reeves did the you're breathtaking segment. i had no expectations for the game like so many others did, so when it came out and i saw how glitchy and poorly optimized it was i just had some laughs at its expense and moved on. it wasnt until 3 years later that i decided to give it a chance after cdpr turned it around and i'm so glad i did. i just wish the game originally released like this so they didn't have to make a huge comeback in the first place."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-04,subscribed because your videos always make me smile!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-27,i casually bought the game 1 week ago cause it was on sale and i am flabbergasted as to how good this game is. like really really fucking gooooooooooood
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-13,958 hearing him say adaption instead of adaptation is actually driving me crazy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,"i'm one of those people who loved the game from the start on a decentlyspecced pc, maybe i got lucky but i did not have any kind of gamebreaking bugs, more like some annoyances. so i'm really happy to see how far it's come, and still play regularly"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,"120 actually they are the ones who set expectations too high almost every feature they said would be in the game, werent even in the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-18,"when no man sky was fixed, people often say i wish more developer would be like this instead of abandoning their broken game, they keep fixing it instead after seeing cyberpunk and cdpr, yeah i can see why developers might not want to invest too much effort into fixing failed games. lost cause, being the punching bag, laughing stock, etc. it's kinda hard to stay stubborn enough and keep fixing the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"when i first played cyberpunk, i played on a 2013 xbox one, and i did not have a horrible experience... yes there were bugs, glitches and some broken things but i still had a great experience overall. by the time phantom liberty came out, i got a series x and decided to load up and replay the game, and wow! i then fully understood what all the fuss was about around 60fps, it was like a whole new game! at the end of phantom liberty i had the same bittersweet feeling i get after watching a really good scifi actiondrama, this was the second time cyberpunk channeled the spirit of the original blade runner film for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,i got the game day 1 on pc as my first pc game ever and i loved the game. i had a few minor bugs but my favorite bug was being invincible. it allowed me to explore the whole map and go as high as i can get all over the map. but the story and visuals were great for me. the dlc was good too so this is one of my favorite games even before the fixes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,cyberpunk was the first game i ever preordered and was legitimately excited for. however when i got the game on ps4 i was so disappointed that i never got around to finishing it. however i just started playing it again and its almost night and day with my experience! now i dont wanna put it down!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-07,"i stayed with cyberpunk from the very start and i'm so glad people finally realized how good of a game it is. it's sad that it took an anime and whole new overhaul to get people back into it but i'm glad it finally got the attention it deserves. the story, soundtrack, characters and lore is just so good!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-26,cod doing the exact opposite.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"remember playing it first day, hated it cuz i was waiting for it for years and at the end got a game that didn't even work, just yesterday started playing it again, got the ultimate edition, and man how they improved it, feels like a different game in a great way and i'm really enjoying it so far, really glad they didn't give up and decided to fix it and make it better, now i can say it was worth the wait"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,i've been waiting for someone to document the development of this game from where it was and where it is now. great video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-26,im 300 hours in and convinced its one of the greatest games ever made. night city is just next level and so are all the characters and acting. 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,i platinumed this and dlc and loved every single minute of it. i wish i could remove these memories from my brain just so i could relive it all for the first time again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-15,"very informative and to the point, falcon. redownloaded after this video. gonna try it again after much disappointment last time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"wish you mentioned how much of a powerhouse this game is as well, a graphical showcase that will push your hardware to the limit, including the latest 4090! ray traced everything and path tracing and dlss and all the rest of the bells and whistles. 2020s but can it run crysis?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,this will go down as the best 1st person rpg of all time in more years as people visit this game in its fixed and final state. im almost done with my first blind playthrough and i am still noticing details that they packed in and put thought into as i keep going. i slowly started reading more and more of the messages and files on computers which i never do. this game feels like vr just looking at a flat screen its so immersive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"the cyberpunk sequel is being created in unreal engine 5 and will look phenomenal. full credit to the devs for not giving up on this project, and luckily some valuable lessons have been learned for the next project."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,im glad people are spreading awareness when the game is at worst and when it gets better
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-28,"i remember completing my first playthrough thinking finally finished when i absolutely rushed through. second playthrough i savored every side quest, finished with the aldecaldos, and i remember sitting there in awe because its when i really fell in love with the game. now even besides the dlc, my third time fully playing it im still finding new thing to love. i know once i finish phantom liberty im gonna break knowing it will be a while until the second cyberpunk game. im not rushing it at all, just really looking forward to it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,in 2025 hands down the best game i've ever played.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i'm thankful i waited a few years before purchasing it. it's one of my favorite games. if id bought on day one, that wouldn't have been the case."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"started watching the show a few days ago. decided to look into cyberpunk 2077 more because ive heard its better than before but still was on the fence of jumping in. after this video as well as the show detailing how interesting the setting is , glad to see cyberpunk downloading"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"1114  one small clarification the transmog system came back in patch 1.5 or 1.6, well before update 2.0. therefore the mix and match clown clothing was gone well before patch 2.0."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-07,i liked the game dont get me wrong. ive done 3 play throughs and even bought the dlc but cdpr changed my view on gaming. never preordering ever again. their embargos made me question them. its a fun game and story but for a studio as highly respected as them to do this just turned me away and i think its important for gamers to realize this. just because they fixed it doesnt mean it should be swept under the rug like a lot of people are treating it. just because you can patch and fix doesnt mean everything is peachy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,great video. just started the game for the first time and i'm loving it. edgerunners 100 is what turned my opinion around on the whole thing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-14,"if you have a pc with a high end gpu, try cp2077 in vr luke ross mod  6 degrees of freedom. night city feels like it was always meant to be walked around in vr. on a 4090 and quest 2, it is probably the most atmospheric thing i've ever experienced in a computer game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"did the impossible feels like a stretch. there's been a decent amount of games that have had terrible launches and overtime they've been patched to relative perfection. cyberpunk, nms, ffxiv, etc. so it's not impossible anymore, it's just rare to see a dev put in the time to fix it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-01,only 11 hours in. love it! quite fascinating to hear of its issues but most importantly they kept at it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,also credit to the anime for saving cyberpunk. also congrats cdpr for winning best ongoing game award
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"cyberpunk has a fantastic story, and fun loop at launch, that's what saved it overall imo. now it's almost an entirely different game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"man, i just opened youtube after playing it. what a timing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-23,"i didnt get cyberpunk until 2022 and shortly after my first play through phantom liberty came out and ive now played and completed the game and dlc 4 times. i have an immense amount of love for this game and world, was just a shame for the people who experienced the release issues. but if you still havent played it because of the release problems, please re think, its genuinely one of the greatest games ever and is so worth your time now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i'll hand it to cyberpunk 2077, it was one hell of a turn around, and kudos to cd projeckt red for that but that doesn't mean that games should be released in an unfinished state when higher ups know a game isn't ready to launch"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,it was amazing to see the game get an award at tga it deserved it cyberpunk did what almost no game nowadays has done fully came back from the dead and delivered everything that was promised i will always love talking about this game even in 10 years from now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,i purchased the game six months after initial release and played maybe three hours than decided to wait until things were improved. well years later the day has finally come!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-02,the word you're after is adaptations. not adaption. adaption is a biological change.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,as a guy who has 715hrs in cyberpunk and is still gonna play more i was very lucky as i have never got any of the major bugs and glitches people complain about and also 1 of my friends had the same time with it. it was my first single player game ever as i got the pc just a year before this game came out and it was the 2nd game i ever played on it. i freaking love this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,im excited to play this now. i just got the ultimate edition yesterday for 60 at gamestop. comes with the game and the phantom liberty expansion. going to start playing today.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i was one of the few who actually enjoyed the game since day one on pc. i knew there was a good game beneath all the bugs and glitches. i'm happy that i was patient enough to discover all the wonderful moments and beautiful cutscenes the game, instead of dismissing it immediately and abandoning like most players."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-07,"i started playing cyberpunk 2077 back in march 2024. i didn't know what to expect and i missed most of the catastrophic launch event, since i was neck deep in my career at the time. i was unaware of many things around this game, in fact, but i do remember hearing some of the commotion from close friends. going into this game without expectation, the game blew me away. not just in the visuals, but with everything else in it. i can say with confidence that this has become my favorite game to play. i now have 900 hours burned in pretty sure i'm going cross 1500 hours at some point and i'm on my second complete run, role playing as a nomad. i absolutely love the cyberpunk theme. i actually got really good at this game too and it just feeds my addiction even further. cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece and i give 0 fucks if anyone disagrees. after learning about the whole debacle, i definitely understand most of the disappointment, especially for ps4 users... ouch! i hope cdpr never does this again and that they've learned from this experience and will avoid it at all costs with their upcoming games. if you've ever felt the itch to try something different, give cyberpunk 2077 a try. phantom liberty is phenomenal."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-13,one of my favorite videos you guys have made! love this video essay stuff!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,030 nice transition
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"i had cp shortly after launch for pc, even with its flaws, cp wasis still one of my most favourite games of all time, only a couple come to mind i find were mass effect and gta45. cant wait to be able to get phantom liberty and play cp all over again!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-12,so happy i only started playing it post 2.0 release with phantom liberty...such an amazing game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i'm on my second playthrough and am actively ignoring tons of games i can play with my playstation subscription. this game might not have started that way, but now i feel it is just something special."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"i played from day one, and i'm so happy to see other people play this game. i also loved seeing the rise that it had."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"got this game day 1, played it for maybe 20 minutes and couldn't get into it. one day i randomly bought phantom liberty and came back to it about 2 months ago, and i must say, it has been one of the most memorable and beautiful gaming experiences i have ever had. the world is unlike anything i've ever seen or experienced. easily one of the best games i've ever played, next to rdr2"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-02,"and this is why cyberpunk 2077 is like, my favourite game ever 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i always stood by the game for its phenomenal storytelling alone. even during the beginning, when it was bugged to hell and back, i always said that beneath the glaring flaws are beautifully written characters and amazing potential. im so proud of them, and im glad i stuck around to see it get this far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i finished the phantom liberty dlc a few weeks ago and it was unbelievably good. i regret judging it based on the first few hours, because that is quite a long dlc and it just goes up and up and up, and then completely fucking smashes it with the ending. i don't remember the last time the ending of a game fucking smashed it as hard as that dlc. i truly cannot remember the last time i sat and watched the entire fucking end credit scene i think that dlc will stick with me for a very long time. and the best part is i really really needed that phantom liberty home run to get me like on side for cyberpunk, because i was one of the people that got fucked over at launch by the amount of bugs, and just going through and being like okay, i've played cp already, i know most of this shit, i'm experiencing probably about 50 of the new content that i didn't get to do, and then doing the dlc i was like this is like my first time playing cp again and when i got to the ending i was like yeah that's good, that's what i needed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,it achieved its no man's sky cycle and we love it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-22,"dude, just got my ps5 last night, and i can't express how happy i am to be able to drift my cars while fleeing from the ncpd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i always comment on igns page how gameranx has better rankings, falcon, jake and the team there really are a bright spot in media that's so extremely rare these days. thank you for all you do, you're truly one of the few things i look forward to"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-27,"awesome, you convinced me to get the expansion. i loved the original on pc despite the bugs and my gaming rig at the time could barely run it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"played close to the beginning but didn't get far, with all the content and updates, i'm happy i came back. one of the best games and stories i've ever played. loving everything in the world so far. and panam"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-20,the attention to detail now is amazing and the city definetly is way more lively. just a few items i wish they would add or fix but still love it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,"i played through the whole game when it was brand new, the original braindance animation was awesome, and i can definitely see how it could cause epileptic seizures. it was a series of brightly strobing lights just like doctors use to induce seizures"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"gameranx never disappoints us, he's an incredible content creator and always creates masterpieces. his content is amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,i dont know how but i had pretty much no problems when i played the game at launch. i think its one of my favourite games ever and im glad way more people are now able to see how good the game really is.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-03,3 years later and i completely regret buying this game. still glitchy in every aspect.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"i bought cyberpunk 2077 a bit more than a year after its bad launch. aside from a few crashes and bugs it ran well, but at first i've got too overwhelmed by all the different builds and systems and guns and whatnot. so i took a step back, played other games then started watching tips and tricks videos on yt about the things above. they helped me a lot to understand the old skill tree and game mechanics. a shout out to all the youtubers who helped me with their videos!  and once i understood the game better, i've got hooked. first the worldexploring and the side quests grabbed me, then the main story and lore sucked me in too. i finally recorded and finished my first playthrough with male v in may this year. and i was floored by how good my overall experience was! after a short break to play other games, at the end of the summer, i went back for a 2nd playthrough with female v before phantom liberty. and i couldn't stop playing ever since. especially since the updates started coming and they'd improved and added so much! most i really love. phantom liberty was a really good dlc too just finished my 2nd playthrough of it , and after getting the last ending of the four, i have 100ed both the main game and the dlc! my very first platinum trophy is from cp 2077! and i just got my very last trophy in the dlc too!!!  this has never ever happened to me before! so this is a very clear proof  to me at least  that cp 2077 is indeed phenomenal now and deserves a second chance and the praise for the cdpr devs not abandoning it, for putting all the effort, money, dedication and passion into correcting that mistake and giving us the game cp 2077 was, i believe, always meant to be! because despite the rocky start both the game's and my personal initial struggles, this game became one of my very favorite open world games and gaming soundtracks of all time! so yes, i agree, the devs very much deserve the credit where it's due, and they did redeem themselves in my eyes with all the hard work they'd put in since the launch. i wish more studios would learn, listen and care like this!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-19,"honestly i've played the game for few weeks after the initial launch and never experienced those bugs mentioned here... everything was nice  didn't played phantom liberty yet, but planning to do it soon..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,the lore and characters of this game is next level greatness
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-15,"i originally played cyberpunk roughly a year before the anime came out, and i loved pretty much every minute of it. i replayed it when the edgerunners update dropped patch 1.6 and then replayed it a third time with the release of phantom liberty. and i loved all of it, every playthrough was fantastic and if i could erase my memories of it to experience it again for the first time, i'd do it in a heartbeat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"great video and work, gameranx!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-16,this is one of the best games ive ever played. ive never experienced another game like this. i did almost all the missions and i only seen like 4 bugs when it didnt even matter.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-13,i was one of the few that from the beginning didn't really experience any game breaking bugs. there was a couple non important npcs t posing and stuff like that but i never took away from the story. my good experience at launch doesn't trump the widely experienced issues by everyone else but it's been nice to see the game age like fine wine and seeing the player base enjoy the game as i was able to. i am replaying currently with the new dlc and its even more amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-11,this game is a fucking masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-03,"i'm on my 3rd playthrough, this game gets better everytime."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-16,"2300 smooth talker! i see how you got so far, play your cards close to your chest. thanks for sharing"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-20,lol at the speedometer. 100 mph feels like 30.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"i cannot for the life of me get into this game, i played it for 30 minutes and could not find it interesting"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-24,i wanna get this game but its first person right . smh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-11,"i tried to like cyberpunk but i dont have time to watch 45 minutes of unskippable cut scenes every time i sit down to play. thats not a game to me, thats a movie. had to uninstall."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,is it some kind of gta? i've been out of the gaming world for 15 years... coming back now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-16,"1829 och! ye were doing so well. i'd take those eyes back to the doc's and get upgrades.only joking, i bet the excomando had good eyes, i would go back and get his body, put it in the van and dismantle it later?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,i just got this game a few days ago gonna start my playthrough tonight

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,i wanna get it but my pc cant handle it  update i bought it on my ps5
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,never played about to buy the ultimate version
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,is cyberpunk basically gta in the future?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,"there should be a rule that when leaving comments, also state your age. this is important bcs a 15 year old and a 30 year old are going to have different perceptions of what good game is. younger kids have a higher tolerance for crap. us older folk have much higher standards. reviews are useless if you don't know the agematurity of the reviewer. my two cents."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-08,i wanted to buy this but skipped when i learned it's first person.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-11,i got this game last night want to play it so bad

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,what will you guys be picking? comment 1. for corporate 2. street kid 3. nomad check out the cyber bag cdpr sent me httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vf4ngq4unk70listpllxou7gtci6s7wtfqpygbsd2kmrei4l5index5abchanneleso
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-02,cant wait to sit in the character creation screen for 3 hours trying to figure out which one im going to chose
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,this is gonna give me character creation anxiety again.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i'm going to do one of each for sure, but i'll play nomad first as it seems like the best way to start. new to the city, seeing it from the outside for the first time. not knowing my way or the people. seems fitting"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-06,i now see why its called 2077 because thats the year i'll finally decide which life path to take
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-08,i'm surprised that corporate sounds the most appealing to me. starting out at the top only to crash and burn and reduced to the streets is the more interesting arc in my view.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"three life paths, three playthroughs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,i love how in every start of any route your character is facing a mirror
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,going corpo. dead or alive ill fulfill my robocop powered fantasy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-09,the fact that 2 years later the song playing at the start is now the most heartbreaking thing in the game. is really crazy to think about.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-05,"my first 24 hours of playing the game will just be in character creation, then once i'm done i'll hate it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,nomad for the first play through. their outsider perspective fits well with my unfamiliarity with the game setting.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,cp2077 dev so you wanna be michael franklin or trevor? make your pick
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,gotta go with nomad it just seems cool to start in the desert then make it to night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-09-02,definitely gonna stare at the 3 options for hours
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-10-06,i have so much character creation ocd and cannot wait to sit for a couple hours perfecting my character  gonna be the most gangster character ever made!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i'm definitely going to make a character in all three, but it's going to be hard to pick which to start. i might choose corporate, using information against someone and getting that information, sounds amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-29,"i'll pick nomad, because of we are in the same shoes as v, we are an outsider trying to get that night city life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-05,"imagine if for corporate, street kid or nomad had their own story arcs somehow reaching the almost same ending but in a totally different way , honestly that would've been awesome"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-05,"i am going corpo, because it's the only one in which v and jackie have a preexisting friendship. so it makes what happens to jackie all the more poignant. also, there's something to be said for the story of the guy who lost everything, and fighting to get it all back."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-29,"when you start as a street kid you will have options to deal with the clandestine world of night city, when you start as a corpo i imagine you will have options to deal with the.. corpo type of people of night city xd, but starting as a nomad you will know almost nothing about the city and almost no one that lives there. i will go nomad as my first character because of that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,so nomads are basically the fast and furious of the world
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-28,"nomad feels more like me, relatable in being new to the city and living on the outskirts, the way of life resonates with me as well traveling is in my blood... otherwise street kid all the way"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-09-04,"ive gotta go street kid man. just speaks to me, love the idea of growing up in the city, then getting power in it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,lmao reading the comments now that i know how little the lifepaths matter is hilarious
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-29,"im going corporate for my first playthrough, then nomad for my second and streetkid for the third. i feel like going in this order will really give me a great perspective of cyberpunk life"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i think i would start as a nomad, as a player i'm not suppose to know how to navigate in the city which will also be the case for a nomad character. after finishing the game i would play a new game but now i know the street as a player so i'll play a street kid char because they know the street like me. then again once this 2nd playthrought is done i'll play a corpo kid, with the ng systeme i could keep my upgrade wich make sense for a corpo char because they're rich that'll explain why i have so much upgrade since the begining. on another hand i can play nomad  corpo  street since i think a corpo char won't know the street like a street kid would same thing during a 2nd playthrough, so a 3rd playthrough as a street kid will make more sense because you know the street better than your 1st and 2nd playthrough. in a 3rd hand we can say that the corpo char was a street kid then he know alot of things about the street"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"imma be corpo and roleplay as detective miller type character from the expanse a kid who came from nothing but worked his way up to the government, but then came back to his roots."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-10-24,"nomad a story of a person, who knows values of family and relationshionships, someone who had been oppresed by corporations for his entire life, but now is sick of it and will sick for justice and will eventually mature, will get supercar, upgrades, money but still keeping values. always was a good person. street kid a story of a person, who tries to survive for their entire life, has done awful and great things, always ready to be thrown into the dump and always ready to stand up for themself. corpo a story of person, who had been an psychopath for their entire life, until their fall and getting a different perspective on what a human they are."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-08-12,"definitely nomad first. i've always been a bit of a loner or outcast, so i fit that vibe easy. plus there's nothing cooler than some random nomad entering night city and becoming one of the most feared melee users samurai within it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,"nomad seems more fitting in line with a rising nobody, but i'm really tempted by corpo path"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-28,at first i thought street kid sounded cool but now i'm leaning towards nomad
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i'm going nomad, anyone else?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-28,037  its the song .. sobbing rn
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"is a shame how much people talked about how much time they would spend creating a character and the lifepath they would choose, 5 months ago. but now we know that doesnt mean nothing at all, just a diferent intro and dialogue choices that dont change anything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,will probaby choose corporate. i just sounds so interesting and could fit into a mostly hacking path.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,corporate may have a harder time getting jonny silver hand to like us say no more street kid it is
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,"i dunno, probably gonna end up with me building a stealth archer as always.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,i hate in the beginning when you see your character in the mirror and instantly regret everything
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-15,that song during the nomad drive hits different now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i'm definitely gonna play through all of these, but for my first play through i'll just roll a dice or something. you don't get to choose where you grow up so i'd like to have an organic character where i decide how i want to play based on my environment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-30,in jax tellers voice i'm going nomad!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i'm choosing street kid for my first playthrough, then corporate for my second."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-09-13,"im gonna do all 3, the question is what order"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-14,god after edgerunners that song you played in the beginning triggers ptsd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,im going with street kid  who else?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-02,im getting concerned how much time im gonna be spending on the character creation
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,imagine not having a flying car this comment was made by gang corporate
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"it doesn't matter what you pick, within 30 minutes it'll be as if it never happened anyway."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-26,023 the song
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-02,i definitely will be playing as a corporate with all my initial points into intelligence and cool.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,ill most likely be picking nomad but that may change when i find out more about the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,street kid all the way. making my way up the ladder. born in the city live in the city die in the city edit this is the most likes i've ever gotten. thx
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-10,seeing the old comments is so deppressing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-01,"im honestly gonna start with the street kid. nomad isnt that of thing for me since i hate starting off slowly and with little to no things to do. corpo sounds cool, being one of those who start off at the top and maybe turning your back on the people youve always worked with, but thats like starting with too much. street is in the middle. not too much, but not too little either"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,"for me ill go with a nomad with a quest to prove himself and make the corporations fear him specially considering he hates how the corpors treat others below them, and hell make sure theyll be the ones groveling before he coldly executes them. hell evolve from using his old car to a more modern cyber bike by honoring his tribe, but still keeping the values taught to him, his icon is more important to him since he is a big samurai fan and wears the clothes proudly, one of the few possessions he keep close, next to his cut and gun. also little cybernetics cept for the arms and eyes. feeling that he doesnt need anything else but the skills and techniques theyve learned throughout their live corpo as a person who knew the arasaki corporation. they knew how to manipulate others. but once they want something theyll take it willingly or unwillingly and night city will be theirs to rule and to make their own. definitely more of a cold blooded assassin compared to the more tactical style nomad"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,"i definitely going with nomad, my character is going to be a cross between terminator, mad max, and baraka from mortal kombat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,im probably going for corporate netrunner for my first run.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-08-17,"me waits years for cyberpunk to release, buys the game 3 months early, watches for every piece of news about it and reads the book also me when the game releases, stares at life path choice for 5 hours, can't decide between street kid and nomad"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,its so sad reading this comment section of excited gamers ready to choose their lifepath only for it to never matter
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,bro this game is going to b the best of 2020
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-03,"the answer to this is easy. whatever path the person wants. then, after their first play through, try a different one. then, do it a third time with the last one. i would make a crappy youtube influencer. that would be my answer for all games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-29,"this game seems tailor made for an evil playthrough as a corpo, where you embrace the dark side of the city, instead of freeing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-09,im will chose corp just to have the i am the manager feeling
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-29,"yeah, corpo is definitely me. although, unlike everyone else, im going to at least try to be a likable corpo in night city. i dont know if thats possible, but ill try. after all, some corpos are worse than others. i may actually side with militech if i get fucked over by arasaka, which, lets be honest, will most likely happen. hell, if johnny silverhand  morgan blackhand worked with them, they might not be all that bad. another way i could earn night citys respect is side with the voodoo boys to take down netwatch. trust me, go watch kazuliskis video lore on netwatch,  youll understand why. i know this sounds like wishful thinking, but hey, id much rather be a likable rich person than a selfish, elitist, stereotypical snob any day. i always loved likable rich characters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"nomad is the way to go... that will be the op builds... you'll see, lol..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-29,"i would like my character to develop an intimate, loving relationship with meredith stout... so corpo it is!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-30,"genuinely, this is the first game that i have been properly excited for in a really long time"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-10,"i hope we get to meet ciri, since she said in witcher 3 that she has been to world with flyings ships and people having metals in their head."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-23,"aged like milk, the only good thing about cyberpunk are the mods."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,"i will go corporate on my first playthrough the reason is simple corporations in this game universe rules the world and i am pretty sure the late game will have a few big corporations as either the enemy or at least as an interested party. but street kid sounds awesome too, i mean the allure of climbing up in the world from the very bottom is really tempting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-28,"explains the corpo life style, shows the streetkid life style, not confusing at all..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,street is gonna be the one for me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-25,200 ..... now im feeling sad hearing that song after watching the series
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-08-03,tfw the game still isn't out and everyone's already deciding what character they'll take
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-01,"my 1st character will be my attempt at albert wesker a corpo male, modded to the point of being so op that he can dodge bullets ala matrix and punch all the way through people. also glowing eyes behind agent style sunglasses and a suit is a badass look."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,im choosing corporate.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-30,i've never liked city life so being a nomad sounds pretty good to me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,like how he showed street kid start during the corpo description
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-22,025 omg that radio
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-28,nomad max for me. so far seems like the life path i want to play.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-30,"definitely going nomad. love biker stuff, so when it starts and hes wearing the biker cut and his taking his patch off that confirms it. cant wait to begin, that biker cut wont come off and hopefully i can keep the patch"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-08-22,this is why i can't record gameplay lmao. i have to spend 2 hours in character creation getting more anxious by every passing second because i'm not actually in the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,i went with corpo and do not regret it one bit. the corpo life path reminds me of a more extreme version of my real life job.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-10-16,me an intellectual why not all ?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-22,hearing that song at the start after watching edgerunners hurts.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-10-24,"so the most important thing to me here from a storytelling pov is that you can start with one life path and transition between them depending on decisions, etc. i'm really intrigued by the idea of starting a corpo life path and then becoming a streetkid or nomad and how that might affect the progression."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-17,michael  corpo franklin  street kid trevor  nomad
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-06,it's already said in the demo mission only the corp gets what it wants.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-08-17,"they all look so good! i definitely think i'm going to agonize during the character creation screen. though i think it will ultimately be corporate, nomad, street kid"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,never been so early to an upload before
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-11,damn that song at the start of the video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-28,"kinda hoping that we get a future update with more life path starts , such as maybe one where you start off as a joy toy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,"the nomad intro is hands down the best intro to all backgrounds, and maybe one of the sickest intros to any game i've ever played"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"my first play though was as nomad, just tried corpo , felt off, and i have to belive jackie ia snother perosn all of a sudden, i would ratherj just stick to nomad, arriving to a big city with no epxlnanation , is mesmerising, i'll never forget the feeling, its such a beuaitfully made game. and starting as a nomad you start for the bottom naturally, and get op really quickly, cos you gotta grind, you gotta be smart, and there is so much lore that is fine just remaining a mystery but the fact that uts there and you can kill it, interact with it, pass it by, is beautiful"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-09-24,my time on the character creation screen will be longer than my time actually playing the game smh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-06-27,nomad for sure.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-07-02,"corpo for me, seems like an interesting story of someone who had everything then lose it all trying to survive in a world filled with street gangs and having to learn new ways to deal with it other then doing it the corpo way"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,sad that they barely matter in the end.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-14,"coming from someone who was inspired by edgerunners to purchase this game, i might be the only one who wants to start from the streets like david and be most popular merc in town. f corpos and i aint no hillbilly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-10,"this game has come a long way, i can appreciate that npr even after what happened can dedicate themselves to fix this game and possibly making what people wanted into a reality. this game has a great story line, great characters, and overall fun gameplay, glitches got in the way yes but it still came a long way, if only npr put more time and less broken promises. overall, this game has to be one of my most favorite games of all time including story and mayhem, highly recommend to try it atleast, this game wasn't overhated before but it is now. give it a chance and see how you like it, there's always a refund button."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-11,this is the only gameplay of yours that i haven't watched along with when you upload it. because i finally got my hands on a ps4 and bought this as one of my first games. granted it wasn't perfect but i enjoyed the game. it was kinda weird being able to play a game along with when you were putting up your walkthrough . thanks a lot for giving me a way to experience all these amazing games before man
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-09,"you'd never have someone sneak up on you, you'd smell them before they got there best line iv heard in a while had me rolling."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-09,2015 i did found your channel and since then your channel is being my netflix ps4

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-11,homie picked up a buttplug and said hey it looks like a doorknob
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-29,it's always great to see you play walkthroughs. i found your channel when you first started recording for resident evil operation raccoon city. i was trying to see if it was a great game before i bought it and i ran into your channel and kept watching your walkthroughs after that.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-09,nobody brad if he wanted to go slow i could've drove
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,bro i have been playing since launch and had no idea that sleeping is actually useful
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,i didn't know sleep gave you extra stuff cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-11,"don't just sleep, shower also. if you have the corpo plaza apt, you can also have a coffee or tea for more buffs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-17,they made so many positive strides with the game honestly its an awesome
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-12,im 30 hours in and still have no idea what tf im doing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-11,cyberpunk 2077 is one of those games where it makes me stop and think about the quests that i have done and decisions i have made
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,dont neglect the food for extra boost!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,"toughest fister in night city..um, phrasing..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,to call it a rocky launch is.... an understatement. still love this game to death now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,that old peek tree is a throwback.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,"like all things in life, start hard. words to live by"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"as of 2.0, tech is no longer required for crafting, so if your build doesnt need it, you can ignore it now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-04,"its difficult for new, immersive players like me to get into the grindy, explorative aspect of cyberpunk, since i take stories very seriously, and starting a game by literally telling me your character is dying and has a few weeks to live at most puts a state of urgency to finish the main story in my head."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-18,"people always think of netrunner, melee build, gunslinger but tech are for techies basically the engineers of cyberpunk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,"y'know, when i first heard about it, i was pretty hyped. then it released and ended up never buying it, but now that i'm seeing this i might actually think about getting it sometime. thanks for the tips as well!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-08,literally haven slept since misty made me sleep after first act. im sittin here mad as shit lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-18,"300 hours in the game and haven't played story through even once. there is just so much to explore and city has so many secrets, details and interactions. if you don't pay attention to your surroundings you really are missing a lot. love this game to bits!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-11,"these tips are actually goated as a player that just copped the game. its definitely densely packed, so this definitely helps"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-08,"as a player since launch, i agree with everything here. my friend started playing at launch too and had no idea he could upgrade his gear. also i had no idea sleeping gave xp boost, i'll keep this in mind when i restart."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"just learned like a few days ago, on xbox y brings out equipped gun, double tap y to holster. double tap y when revealing weapon and youll do a lil inspection animation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-10,i just wish levelling wasnt a pain after 3 max level saves the best way i find is just to run every single gig in nc and some scanners
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,"i played version 1.0 and loved it. i recently came back to play phantom liberty and it feels like a new game, and i love it even more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,game reviews should list the build on review and only affect that version
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,i just beat the game a week ago for the first time. so good! had a blast struggling with the mechanics at the start and eventually becoming an op sandevistan speedster. never seen a video game map as alive as night city.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-11,"never ever neglect those crafting techs. some iconic weapons can't be crafted without it, and others will never make it to legendary rarity without it. some of those are the best or most unique weapons in the game as well, so don't skimp out on that, but feel free to take a little bit of time to get there once you figure out how many points the game will limit you to. planning your build is a good thing, and makes a frustrating experience into a great one when your character can actually work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,just finished my first playthrough and i'm so glad i waited until now to play it. the game was fantastic. thanks for all of these tips.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,i've made 6 different characters and have completed at least a dozen play throughs and i can definitely say that that early game ain't so bad. i've played a lot of single player rpgs and this one has a pretty digestible intro. no cap i can get a new character up to strcrd 15 and level 15 within the first five hours of playing. and i'm not using any glitches or hacks or mods. just a vanilla playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-13,"the shadows are still goofy af, using mantis blades makes me look like the rake"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,"im so glad they did away with the crafting perks. it was ridiculous we had to invest so many points just to craft over half the iconics in the game. version 2.0 is amazing, now we can just craft anything soon as we have the parts."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-03,i figured all these tips oit after my first playthrough. i'm glad i found this short that explains it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-20,and if you get all the gigs and jobs done before progressing the story you can pretty much have a good stat for every choice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-26,"i still haven't completed hanako's killing smasher but i'm almost completing side gigs, it's kinda cool to have becca's shotgun because i killed those three strong officers after completing some other job"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-09,don't play until the dlc because cdpr is changing alot about the game when it drops
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"i watched your video and immediatly changed the difficulty, thanks my dude!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,"i love that sleep buff! like, you retain a lot more information if you sleep well irl too. and yeah, do side stories when they become available. the story is paced like crap if you just do the mandatory parts. the second act, you sneeze and it's over. except for ncpd missions. don't be a narc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,started playing 3 days ago. i already have 5 hours and just finished the intro. i got waaaay too distracted  so far im loving it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,"just about to start for the first time any advice, tips, recommendations?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-13,i've been a fan of cyberpink 2077 ever since the first gameplay reveal trailer. and it's really nice to see people play it after all rhe updates.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-10,i didn't knew you could have apartments or sleep. i'm gonna return to night city as soon as phantom liberty comes out.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-28,"dude i love this content, i preordered cyberpunk, loved it with all its flaws and never gave up on it, i've played thru multiple times, and i never knew about sleep, thanks bro i learn a lot about this game from you!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,did they redo very hard?? because i beat my first playthrough on very hard in the first 4 months and it never balanced out. i was a full int build net runner with all legendary quick hacks and the enemies were still shrugging off suicides and laughing at my grenades lmao. you don't know fear until a random valentino shoots himself in the head with a heavy revolver and then just looks at you like did you think this would stop me?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-10,"i fully agree with tech, not only can you craft items, but with the combat side, you can upgrade the damage that you can do with tech weapons, damage with grenades, and damage against all robotic enemies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-29,i would do anything to experience my first playthrough again. best game ever!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,"still makes me laugh dude. loaded up the game for the first time in a long time, first cut scene had t posing characters. love it man"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-04,the sleeping strat is pretty good i remember actually sleeping and i ended up max level before i even finished the story lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-10,i played on launch and can attest it had tons of bugs and low performance but i still played it to the end and enjoyed it. since then i have replayed it twice and i am now playing it through a 4th time in the newest patch to have such a fun story game with improved mechanics and performance it truly is amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-19,"i've learned so many things while watching these shorts. i do sleep but rarely and as for eating the food, i don't. i will now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-18,i just started playing it for the first time . im in love with this game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,early game is brutal on the hardest difficulty but it is so satisfying when you get the body perks with gorilla arms and beat the hell out of all of the npcs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-28,additionally when in apartments that u can buy shower gives bonus to health regen and coffetea gives bonus to stamina regen
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-03,"ive found that very hard is the most fun game difficulty for me, being a regular joe off the street on that game difficulty feels real, and you go from being 2 shot by enemies and having to complete gigs to wiping the floor with everyone by the end of the game. it forces you to be creative in the beginning til you can afford your first few cyberware upgrades"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,not gonna lie i played like i was living. i picked nomad because thats the path i identified with and built a shooter that could fight well enough to accomplish the mission beat the brat and dumped everything else into crafting and hacking. i sunk so many hours into cyberpunk when it was at its worst. i'm genuinely excited to start a new save as a street kid and go meet my nomad wifey all over again. yes i'm down horrendous for panam. like imagine down bad and multiply it by 100 then bury the casket and that's not even close.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-14,even after 3 years and over 1k hours im still learning a thing or two from these videos
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-23,man ive been getting so many videos in my feed and i rly want it now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"another tip i found is in some of the higher end apartments, you can use the coffee machine to get a 1hr stamina and regen boost for free, ignoring the apartment cost"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-25,i played first time this game after phantom liberty release and this game is massive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-31,fun fact  you are the person that got me into cyberpunk and now cuz of you i have the most op build guns cars etc. thanks love your vids
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-18,"planning to get it tmr in fact, its got to a good point and i feel its worth the money"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-11,crafting legendary quickhacks batmoss legacy isnt tied to tech but ingelligence...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-22,"tech has been pretty useful so far. sure i don't use the tree that effects tech weapons and i dropped the projectile system for mantis blades when i discovered my love of knives, but those boosts to cyberware is so good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-04,i started 2 weeks ago and am on my 2nd playthrough. love this game. it's all i play now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,"tech is still crazy powerful in 2.2. ive got a tech based chrome compressor build who has rediculous amounts of cyberware even without the top tier edgerunner perk. massive amounts of armour, fast healing, lots of grenades, minimal cyberware recharge time. im basically judge dread crossed with robocop and also i have lightning powers. even if you dont go hard on tech you should invest a little bit into it to get good cyberware"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,now tech is a seriously important skill tree if you are a chrome jockey
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-14,"when i got my first fully specced out pc build in arguably one of the hardest time to build a pc, i was excited to play cyberpunk with my 3070 graphics card. sadly, it was a disastrous launch. i ended up waiting 4 years and now im addicted to the game. they updated the game and runs so beautifully. still a lot of performance issues but at the end of the day, this game is fantastic"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-13,as someone who religiously stealth through monster hunt as soon as the epilogue is over i l can say this game is brutal early on
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-04,omg i never even thought about sleep giving an xp buff. i haven't slept at all manually im over 300 hours
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-01,"this was a great video, thanks for the advice."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-26,just started my first play through recently and ive been loving it. had a few crashes but im on a ps4 so its to be expected honestly. runs pretty damn well most of the time. im just sad i dont get the 2.0 update or phantom liberty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,"a rocky launch is a bit of an understatement. i played it on first release and holy shit. the glitches made it miserable, but fun at the same time because you be fighting someone and then theres that random npc or enemy just tweaking out in the corner"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-07,"ive started playing over the past few days quite often, now while i do notice lag spikes and bugs sometimes its not as bad as it used to be"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,i am playing it right now on pc i thought all the glitch and bug are gone but i noticed lot of glitches sometimes i had to restart but stil gonna complete the whole game this is damn good man
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,"just started my 2nd playthrough and ive still noticed a few glitches, but nothing that ruins the game. i love this game and story"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-23,oh and for those chooms who are looking at this. you can check for police scanner locations by going to custom in the map section. really helps finding blue prints or just to grind to lv50 as fast as possible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-17,"i have done all of that in the last month after having the game since 3 years ago in the desk, two more trophies for the platinum an absolute masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,just started cyberpunk these tips is helpful
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey i just wanted to say something thank you this video was really helpful to me seeing it was one of the best things that happened at the beginning of my first play trough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,thats such a cool addition that sleep enhances your skills
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-05,"first of all, despite the fact that v is a bit too fast, the ergonomics of the gunfight are more or less fps acceptable, the fov, animations, sway, aiming and everything that plays a major role in a fps shooter fits well with this game. i have problems playing starfield now due to the exactly same fact, starfield is not ergonomic when it comes to gunplay, it's stiff and causes nausea. cyberpunk fits much more and sometimes the gunplay reminds me of a bf4, guns are properly modeled, have been correctly placed in front of the camera at the exact angle they should be, the render feels very natural, both of them. the way that most fps games render guns is by rendering the background everything except the gun and then pasting another render with just your arms and a weapon on top of it, that's why sometimes in some games you can see your weapon clipping through a wall and sometimes you can't. problems raises when we are asked to place the rendered weapon on top of a game world, if both renders have different aligments, whether it's caused by fov or bad dev work means the same, the game feels unnatural, stiff as fuck and causes nausea."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-18,"every time i started playing the game, i always finished with sleeping, and then saving the game. and whenever it was possible between missions, every time it was night time i went to sleep. leveling up was truly a breeze"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"i think this is the only game i have played since chrono trigger where level progression matches the story and side quests progression this well. theres tons to do, no real fluff and no need to grind levels"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,i got the game two days ago and i have been loving it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,thank you dude!! i just got it today!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,thanks i needed this!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-04,ima be honest i played cyberpunk when it first came out one last gen and even with all of its bugs and mid graphics i absolutely loved it and had a great time i cant wait to replay it on my pc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-25,i didnt buy this game at launch since i heard about the rocky launch but recently got it and have been enjoying it tons
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-13,most important go to the pacifica roller coaster before double life mission if you wanna complete every mission cuz that mission will be available after doing this quest.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-20,what. i need sleep? alright trying that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-05,"as a 2077 vet, we do love you"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-24,i remember when i was playing on launch week and i had advice to do the kasarda play though which is ignore the main plot in favour of the side quests and advance the main plot just far enough to get more side quests.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-17,"bro, your broll for don't ignore tech is ancient. the skill tree hasn't looked like that in a while."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-17,"been a big fan of the game since launch i was incredibly lucky and only got bad bugs a few times, even if the missions broke and i had to reload an old save its always fun to just walk around and explore the beautifully made nc and have 750 hours in the game, and had no idea sleeping actually did anything other than advance time, god damn lmao"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,thanks for the tips!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-14,gorilla arms and sandevistan with camo tech is probably my favorite combo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-03,"i didn't know about the sleep thing, but that makes sense."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-02,"i played on pc at launch and had 2 bugs in 2 full playthroughs. the one where panam gets stuck in the drivers seat, and one physics bug where i slid down a stair rail. it was fine for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-10,"sleep is one of the few things i've done per playthrough  i've done a few by this point.... also the extra apartments does help so much for that option now since u have other places to go to sleep. outside the necessary reasons, who goes all the way up that megabuilding to sleep"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-16,"the glitches made it funnier for me at least, ive never really minded them"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,you should also mention that the sidequests impact the main story and your decisions will do so too.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-26,"just got it, seems to be pretty good so far"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-03,very useful just started and im a bit lost!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-09,"rewatching the trailer three years later and all i have to say is kudos to the animators, directors, storyboard and concept artists of this trailer. 4 minutes of insanely high quality animated cinema"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-30,"i do like the changes to this scene in the actual game, poor tbug doesn't make it to that scene, she took a big l for the team, sounds like she got hit with synapse burnout. i like that version of the story better because it leaves tbug as an ally instead of someone who turns against you when you turn in the chip. it makes the entire mission more heart wrenching, because not only do you lose jackie, you also lose tbug."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2019-06-09,for those who ask why keanu is in the game he is the one.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-12,i wish this was how that cutscene actually played out

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-11,"see you in the major leagues, jack"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,why did the rocker get kicked out of his apartment? he wasn't chipping in.  jackie jokes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-09,"116 im stunned by the level of detail on this. his neck and eyes literally tickle just when v moves to the bath, a very subtle sign of doubt just before closing his eyes saying gotcha."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,full video linked on my channel! thank you for watching!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,another thing to note is that you can reset attributes as well so you can get a onetime overhaul of your entire character without going all the way to the beginning
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,i have like hundread of thousands worth of cyber ware and weapons no way im resetting
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"guys you have save files, why are you acting like restarting is wiping out your previous save file"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"i've played on and off since last year, but i only have about 22 hours in. practically just through the first chunk of the storyline. i feel like i'm safe to continue this character and get the full new experience as intended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-01,"every time i replay this game and pick it back up i get convinced its one of the best games of all time right up until you hit a brain dance sequence. like that has to be the worst mechanic ever created in any videogame ever. worse than the watchers in halo 4, or the stealth missions in spiderman ps4, or even the car sections in mass effect 1. they make me want to drop the game entirely from how tedious they are."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"i recommend restarting. i've had it since release and on my 4th play through. with the updates. with 2.11 update, this has been my best play through. currently at 84 hours 50 cred 50 level. all tier 5 cyberware. full net runner build and sandy build. still plenty left to do. not been into a game this much since rdr2"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,"yep, i restarted. my last save was 2022 and i just got my new series s. bought phantom liberty and i am really impressed with the new features and mechanics. this game has grown into an absolute beast and i reckon there's more to come yet"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,"i agree. or, starting from the phantom liberty start. if you did all of the ncpd  gig events, you're not going to be able to get the cyberware shards you need to max your cyberware capacity. trust me, don't build your old max character out, just choose either a new start or phantom liberty. old characters are capped at what they're able to do at least, if you already did everything"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,"lol, i am not restarting my character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i've played through enough times to have had all but one of the endings, but i may well give it another go if it's that different from 1.6."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"had a save from xbox one when i upgraded to series x,yea i started a fresh char the 2.0 update was very different."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,bro took youtube shorts to a whole new level
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,just as soon as i finish up with my old character.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"what i did was go through the prologue do all of the available content before the big heist do not spend any skill points or attribute points and then when the main game starts after you get johnny you should be ablut level 16 with the same amount of attribute and perk points and save there so you can just reload that save whenever you wanna restart sure it limits your character customisation to the sex background and certain cosmetic options but you get to skup the prologue, i did this twice once as a male v and female v, you dont have to do that but it gives yah two options of sex"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-19,was already gonna restart my character. my v has died on that spaceship... she has entered a coma and will now be reliving her memories thry the eyes of my 2nd v inwill create
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,"ok, i would choose the thug path as my main save file and replay all the to her paths just to see thendiffeence in story mode but after that, i would only stick to my main save, one reason to restart is to experience the difference in story mode paths that you are given"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,im on my 9th playthrough lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,ok will do
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,im on file number 4 now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,i havent played since 2021 sonstarted a new one
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,that's funny i just stated a new one today.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,i kept my guy and gal but started a new guy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,thats annoying asf bc ive been grinding for a whole week just to restart my whole character
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,i would if ac mirage wouldnt come out in 2 days
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,how about them adding new game plus thry should have already done that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,i wish they made it like elden ring. once you finish the game you can start with everything you obtained doing your play through and use it from the beginning of the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,what if i'm halfway through a playthrough? haven't bought phantom liberty yet but i am this weekend
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,uhhh i have 109hrs im not restarting
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,it took me 8 min to watch a patch notes video and about 15 to get used to everything after beating it 3 years ago. i'm good on that restarting nonsense.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,is it me or is it easier to make money now. i always felt broke before now fixers pay 10 to 20k for a job
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-16,"i made a new game after playing it 3 times previously. i was excited to play since there were new updates. so i begin a new game and i'm enjoying it like always. however, i'm a bit miffed that ps4 still doesn't have the new content. my latest update is at 1.61. so no new content for me. why?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"is there an option to create a new character instead of resetting? like gta? ive never played just curious, if there isnt they should add one knowing the state they put they game out in originally, shouldnt punish your og players who kept you afloat by not letting them in on all the new goodies without having to delete the character theyve had hundreds or thousands of hours on lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,what is that jacket?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,restart the beginning the game for what? wasting time with same experience. just continue your char and go to dogtown... go now...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"ive given this game multiple chances and its struck out every time. i tolerate halos bs due to nostalgia and loving the pro scene. cyberpunk has neither of those for damn near anyone. i appreciate cdpr for taking the time and getting the ship back on course, but im not starting a new character when im already 80 hours in on my first one. ridiculous."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-04,"dont crawl back to that game fellas, you know better"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,is patch 2.21 the end or do you think more cyberpunk 2077 updates are coming?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,would be funny if they stop the patches at 2.77
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"all i want is metal arms bro, half the charaters have them. want me my metal arms edit i know there is mods, i'm on console."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"honestly surprised cdpr doesn't change their priorities and invest in a new dlc for cyberpunk, considering the player count has been so large and consistent 4 years after release, even growing now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i hope cyberpunk doesn't stop here, it's a world with so much potential, that it feels like such a waste to just simply end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"the end of the 2.2 announcement, they told us in corpo speak that there are more updates coming. the company has two new ceo's that are all in with the cyberpunk brand, and that is what changed and why we have new updates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,patch notes for an update that breaks all mods be like 5 peanuts were added in night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,man i just want a freaking flashlight or night vision eyeballs or something to help us see better in the dark
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"its been long enough, most of my mods are updated and working again, time to play cyberpunk again. new cyberpunk update!!! flips desk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,still no new clothes and no metal arms? i really don't understand why npcs have more cosmetic options than the player character. it's usually the other way around ...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"rtx 3080 owner here. i'm fairly impressed with the new transformer model for dlss. it looks noticeably sharper and more stable in motion and in other edge cases. you can run it as low as ultra perf upscaling to 1440p and, while it's clearly not native 1440p, it resolves the image like a champ and is much more stable in motion. it allows for path tracing at 60 fps on this card, incredible. it feels like a free upgrade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"from watching podcasts and interviews from cdpr, i could tell how passionate they are about this game. they won't let it die at least until the sequel arrives. more updates will come just trust me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"any console users viewing this, to sum up the video, this patch is more for pc's i think i started a war"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,i hate that i decided to install a bunch of mods last night just for them to push an update this morning...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i just want a customization upgrade especially for visible cyberware and things like that , i want a metal arm or two or to have different body types"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,gimme 3rd person and cooler body modifications
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"so for anyone on pc  steam, set the game to only update on play, then go to your cyberpunk steam folder and create a shortcut for the launcher and voila the game wont update when you start it directly from the launcher. saved my current modded playthrough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i have a feeling nvidia had a helping hand with these updates. cp2077 has been one of their demos, and is probably one of the best games to really help show off the tech."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i'm playing this game for the first time, in vr with a ps5 controller. i'm blown away, sucked into this game and its lore to a depth i haven't experienced. everywhere i go i spend as much time looking around and feeling truly immersed in night city as i do anything else. i hope this helps rather than breaks the luke ross mod, i deal with some ghosting on my 4070 even after finding optimal setting for my setup. fingers crossed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,028 lowwww taper faddeee
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,this game deserves more expansions tbh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i cant lie, i have a 4070 and i cant see a difference. my fps did decrease by a decent amount though, im getting about 1520 fps less... so it only really hurts me"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,300 i refuse to say theres a difference i dont see it on any of them
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,all i want is 3rd person. i will play it from the beginning like it's a new game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i hope one day they add mod support for consoles. that would extend the life of the game on console so much, without them needing to make more dlc's! although, i wouldn't say no to more dlc's either!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,nvidia probably had some influence for cdpr to get it in.. because cyberpunk is a really good game to show off new gpu tech with.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,i literally just updated all my mods from the last one....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,if this somehow leads to a second dlc i swear to god xd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,and out of nowhere they announce a second dlc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,thank you for the great comparison footage between dlss 43.8. great work! i notice the skin looks much better as well
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-27,051 so basically this update is for pc players
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,cyberpunk 2077 still got lots of room to grow.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,the game is gonna weigh 2tb by the end of the year.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,thank you for always informing us! i hope you have a wonderful day!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,smart business move. they're making sure this game has a fresh facelift for new series of gpus. what they should be doing is giving us official mod tools.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,everytime i turn back on my ps5 cyberpunk has a update love this
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,the update just came out a couple minutes ago and you already posted a video on it?!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"yo wat, please don't break my mods. d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"mate how many times more i'll have to download the game again, install it, update it, complete it and delete again saying  'this is it, the last time, all side quest's compeleted, i have finally let panam see the better off me.....'"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,brother really needed to his bag with this one. i respect it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"as an amd card owner, and a person playing modded this update just sucks atm. the big main fearure is nvidia only and now my mods will be broken if i update"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,just when i just got my mods to where i want it. lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i am loving cyberpunk 2077. the updates are icing on the cake. like no mans sky before it, cyberpunk are committed to improving their existing games and their legacy as the best storied rpgs out there. bethesda, move aside, you sold players garbage in fallout and even skyrim. when you updated skyrim you made us pay for it again. not so cdpr. i always assume games rushed out by suits when developers say the product isnt ready is the norm, so i wait a while before purchasing the game. i know by then that the major issues will have been fixed. i bought cyberpunk in 2024 four years after release and i am not disappointed. for bethesda morrowind was their masterpiece, the original morrowind. oblivion was good but there were too many hints as to where to go. skyrim was good but charging players for updates was a big mistake. todd howard is now a corpo suit and not a developer and i never believe a word that comes out of his mouth. the less said about ubisoft, the better though."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,the patches are just literally adding stuff that should've been at the beginning of the game. i'm not complaining though
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i am playing the game on my 4070 ti and while the card is perfectly able to render the game with path tracing enabled at a high frame rate at 1440p through dlss, i always went back to psycho rt because pt made the faces of npcs blurry and a bit mushy in motion because of small artifacts. rt just looked cleaner than pt. i am baffled that the new transformer model seems to negate that effect. so i can finally enjoy the benefits of pt without drawbacks. i have not checked my fps yet but the change isn't noticeble so far i'm using gsync."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"thanks for always providing quality updates on games like cyber punk, juice! honestly go out of my way to either wait for or watch your breakdowns over ign and other content creators. you do a great job man"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,great now i have to update my mods againsigh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,im glad you mentioned that that was one of the first things i noticed i dropped down to dlss performance on my 4090 and it almost looks like the old dlss quality its quite impressive and with doing that. you also gain a nice chunk of fps without it hurting my eyes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,noooo my mods
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"306 imagine having pc crashing issues, you watching this video then its just stops and youre waiting for your pc to crash just for it to be just the editing. couldnt be me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,welp! there goes my mod collection i installed last week...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i didn't know there was an update until this morning. so of course, my mods are borked, even after core mod updates. thanks, cdpr! the graphics update won't affect me since i'm using a radeon card maybe once the 9000 series is out they might give us some love, too"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i like that they keep coming back to keep fixing bugs, they still need to fix some of the car spawning issue with some of them"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"im just so happy its been supported this long, ive enjoyed the game at launch and ive been reaping the bonuses from the devs ever since bravo cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"dear gaming gods, please let one of the future updates include a third person perspective."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,the reflections with ray reconstruction actually look insane now. used to be a blurry mess but now it looks crisp and clear!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i'm on ps5, love the game, but i would love a fov slider. i get sick when moving at full speed. next update? lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"its because the new model doesnt use the optical flow chip, but the old one did. that should cost less on the new hardware but more on old hardware because its using your tensor cores to do the generation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,there goes my mods again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,im so happy that im either too old or too blind to notice any of these visual differences.. my wallet is thankful
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"if we keep getting updates, does that mean there is room for another dlc? or am i just way too wishful?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"as development cycles are now multiyear projects. keeping a released game uptodate is a great way to keep it relevant and generating revenue between releases. a studio like virtuous games could add content, fix bugs and expand the game to keep old players engaged and raise interest for new players."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,fsr 3 is still bad broken
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"030 sitting in my room, hugging my gtx 960 blower 2gb finally, our time has come"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"so, why using ugly dlls if you have 4070ti4080  4090 ? moreover why using it on 5000 series? they run perfectly well on ultra on a native 2k 4k monitors. on other hand this patch is useless for amd users or weaker gpu's. i have rx6900xt, stopped auto update, no way i'm gonna reinstall over 200 mods..... again...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,another one!! yes!!! bring it on!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,i'm on rtx 3060 ti can't afford a 4 series or 5 series lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,for photo mode it'll be nice to have more poses that can have the cyberware on the arms be activated so far it's only i know kung fu and that pose just sucks with the arms activated or not
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,027 massive?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,not another update sounds like a funny movie
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,really wish theyd add bethesda style mod acc for consoles.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i've been a day one cyberpunk fan, and i'm so excited to see it continue to get updates. i really hope in the future. they will make a use for all the brain dances that don't work. new companions, and a way for them to help on missions or go out on date's. and for mods on console. if we can get that, then i can't think of anything else, cyberpunk needs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,cd red is absolutely cooking
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"getting mod support, specifically to console would make me feral i need it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,cdprbethesda......
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"i wish this was the game i played when it first came out. theres so much new content, but i cant get myself to play through the story again"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,yet still no ng plus etf
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,"im all for these continued updates, its great to see cdpr not abandon this game despite its arguably finished state. this game has come so far since launch its honestly amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,might be an unpopular opinion im annoyed that they release massive updates years after release. i played the game a couple times and beat the dlc a year ago. i feel annoyed that when im long done the game theres improvements that come out when they shouldve already been there to begin with or at least close to when the game was released. maybe a couple years from now ill come back and be happy with the changes but i cant help but feel like this wouldve been nice the first time i played through it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-27,i waited 3 years ..and now i  that game ! very nice ..i needed that in 2025
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,great my mods not working
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"it's actually interesting about update size, as it is different for almost everyone, there are cases of 12gb, 8gb, 6gb, and 4,7gb updates being downloaded on steam"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,i still want mod support for console. sdpr mods
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"most importantly, this patch saved my playthrough, because i had a bug where the xbd dealer wasn't appearing in disasterpiece, and when i loaded it up yesterday, he was there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i didn't realize the game got updated, but i did notice it was randomly running smoother. i assumed it was because i finally got my overclock dialed in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"for anyone who wants a more in depth explaination about dlss 4 and why it may cost more frames, why it is more detailed and how its able to trickle down to the older cards. digital foundries has a very good interview with bryan cantanzaro. he is vice president of applied deeplearning at nvidia. this fancy title basically means he oversees any and all ai and deep learning related things they have done. dlss, raytracing, framegen etc. he explains in everyday terms how everything works and what their philosophy is surround it all. it's a long video but its definitely worth a watch. it makes you much more appreciative of the work they do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"yah i was mad when this update came out at first cuz all the mods broke, but..... man this new visual improvement was worth the pain of updating the mods"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,the day i finally play cyberpunk is going to be insane
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"cyberpunk is going to be the game they keep using to test new lighting and frame features i would assume, makes sense. its a beautiful game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,it's funny how many people really don't understand how to gauge their performance. fps is not the only factor. excellent video.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,i really hope they keep adding more updates with more bug fixes and little new things. make the game as perfect as possible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,great video.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,i'm still holding onto the hope the devs hear my prayers and give us a second arm cyberware slot
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"got so excited when i saw how big the update was on my ps5, dont mind the bug fixes at all ofc but felt a little catfished lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"sucks this update screwed up my modded game. can't launch the game with mods anymore without it flatlining, yet i can play it fine without mods."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"the new upscaler model in dlss 4.0 is heavier to run, but the graphical improvements are considerable, meaning the update is not to improve performance but to significantly improve the quality of upscaling, the frame generation component in dlss 4.0, on the other hand, is designed to improve performance, mainly by reducing vram usage by using a different technique for frame generation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,i recently played my first play through and im actually enjoying the world. i really appreciate these past two huge updates
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,i appreciate that cdpr still polishes up and improves their game. it shows they really care about their product even given its state at which it was released back then.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"the new dlss is a nice upgrade that gives me a cleaner image that once you see it, you can't go back to the cnn model. i've only tried dlss set to quality, but after this video i'm going to experiment with balanced and performance on my 4070 ti super."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"for the people who want to know how to get the sidequest for this gun when you start the mission ive seen that face before before you take over the twins identities you have to hide in the back of their car to hijack it and can eavesdrop on their conversation, just keep listening and wait for them to mention slider and a file called blind  dead before taking over the car, after getting out of the car you can upload the data from aurores body and that will lead you to the sidequest called voodoo treasure thats how you normally get the gun."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,i feel like cdpr is now just testing features and checking how they're received so they can pump all of them in orion too at release. let's hope! they claimed it will be the 'ultimate' cyberpunk experience after all

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"pretty sure all of cyberpunk2077 developers are rpgstorytellingworldbuildingwriting fanatics it is truly admirable how such little details of well written and short dialogue shards are scattered through night city in the most hidden, forgetable, unsuspecting places. just waiting for someone to take a peek on some random ass garage in middle of nowhere and yet, if not for channels like sam bram, i would never know who those shards are tied to, and where i might have encountered them"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,239 could this possibly be a soma reference as the scientists in that also upload their mind onto an ark to be launched into space

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,"scorch has become my favourite weapon now, even if i dont use it in a fight i usually finish off incapacitated enemies with it. it feels like the best place to use it would be in the black sapphires gambling area, if there was a fight there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,just started playing cyberpunk this last week and i have to say your content is by far the most enjoyable i hope they make more content for you to make videos on

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,love these cyberpunk deep dives. i've been getting into the tiein comics over the holidays and i've been curious if there are any hidden connections between them and the games. maybe some future content?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,2313 just a reminder that the esa used the mass driver at their tycho colony on luna to drop a two ton rock on colorado springs during the first orbital war

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,the second site reminds me of the plot of soma

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,"1024 fun fact! i dont know if thats also the case in the other dubs of the game, but in the german dub, these two and other characters in various gigs were voiced by popular streamers! gottfrid and frederick were voiced by handofblood and gronkh i think"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,"i think the arc uploading to space thing could be a soma reference, now that's a macabre game plot"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-18,"im incredibly grateful that cdpr decided to continue supporting the game despite previously saying otherwise. 2.2 was most certainly a welcome surprise. not to sound greedy but cdpr should focus a some attention towards creating more content for this game. now, im in no way saying it should be phantom liberty tier content, but it would be a very welcomed addition to us all if they dropped a smallerscaled dlc such as a casino heist story for instance along with new gigs and ncpd scanners. maybe even the addition of radiant quests. ive been gaming since the 90s and i can confidently say that cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time and one of the best games ever developed. despite the early hurdles it overall proved to be a resounding success and i find it baffling that the team has decided to produce only one, single dlc and more or less shelve the game. a game this great deserves a at least one more addition. cdpr exhausted a commendable level of time, energy and finances improving and polishing this game that it stands today as very technically impressive alongside its overall dynamics that entrance the player in such a unique way that it stands leagues above most other titles within a similar genre. i really do think it would serve everyones interests in dedicating a small yet effective team of devs towards producing reasonablysized dlc products for 2077 while the rest continue focusing on project orion. i really do feel that cyberpunk 2077 as it stands now is left largely untapped in its immense potential for continued support."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,1640 gave me flashbacks of watching koseki bijou play roach race for several hours of an 11 hour cyberpunk 2077 stream
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,"was wondering when you were gonna upload next since 2.2, preem video as always"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"i love this game. my first playthrough has100 hours. i completed every side quest in the game. i never do this in video games. i am usually doing the bare minimum story stuff, but i loved this game so much that i just wanted to stay in night city as long as possible. i'm on my second playthrough and on my third watch of of the edgerunners. keanu and idris killed it in their performances. truly movie level stuff on their behalf."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"the children of the ark almost strikes me as a soma reference, with everybody launching their engrams into space. doubly so with the black cords or tentacles, attaching themselves to everyone's bodies. jax kermith seems like an obvious reference to se7en."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,the neon dystopia is a vast rabbit hole i love falling in.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,the bunker in rocky ridge reminds me of a scene in terminator 2 as well.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,2220 u say connecting dots and finding patterns where their most likely are none is an exact quote to the new cut scene found where u get the monster truck. this is either a coincidence or u know more then ur saying sam

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,choomba thanks for compiling this list. the gonls digitizing their souls and sending them to space reminded me to the story of the game soma. not sure it is because the connection seems very small.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"the cops at toms diner is probably a result of the mission playing for time, hense arasaka being there. there was a dude who looked like he was watching takemura after all"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,it's devastating to know that this will be their only expansion. this expansion has been awesome. gigs are pretty varied with consequences you can feel. the just poured a lot in this one. respect to cd projekt red for seeing this through.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,i love how he gives you some straighttt up gameplay and his first impressions.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"i've been playing this game since it launched on ps4, dealt with all the rough times, then i finally upgraded to the ps5 version. it's come a long way. the 2.0 update and phantom liberty just top it off for me. i get so immersed in this game, absolutely love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"just finished phantom liberty and really enjoyed it. the gigs, side missions, and the story really had me just in it. the performances for this dlc are splendid and with all the new changes, gear, cyberware i am chrome'd up beast! really great to own if you have the game already, thanks for the great vid y'all!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i haven't bought the dlc, but the 2.0 update has made this game way more fun for me. the new movement options have taken the game to a totally different level. you can jump cancel dashes and conserve your momentum by bunny hopping, it makes the game super quick and crazy. i feel like a real cyberpsycho as i'm jumping around at 100mph with my katana, sometimes slowing time midair to rain bullets on my enemies, tons of fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,they really knocked update 2.0 out of the park. the game is in a great state now and its beautiful. everyone should try it if they havent now. i got my copy for 12 brand new!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,i still havent gotten over the physical world of this game. its unbelievable and im probably permanently obsessed with its aesthetics
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i love the cyberpunk world. i finished the game and all of the side quests and wished for more. and not just more quests, but more life. i want to see more shops opened, more npc types, make the world as big as it is with the level of detail it deserves. i wish they continued to make more content for this game as i believe despite its rough start, could be one of those games you play for years like a gta5. im glad to hear they are making a sequel. im not sure why they need a sequel, since the cyberpunk world theyve already created is awesome, but im just happy to hear they arent dumping this ip all together. i hope they take everything theyve learned from cp2077 and make it better in every way this wild sci fi expects."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"when i finally got my hands on the ps5 a few months back, i jumped right into cyberpunk. absolutely amazing game, and now with the 2.0 update, i'm sure it takes it that much further. if only it released in this state 3 years ago.... they would have gotten so many awards!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,"i preordered the game and have played since the day it launched. i never had nearly the same negative experience as seemingly everyone else around me. there were a few glitches here and there but i never found it to be particularly bad. i know this was not the experience of most, but it was mine. anyways, ive been playing on and off since then and its been probably my favourite game in that time. this expansion has only made things considerably better and i am so happy!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i'm starting cyberpunk 2077 for the first time tomorrow and i'm so excited! i wanted to wait for the 2.0 update and phantom liberty to be released before i even got the game. i remember being so excited for this game and being disappointed when it was released but i'm glad that they didn't just give up on the game and kept on improving it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,it really should have more games with cyberpunk thematic. thats why i really like this game despite all of the bugs because it is one of the few games about this genre
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"cyberpunk 2077 has been my most installedreinstalled game, basically every time a major update came out i would hop back in. i even bought it on steam and got a month of geforcenow to try out the rt overdrive mode. but i never got sucked all the way back in enough to do a full replay. i think now is the right time to revisit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,029 two npcs tripping eachother xd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,currently replaying the main game since the update and i'm genuinely enjoying it. i was a bit salty that my 100 hour character wasn't as op as it was before the update but the added challenge is actually refreshing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"building up v from scratch on my 4th5th full run of the game. i have been in love with the game despite the bugs from day 1. played on a ps4 slim my first playthrough, now on ps5. between my first to now, i have not been disappointed. seeing all the updates and improvements has me hopeful for the future of this game, and i look forward to how this plays out. i only am past getting johnny and am clearing the side quests first before any mains. level 33 at the moment. love the new trees and cybernetics systems!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,im actually really excited to jump back into this. i did a full play through about two years ago but playing starfield has me yearning for another sci fi fps rpg experience
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i can not wait! i loved it when it came out i have 146 hours in the game, i had almost no issues outside of two crashes and some clipping in the first two hours or so of the game, but still the issues other people were not ok by any means, i hope with everything now its even better, going to start a new game and go at it again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-24,"i really loved this game, 3 months after launch on ps5. one of the more pleasant surprises i have had in gaming in a while. it has a lot of classic rpg pitfalls but a lot of classic rpg upside too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,update 2.0  phantom liberty got me hooked on cyberpunk 2077 more than ever. made me want to just completely restart and enjoy the world from scratch! what a comeback story.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"the detailed world building and how every corner of every street feels different from every other and just littered with details, its incredibly impressive. ps5 graphics looks amazing too"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,plays like it always should have! definitely enough to revisit or explore this beautiful world for the first time! and idris elba is a nice inclusion and definitely adds that star power that plays along nicely with keanu reeves
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"played 2077 right from day one, and up until 2 months later, racking up 214 hrs and a 100 completion. love the game, love the world, love the quests. there were some minor glitches, but nothing really gamebreaking. heck, i only crashed like 6 or 7 times for the whole duration of playing. stoked to play the dlc, preordered it a week ago."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i played through earlier this year before 2.0, and even then it was a lot of fun. a very easy game to get fully obsessed with, especially if you like to collect everything. really excited to see how the new perk trees map out and get more time with good old johnny silverhand. only problem is that i went for 100 trophies and am kinda burned out on it right now, will give the dlc a play in a few months probably"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,"i just finished my first run of pl, saw the first two endings i could get. 20 hours, still have some stuff to do in dogtown. i loved it. been playing since launch and these years, this wait, was totally worth it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"great review as always. love your sincerity and care for non spoilers. you really are the 1 outlet for deciding on a game, at least for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i started playing when 1.2 came out, on pc, and i loved it ever since. never fell off of it, and i never had any majormild issues. a few really small glitches but nothing that pulls me off it. i have about 380 hours in with 5 playthroughs, but i have put some time into starfield before i put another 60 into this lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-12,"as someone fortunate enough to have a 4090 and an i9 pc....cyberpunk with path tracing and everything cranked to ultra, 180 fps is the second most immersive game i have ever played, behind only rdr2, but is the single most visually stunning game i have ever seen...and my favorite game all time, which is crazy to me. sometimes ill unequip my weapons, press g to slowly walk around, and just fucking gawk. i understand the launch was unacceptable, but they delivered boys, it took some time, but it happened. if it launched at 2.0, it would have matched most of the hype. its not the rpg we were hyping it up to be, but its like a fallout game meets the best far cry game youve ever played. 700 hours in, will be playing this game on and off until orion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"already loved the game before 2.0 but now i love it even more, been enjoying the hell out of my new playthrough!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i really like a lot of the changes involving the cyberwear and skill trees. here's hoping the sequel in ue5 will look amazing and take everything a step farther, maybe incorporate more of the tabletop elements and things we didn't see in this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,been playing all morning. started a new playthrough a couples weeks ago to lead up to the dlc release. loving it so far! story is amazing and gripping in dogtown
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i picked it up on sale a year ago, and i completed the storyline. its such a good game now!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"after never touching a purchase for 2077 noting its terrible launch, edgerunners was what brought me to make that leap of faith, and i actually loved my time with the game prior to 2.0. however, there were a lot of glaring issues still that stopped me from wanting to progress further. now, that i've waited long enough, i'm so excited to dive back in, especially with the phantom liberty dlc. plus, there's just something so good seeing the game embrace the combat improvements that make the game feel even more like an anime than it used to. if any of y'all haven't seen edgerunners, you should. one of the best pieces of art i've ever spent time on in a long while."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,the phantom liberty premise really reminds me of escape from new york. the president is lost in the prison of nyc and snake plisken merc is tapped to go in and retrieve him.... not too shabby of a premise actually. iconic film.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i am very happy with where this game is at. i initially bought it on ps4 and gave up not too far in. i have been revisiting this after every major update and it still didn't hit. finally, after 2.0 and on a ps5 i am very happy. i have had no performance issues, no bugs, no noticeable texture pop ins. i am actually going to get phantom liberty because i want more!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i started a new save yesterday in preparation for the dlc. i have not touched the game since the beginning of 2021. with the 2.0, it feels like a lot better of a game. can't wait to explore the dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,i was level 21 on my first playthrough that i didn't finish. coming back 3 years later and wow! i forgot how action packed night city is. 2.0 and the other uodates throughout the years finally brought cdpr idea of cyberpunk to life.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i love cyberpunk and i love the new update. my only problem with the game is the roads feel empty and then when you're driving in the desert and see all the phantom cars a few hundred meters that aren't really there then just casually disappears is such a strange thing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"its a brand new game i cant lie i used to talk bad about this game until i played it last month and wow i didnt realize i missed a masterpiece, now with 2.0 its even better i cant stop replaying this beautiful game cant wait for liberty for my 3rd replay"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i played one mission in 2022 and put it down, i will reengage this fall. glad to hear the 2.0 and pl positive updates!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,been playing for the first time since the 2.0 update launched  20 hrs in and i couldnt be happier with my decision to wait so far  even with the occasional visual glitch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,i've been playing since day 1. i built my rig for the game and it eventually would release on my birthday weekend. i beat the game with each of the three paths. i'll play as another nomad and discover phantom liberty through the story. i hope everyone who plays has fun!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"haven't played it yet, but pretty stoked to try it out now that 2.0 is out. looks like they've made substantial improvements since launch!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i played it during the next gen ps5 update and i never faced any glitches. it was amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"cyberpunk 2077 is looking really cool nowadays, and the developers should be commended for their efforts, but it's a really good example of why these days you might not want to buy games immediately on launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-24,"dogtown feels huge. it is so tight, so turned in on itself and stacked on top of itself that i don't know if i will ever fully grasp or explore the layout. the whole thing is so multileveled, from sewers and usually 2 or 3 levels above the street. it feels like if half of the rest of night city was condensed down into a single district with content over content and under content rather than just content islands scattered around the map like some of the other districts are."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,this game is my favourite game of all time. also stella in the game is played by the sphere hunter in phantom liberty! shes also sasha's big sister from the let you down music video from edgerunners. also theres more edgerunners easter eggs in 2.0 in general! the perks has lil icons of the characters and go to the place where theres grave markers for a surprise
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"whatever cdpr does next i firmly believe a sequel should be it. they nailed the presentation, story, and lore, and now 2.0 brought the gameplay up to par. as long as they apply these changes to a sequel and actually deliver on an open world that isnt a beautiful tech demo, they have a real masterpiece just waiting to be made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i have been playing this game since day one, of course the launch was very bumpy but this game turned out to be one of my favorite games for sure. i played through the campaign various times so i am definitely diving right in on this expansion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,i love this game so so much. ive stuck with it since a few months after it initially released. definitely one of my all time favs! never fade away!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"i've waited 5 years to play it, because i already got burned in the past by preordering a game lol. waiting was sooooo worth it, one of my favorite games!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"been enjoying cyberpunk 2.0 more than starfield, shockingly. might just hit the spot for me better with the build crafting and gameplay, along with the gritty but fun world building that just manages to make you feel like you're living it and you don't feel bad playing your own way, which usually happens with a lot of rpgs. great byb as always!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,stuck with this game since launch. only 2 true playthroughs but man i just fell in love with the world. excited to see the new clothes in the expansion!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"judge me if you will, after a little over 2 years of being a beta tester, and paying total of 90 for this final release, i'm happy with this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"great video as always, i have let starfield cool a bit and started a new play through over the weekend of cyberpunk.first time playing it on ps5, the dual sense triggers , game changer at least for me. the new 2.0 update really is fun, cops are hard to loose, perks are more substantial, overal great update. i personally can't wait for the dlc, looks great. as you can tell highly positive about this game, have liked it from the start, initially played it on the xbox series myself, one of my faves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i was very impressed by the quality of the audio in this new update., it sounds very impressive and realistic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-10,"i waited, and playing it now with phantom liberty. it is amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i guess i feel grateful and lucky to have enjoyed cyberpunk 2077 since day one. and now its even better. like yourselves, i kept returning to it often."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i played this on my ps4 on launch day and loved it even if it was a broken mess. started fresh with 2.0 and im hooked like its the first time again. cant wait to jump into the new dlc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,my biggest annoyance that still isn't fixed and probably won't are freaking clones.. clones everywhere. moment i walked out of the appartement i had 5 clones kids walking by two min later triplets. freaking immersion breaking. and yes hdd mode is off and i am playing it from a nvme.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i been playing for about 900hrs, and it feels like a new experience. they put a lot of love into the update and can't wait until phantom liberty comes out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time! this will be my 4th play through. im super excited for the dlc! ive been playing since launch. this game did a 180 in a amazing way!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,i still remember when v gets to his apartment and lays sideways on his bed. the game's finally complete and it's bittersweet to see how the game has evolved
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i started and finished cyberpunk 2077 last year. it's hands down one of my favorite games of all time. can't wait to jump into phantom liberty
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,still sad theres no 3rd person but im cautiously excited for phantom liberty
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i've been with cyberpunk since patch 1.5, which was when i upgraded my pc it was the first game i bought after that. i haven't yet played phantom liberty, but i've been blown away by the 2.0 upgrade. everything is just so much smoother, and more logically designed. i say that as somebody who has loved the game since i initially played it. also, i had been concerned when the new system requirements were announced but, not only is the game even more beautiful, but it runs even better than it did beforeand i never had any previous issues, to be clear, certain other devs should take note."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-07,i originally played it on my xbox one when it came out not only was it falling apart at the seams but the system just couldnt handle it. so i stopped playing it after only 10 hours in or so.i just started playing it again a couple weeks ago on my series x and im a little over 80 hours now lol. between the new system and all the updates its like night and day. its a new game. im glad i waited.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i finally finished cp2077 earlier this year. after 153 hours i have to admit, this was one of the best games i have played in recent years"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-30,"its one hell of a game now, im glag i got it. i never used fast travel so i wouldnt miss just how much work has gone into this game, i also walked a lot and looked around, it may have had a bad start but now its fantastic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"something that i noticed right after the 2.0 update is how good the game looks, ive got an rtx 3050 and the game looked good but not strikingly good, update rolls around, i get to play with some settings and then boom. game looks like another reality, its actually a testament to how good our technology is with this game being probably the best looking game to have ever been released."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"ive found cyberpunk to be like a fungoofy dinner with friends. it was a great time, i ate quite a bit. once dinner is about over and everyone is too full to continue eating, the waiter comes over with freshly made dessert. its looks amazing and from the people whove already tried it also say its amazing. fine cd projekt red ill eat my dessert and be sure ill enjoy it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-09,"im definitely grabbing the expansion! thanks for the headsup. honestly, this has to be one of the best games ive ever playedits a masterpiece! 338"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,it may have taken 3 long years but the game is actually playable and really really fun! can't wait for the 26 th!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i played cyberpunk since launch, while ive seen many people leave it, i stood with it and watched the game grow and become more of a thing that everyone can enjoy. i am happy, i feel rewarded for loyalty and i am proud of what this game has came to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-22,the ending credits song is as emotional as i really want to stay at your house from edge runners
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i love the game but i do feel like as great as the update is and how far it's come since launch, the game we saw in those e3 trailers still doesn't exist and i wish we got that game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"i played the game on launch and found it amazing, never crashed, no bugs or anything for me. did one playtrough back then and then another when 1.5 dropped and just started another one with 2.0. i just finished the voodo boys part 30min before the supposed launch and am ready to start playing the expac"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i preordered cyberpunk for ps4 back in 2020 and i played through the whole game, and honestly i loved it. i had almost no graphical issues on a ps4 slim, only had a few bugs here and there. some bugs stopped me from playing a questline, but honestly its not any more then a bethesda game at launch. i never got why people were so furious about it. i remember players bugging cd projekt red to release the game even if it wasnt finished and then getting mad that they didnt get a finished game. but for me it played great and im excited to play it again on a newer console with all these updates"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"honestly the biggest thing i get from cyberpunk is seeing the cool direction cd project red is going with games. i like the future setting and design they have in cyberpunk, i can't wait to see what they have planned in the future as far as fresh new games go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i bought cp2077 on day 1, and finished in a month. then i spent another year exploring night city and the 5 endings. i have been starved for more cp2077 content and phantom liberty does not disappoint."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,i have done probably 5 replays since this game came out. i really liked it. when it launched i had a brand new baby and it got me through the long sleepless night. i will definitely be getting this and doing another replay!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i can't wait to play been debating if i should start over since all the new updates make it feel like a different game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-29,"really have come to love this game despite its rough start. no other game seems to get me so immersed. rdr2, fallout 4 and new vegas are up there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,"i played it at launch and got back into it recently, and have played it on the hardest difficulty both times and i am happy that they added more struggles to overcome, like having the game progress with you instead of saving up for an expensive piece of cyberwhere and blowing through the game. i would love to see an option to experience cyberpyphosis, like the more you go over the limit the more likely you will just randomly die. i also like how you actually want to buy more of the cars, originally i just got quest line cars and called it good, but with the el capitan missions you really want, and can collect all of the cars"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,i loved this game and was one of the freaks that played it day one on stadia... it worked well there. after losing my original finished stadia save i started a ps5 replay after the next gen launch and another now on 2.0. i am loving all the improvements. it feels like a totally new game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,"one of my all time games as is, beyond excited for this. cyberpunk forever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,with phantom liberty and the 2.0 update i think this is one of my favorite games of all time. its incredible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,hoping this replaces the feeling of disappointment starfield brought me. the game wasn't the issue.. the forced moral compass was. that and i thought they would add cool body mods like fallout new vegas
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"can't say i'm completely a fan of how they handled the skill trees, but i absolutely love everything else. i just preferred the freedom of being able to get whichever perk i wanted without having to purchase linked skills or needing each branch at a specific level to do so. regardless, i am on my third playthrough and am honestly having a blast."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,i love how these videos pop up in my feed after i buy whatever the video is talking about. i just bought this dlc an hour ago.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,so glad they didnt let the hate get to there heads and they could finish this awesome game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,always love the balanced takes from jake as always to tell it how it is. that being said having played cyberpunk for the first time earlier this year was a blast for me even with some very obvious glitches still happening. this universe is great and i just hope cdpr gives it the respect it deserves next time if they make another game in it. i appreciate they didnt just drop the ip and continued to expand on it. also the anime is op.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-04,"i preordered for ps4 years ago. like 2018 after the gameplay release. i dont think i can forgive how much bs was fed to us. if you like the game now, more power to you. im just pissed that so many people have forgotten the past."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,tbh the players that had the from week 1 shouldn't have to pay for this dlc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,always loved cyberpunk even when it was broken in half it was hilarious. it was one of the most immersive experiences ive ever had
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,literally the only review i trust
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"i absolutely love the game , was gutted with how broken it was at release but im so glad to have stuck with it , its one of my favourite games ever and looking forward to this new area of the game , i definitely forgive cd project red"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-11,phantom liberty's story and design feels way more polished than the main story line. the visual effects of the blackwall and lizzy wizzy's concert is some of the most beautiful scenes in gaming. dogtown's design has so much depth. from the extravagant black sapphire to the slums of black market. the character animations and voice acting has also gotten a lot better.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,throwing his own dead daughter at him is diabolical
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,in phantom liberty 1. in the mission the damned if you side with netwatch and killed brigitte in cyberspace slider will recognize your actions. 2. in the mission no easy way out if you killed sasquatch an additional dialogue option unlocks when talking to angie. 3. also if you finished beat on the brat questline and beat the champion razor hugh you can mention it to aaron.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"dakota smith gives you a gig flying drugs where you have to shut down a jammer that's taking out her client's drones. if you drive around to where you can hack into one of the cameras, switch them until you get the one that's on the rooftop, facing the antenna's controls. you can us short circuit to fry the controls, completing the gig. dakota calls you, impressed that you came up with a solution that she'd never thought of. listening in to the npc's dialogue will sometimes reveal insights on them. for instance, when you go to meet mr. hands the first time, wait in the hallway and listen as he has a holocall conversation with his family. it's a side of him that you don't see otherwise. and when you leave reed and alex at the moth, they talk about what they've been up to, and how they haven't had any relationships. both of them acknowledge they're difficult people to love. and when gary the prophet tells you about a clandestine meeting where you'll see what the technonecromancers are doing, go to the location. johnny will ask your opinion take the last option and get a fun response out of him"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"not sure if it's common knowledge but something i noticed in the main pl quest you know my name where you break into the black sapphire. during the mission where you're at the sniper vantage point guiding reed to meet up with you, he will reach the middle where the elevator comes down to let soldiers out. if you're quick enough you can quickhack the elevator to continue going down and miss that floor. i did it with a netrunner build so i'm not sure if there are intelligence checks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"only started cyberpunk a few months ago. since then i've spent 350 hours in night city, three runs, all achievements, and your channel is an absolutely brilliant resource for gameplay, story and worldbuilding. bravo!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,so glad cdpr did not give up on this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"my fave is still during regina's gig to get the laptop where you also have to get sandra's databank and you read the info on the laptop showing that the ripperdoc upstairs has been working with the scavs and the dialog options that brings up. i'm mad that they count his death as an arrestable offense after that dialog, but its nothing laying low inside the place won't fix. also interesting to note on that laptop is that one of his patients is the one that goes cyberpsycho on her sister in a santo gig that cap sends you to do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"one interaction most people don't know is possible although it might be bugged in the current version of the game, is that if you finish rivers quests before you meet woodman for the first time you can use your friendship with river to threaten woodman to get the information about evelyn. if it is still broken there's a tiny mod on nexus that fixes it. the problem is that when talking to woodman the game checks if you have certain variables aka quest facts and the one involving river is mislabeled. so technically the dialogue for woodman tries to see if you have a quest fact that doesn't exist, there's an almost identical onr thag you get when meeting river though, so it seems like cdpr accidentally left in a typo since it's such a rarely seen event"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"another sort of tangential thing regarding woodman and clouds, is if you do judy's side gig line, and got through all of clouds without killing anyone or going loud with anything, when you talk to the tyger claws lady who runs clouds i forget her name, the exgf of judy the you try and convince to help you take over clouds for the moxx, she tries to accuse v of being a blood thirsty killer, but you get a dialogue option where v points out that they went in, got the information they needed, and left, and nobody ended up in a body bag. to which the tc lady actually acknowledges that detail, and thanks v for not making it a blood bath. i don't know if you go loud with that mission, but do everything nonlethal if v has the same dialogue option, i always do that one quiet, but i do know for a fact if anyone you drop is done nonlethal, and you walk out without any alarms or open combat, you get the option. i can't ever bring myself to do that one loud, because if so i don't get the dialogue option with woodman that let's you protect the dolls from further external hacking risks, by giving woodman that software update info to protect the dolls. for me that's the only viable method of ending that conversation. because i'm at least making things slightly safer for the dolls, who have a dangerous life as it is. if i can remove at least one threat vector in their life, i consider that a win."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,you don't actually need to sneak up on the animal boss in the red queen's race. if you just knock her out in the fight like with a melee build and your fists you can question her while she's on the floor. great vid! making me want to go in for another playthrough....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i dont know if anyones talked about this, but ive never seen it before but if you complete the phantom liberty ending siding with reed, and also craft the erebus smg, when completing the aldecaldo ending and then talking to alt she stars talking about ai entities beyond the black wall and how we already encountered them in cynosure. i feel like somebody wouldve had to seen this already but i didnt and i thought it was pretty cool"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,got the animal in red queen's race and jotaro dialogue for woodman on my first run funnily enough. got fun one for ya wearing samurai replica jacket from rogue during the samurai bootleg quests. only adds two or three lines of dialogue but it's pretty neat. also if you do pl before capturing hellman you can tell him about dealing with blackwall in regards to the relic.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"the bit with sixth street is interesting because i recently did a stealth run, so i was never seen while doing that gig so it was pretty funny that they recognized me seeing as i never actually got into combat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,i like reed and it broke my heart having to kill him but at the end of the day he was a government assassin and if he was ordered to kill v he wouldnt even blink
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"the best one is, after taking a selfie with us cracks and kerry, you can tell that famous person in a liberty phantom side gig, that you're famous or something along those lines, and convincing her immidiently instead of convincing her with a lot of talking."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"damn, i really found a video that actually shows very rarehidden options instead of being clickbait bs, wow! thx buddy!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,the stadium love quest for me was funny. i lost the shooting contest so they didn't let me pick up the gun. so i dropped a flash bang in front of them and when it went off it agroed everyone but it let me pick up the gun then i jumped out of there before they figured out what was going on. nobody died but they must've been really pissed getting robbed like that.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"a cool little bit of world building happens at the end of phantom liberty if you got the behavioral system component in somewhat damaged. after you decode it, if instead of using it, you just keep it in your inventory and don't do anything with it, you'll get more text messages from the unknown number criticizing your hesitation, trying to figure out why you haven't used it, and trying to encourage you to make one of the items."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"i'm playing the game in 3 different builds  netrunner, meathead and sneeky breaky. what i noticed is that the glorified quest with malestroms in allfoods is not as complex as people think, while there's tons of other quests equally or even more complex in the choices and variations. you really need to complete the game at least 3 times to witness everything it has to offer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"one of the more interesting things players can choose to do while playing as v is to intentionaly get as many npc's killed as possible. the total number of characters v can end is pretty large, most of them relating to side gigs, either by not intervening or because we make a wrong choice and sometimes v can kill them, themselves. there is a simple reason why night city's columbarium. depending on v's choices, that place will contain a very large number of names belonging to npc's v has interacted with. v can literaly fill a graveyard, wich is extremly disturbing, to say the least. this could be an intereating subject for a future video how many characters can get end up dead because of v?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"i knew everything, but it's always nice to watch your content on my favorite game. if you don't put the claw tattoo a gift from wakako before the mission where judy offers to visit maiko, you will have an additional dialogue option about judy's plans for the clouds. also, after visiting pacifica and working for voodoo boys, the haitian woman in the pharmacy near h10 will have a new dialogue, maybe i'll remember something else"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"not certain if anyone else noticed. but when talking to rogue about the kang tao transport. after jacking the shard inside, you see the manifest of the av's personel. there is a robot called ctrpooo which is c3p0."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,great video. on my fourth playthourgh now and i've actually learned about a couple hidden choices that i didn't know about
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,the first time i did stadium love i was not yet aware that not all npc's with enemy markers are aggressive but can often be talked to. what i therefore did is attack them on sight.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"i need to get this game again. had a playthrough and then sold it, but after watching your videos, i realised i missed so much of the game. will definitely be getting another copy and taking my time this time around"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,1. i've always blasted through this mission and still got the dialog. just animal's alfa was lying on the floor like dead.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,surprise you didn't add the mission don't lose your mind. i just found the other day you can destroy delamains core instead of the other two options they tell you
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,i never knew about the convoluted way of getting into fingers' operating room since i always have double jump at that point and just jump on the awning
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"its crazy to still see you doing content on cyberpunk this many years later even after pl, ive been playing since day one and personally its my favorite game of all time. to see you still making videos like this for the game always brings a smile to my face"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,still doing cyberpunk 2077 videos. this game is so great.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"i wish the dev's added 1 more hidden choice on the gig gun music. in the 1st mission of the game with the scavenger, do the nonlethalsneak way. then later instead of having high str for a peaceful way the game remembers that choice too for 2 peaceful ways. remember the e3 trailer when trauma team shoots the scav's the dev's cut out v can blame trauma tream for it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i had 6th street recognize me because of the gig...but since i won the contest, the captain still gave the prize, and i had a temporary truce to leave the area."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,i always love to watch your video since i found your channel a year ago when you are making 2.0 rangking. so many things happen and boy i'm glad you still made content about cyberpunk. makes me feel a year younger

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,it's cool to see they have hidden unique choices when on the other side there is dialogues with every single choices being the same
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"1337, i don't know if you are aware sam, but if you complete life's work without being detected i incapacitated all enemies you can complete stadium love without having the shoot out if you say that the gang's leader should jump of arasaka tower they will instantly turn hostile regardless of previous missions, i did both of these today in said order to try it out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,when i beat 6th street fair and square which is pretty much everytime other than maybe my very first time i tell them gunner can go jump off saka tower just to mess them. also in the pl dlc we get to actually meet gunner with reed in one of the endings and he isnt too pleased lol.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"the most overpowered quick hack in 2077 is memory wipe. you start a cyber psycho encounter, memory wipe, then youll have plenty of time to just get behind them and do a non lethal takedown"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"this might be well known but i discovered it by accident. if you have the blackwall cyberdeck or the erebus smg then after the mission with the parade and youre in the hotel room where hanako sends a proxy to speak to you, after the proxy leaves, the blackwall ai will make a comment about humanity and instead of talking down on it like he usually does he, or it, will seem intrigued, i know thats vague but its been a few months since i discovered it and cant really remember exactly what the dialogue is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"for stadium love, as soon as i set foot on the roof they all started shooting at me, 0 dialogue, it was really early on my playthrough and my first time seeing any 6th street, so i just dashed to the other side of the roads and hid on a roof but as soon as they stopped looking for me they all dispawned and left no loot, not even the iconic riffle..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,615 he tposes
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i discovered the first one by accident on one of my subsequent playthroughs and thought it was really cool. i had never done perfect stealth through the whole mission and that was a cool secret to find. thats why i love this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"i should replay from scratch now that fingers isn't the only one selling legs, i had seen him in my games to buy his leap legs so judy got mad at me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"the animals leader interrogation got weird. i snuck all the way through, grabbed and knocked out the leader, only to then notice the option to interrogate them while they were spreadeagled on the floor, staring up at the ceiling with their lips flapping. oddly, they were whispering, so i dont know if this was an intentional after beating them up, but it felt really immersion breaking."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"good video. another hidden choice is to give jackie a maxdoc. you've probably got several dozen available in your inventory. they should be enough to save him. hell  panam even used an expired one and it still saved her... but  oh, right  none of that works, because... narrative for the record i love cyberpunk. but that kind of ludonarrative dissonance kills me. and jackie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"ive never seen it mentioned but during the killing moon ending for phantom liberty, you can reach the elevator for the spaceport with zero hostility walking right beside security and staff. wait for so mi to get you the uniform then find a panel to hack with a 20 int skill check that will make you appear as staff to the robotics patrolling. you are completely now nonhostile until you pull so mi up by the fire hose."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,i've already played through the game 3 times and don't know all of your tips. many thanks for this video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,side note on the hacked apartment. some of the skill checks are level dependant so it could be a way lower requirement if you got there early.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"if you either stealth the rescue act 1 opening mission or kill every single scav in the apartment, then the scavs you meet in the optional job gun music won't recognize you. however, if any were left alive and saw you, they will become hostile. you can then resolve the conflict again if you have a high enough body stat for intimidation. surprised this wasn't mentioned in the video, as it's one of the earliest points in the game you can make a lasting rpg choice, even though the effects of it don't show until after you meet panam and gain her trust."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,my favorite part is at 616 ramirez does the t pose in a split sec haha
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,ooh i got one. if you defeat sasquach in the voodoo boys mall quest it can come up during the quest with aaron the boxer. aarons boss angie will come in and talk to you. you tell her you defeated sasquach and she will back off and aaron will be able to escape night city and go to costa rica.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"this is why i'm glad i always play stealthy lol a few of these are very easy to see if you just don't go in guns blazing, like i thought the animal interrogation was very wellknown lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"i wish i knew about the last one before i completed the sergei quest, gotta do that in another playthrough"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"1150 i did the jake estevez job before i did the shooting gallery. however, i fully stealthed it, so when i did the shooting gallery, they didn't recognize me and never attacked. on a side note, i think jake estevez was killed by the valentinos afterwards. the reason i say that is, after getting his car gift, i stumbled upon an ncpd job in the glenn. it took place at a small garagejunk yard in a back alley. the area was filled with valentinos, and there's a data shard on one of them talking about how they came there to steal a couple rides from a guy named estevez who worked with 6th street. you can also find the corpse of a man who looks exactly like jake, except he's wearing a camo 6th street jacket, rather than his pink and blue vest."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i think i accidentally did the shobo thing. i usually don't pay attention to a lot of the backstory when doing gigs, and by the time the shobo dialog option showed up, i was like, who the hell am i talking about?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"believe it or not, i actually managed to get that dialog for number 1. saved the gigs for last as stuff to do while waiting on that damn iguana egg to hatch, so i did them in pretty much the order to get said dialog. being a nomad also helped seal the deal and the trunk."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,i must be too obsessed with this game because the only one of these i didn't know was the cyberpsycho interaction and the extra alt interaction.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,a dlc i would love to see from cdpr would be jackie's ingram getting copied onto the relic with or instead of johnny while it was slotted it in his neck
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,i love the new camera options . you can go through the boundaries to see hidden areas . pretty cool .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-27,man ive missed you threw me off so hard when driving to a mission  i thought i was about to pass a side quest
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"i wonder if they'll add the chrome body parts at some point. or third person view, to be able to see the character without the photo mode."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"also you can grab the color scheme of a good chunk of cars on the road, with every model that supports the color changing also having a couple unique schemes. best spots are in front of the jinguji store and around the memorial park roundabout. the only exceptions to this are the aerondight either doesn't spawn on roads or is just really rare, konpeki's garage has a couple if you know how to clip in or are starting a new run, the outlaw while they do spawn pretty often they don't have any unique schemes, and the kusanagi npcs don't really ride bikes unless they're chasing v, and even then the tygers only really use their customized variant, if there are any unique schemes i haven't seen them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,love this. thought they were done with updating a while back but this is cool.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,johnny poppin' in just to tell me to drive better is very immersive
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,this would be really nice to drive around night city with johnny in a civic if i wasnt stuck with 1.61 on last gen
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"it's decided, i'm saving for a new gen console, i've been absolutely sold on these new updates, idc how much it costs its worth it for one of my favourite games ever"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,i always felt so dissatisfied with the limited cosmetic cybernetics for the face im glad they added more
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,i played the hell outta this game back in january i need a break but i will be sure be back one day
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,i updated this game without knowing and johnny spawned in his porsche telling me to slow down i was so confused
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,johnny scared the shit outta me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,still no johnny style cybernetic limbs without mods
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-05,between adam smasher is one of the rare to have already a pose when you add him  idk if others have that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,whaaaaaat?! time to start a new playthrough!!! d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,"i got a slow down turbo. you're gonna get us killed, again and i literally crashed into another car headon at 200 mph because of that"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,"ive got the curb your enthusiasm theme lined up ready to play for whenever johnny says curb the enthusiasm, kid while were driving"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,can't wait to see all those new customization options in the cutscenes during my new game plus playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"i love new eyes, a thing you see like twice in the entire game if you don't approach any mirrors by yourself"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,johnny being in the car feels so natural im surprised it wasnt in the game earlier
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,still havent played the game i want to but not rushing into it especially with all updates originally didnt want because people said it was bad at launch but sounds like an improved game now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,goodness that bakery
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,them adding johhny to be able to drive with you is a cool new perm feature
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,"hype af, was just wanting to play cyberpunk some more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-22,you forgot the npc's that are constantly jumping into you. to get you wanted...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-09,johnny slow down turbo before you kill us again me dies instantly
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"shame the didnt add blackwall eye effects, yes it's not cannon and there is a mod somewhat broken with that effect but still would be cool"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,"just bought this on sale on xbox, been watching a lot on it and it looks cool. installing tomorrow"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-04,i randomly decided to do another run not realizing there was an update and i freaked out as i was making my character lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,having johnny next to me while driving feels just right lol especially in his porsche
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,cruising wit johnny lowkey lit im ngl
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-27,i saw rebecca's eyes and with some of the full face helmets with the eyes exposed pretty menacing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,and this happens when fans love a game and the studio hat passion in it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,so glad that i waited until now to play the game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,nice art piece in the photo frame there samurai
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,the urge to get this game is strong now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,johnny shows up like hey i got lonely
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,it sucks that all the new updates are not coming to old gen. i ain't got money to buy a series x.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-23,glad i started my first playthrough on the 2.2 update
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,im waiting for the movie with keano reeves
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,that pancake joke was a violation my guy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"i like how every few months they just say fuck it, one more update"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,when i was speeding on the highway johnny said slow down or you kill us! again!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,"god damn it, how many times they want me to play this game?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,the last one was originally a mod from nexus glad to see some stuff is making it mainstream
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,"funniest thing happened while driving. so i was driving to a mission when johnny spawned and said hey, you good v? i go into first person view looked at him and then i hit a pole."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,he also has unique dialog depending on the vehicle your driving. he compliments us having a militech vehicle i think. but that may also be me not remembering what he said tbh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,better and better every day
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,kinda feels like features we were owed from the beginning
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,every update that they put into the game becomes a brand new playthrough for me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-23,you just made it personal with rebecca...now i'm depressed again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,"i swear johnny has been in my car the last few play throughs, it may be a mod but anytime id crash id hear oh v"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,damn didnt know i was signing up for an early access game when i bought this for full price 5 years ago
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,wish they added new hair
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"i went back to this game after buying it roughly a year ago, i didnt get into it. came back about a week ago and have been having such a fun time. i regret not picking this game up sooner"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,the only thing i could even say is missing at this point is some of the cosmetic cyber wear like the pointy legs or chrome skin
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,then johnny acts like my parents if i drove too fast
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,is anyone else having a problem with stealth combat after the update? i insta kill someone with a throwing knife which would normally be unnoticed but for some reason the whole area immediately turns hostile and knows where i am.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,and as soon as i open the app i get an edgerunners spoiler. god is good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"ngl i first saw johnny in my car after unlocking his car, so i had assumed it was an easter egg limited to his car specifically lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,"soon the game will be in the state it should have been in on the day of release, brilliant"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,"oh, v. i've heard that so much because i keep crashing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,bro the game just keeps getting better and better
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,i think its cool johnny appears. hes just like 'sup'
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,when johnny first appeared in my car i freaked the hell out and crashed so bad the car blew up
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,now i can finally give any vehicle my favorite set of colors idk why it took so long to add car customization
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,i just got the update. though i had to validate the files a couple of times to get it working right.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,wish i could cruise around with panam
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,loving the jojo poses!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,aight time to replay it for the 7th time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,it would be nice to see ng. it should be easy to implement
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,all the glitches are back too! eyes with no heads are wandering the streets and we got new cars with no tires
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,didnt even know a update was here thanks choom
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,be nice if they would update old gen versions of the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,so im rockin beccas eyes and gun with davids jacket
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,yes! they added crystal coat to other cars. i really thought they were just gonna dangle that feature infront of us and keep it at only 2 cars
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"i didn't know there was an update, so i was just driving around to a gig and heard johnny pop up start talking. i thought my game glitched until i went into firstperson and saw him in the passenger seat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,stop tell me how to drive johnny!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-27,"johnny spawning in saying man i missed you is just ahhhh . also glad they added rebeccas eyes as ive ive attempted to add the mod to get them multiple times but it just never worked for me for whatever reason all this game needs aesthetics wise is more hairstyles, body cybernetics like arms, legs and other stuff on the body, car stickersdecals maybe a few more extra stuff like modular home stuff so we can make it more to fit our needs and such also need a way to get silverhands arm in game as a quest or something maybe given to you as a gig by rogue idk thought it would be cool and add to the world idk just been missing it ever since the ghost version got removed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,"oh this is sick, i thought the game wasnt getting updated anymore"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,i just love it how i can have gojo eyes
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,that be cool if it had a higher chance of spawning johnny if you were driving his car
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,when are we gonna get a live play cyberpunk show from you? id watch the hell out of you playing red
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,it's also very cheap and it's popular to low income people in night city. it's kinda like their highpoint in that universe. i believe nomad v got mocked because of that gun when he surrendered hisher gun on the security guy when he had to be asked for questions when crossing the checkpoint.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,i love how vibes are used here
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"with it replacing the cylinder, it reminds me of the remington 1858 from the old west. so it does have some accuracy ro that particular pistol in that it was a faster way to reload in the old west, but that's about it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i love that the grips are molded in halves, with a hole for the screw. it makes the gun look suspiciously cheap. a hipoint mateba is perfect for the setting!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"thr remington 1858 revolver could be reloaded by swapping out the whole cylinder quite well, i can do it in 5 seconds, which is in no wqy as fast as in cyberpunk, but still doable"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,i'm so glad you actually understand the whole style over substance aspect of this universe. other people who cover cyberpunk 2077 guns always neglect to mention or even learn that a lot of it is impractical for reasons.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,this pistol has a 2 14 inch barrel and is as long as a normal pistol with twice the length. i love the idea that they just said wild west gun and people were like well i wanna be gunslinger i think that perfectly fits the lore. nomads would use it because its popular and its popular because of a fad started by a corp trying to ship a bad design.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i mean, the 1858 remington new army was a cylinder swap revolver, and it was used during the wild west era, but obviously better and newer revolvers were more common then."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,sooo.... mateba mtr8 basically but cranked up to a bigger cal...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,there was a revolver that loaded like that. an even more obscure precursor to the mateba model 6 unica. i think it adds to the crude imitation feel. they didn't just do a scifi revolver. they used the failed precursor to the gun that inspired most other sci di revolvers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,not to mention its got a glock esque trugger safety which is the total opposite if western.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,advertising over reality? in cyberpunk?! say it ain't so!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,its sort of resembles a chiappa rhino but with a what seems to be a glock trigger
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"brandy boy likes to complain about a lot of cyberpunk weapons, and i genuinely dont get why a lot of the time. i see both videos from you and him regarding the way these weapons are designed, and half the time i have no clue why brandyboy is yapping about half the guns he yaps about. this false revolver is an example of the point going over his head. its the cyberpunk equivalent of a mall ninja sword."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,that boltok behind you looks awesome
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"so it's a western revolver for people who understand nether of those words? yeah, that tracks with the setting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,that cylinder swap is dope i wish it could be that small and convenient
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,as to the cylinder swap i recommend looking up the dragoon and similar models. because the percussion cap design of the early revolvers had the ability to drop the lock and swap the whole cylinder on the fly. super neat how we got around the reload issue during the civil war
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i really like your commentary on fictional guns, unlike a certain someone whose name rhymes with sandy who went ummmm these guns aren't looking like glocks or ar15 cinemasins ding ding ding on all guns"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,to be fair that guy is super stylish
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,swapping out the cylinder was common in the old west as old revolvers worked like muskets but had 68 shots.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,dude please please please dm a cyberpunk red campaign. you're clearly a fellow man of culture with your in depth knowledge of the cyberpunk lore. i'd kill to see you run a campaign
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,unironically my favorite gun in cyberpunk i just wish your character two hands it that recoil snd rate of fire is a pain to get used too
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"where are you getting the .500 sw from? the dr5 nova is specifically described and shown as a more lowpower weapon that is cheap and easy to use, hence why it's mainly found among less than skilled beat cops or gang members. if you want to go off game stats, the malorian overture you also mentioned in the video is specifically described as a .42 caliber revolver, and it does 128 damage per shot, whereas the nova does 106. beyond that, if you look at the concept art for the nova, posted in a large art collection by mikhail solovarov on artstation, the rounds are rather clearly much smaller and shorter than .500 sw or even .42. so i don't know where that information is specifically coming from, or if that's just an assumption on your part. as for it being a good design, i agree it's a good design aesthetically and fits the world, though as a practical weapon that's a whole other discussion, one which to be honest i don't feel getting into and one that i am not a genuine expert with to comment on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"a detachable rotary cylinder magazine pistol is cool, good way to use rimmed or otherwise inconvenient dimensioned cartridges"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,looks kinda like that 12six shotgun concept that never got off the ground
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,i like these experimental or unique revovler designs. honestly if holstering wasn't an issue i think this would be a unique shooting experience. its absurd in thats its chambered in 500magnum but scale it back to a reasonable caliber and it'd be good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"the only revolver i know of where it was not common practice but it was used to a degree, is ball and cap revolvers. completely load a few cylinders and keep them for when the current one is emtpy. the whole cylinder could be removed quite quickly and replaced."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"even though the popout cylinders function in a sense like magazines, the gun still retains the benefit of if a round fails to fire, just pull the trigger again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,you can also prefab the cylinder and bullets in setting together for dirt cheap.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,they also look like they are made on the cheapside so it would make sense for nomads to get cheap but powerful pistols
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,that was how u reloaded 6 shooters before cased ammo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"as much as i dislike the design of this gun, i still agree with basically everything you said. it fits perfectly within the world of cyberpunk i just think it looks like an especially ugly nerf gun"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"technically replacing the whole cylinder is very reminiscent of the 1858 remington revolver, since it was easy to take out the whole cylinder and replace it with a new loaded one due to the remington being slow to reload as it was a cap and ball black powder revolver."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,have you ever done a short on the weapons from the metro series? because that would be great and i love those guns! they look like they were designed to be bare minimum functional and were built from soviet era weapon parts found in a warehouse with and whatever could be scavenged from a hardware store.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"if i remember correctly the first models of revolvers didnt have full catridges yet and reloading them would take ages, so the best option for reloading back then would be remove the whole cylinder then put a new one in. in that regard the gun isn't too far off from the old wild west style"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"actually, the colt single action can have the cylinder can be replaced by a new cylinder. granted to do so you'd essentially have to field strip the weapon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,need this thing irl
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,always liked the overture over the nova
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,based on the mateba mtr8. also means the barrel is short as hell.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"in the outlaw josey wales clint eastwood, does a cylinder swap with 1858 remington."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"to me, it looks just like the other mateba revolver. i looked it up it's called the mtr8"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"its like getting a giant sword thats indicative of medieval times, historically accurate? no. cool? hell yeah."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,you do realize  the navy colt model had something of a replaceable cylinder seeing how they where cap and ball amo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"what if we know revolvers, but want to evolve them at the same time? eh?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"considering nova is just slang for cool or awesome, this basically just means cool revolver so even the name is fitting"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i don't know much about guns, but i've heard cylinders also help manage strong charges. so maybe they went for a cylinder to make sure it packs as much of a punch as possible?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"i'm sorry to be that guy but swapping the cylinder is pretty old west, most of your older black powder revolvers was known for this, because either you had to pour your powder into every single shot of the cylinder and then jam a ball in there which took forever, or just have spare cylinders on standby which was waaaaay faster, so yeah, it's pretty old west"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,they make more money selling cylinders than the guns itself
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,i always did love this gun even though most stuff would outclass it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,it's not entirely historically accurate but there are cases where half cocking it and then flipping out the cylinder and replacing it was faster than reloading it one by one. if you really had put down a lot of lead in a short time then having 2 or 3 of them taking up your pocket space was worth it. also it invokes the westerns like the outlaw josey wales where he would do that and nc is about style over function.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,tbh swapping cylinders isn't too far off from the old west due to conversion cylinders on the 1858 remington and similar black powder revolvers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,five seven but revolver is crazy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,style over substance sounds like keltec and we love them for it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,"okay so old west guns in the 1860s and a bit after area had switch out cylinders. loading every chamber like a musket as they had to do wasnt very efficient after all. and it is a real gun, its called the mateba mtr8 and never went into heavy production because it was too complicated and got overshadowed by the much more effective mateba6 unica auto revolver. it also doesnt have that quick swap cylinder. the game also fails to show any real mechanism holding the quick swap cylinder in place so its a little weird"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,they should have put in the mateba as this gun is based on it's precursor which was objectively worse.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"the detail to remember when cyberpunk talks about history, is it's talking about its own history. not ours. cyberpunk, despite the 77 in the name, doesn't take place in our future. it's its own different timeline."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"what are you talking about bubba, all the colt and most of the remington cap and ball revolvers, all the conversions of those and half the cartridge revolvers of the era could replace the cylinders and for all the powder revolvers it was absolutely quicker to pull the pin and replace yh cylinder with a fresh loaded one"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,i did see a theory that as a cheap but powerful gun the cylinder won't take repeated used. kind like the vending machine gun. the ammunition having more propellent maybe? how might that be plausible if at all?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,if this is true it adds an extra layer to the aguilar quest
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"dont get me wrong i love the nova, but the overture is just so much better"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,looks like modernized mateba
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,someone needs to actually make one of these
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,is that a trigger safety? interesting idea for a revolver.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,so kel tec?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-09,as a gunsmith this revolver pisses me off so much
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,until i got doomdoom i never really appreciated the wacky design of the nova. overture may be superior overall but it's still pretty nifty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,well before the invention of speed loaders gunslingers of the time where known to keep multiple loaded cylinders so boom theres your wild west connection
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"yes, there's nothing that reminds me more of the wild west than a semiautomatic, underbarreled, internal hammer, removable cylinder, revolver that was designed by an italian... in the 1980s."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"uhhhhhhh. have you not seen how black powder revolvers work? watch a clint eastwood movie, he has many scenes where he casually reloads by swapping cylinders. i too have a few cylinders for my cap and ball revolver. pull the pin, swap cylinders and get back to shooting. so who doesn't understand the old west or revolvers now? me thinks it be you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,scuffed polymer mateba
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,the overture is the superior revolver.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,it also screams cyberpunk i mean its a world of waste and disposability replacing the whole cylinder to reload screams that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,i would disagree before cartridge guns swapping out the cylinder was how you reloaded and they you would reloaded you cylinders when you were done
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,but in fact swaping the cylinder is old west. guy should read up on it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,power move there not just pulling out a cyberpunk red rulebook there but an expansion for the ruleset. just proving you're not talking out ya butt there i guess
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,could this gun work in real life though if someone actually made and designed it?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"guess he doesn't know anything about swapping preloaded black powder revolver cylinders, although much slower, but was still possible back then!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"cap and ball revolvers could be reloaded by changing the cylinder, right?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"dunno, man. i can't get over the terrible barreloverall length ratio. plus, even with that low bore axis, it still has major muzzle flip."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,my headcanon is that those are disposable preloaded cylinders consumerism at its finest
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,is that a carnifex in the background?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"im gonna be so honest, i despise the look of this gun so much, i actively avoid ever even picking them up"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"replacing the cylinder is old west? my guy, have you not watched pale rider?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"this gun is actually kinda cool in a weird retrofutiristic way. like, only ironically. the manufacturer is dumb as shit. but it is fun because of that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,.500 sw my ass
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"okay, but why does it have a trigger safety?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,mateba 2077
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"nova revolver is based on a failed revolver prototype which had the same design and it was pretty much the engineers hell. it was over engineered and had too many details, it was expensive to manufacture and.. it even jammed. yes, a revolver which can jam. its pretty shocking, innit?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,one could say its nova
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"the nova revolver bugs the poop out of me. it's 'nova'...but does nothing more than duplicate the functionality of the overture classicdesign revolver. the nova should be a 7 or 8shooter such things exist irl, and been suppressorcapable. i've had a request in on the cyberpunk modding discord for a long time, but nobody has seen fit to give it a look. my coding skills are nonexistent, so i can't do it myself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,good? uh yeah
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,doom doom
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,the lines look very much like someone copied from the mateba mtr revolvers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,ragebait or firearm illiterate mozart of dunning kruger effect. just pissing into the pond here.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"bro tries to shit on this gun saying its anything but western. this dude probably things airsoft guns kick too hard. before cartridges, you had to load each chamber with powder, a ball, and a cap. many models had easily removable cylinders because of how long it would take to reload. if only they had a pill for diarrhea of the mouth."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,sorry man
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,style over substance actually makes sense since youd do more damage insulting the enemies instead of shooting them with these cap guns
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,so it works because of the game not actual logic.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"do you guys wanna see a netrunner, pistol or any other builds? mods httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vapomwxyovmeabchannelastrosive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,wow. a cyberpunk build where they actually teach you what perks you should get first. amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"this has got to be one of the best build demonstration videos out there. too many look what i can do videos that don't really explain anything. watching what the build is capable of while going thru each attribute and each perk is how it should be done, not just a couple of frames at the end of the video. plus, constantly keeping in mind that different people play different ways with you may not want this... you don't need this if you want the point elsewhere..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,"102 being able to hop around like cp0 nakama on sight, subscribed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"you just got a new subscriber because you accidentally taught me quite a few things about cyberware that you weren't even actually talking about, just passively. i've never thought about intentionally using the tattoo that i thought was worthless to occupy a spot to save cyberware, but then i realized i could just disable the perk to even have two hands so that i could use a higher tier cyberware somewhere else"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,"i doubt the creator will see this but thank you so much, its so nice to see build videos with tips for people without dlc, ive had the dlc for a few days now but when i didnt i couldnt make any build cause they were all dlc. also its super nice to see someone with personality make a build video"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"1200 better choice is the tyger claws implant, because when upgraded it gives 3 extra bonus stats for zero cyberware cost"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,you also get 25 health back from doing finishers with knives and swords so it keeps the fight cycle going very well
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,thank you bro the build was amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,if you do the same build but with berserk your dps will be higher and you are still gonna be very fast after playing for a while and you won't have to worry about dying since as long as berserk is active you are immune to death.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,love the blade build but i don't want to do another blade build for the 7th time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"excellent. looks like great fun. gonna reset my attributes and try this build out. love the throwing knives, but haven't tried katanas yet or any arm weapons. cheers, harry."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"been wanting to do a ghostrunner build inside cyberpunk2077, thx for the idea. i wish we had a ghostrunner skin inside the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,my non negotiable perks are the adrenaline and survivability stuff from body and the air dash stuff from reflexes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"so i literally just beat my first playthrough. i'm level 60 and i use my point switch early on. i've got 16 points in intelligence thinking i was going to jump back and forth between st devaston and cyberdeck, but i was wrong. sandy is the way to go, so i only have five in my body but i have 20 and cool, reflex, and tech and i have all the best cyberware you could want for anything to dash around in and do melee, i highly regret not putting those intelligence points in body. things like fallout corrupted my brain because in fallout strength is usually the second the last thing besides charisma i worry about. i'm a minimalist with inventory. so i had told myself halfway through my playthrough that this game was so intense i was going to do everything on the first run and then take a break from gaming all together, and because of this one mistake i feel like i missed out on a huge part of my playthrough and now i've got to play through it again with the right point allocation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"damn, nobody uses a jedi build with errata, hacks and containgon for extra xplosions with every burn? trying meele with hacks turned out to be like playing fast paced jedi game with active pause. pure pleasure xd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,dual headhopper on two g58 dians with submachine fun is just unreasonable
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"by the way, this works today and im currently on my 4th max tac squad, you just need to hide to get back your health but then use a flash on the squad and attack using the sandevistan."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-16,i like c for dash. it's easy to hit with the thumb or index finger when your hands are around aswd. it's also what i used in wow to blink on my mage so it just seemed natural.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"literally just started playing this game. my number 1 favourite game ever is rdr2. but damn does it have competition now , and as much as it hurts to say, cyberpunk might take the win."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,good video bro thanks imma try this
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,i miss when monowire was good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"someone who actually tells my dumbass what to do, thank you good sir"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,thanks starting a new game when i get home
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,all the names of the abilities are from mostly 80s scifi or 80s metal songs. my favorite years to grow up. also how about the ultimate netrunner build?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,this is an excellent build. one small suggestion try this build with sir john phallustiff
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,find it ironic that one of the coolest builds and fighting styles utilizes the cool skill tree the least lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"you're a bit caught up in pre 2.0 nostalgia. talking a lot about it though it doesn't have a lot of relevance anymore. best post 2.0 katana by far right against hordes of enemies that pairs well with sandevistan is byakko. higher attack speed than cyclonemodded s noniconic katana, although the attack speed buff is not permanent and instead only lasts for a few seconds after killing someone. so start combat against the weakest of the enemy group. in bossfights without adds this weapon actually is a bit on the weaker side so you might want to carry a second katana for those encounters. the errata is actually a very strong option  if you play with incendiary nades instead of the launcher arms. it would pair even better with a contagion  overheat raven microcyber build than with throwing knifes and sandy though. in that setup errata jumps to the top. but then the build is of course not a sandykatana build anymore but primarily a contagion explosion build with the errata being one of many tools in the pocket to make enemies go boom or give them the rest if they survive the boom. when going for berserker instead of sandevistan some people want that the gwynbleidd sword becomes a very strong option, assuming you actually take enough damage to stay at below 25 health to benefit from the effect. works best with militech berserk if you activate it at below 20 and don't use itemsperks that heal you. the 25 effects are still active with the other berserks but as soon as you regenerate a single point of hp you lose them. make sure that you combine this with other implants and perks that activate at or below 25 health and explicitly not something like healonkill, that would be counterproductive. though byakko might actually still be a bit better against hordes in this setup but not by much as in the sandy build. gwynbleidd will decimate bosses though  the extra 25 damage also applies agains minibosses like maxtac elites. requires that you own witcher 3 on the same platform and account to get it. jinchumaru is a very decent, high damage option if you go for optical camo. doesn't have the attack speed of byakko or effects of errata or gwynbleidd but the higher crit damage makes up for it. you can even get crit chance very high outside of optical camo  the higher your crit chance from all sources is the more competitive this sword becomes. but it probably still never outclasses the byakko against hordes but it will outclass it in bossfights, especially if you can use optical camo mid fight. best throwing weapon by far is the agaou, especially with the skill tree for throwables filled out. iconic electric axe with highest damage per throw. it would have one of the highest damage per throw values even without the shock effect but that is icing on the cake, especially against mechsrobots. when going for headshots or breaking the weakpoints that's even more alpha strike damage. found in an organized crime activity in dogtown requires phantom liberty."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,btw u need to be lvl 40 for the apogee to be in vendors
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,man i wish they had more dlc for this.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,i am the storm that is approaching!!...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-20,"this build is not taking advantage of the critical damage bonus from the new iconic cyberware, and its not using berserk for higher burst damage, it is certainly not the best katana build lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"this game is absolutely fkn amazing it really is 1 of the best games ever made period. the gameplay and graphics. dlc and soundtrack r something else. cant wait for orion. thank u v, that was for alex."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"im waiting for the game to go on sale because im like, 10 dollars short of being able to afford it, so ive just been watching videos about it while i wait, to see what looks the most fun, and i must say, this is one of the better videos on the game that ive seen, i doubt you'll see this, but im definitely subscribing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"melee builds with sandevistan are always broken to be honest, makes the game too easy for me even, once you got byakko you dont need anything else and you can rush wakako jobs right off post heist."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,"biomonitor is 100 essential, if i don't have it i don't even notice when i'm low on health and i die randomly"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,i may be wrong but i think the falcon sandy is better for a katana build you get less crit chance and damage however you get more base damage the apogee only gives you headshot damage the falcon also has a longer duration letting you get more sword swings in and the longer cooldown isnt that much of an issue when you have axolotl
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,"i happen to know a lot boxes of rocks, and confirm they're not all dumb"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,"i just bought the dlc and im gonna try and change up the build when i replay. i always do a machete, pistol build with high crit but i wanna try something new"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,seems like a good build for my next play through. only question is hows stealth? since i like to utilise it for extra gig money.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,yeah i pretty much hop dash everywhere though if i need to get across the city i do use a car
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,take a shot every time he says sandevistan
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,did so many of the gigs to get weapons and he said at the end you can buy em from black market.. dead
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"everythings fine but i cant boil the water like that, can you make a separate video to teach us that magic"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,i finished the wakako missions and got the widow maker instead of the katana
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,"i use camo, the camo katana, and berserk. i really don't sprint in combat w katana it's a dash into thunder clap heavy to close gaps"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,i dont know anything about this game really but ive been playing and i just buy random upgrades. but i feel pretty op i cruised thru the whole game. i'm not convinced any of this matters lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,great video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,the best blade is from wakaku after you finish her side quest.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,"this build is so crazy my game is crashing, i'm going to stick to my netrunner samurai combo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,i only bought this game to slide for my boy david.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,which eyes are those? cant tell if i missed them or not but its my first time playing cyberpunk and i wanted to have a katana build
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,"i got a build i'm running, super stealth dumbass, i got cool, reflexes, and tech at 20 with strength at 18, clearly we both see where intelligence sits. i invested into the pistol side of the cool tree, and the smg side of the reflexes tree paired with cool stealth. the tree i didn't touch was the grenade tree. my main cybernetics are camo and chrome compressor. i would hop in and out of combat with camo, utilizing the phantom liberty make everyone forget you perk and while in combat, melt everyone into paste with erberus. finally its also using kerenzikov as a discount sandevistan, and it works very well. the build may be a bit all over the place, but it melts on very hard, been playing the game the whole time on it. not even smasher stood a chance, and the cyber psychos were super easy being able to stealth take out them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"best smg build???? this build is crazy btw, i got board with like the 3rd max tac unit sent to me lmao"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,netrunner build pls!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,hi ty 4 the video can u show us ur controller settings
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,is this a good build to bring together sniping? looking for stealthsniping then up and close with a katana.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,"my question is  how do you do the stealth missions with no hacks whatsoever , not even ping or distract enemies? how do you deal with cameras and such just started a katana build after 2 net runners any advice will be appreciated, thanks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,will never matter without ng
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,what do you think about scalpel as a sandevistan katana?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,how did you make that character in the thumb nail?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"funny, this was always my build from the very start"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,my skills tree doesn't look like this in 2.2 on ps5
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,i dont know but i liked older skill tree so much so much better..
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,genuine question but is it better to completely make a new character? i have a character who's level 50 street kid and level 35 but i stopped playing before they changed the skill system and now all my attribute points got reset. is it just better to restart?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-15,how do you get your grenade launcher to fire rapidly like that mine only lets me shoot one at a time despite having like 2 missiles.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"wirhout mods small chances, i hope cdpr will add mods for consoles too in next future update"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,you forgot the killsaw chainsaw
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,respect! i have never played it in any other difficulty than the hardest
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,what cyberware do you have equipped for face at the ripperdoc?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-18,this could be run with mantis as well yea? always found the katanas awesom but like the mantis blades idea
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,cp0 wow my man just made a one piece reference
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,what cyber ware eye should i use for ghost runner bulid?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,229 dont mind me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"i don't think this is even close to being the best sandy build don't see you murking the entire maxtac squad the moment they land on the groud with just one sandy charge on very hard and i'm reluctant to say that an optimized sandy build is the best. optimized sandy build is easier to play against ncpd and maxtac but optimized netrunner is better for single target battles like boss fights etc... the first mistake of this build is not enough cyberware capacity. even my netrunner build at level 60 has 302 points without having maxed out tech  and therefore the edgerunner perk. remember to pick up everything so you don't miss a shard  practically impossible, but choose to start a playthrough from phantom liberty minimize the risk of missing. secondly, you don't use the perk in the tech skill tree that allow you to choose bonus stats every time a piece of cyberware is upgraded. rerolling every piece of cyberware till you get the bonus melee damage  usually from 1.9 to 5  to have a combined 40 to 50  melee damage bonus. some other mistakes would be not raising your shinobi skill to at least 55 so low stamina doesn't affect your melee attack speed in sandy time and not using cockatrice eyes and that hand cyberware to achieve 100 crit chance. last objective flaw of this build is not mastering the use of a 5 katana with two tier 5 cyclone mods that allow it to function as an activated byakko, the only prerequisite being having to trigger it through a running attack. learn it so you can muda muda adam smasher, oda and every single boss in this game without relying on killing something, a fatal flaw that make byakko useless in most boss fights. my final critique would be that almost every sandy enjoyer who makes it their habit to lay waste to the ncpd, militech and maxtac in the badland  badland has the strongest law enforcement in the game, with 13 of the enemies having a red skull symbol over their head. anny build testing needs to be tested in front of the sunset motel so you can see their limits  can tell you the best sandy to wipe out endless maxtac waves on very hard is the falcon. with it maxed out 14 seconds charge  with perks of course you just have more time to kill more enemies, not to mention the melee crit damage it provides. although i undestand if some of you use apogee for cosplay reason, it's worth to remember that apogee cost 14 more capacity points to install."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,"so does the erratta katana actually give you a stack of pyromania every time you hit an enemy or kill an enemy? because i'm not seeing any indication when i use it that it is, which i'm mainly just using it for the mitigation...  also, i have desperately been trying to find a full chart to what every little blue icon next to your health bar means. i've obviously figured out a good chunk of them, but there are some that pop up i have absolutely no idea what they're supposed to mean"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"this is not the most broken. netrunning build using almost exclusively synapse burnout i know is very boring is the strongest. katana build is the second, but the gap between them is pretty steep. melee and netrunning builds are the only builds which can conformably kill maxtac at the hardest difficulty. katana's are the strongest of the melee weapons, byakko being the strongest of them all like you mentioned. the main issue with melee builds is that you do not have as much reach compared to netrunning. i have tested minmaxed katana builds extensively and i often die at some point by a sniper shot. you can also get bursted down easily by turretsmechs. i test builds in the big camp near the golden pacific travel point and usually spawn in maxtac as well. another downside is that you will run out of time with berserksandi uptime, which make you quiet vulnerable. netrunners in comparison can stay in overclock indefinitely with synapse burnout massive 3 seconds extension on kill. also berserk is stronger compared to sandi. both sandi and berserk basically make you invulnerable, but berserk has a longer uptime. especially if you use the zetatech berskerk, which has a 11 second duration with only a 25 seconds cooldown. another notable improvement would be to use countershell cyberware. it is one of the most op pieces of cybereware in the game. it helps a lot with preventing burst damage for a low cyber capacity cost. next second heart is a big trap of a cyberware piece. it has a very long cooldown activation and costs a lot of cyber capacity. you should use bioconductor and healonkill instead. with that extra capacity you can get the cockatrice optics, which will significantly increase your dps. at last the perk edgerunner is also a trap. the health loss is never worth the extra cyber capacity. health is one of the most important stats for survivability. you have enough cyber capacity to get all the important pieces of cyberware for any build without using edgerunner."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,are you using mods for this build to get more perk points?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,which eyes do u use?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,these kinda builds suck at bosses. netgunner properly specced can down the whole maxtac squad with a single smg mag and blow through any boss including smasher in just a couple seconds. also pretty much invincible with kerenzhikovdefenzhikov and mitigation stacking. game the cyberware system for max quickhack damageheadshot damagemitigation strength stats.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,instead of a sword can i use mantis arms? mantis arms are just so fun to me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-19,"currently doing a similar build using intcool build with gorilla arms, seraph pistol, overwatch, punk knife, and canto mk6. absolutely busted."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,what are those crit boxes on the enemys and how do i get them
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,"326 oh how wrong you are. at base you get auto crits for well timed blocks and the only defense you have other than movement and cover. i can tell by your gameplay you dont have that down. when its used with some cyberware magic and a little skill you get auto crits, stamina and health refills and speed increase at the cost of no stamina for blocking. i got clips of blocking maybe hundreds of bullets in one kerinzikov activation. many of them had hmgs and snipers and as you said, you play on very hard. sorry but not using this on vh while having a blade build with a sandy that has room for it is pretty foolish. and i dont even like playing on vh. its enough ai breaking the game to make you miss on hard as it is. but ive had my fair share of maxtac waves and from what i can tell its just an excuse not to rely on os activations and spamming playstyles. not to good for those that like to use the full combat system."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,any mods to get monowire back to the way it was

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,waheyyy first video to hit 1million views! thank you all so so much for checking it out and supporting the channel!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-24,"i think what i love most about this universe is that the stories of david and v are like drops of rain, tiny in the grand scheme of things. both david and v went through hell, leaving bodies upon bodies on their path to freedom or survival and in the end? night city remains. the megacorps remain. to the average night city resident, it was just another tuesday."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-24,slight correction is that falco driver for maine and david's crews survived the events of 76 and has a small text chat with v
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-11,kinda perfect that both fallout 3 and cyberpunk have pittsburgh be renamed the pitt and be irradiated wastelands. and honestly the footage works here for it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,i love how the entire timeline is basically what if everyone had horrible international relations skills?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"cyberpunk lore is that it gets worse, and then it gets worse, and then it gets worse, and then it gets worse, and then it gets worse cool robotic implants"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,"gotta say, i love the constant jabs at prince andrew"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,15 minute lecture? nah. 2 hour long timeline of cyberpunk? hellyeah.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-05,"i'm so happy to see cyberpunk as a genre being revitalized, and this series specifically is a perfect way to make that happen"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-20,"johnny was never captured by arasaka. when he encounters adam smasher in the building, smasher shoots him in half. spider, the netrunner on the crew, slotted a shard that had the soulkiller program on it into johnnys head before he took his dying breath. the visions we see of johnny being carted out of the building and interrogated are either memories that were planted in johnnys head, or they were completely fabricated by johnny himself in the 50 years he was trapped in mikoshi trying to make sense of how he could have possibly lost everything. johnny is a narcissist, and there's tons of examples of him embelishing events throughout the game. alt herself even tells you that you cant trust the things he tells you. johnny wanted to believe he was more important than he really was. he was convinced arasaka had taken alt to get to him when really they didn't give a shit about him. the vision of the tower raid doesn't include morgan blackhand because johnny wants to remember himself as the leader of the raid, and that it was his idea when in reality it was fully funded and supplied for by militech."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-24,i love judys mission at the dam. i absolutely love sunken architecture and greatly fear it. so it was a thrilling experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-25,"15755 maine didn't actually kill dorio. she was shot by one of the cops while she was trying to inject maine with a dose of immunosuppressants. i think it's purposefully presented in a confusing way in the anime, to make the audience think what maine's thinking in that moment, confusion on if he'd killed his own lover while he was going psycho."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,"cyberpunk strikes me as the future we're heading into but without the cool cybernetics, at least, not to the same degree."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,i love how the lore is like awful thing happens and tons of people are killedaffected but if you thought that was bad...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-22,wow so the edgerunners had just ended a year before v and his crew came on scene. aww man we just just missed it by a year. would have loved to run into anyone from davids crew.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-24,"i just think it's amazing that mike pondsmith drew incredible believable parallels from our real world and weaved an incredible story and universe from it. shit, don't know how old some of these ideas are here but the man may as well be a prophet at this point. just incredible, amazing execution on editing of the lore as well. i loved every second of this video!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-28,"small saburo fun fact there was a japanase fighter ace called saburo sakai, who went to similar ordeals getting his eye shot out and having to fly to base for hours while passing out from his wounds several times"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-13,this is one of the coolest althistory timelines i've seen. very realistic minus the future tech and compelling
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,well worth the second watch. you have created a great and interesting 2 hour long lore video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-30,this killed about 2 hours of time at work for me!! this was amazing dude thank you
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,never did i think i would hear the bloods travelling circus and disney in the same sentence.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-24,"fantastic, as a lore nerd, couldnt ask for a better video. before 2077 didnt know squat. after playing 2077 became my favorite game and second only to halo in my favorite lore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,"the game and anime that has come from this universe are my all time favourites of their respective genres and with your help to explore the wider cyberpunk lore, your youtube series on cyberpunk have become my all time favourite youtube videos. amazing work, thanks a lot, choom 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-16,"you know, this video just kind of reinforces how much of a legend v is. took down multiple gang leaders, adam smasher, dozens of psychos and arasaka elites... depending on your build and difficulty, v did it like it was nothing too lol."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,listening to the part about the us messing up the world economy and the panama canal part about 1315 minutes in in 2025 is actually terrifying.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-04,"family, this was incredible. thanks for taking the immense amount of time required to flesh out all the written lore into a chronological timeline. fair play, mate, you successfully chronicled almost 40 years of writing, and just added so much to my understanding of the cyberpunk '77 universe."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,"i'm glad to see this amazing video back up, it's gone right back to the top of the lore videos playlist i use for worksleep. keep up the great work wise."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,the game and universe does a fantastic job at making you feel like youre just another member of society rather than the world revolving around you.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-04,my favourite part of cyberpunk lore is how the entire world is constantly rocked by devastating financial collapses and disasters with incredible frequency yet somehow there's never labour shortages or supply chain disruptions that would stop massive construction and technology projects
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-24,this is the mona lisa of lore videos.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,"very happy to see this one back online, i wanted to rewatch it and i could not find it. google really is the arasaka of our times"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-21,the idea of charles iii and prince andrew leading armies to war is the funniest thing possible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-07,you know humanity is done for if apple and microsoft start building aircraft carriers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-17,"honestly, i am a history lover, so learning about stuff in the past and how things came to be and all that is just so interesting. so learning about the most important cyberpunk history and lore just had me even more invested in the universe than i already was after playing the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-29,"i cannot overstate how much i appreciate the quality of your lore videos. visuals, background music, pacing, and your absolutely stellar vocal presentation to top it offabsolutely some of the best out there. been lurking on your channel for quite some time now, and i think you finally reaching 100k is absolutely deserved. congratulations!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-27,"i'm not a huge lore nerd but i am a huge cyberpunk nerd. man did this vid scratch a huge itch for me, cause cyberpunk the series has such a crazy and wildly complex background that i can rarely ever scratch the surface of reading the sourcebooks before i need to move on to other things, but it's one of those things i've always wanted to know more about. this must've taken an insane amount of time to put together, kudos and thanks for doing so!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-31,"have to say dude, the way you have edited this video, is truly impressive! literally had me going oh i know that gamemovieshow! all throughout! yet you link them up with relevant times dates and places in the cyberpunk timeline. you managed to make it all connect together so well it feels like its footage from cp 2077's universe.. seriously, well bloody done!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-09,if ever a cautionary tale for the real world thanks for putting this together
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-18,"as a budding youtuber focusing on photography and cinematography, i have ridiculously high respect for you for making anything this long. my videos average about 89 minutes long and the work that goes into those is a lot. i cant imagine your workflow and talents to make a damn movielength video and have it all fit together so well. superb work!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-09,"1713 juan's story is basically what happened to david, damn."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-16,"wow. thank you for making this. i can't even fathom how much time and effort went into it, but i genuinely enjoyed every moment!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-06,"such a fantastic video, this took me like a week to actually watch and absorb so i cant imagine how much work went into this. thanks man, youre awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-23,"god the graphics and art direction from 001 to 139 is so amazing, what a city they've created i wish they had made like 5 expansions for this game not just one"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,"this video was very informative and well arranged. my favorite part of this video is that it managed to put into a clearer perspective how terrifying adam smasher is for ending the lives of a few nc's legends, and how badass it is that our v to be able to take him down, while being handicapped by suffering from the relic's side effect! hail v!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"thanks for a great overview of the story! it filled a lot of the gaps i had from only playing the game. by the way, 3437 its chooh2, o as in oxygen, although such chemical molecule is not possible not with our current technology, at least. however, a molecule with one less hydrogen is possible. chooh is a formic acid, a basic carboxylic acid. the name is derived from the acid ants produced. in latin, formica means an ant. also, 5612 his name is kim jongil, not the second."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-12,absolute brilliant! thanks! one thing i'm curious to know more about is how cyberware came to be as prolific as it is how it all started and how it evolved throughout the timeline.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-28,this actually made the universe make a ton more sense for me. thank yeh.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-17,"just finished edgerunners, this was exactly what i was looking for. very good writing and ty for the vid"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,wonderful video. well worth the effort. it was articulated extremely well and seems to have contained everything one would need for a total lore overview for cyberpunk. thank you.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-25,my home town! rocks dropped from orbit... why you gotta do us like that aliens!? great video thanks for the quality content choomba!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"i love the game, it has it's ups and downs from a technical standpoint, but the story is just amazing. one of these worlds that feels too real at some time, and to think that we might be just a century or so off..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,just starting cyberpunk 2077 and this was a real eye opener. thank you for an excellent job!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-31,"thank you so much for the time and effort you put into this! ive entered the cyberpunk universe with the game, and always wondered how this world became what it is in the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,"cyberpunk's world is the type of scifi i could actually see happening. sure,not to the extreme of using so many nukes, but the economic and most grounded technological aspects, are somewhat believable, especially nowadays with ai progressing and prosthetics getting better, while economic inequality, government corruption, and pollution grows. aldecado the founder, and richard nights are probably the only ones i dare to say who are actually good people, while the rest are.. a bit iffy at beat, sociopaths at worse"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,thanks for the reupload!! can't wait to watch it later.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-16,this was incredibly interesting for me as a notorious text log ignorer. thanks for putting this together.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-17,"love the straightup putting prince andrew on blast, sir! very well done! great job with the timeline as well! great video!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-13,i love the switch to fallout 3 gameplay when you started talking about pittsburgh. its just so perfect.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-28,15754 very tiny nit pick maine did not kill dorio. if you watch the scene closely. she slips past his shots at her. gives him his meds and he comes to seeing he was actually shooting at dorio. then the cops shoot her from behind. knowing this it is actually even worse because he wasn't in a cyberpsychosis state when he had to watch her die because she cared more for him then herself.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-19,this was amazing! perfect video to watch before phantom liberty.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"2118 divorcing her sweaty, noncy husband  prince andrew i hear you mate"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-21,this was an incredible watchlisten. thanks for all the effort you put into this.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,truly the cyberpunk world is so lore rich. this world couldve make logical sense for gta games to exist.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-19,thanks for making this video! it was a lot of help for me in reviewing the cyberpunk timeline before running a cyberpunk red game set in 2078.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,man this is so in depth and comprehensive thanks so much! im starting the game now 2.0 and pl have dropped and really appreciate the setup here.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-27,"holy shit! finally all of the info in one place, thanks a lot"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"i legit thought the beginning starting in the 1800s were you talking about the creatorauthor. i was waiting the whole time after the army, he became an author and illustrator. it took me way to long to realize this was inuniverse lol."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"amazing lore video, even though its quite a challenge to compile over 200 years of history into a 2 hour long video. i also love how the lore is very well based in historical evento up to the early 80's, making it overall a very realistic alternate universe to the irl one. props to the creators of cyberpunk for it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,"what i find most appealing about 2077 is that it manages to both make you feel like you're a regular citizen in night city, as weird as everyone else with your own story, yet it also makes you feel special and different as a protagonist. it's fun to switch between regular citymerc doing gigs and the reincarnated johnny silverhand."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-31,"i love this vid, awesome timeline, really good analysis and everything important on spot explained and your timeline builds up from zero to 100 3 pure love, enjoyed every second 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-03,the cyberpunk timeline was always a interesting one to me and even though it's a dystopia its one that i wouldn't mind living in it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,glad to see this back up. great video. one note  kei arasaka is always pronounced kay or simply k in japanese. your pronunciation only works if it was spelled kai.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-15,"cyberpunk has become one of my fav games of all time. its like the perfect mix of fallout meets gta, and those are 2 of my fav game series already. plus with the whole futuristic and punk aesthetic as the cherry on top. i come back and listen to this video all the time cause i just love this universe and world thats been created and that you can be a part of. thank you for making this legendary piece of content for us cyberpunk fans. i always look out for your new stuff and i cant wait til the orion videos flood my home page ! take it easy, thank you, and take care choom!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-02,"great video! really shed light on some parts of history i didnt know about. what i find interesting is that the biggest changed in the cyberpunk universe that are currently present in the lore, that make the game how it is happened in the last 10 to 15 years. pretty cool how much work mike and cdpr put for this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,"loved the first video, great work choom"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-22,"just got cyberpunk last week, and found your channel just yesterday. too cool, the lore def makes the experience much much better. thank you sir!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-07,246 me?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-18,"funny how, read in reverse, arasaka japanese meaning for 'incomplete hill' becomes very simillar to the sanskrit word for 'imperishable, indestructible, fixed, immutable'. excellent video, great work compiling all of this. thank you!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-10,"i put this on while cooking food for the family, absolutely brilliantly done. succinct but still elaborate, you should be proud of yourself mate!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,your storytelling is amazing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-25,watching this to hype myself for tomorrow's phantom liberty expansion. finally going to play again.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-30,"slight correction, johnny probably never had a buddy that took bullet for him, more likely he is talking about him old self, that he died so that johnny silverhand could be born and live"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,subscribed! amazing lore video. havent even finished it and im already blown away. your pacing is great. was listening to this on my drive home. keep em coming!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,this is the best video i have ever seen about the cyberpunk universe. i would like to thank you for making such a beautiful video about the universe.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,i can't wait for my pc to be able to handle this in the year 2077.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-08,driving that fast is terrifying with this level of graphical fidelity.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,that rtx4090 pulling life itself at this point
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,oh my god i genuinely thought that was ai thumbnail absolutely insane how far we've gotten in visual modding.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-22,"if someone showed me this video to me 30 years ago, when i was playing my snes, and said to me this would be the videogames from the future, i swear i'd think it was some kind of alien technology. not in my wildest childhood dreams i thought it would be something like this, younger people who already are used with crazy tech shit since their childhood have no idea how crazy is to live through the absurd changing we had in the last 30 years. and we, probably, have no idea about how games will be in 30 years the same way."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-09,this shows how important lights and shadows are in a realistic graphics.. i think they worked in this aspect the most!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-19,finally a graphics showcase video where the whole video isn't a flooded rainy city with water covering every surface
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-22,me watching this video  nice. my gpu  what the f are you looking at?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,419 that just looks real
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-14,"with graphics this realistic, i'd be scared to break any laws."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-18,"hats off to the camera man, he seems to be a little nervous in the video but he did a good job getting the footage."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-23,the fact that weve gone from pixelated polygonal graphics to this in like 30 years is actually insane.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-05,so realistic it got me getting nervous at the bike scenes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,i am currently replaying cyberpunk for the third timethis absolutely blows my mind.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-18,my graphics card committed sudoku just from this video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,"i legit forgot it was a game when the first dude appared, i was like nice cosplay"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,"that first chick was the most realistic, cause every npc after her went back to that uncanny valley territory. still extremely impressive tho"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-11,"i can't imagine how good the artistsdevs feel, seeing their work in it's best form."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,damn... good work. cheers from poland
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,this is why when people say weve peaked with graphics i respectfully disagree.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,there are so many jaw dropping things happening here. i dont even know where to start.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-19,"we need a 30min version of this 003, walking around with her in the city. it's breathtaking how real it looks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,looks good!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-24,"what surprises me most about these graphics is precisely the lighting. this lighting is extremely well done. what fascinates me most is that the colors, the contrasts, the reflections, the shadows look just as a human eye would see them. in other games that have very good lighting, that lighting reminds me more of the typical lighting that you would find in a cinematic or in a movie or in other types of things similar to what i just mentioned. but the difference with this game is that the lighting is so natural that if i could teleport in the game right now i wouldn't see any difference with real life when it comes to lighting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,"305 seeing the city in fog and those aircrafts around, it creates an aesthetic to me that similiar to death stranding? incredible work!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,imagine showing this to someone in 2005
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-26,1 minute of silence for people who think gta vi will have these graphics...

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"the jackie thing hits even harder if you send his body to vik and then do the ending where alt destroys mikoshi. v will meet jackie's engram one last time in cyberspace on a reconstruction of the rooftop of misty's shop. what makes this hit harder is that while in this ending the jackie engram is obviously still corrupted, there's little hints here and there that he actually understands the situation more than you'd think and is on some level self aware, and that he's trying to say goodbye to v. it's a real gut punch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,recycling guns isn't that bad idea. you need a lot of components to upgrade cyberware.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,i wish this game had new game plus this game is still my favorite
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-27,worst mistake you can make is picking the arasaka ending
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"afterlife, see you there is the only moment of clarity of jackie's engram since it's more of cobbled up random memories of jackie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"advising to sell guns is crazy, money comes pretty quickly without selling a single item and components are key to upgrading iconic weapons."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,"in my first playthrough, i sent jackie's body to vik's clinic, thinking that there could be a chance to save jackie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"i really loved that river questline. mostly because it's very clearly an homage to the movie the cell, an actually good jlopez film. but i also love that they factored in the fact that v might actually go to that farm from just random exploration, before doing the mission. and if you do, v just recognizes the farm, and says so. you don't have to hack the information or have enough intelligence to suss it out. just hey...river, i know that place, i've been there! and boom, you have the location. nice attention to detail there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,"dont sell ur guns!!!! break them down for parts. after 2.0 the best way to upgrade ur guns and chrome is to get as many components as u can. only sell the common and uncommon guns that are worth more than like 700ish which will be later on in the game when the gun prices scale to ur level, regardless of the weapons rarity they can be worth a lot. always break the purple and gold guns for epic and legendary components. i know it seems counter intuitive but since the update, this is how the economy works. besides all u should be using are the iconic weapons which u can only upgrade and not destroy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"post2.0 attributes can be reset, once. the main reason you break down weapons is for the components to either build new ones, upgrade iconics, or upgrade cyberware. you only spend eddies on building iconics, like buzzsaw or comrade's hammer. you can easily upgrade your weapons by keeping the best from what you loot. until you are level 10, selling guns lets you pay off vik and makes up for the lousy payouts you get for gigs early. past 10, stop selling them, keep them for upgrading iconics and cyberware. you're going to be making enough from gigs and looting eddies from bodies and safes, and since you can't buy components anymore it's an easy way to stock up. the sidequests are not just there for filler. they're ways to gain xp and eddies, iconic weapons and cyberware, and your choices in them can effect your endgame choices."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-27,i'll never understand gamers who avoid side quest. lock them up in a psyche ward cuz that's crazy talk...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-24,if you skip panam mission i dont want to talk you plus leaving with panam is the best ending

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,one thing i fou d really annoying was how locked gates and door felt really inconsistent. like a rusty taped together metal sheet gate taking the pinnacle of technical ability to bust open. like really?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"scraping weapons aint that bad, i just sell the lower tiers and just scrap the highest tier i can obtain, when i do the math it takes twice the amount of material to make a tier five weapon from scraping tier four then just selling it compared to selling a tier five, so thats how i just do it and it worked for me now i have two million eddies but in need of components so if you arent desperate for eddies just scrap your guns and upgrade your cyberware and iconic guns"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"friend  meh, i don't bother with the side quests, i don't have time for that. i just want to play through the main story. me  one does not simply meet hanako at embers!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,i like the ending where it's you and johnny going to arasaka solo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,the worst mistake is not playing all the endings with at least the first time you play it throuhg. the game literallly throws you to the point where you can start new ending. not all endings are available? then just go play those quests that unlock them and play them then. i've done this on over 10 playthroughs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,never tell judy that what happened between you two was a one night stand. she'll block you and leave town. so either romance her or don't.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-27,good to see the cyberpunk 2077 comtent back this game is still one of my favourites of all time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,"doing gigs and scanner hustles are far more lucrative than they were before, including cyberpsycho missions. this was likely done to make up for other ways to make eddies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,i like how someone described engram!jackie as chatgpt jackie.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"hey dan, i have a tip for a video for you, but it may be a hard undertaking theres a sense of urgency in cb2077 due to v's condition with the chip. it would be nice to get a list of an optimal order to tackle main quests and sidequests from a storytelling perspective. i personally like to do the watson district as a whole before doing the heist so you can justify v fooling around less, but later on there are other things you need to consider, like the proper moment to do phantom liberty etc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,"little fun fact... you can dial up jacky after he died. found that very emotional. besides of that, beating up adam smasher to pulp without using the dildo only from meredith is not canon. 4 rebecca!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,"listen amiga i got this thing, mind if i borrow your wheels? just hits in the feels. like a gut punch. i never use the defualt car in the game post jackies death. he can always have my wheels. rip"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"my cousin did the same thing as your friend. underleveled, no options for endings, lowtier guns, and finished the game before me. but we went back when he learned of panam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"dismantling items is not a mistake, components are a lot more important than money."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-27,"i like this channel. i always find what you do is very intricate and detailed, and then i wondered like dam i didn't know about this. what else could i have missed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-13,"skipping all the ''main'' side quests is a sin, at that point you did not even play cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"selling guns is the gonk move. as long as you aren't being stupid and splashing eddies every time you get the chance, money will never be an issue. my first corpo playthrough, after phantom liberty, i ended with 2m in the bank no luck finding the cyberware i needed in the world, so i had to buy it, plus bought a few cars, my nomad playthrough, low cyberware, no bought vehicles... 4m came easy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-13,the soul killer we see of jackie is nothing more than memories on replay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"on the breaking guns vs selling guns, i have a middleish ground. white and later green guns are scrapped for parts while the higher quality get sold off. there's enough common guns and they sell low enough to not put that much of an impact to credit balance. also, once your build is set, you can just sell everything anyways."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-07,"oh my god, i didn't know about jackie being soul killed. i'm so glad i've never sent him to vic, that was absolutely heartbreaking."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-09,"don't be a gonk, don't sell your weapons. you need loads of mats to upgrade your cyberware. never sold weapons, still got over 2 million from doing side missions and gigs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-15,"the river thing lowkey got me sad, can you imagine going through all that and a freak tells you on your face that these kids that were hooked up like cows had it coming? i'd do the same thing, he looks so damn sad and pathetic in that last call too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,"you need item components to upgrade your cyberware. you need eddies to buy cyberware and things from merchants. typical below tier 2 arms you 'find' sell for about 600  800 eddies and break down to 5 tier 1 item component, but if you need ics, no amount of money allows you to purchase them... directly. but.... if you want to play absolutely vanilla, you do this. buy slaughtomatic guns from vending machines. there are 3 next to each other right in front of the ripperdoc's office near the goldsmith street fast travel box. there are two in the atrium level of megabuilding 10. leaving mb10 turn left and walk to the parking garage, turn right, walk up the street, crossing the first street coming from the left, then turn left on the side walk and find two more vending machines. in kabuki in the market circle where the gun and the netrunner dealers are, on the lower level, where the gun dealer is, if you walk around the entire circle, there are 4 or 5 vending machines. those are the ones i know by heart. there are many more. as i stated before, arms you 'find' break down to 5 tier 1 ic, but sell for 600  800 eddies. buying slaughtomatic guns cost 100 eddie each and breaks down to 5 tier 1 ic. that means, the pistol you can break down to 5 tier 1 ic, if you sell itanywhere you sell gives you the exact same price, even drop pointsyou get let's say 650 eddies, which you can use to buy 6 12 slaughtomatic guns, which you can break down to 6 12 tier 1 ics, which is 1 12 more than if you break them down directly, but you have to work for it. or you can do it the easy way, but people are going to start screaming and pulling their hair out, and crying that it is cheating... use console commands to trade your eddies and ics without going through the rigmarole. sell all the stuff you don't want wherever you want. for every 100 eddies you can buy 1 tier 1 ic. for 5 tier 1 ics you can craft 1 tier 2 ic. for 5 tier 2 ics you can craft 1 tier 3 ic. and so on. just do the math. use console commands to remove the money you 'spend' for ics and give yourself the equivalent in ics. the vending machines will sell about 25 guns if they haven't been used in a long time, but far fewer if they have been used within at least the last 24 hours game time.the only difference is in not running to every slaughtomatic vending machine all over the map, standing there and buying gun after gun, until the vending machine runs out, to buy the guns for breaking down. so you can do a lot of running around to get guns to break down to get the ics you need, all completely fair and within what the game allows, or you can simulate doing the grinding by using console commands. if you think you should have to sit there and click, and wait....... click, and wait....... click, and wait....... to buy guns you then just break down, you are a sick puppy  go find a doctor. that's not the kind of game i want to play. you do you, but leave me out of it. starting with tier 2 weapons, the ics you get greatly exceed the eddies you get for selling them. for example 1 tier 2 gun breaks down to 5 tier 2 ic  25 tier 1 ic  2500 eddies, but sells for only about 1100  1200 eddies. so above tier 2 weapons, it is better to break them down for ics. always check and do the math."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,jackie mustve died during the transfer or died in the car. his brain unable to receive oxygen. meaning what ever engram of jackie that was created wasnt whole. corrupted and somewhat sentient.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"what i do is i complete the main story up until the point of no return, while completing any missable objectives, and then i go through all the side quests. it definitely helps with the attribute checks in side quests"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"biggest mistake cyberpunk does, is letting jackie die!!!!!!!!!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-10,"doing my 2nd run. decided to send jackie to viktor.... knew it was a bad idea, but it's a purposeful decision."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,none of these really ruin the platthrough. the closest is maybe jackie since you miss out on his bike and pistol and a few side missions.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-10,i took jackie to vic in hopes he might save him...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-06,"during 'the hunt' mission, i didn't get the choice to choose one of the farms. the game itself chose the farm and boy am i glad it was the right one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-27,"the side quests in general are some of the best, and not just the johnny  panam stories."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,right on time big dan..just started a new playthrough last night..went with a normal size nis this time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,literally just started playing cyberpunk for the first time and i gave jackie's body to viktor and i'm too far in to go back and redo it again....whoops  we'll get it next playthrough
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"breaking down weapons for parts is okay if you have saved enough eddies, especially toward the middle of your playthrough. if you take the time to do all the side quests and complete the ncpd scanner hustles, you'll earn more eddies than you need. getting parts for upgrading your cyberware or getting your favorite iconic weapons to tier 5 requires components you can only get sparingly in random drops or breaking down unneeded weapons. trust me, you'll get more weapon drops than upgrade components in this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-08,you should've included picking the wrong dialogue options in the oilfield and getting locked out of johnny's ending
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-27,any thing cyberpunk.....i here for
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-23,"in the latest cyberpunk version, breaking equipment for components is basically the only correct choice. gigs give more than enough scratch, and you need a ton of components to upgrade your chrome. if you buy new chrome every time a new tier unlocks  you won't have any extras with or without extra scratch from selling guns, because chrome of high tier is all expensive af. much better to buy it as you play, and then just upgrade"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-19,i can almost imagine johnny  panam skippers being upset that the game has not much to offer and it's too short...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-22,"the components from guns helps, but here's how i do it. i don't break down guns until i start finding tier 3 guns and when i start finding that i start selling all of my tier 1 guns and breaking down the 2s and 3s. then once i start finding tier 5s i sell the tier 1s, 2s, and 3s, and breaking down everything higher that i don't need. if you do this you will have tons of money and plenty components for upgrading your iconic weapons and cyberware."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,dan we need more cyberpunk2077 content choom
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,"its clear jackie is trying to talk to v, but his engram is too corrupted for him to talk properly. probably a result of him having died before they could get him in there. afterlife. see you there. he could have easily just said goodbye, but he chose to say specifically that. its like hes telling v hes waiting for them past the gates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-17,it still baffles me that we still only have one opportunity to reset the attribute points. i understand the lack of ng plus possible glitches being introduced but at least they should have given us this.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,i wish there's an ending where you get a perfect engram for jackie...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"i love crafting, since you can upgrade the iconic weapons, and they are, most of them, the best guns in the game, so the very much so are worth upgrading. but at some point when your guns are higher quality, you really don't need to disassemble them, the grays, greens and mostly blues, so those are worth to sell after some point. and at some point you start getting so much money, that i don't what to use it for anymore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"advertised biggest mistakes, delivered personal opinions on story arcs and some 10iq advice, including always selling guns instead of scrapping them which is actually a big mistake."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-28,"judy is best girl. glad someone else thinks so. i think panam is a bit bitchy and uppity. doesn't mean she's wrong about saul, but her way about going about handling him could have been done with a much cooler head. honestly, i think panam is more chaotic and more likely to jump out a window and be surprised it hurt than judy is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-07,i've been scrapping everything since i started and im still swimming in ed's while also being able to upgrade equipment ahead of my actual levelwhat was available at the ripper docs. p
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,"make a permanent save at the start of every significant quests, quick saves are erased as you progress."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,i have found on my current playthrough that selling weapons above common works well. i scrap the common stuff and the clothes and junk and at level 30 i have like half a million eddies.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,glad to see more cyberpunk content to watch.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,"i'm on my 4th game play. i played from day 1 and still remember when they had vibrators to find all over the map. i actually have day 1 video of the first one i found lol. they quickly removed them, and i wonder why. they were.... interesting and i was kinda there for it lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,glad that i always had habit the of selling unwanted items in my inventory
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"man, if any game rewards you for going with your gut, its cyber pink. i mean, who felt they were doing the rightsmart thing betraying judy after everything you both have been through? two suspects psychopaths and people that just wanted to see an alternate resolution."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,"my first play through i never smelt the roses, got the devil ending lmaoo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,i didn't save takemura because johnny made me think he was dead. i'm on my first playthrough and completed the main story and i'm still upset about it. i sent jackie to victor because i thought he might be able to revive him in some way. i was right in the worst way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,i took maiko's bribe money in my second playthrough because i had never done it before and wanted to see what would happen
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-09,"not sure how many others realized this, but arasaka wouldve never known jackie was at viks if you hadnt led them there after takemura and v kill the ninjas on the highway."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-12,i knew you were going to make one of jackie since you did the one as to why not to save that one dude hahahaha
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,"this is 1 of the best games ever made. and the dlc was class. soundtrack 2, love the gameplay and graphics absolutely amazing. cant wait for orion. thank u v, that was for alex"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,"during a playthrough i went rhe arasaka route. chose to let then help me but i wanted panams romance. i went past the point of no return and ended up in space. during credits, panam calls and asks if we have any gigs we could pass off to her. she's not doing well with the aldecaldos and struggling to stay afloat... honestly hit me in the feels."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,saves made after 2.0 can also respec once per playthrough.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-11,"105 i think sending jackie into vik's clinic not a bad choice, i mean at the end of the arasaka ending we can see him, ended up like how silverhand ended up, i think this is the only good way jackie still will be with us, at least his print, and probably able to convert back into a people as a biochip, so i guess arasaka saved him, even if it feels like they not."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"i remember way back at 1.6 earning moneys was awful in the start , now its kinda easy just selling them weapons xd... as for dismantling... leave for the broken ones"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,"damn, hanako is working that white dress though"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-03,"you can reset the attributes in any playthrough once per savefile, and perks can be reset for free."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,my biggest mistake was missing some of the iconic weapons my first time through. really wish i didnt miss the iconic katana near the beginning of the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-29,really helpful! thank you so much for this vid! love from germany
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,thats how jackie becomes a construct
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-10,scrapping weapons is one of the best ways to get crafting components. i'd rather have a stronger iconic weapon than a couple thousand eddies
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-18,"you can actually max out everything if you have phantom liberty. the dropships sometimes have perks and attributes shards. also if you cycle all vendors and ncpd drops you will have alot more attribute and perk points than your lvls would have granted you. if you hundred percent the game and grind the drop points, it will take you about 20 hours after reaching max level to max out everything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,i think the reason jackie engram is like that was unlike jhonny he was already dead when arasaka use the soulkiller. on him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,i didnt really grow attached to jackie so i didnt really care tbh. just sent him to his mom cuz just felt right.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-17,i swear i sent jackie to vic with the best of intentions
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,you can get hella money from the neverending carjacking quests from el capitan theres no need to sell all your guns especially the high grade ones!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"thanks dan, i'm gonna go brick my gameplay right now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-07,i can't think of a better fate than rivers in this. it's the best choice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,sending jackie to arosaki is the worst especially since he absolutely hates corporations
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,breaking down guns... kinda i only do that for fast upgrade of one of things to keep myself up. usually i sell it and leave stuff i use.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-18,"protip  after you beat sasquatch in the gim, punch the netwatch agent! if you make a deal with him, you'll cause something very bad to happen and spend the rest of the game with pissed off voodoo boys trying to hunt you down."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,with phantom liberty you can upgrade weapons and cyberware to 5 for a pretty big boost but it needs 200 components so 100 scrap those weapons. you can easily farm enough eddies with gigs that you should be doing anyway and ncpd scanner hustles
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-04,i just punched him because it was an option and i didnt know he would die lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-14,"hey, so about those 73 grenades ive been saving all game activates sandevistan think fast!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-16,now this is not an issue you can punch him and get access to his inventory now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-29,good news! in 2.0 the best sandy is no longer finger's offering. punch away.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-30,militech apogee sandevistan is davids exact sandy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-04,bought the mk4 sandy off him then instantly used him as my first test subject boy oh boy was it satisfying
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-27,separated his head from his body. upgrades be dammed. 1010 will do it again 4 month update have done it again. i have never bought a single upgrade from him.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,they patched this in the 2.0 update. now there are no repercussions for punching fingers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-04,this is no longer an issue as all ripperdocs have the same inventory now. punch away
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-04,"if you want to move like david martinez impossible, v can actually beat adam smasher"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-11,"if you force the door open he's operating on a woman who has her whole lower jaw removed, so if you kill him she's just stuck without a face."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,davids actual sandy is on a beach rotting with two corpses. you can go there and pick it up. under the seaside cafe. avoid the cyberpsycho though.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-29,i'll take a slightly less powerful sandy in return for killing that literal human filth
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-19,fingers watching in fear as he gets shipped the same thing every other ripperdoc is getting
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-29,you can punch him now he doesnt sell the best sandi
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-29,"clean, fast, simple tutorial..... this a gigachad right here!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,y'all didnt hear... 2.0 fingers is dead
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,2.0 fixed this. now the best sandy is for sale at any ripperdoc when you are lv 40
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-18,"with the new update, you can beat the ever living carp out of him"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,its not a shame because every ripperdoc sells it once you reach the appropriate level lmao.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-12,you can simply go buy it before having that quest interaction.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,flashes back to when i killed him also me woops... yeah he didint make it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-25,"i punched him in that mission, came back after the mission and punched him again so he's out of business for good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,"that fingers compilation was so satisfying, thank you"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-18,in the year 2025 you should punch fingers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-04,have you actually did his part of the story? because i find it impossible to not punch andor kill him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-19,"you can just go to his shop before even talking the mission. i stumbled upon his shop while being lost. because i am a loot goblin, i bought everything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-18,"idk if it existed at the time, but now the best sandy is the militech apogee sandevistan which is sold by all ripperdocs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"not a problem anymore, now we just got one new sandy everytime the shops get higher tier items"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-30,just so yall know in the 2.0 update all ripperdocs sell the same inventory now and that includes fingers so feel free to flex that quick save finger a few times and go crazy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,it doesn't matter anymore lol. every doc sells the same thing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-29,"thanks to the new update, i can buy that sandy eben after killing him."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-06,"just do the quick save method. punch the shit out of him till youre satisfied, and go back to that save point and talk to him normally."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-06,"i replayed that multiple times to see his tolerance for when hed die. i like the one where v asks why he shouldnt kill him, and then punches him so hard that he instantly dies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,the best for melee is the one legendary you can get in phantom liberty since it extends the duration by each kill.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-13,25? ill keep my 85 bud.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-18,"or you can visit him before the mission, buy his stock regardless of whether you meet the requirements because you can still do that, and then still beat him up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,"to anyone seing this after the 2.0 update. punching this man doesnt take away the ability to purchase from him anymore, punch away!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"then you probably shouldnt punch fingers like i didnt, but i went in there and threw a grenade at him later on"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-02,"i'll keep that in mind, i'll do a sandi build later but right now i'm doing a netrunner build"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-05,you can still punch him. just buy the sandi before starting the judy quest line. also get the epic legs as they are the best leg enhancement. then punch to your heart content
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-21,best part of 2.0 is that the best sande is a global item now and i can punch fingers during the quest and come back later and shoot him in the face.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-12,"my experience is that this sandy is too good, it gets boring. it's much more fun to use a different one with a longer cooldown so you have to work around that time outside of bullet time by reaching cover when it's about to end or by using optical camo for example to keep you in the fight while the sandy recharges. but using this one and being able to keep the slow time on almost constantly, gets boring quick."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-25,"ever since the qiant sandy went bye bye, i went with dynalar and everything i could to shorten cd and prolong the effect window. its 50 time slow compared to 20 and also picked up stuff that would give me movement speed at the start of combat to make full use of the time window. its not as spammy as qiant was, but its still pretty cool. also deflecting bullets while in slowed time goes back to them as a guaranteed crit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"ngl i find netrunner more satisfying, feelin like aidan pierce rollin in and killin off everyone with a simple press of a hack"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-14,outdated since the release of 2.0 as far as im aware
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,this is no longer the case post 2.0
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,update in the 2.0 overhaul every ripperdoc sells every cyberware now if you didnt know. so i literally blasted his brains out with johnnys pistol first chance i got with no consequence
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-05,"whats crackin fingers! my nose cause you punched it, get out!!!! lmfaoooooooo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-22,"fingers no longer is the best ripper. punch away fellas, and return later to finish the job."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,does this matter with 2.0 now that all ripper docs are supposed to have the same inventory?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,i heard 2.0 fixed this. that you can now punch all you want.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-11,this aged like milk lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-02,it's wild how many don't take the obvious option things that have a benefit to it in this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-27,me thanking my past self for not killing him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-22,"once i learned about dashing in the second level of dexterity i didnt need a sandevistan, 3 knoves to throw and dash realy just makes the game easy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,im so mad that cdpr nerfed most sandys into the ground in 2.0
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-13,laughs in militech apogee
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-01,this has been changed all ripperdocs have the same inventory now so we can punch fingers to our hearts content.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,to late i already went oopse upside his head
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-06,"vic acts as a lost and found for cyber ware you missed, punch fingers and get the sandy from him winwin"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,i love the look fingers gave me right before i used guts to vaporize his head.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-21,if i had known i would've left him but seriously that guy was getting on my nerves and probably would've killed him after getting the stand
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-17,where did u get this sandevi? at a dumpster lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"before 2.0, i stuck with being a netrunner since i focused more on technical ability for crafting and upgrades and cool for stealth. putting in the best sandevistans required having reflexes 18. nowadays, there's no necessary skill cap for high tier sandys and berserks. also, fingers used to be the only ripper you could get the pain editor cyberware from. which used to be capped at cool 15. again, not anymore. with every ripper having the exact same inventory now, aside from the iconics sold by the dogtown rippers, punching him out is all the more justified for how to react to this sleazebag. after all, both judy and nomad v point out how junkyards have better things on offer than his stock."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-12,try and stop me from punching him every play through
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-01,when i finally got to doing the championship quest. the one where you find people around night city and duke it out. i had sandevistan at the time it i found it so funny how i just slowed down time and started punching them in the face over and over
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"the military apogee sandevistan allows you too slow down time at 85 is an iconic and can be found in certain invetories guaranteed when over level 40 or so it has multiple  cells which allows you to recharge from each one rather than the full wait time and whilst it is active every kill recharges one of these cells. its also been said that it is the very same sandevistan that david martinez used in the show. its got more too it but you can find it very easily late game, theres videos showing the exact location you can get one for free without phantom liberty just make sure you dont already search that spot before youre a high enough level"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"as of 2.0, you can punch and even kill fingers without consequences! all rippers have the same inventory, but the dlc rippers have the dlc cyberware."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,i dont think any amount of sandevistan could not make me punch the guy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-21,"just like oda, he catching these monke hands."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-29,the pain i had after watching edgerunners and then followed up by the pain i had knowing i couldn't get close to his sandevistan because i blasted fingers with the electric shotgun.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-12,before 2.0 i had a very op sandy build. it gave 10 seconds of slow time with a 3 second cooldown and i used it with my throwing knife build.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,"watching that just after i punched him in my pl playthrough. and still, i dont really regret it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-11,bro how is it even possible that someone like him even owns it...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-06,ever since update 2.0 there has been no mercy for fingers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,i use the iconic falcon variant i can clear whole buildings with many kills jsut throwing my knives. feels good hearing the cyberpsychosis kick in
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-05,"dawid are tou using sandevistan? v nah, but my chrome compressor makes me a super soildier."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-22,ok ok next time ill let him give me the upgrade but im still gonna annihilate the guy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,i not only punched fingers i made sure i give him the real ripperdoc experience
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,glad all rippers sell the same shit now lol xd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-10,"i love how fingers, the man whos literal purpose in the story is selling shitty cyberware, clearly gets his act together upon meeting v, considering he starts instead carrying the highest quality sandevistan nc has to offer!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-13,using a sande with a reflex build is my favorite way to play this game. you get to bounce around a room at mach jesus and shred everything with a katakana
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,ahhh... brings back memories...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-09,"david actually uses the 'apogee.' if you pair it with axolotl, you can keep it up basically constantly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-01,bro that anime fucking left me speechless with that ending
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-30,"as of the recent update, you call kill the asshole, all ripper docs now have same inventory"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-26,why am i getting this in 2024
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-23,yeah. last night i went him a visit and as much as love punching his lights out i also stumbled upon his place before the mission with judy. gotta say he does have some neat upgrades. and i am doing good as a boxer type with out it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-22,"even though he has the best sandevistan, i aint paying him shit because of how he treats his patients"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,after i heard how he is useless after 2.0 update fingers is deeeeeead brotha
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-31,bro didnt even touch the werido and he still had his doors closed and the girls outside his office still
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-19,i never had a play through that i didnt end this guy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-07,pretty sure my sandy slows time by 85 while the one you're showing slows by 75 time pass by 25 and it's an iconic
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-08,i find it hard to believe that fingers is the guy with the best sandie because hes chipping dolls with outdated faulty cyber wear and yet hes got his hands on the best sandie
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-11,im always nice to him as i watched a video for that quest and they said don't hit him so i don't he might be a little creepy but hes still pretty cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-27,"me who only uses netrunning tech oh no, anyways"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-22,i believe they changed this in 2.0 were you can get any cyberware at every ripper
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-09,got this right after punching him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-30,the right dialog options allow you to punch him twice and keep his inventory accessible later on
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-17,
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-20,"i agree with you so much. i'm almost obsessed with the world of cyberpunk. the architecture, the culture, the technology, the lawlessness, and the colorful neon lights just mesmerize me to where i sometimes wish i could've witnessed it or something very similar with my very own eyes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,"what gripped me was everything about the world, but the the nail in the coffin was the fact that it is one of the only games that i feel dirty fast travelling, and i look forward to that long drive across the map"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"i finally found my people. ive sunk over 600 hours into the game and i still cant get enough. the world, characters, stories and atmosphere found within the game are just so amazing and im excited to see how night city is going to be portrayed in the next game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-18,"i believe that this game saved my life. i was so done with everything and every night when i went to bed i wished that i wouldn't wake up. then i played the easy way out ending, and when i saw the impact it had on everyones life in the end credits i thought about how my family and friends would react and then i realized that i wasn't as alone as i think i was. couldn't stop crying for hours , but then everything felt better and i don't have those thoughts any more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-23,cyberpunk 2077 isn't a game. it's an experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-20,"night city just swallowed me, i wasn't able to play anything else but cyberpunk. ending on my first playthrough just broke me, like i was literally dead behind the screen. after that i decided to get pl on next sale and i do not regret any penny spent on this masterpiece. we all know cyberpunk had rough start, but now this is literally on of the best games over there. waiting for sequel for sure."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-11,one of the things that has been engraved in my brain is the slang of night city. calling someone a gonk or a choom is so funny to me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,cyberpunk just feels real. it isn't trying to show you a perfect world it has it flaws and shortcomings but it never once claims to be perfect.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-23,"riding a motorcycle through the night city streets after dark, is the very best game experience i have ever had. it feels so alive!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-07,i'm so happy there are people like me who are still obsessed with cyber punk
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most important pieces of art i have ever experienced.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-26,"really one of the most painful things to me is to see how unrecognized and under appreciated this game still is. my friends still laugh at me when i tell them cyberpunk is my favorite game of all time and many of them still have never picked it up despite me nearly begging due to the shaky release and bad press the game got surrounding it's release. these love letters to cyberpunk mean so much to me, they put in to words what a lot of us can't how brutal and cruel the world is but yet at the same time full of love and hope if you dig deep. the characters are unparalleled and the graphics and setting just can't be beat, thanks for this choom much love to all of you out there!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-20,"im glad its not just me. i seriously cant get enough content about this game. ive spent 500 hours completing every single quest, collecting every single item, and yet i still search for videos about it. it really is the most incredible game of the decade for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-12,"i will never, ever forget the conversations with kerry eurodyne on the rooftop  the conversation after the concert. they don't say it outright, but i'm pretty sure v saves kerry from trying to take his own life again that night you show up in his mansion. he had dismissed all of his staff for the night, was showering with a gun. and after the concert, he basically says it without saying it. he hints heavily that if v hadn't shown up that day, it stopped him from doing something drastic. when kerry felt alone, v came along and let him relive his glory days a bit with his longgone friend, and gain a new friend in the meantime through v. i love kerry so much lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,"g'night, valerie. today was a good day. hits hard. johnny is sad that he is going to get wiped but accepts it because he knows it will genuienly save v. and in the end that's what he wanted."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-20,i am absolutely obsessed with the cyberpunk world. cyberpunk 2077 is the best game i've ever played and edgerunners is top 1 on my anime list. i just can't stop thinking about this universe
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"i've logged over 3500 hours in this game. first playthrough ruined me. that was a bit under a year after the game originally launched i had an old pc that was on its last legs when the game came out so i got a mate to build me a cyberpunk read one in 2021. i'm an old, first gen female gamer  in the second half of my fifties with the declining hormone levels to match. i thought i had become, not exactly dead inside, but emotionally muted you really don't realise how much those hormones influence your emotions until they go away. and that first playthrough actually made me realise that i could still feel, because it made me so bloody sad in a way i hadn't been for ages. i'm terrible for repeat plays  i can spend months and months playing and replaying games to try different paths, different builds, etc, and so it was with this. subsequent playthroughs didn't make me feel in the way the first did, but i began to relax and enjoy the gameplay more. i did take a side trip into rdr2 itself a wild emotional ride for a few months while i was waiting on phantom liberty but the dlc lured me right back in and is even better than the main game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-04,"im 25 and i used to play video games day and night as a kid but moved on from them in my adulthood. i had an injury at work in the spring and had the next 2 months of summer to recover and basically do nothing. i decided to give cyberpunk a try after i bought my fancy new ps5 and 4k 165hz monitor and a great set of headphones and oh my god. i spent literally 2 straight months playing this game and exploring the world pretty much all day every day and just basically lived another lifereality, inside of a video game. it was completely enveloping because of how realistic it is, but also so emotional because the story is so well written and how your choices effect everything, you really feel like you are living a life inside this game and making relationships with real people its insane. falling in love with panam, grieving jackie, getting to know a brother in johnny silverhand. ive never in my life played a game so realistic to what real life is. not only is it the most realistic game ive ever played in terms of the senses, the graphics, environment, ambience, etc. but its so realistic in terms of the emotions it evokes and how close it is to real life emotions and relationships. id give anything to play this game for the first time again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-05,"i'm 49 years old and have been playing video games for as long as i can remember. i bought cyberpunk 1 week ago, a little scared because of all the hate the game had received in the past. it has become one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. and it's on its way to becoming my 1 favorite game. it's absolutely amazing. thanks for your video and for showing people what cyberpunk is really like today."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"you know what i noticed on release, and even kinda now? most people who enjoy cyberpunk 2077 weren't gamers per se, those whom enjoy the gameplay first, but more of a film, books, and etc. lovers, whom may have overlooked bugs and flaws of this game, and were in awe from atmosphere and story that was on release. no other game had dragged me in so much, that 3.5 years after it's release, i still think so highly of this game, and still ocassionallly return to it once every 6 months to complete it, as soon as the memories of details fade away a bit"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-04,"that aldecado campfire with panam was truly quite magical, i was there in that moment and all those characters felt so real, wasnt ready to be blown away by this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"i grew up in la, cyberpunk feels like home to me. everyday i see inspirations and scary parallels. i was best friends with a jackie welles in high school, and had a fling with a judy. night city will always feel like home"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-31,"i preordered cyberpunk 1 day before launch. i had a 1060 3gb, played and finished the entire game at like 25 or less fps, and yet loved every second of it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-09,"thank you for making this, choom. im glad that im not the only one who still to this day is moved by the whole cyberpunk universe, from the base game to the dlc to edgerunners, its become a massive part of my life for many reasons, but i think this is one of those things in life which will stay with me forever. great video, earned a new subscriber."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"i have 700 hours in cyberpunk. i first completed it within the first 3 release weeks and find myself starting another playthrough again and again. i honestly don't really know why. maybe it's some sort of nostalgia, i want to experience the game for the first time again. i want to immerse myself in night city, get to know all the characters, feel the dread, experience the vast interconnected worldbuilding and the hidden depths behind every corner of this huge game. of course it never ends up feeling the same. its never as mindblowing and captivating as the first time, yet i still love night city and find myself longing to wander its streets. i don't know how often i replayed the main storyline, i 100ed the game like 3 times, and i have done each and every ending over and over again. i just cant comprehend how they were able to create such a huge variety mindblowing storylines, intrigues and mysteries all interconnected, coexisting symbiotically in this beautiful hellscape that is night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"i absolutely love the world of cyberpunk. i put 100 hours on my first playthrough. i did all the gigs, all the police reports, all the side missions i could do, phantom liberty, driving around the city listening to bangers from body heat radio, optimizing my build, and much more. im so glad i played the game this year instead of when it came out. i feel bad for those who had to deal with the game on release, but you haven't played cyberpunk yet i 100000 recommend it now. anything cyberpunk sign me up. i can't wait for cyberpunk orion!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,300 hrs in zero regrets. i love this game dearly and i really love cyberpunk. lol even wrote a fanfic
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-04,"as a fan of blade runner, i can't get enough of cyberpunk 2077. futuristic worlds are my favorite and every since the game came out, i've been obsessed with it as well. the characters, vehicles, and locations are just awesome"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"after nearly 3000 hours in this game, and still playing, i know exactly what you mean. i would have assumed i'd have put this game down after maybe 300500 hours like my other favorites, but there's something about this game that just pulls you in and never lets go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"i have been obsessed with skyrim for the longest time, literally feeling homesick for an imaginary world. i recently started playing cyberpunk after my partner kept saying how good it was, and i can truthfully say that cyberpunk and skyrim fall into that same category of a cruel world that is so beautiful you want to be in it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-25,"dude ive been so obsessed with this game for so long. im obsessed and havent been this obsessed with a game in a while. its so nice to know there are other people who are also as into it as me. feels so affirming . so so grateful this games launch didnt deter everyone, this game has so much promise and is so beautiful . shame so many people wrote it off so fast, grateful for all you chooms that also got caught up in the craziness and beauty that is cyberpunk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"genuinly, first off we have the same taste in games which i love  but the reason i'm commenting is that i've also been depressed for years, but one of the credits sequences in cyberpunk is one of my main barriers against zeroing myself, to use the game's slang  the sheer amount and weight of emotion when judy asks you if you ever thought about what happens to everyone else, and how she breaks down when she can't leave you a message because she knows you'll never answer, it just floored me. that and most everyone else being a different stages of grief, viktor angrily snaps at how he wishes he could, no even should have done more his words, not mine  even panam, with the most violent and angry message out of them all, to me at least, seems to be angry not only that she did so much for you, but it still wasn't enough, and you weren't thinking about anything at all, because if you were, you'd have asked for help from a reliable source. to quote the name of a video essay i adore about cyberpunk 2077  night city hates you, and you have to deal with that, but as is said in the video, you can love living in a city that hates you, not just because you're an outsider who faces no consequence in a city created by artists, but also because within that hate that surrounds you at all times, you can find myriad little holes carved out of the world for people  families, crews, lovers, friends, brothers, and hell even good colleagues see v and their fixers the reason we love night city so much isn't down to the disgust of capitalism that writhes within it, but that even 53 years from now, when we'll be closer to saul or viktor's age, love and hope persist"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-28,"this game really gave me much, shortly after my dad passed away this game came out, i had a hard time reconnecting with friends, family and social life in general. i was quite young and this game taught me to move on and made me remember to always cherish the moments we had. now few years after i am at a much better point of my live. partially thanks to cyberpunk that broke my shell again. thank you for reading my rant."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,ive never played this game but i am obsessed watching the gameplays and reviews on yt. i love this type of aesthetic so much. it literally my dream.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-27,"honestly cyberpunk 2077 and red dead redemption 2 are the only games that i would personally consider perfect. they truly left me broken and wanting for more. im obsessed with both of them. the worlds, the characters, the stories, the lore everything is perfect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"thank you for expressing exactly how this game makes me feel. i have over 600 hours in this game, countless playthrough, and everytime the game still manages to entrance me and capture me. i tried many other games but none can satisfy me the same way cp77 did. on my first play of pl i sent so mi to the moon and i cried like a baby, looking at my screen, and that moment will stick with me forever. that's moment like these that makes an epic game for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-24,this game's story made me cry. there's something about trying your absolute hardest to be something and have it all just to be swept under the rug or simply forgotten that destroyed me. that helplessness was gutwrenching. how many v's are there in nc? we were special until we weren't
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,"thanks for this, man. i needed to watch your video today. i've dealt with depression and anxiety my whole adult life. it's been pretty much under control for some years now. but this past month, it's been really tough, as i been dealing with a really bad break up with an exgirlfriend and my dad going through an unexpected chemo. so depression has been on my radar for sometime now, and i've been fighting like hell to not let it settle in again. so, it's new year's eve and i've found your video... it has the message i didn't now i needed! yes, it's about a game i really love as well, for the same reasons as well. but you nailed in the end with the message it's all about escapism and how we use games to indulge our minds. from the bottom of my heart, thank you! you really helped me today."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-22,cyberpunk is like no other game to me. im absolutely obsessed. on the end of my 3rd play through rn and still absolutely loving it so much. ill never get over how much of an impact this game had on me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-09,"what a love letter man. i played it on release on pc and even though there were some bugs it was the most immersive game i've played ever. i truly felt like i lived a life with these characters. i still remember escaping the boundaries of night city's outskirts with panam looking at the stars. it gave me such a euphoric, freeing but sad feeling of what awaited even though that's where it ended. i realized that's literally what v was probably feeling too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-24,"2077 inspired me to get into gming for tabletop games, as i picked up cyberpunk red afterwords and have been building characters and writing stories with my friends in the setting ever since."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"i feel ya choom! this game captivated me. the characters, the world, the gameplay and the modding community. i have so many hours in this game and have never gotten bored. i am so in love with the story telling, the characters lookin at u panam  and the world building. i even watched edgerunners, and ive never watched an anime in my life and probably never will again.  i hope cyberpunk 2 delivers just as much care and attention as this gem has."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-28,your final message with hardest to be in the background goes so hard dude
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"agreed with many points, which is very much why your title called to me. but i would be remiss without calling out... no love for kerry? out of all the amazing character moments one that is my favorite is sitting on the boat with kerry while he just strums those few chords and hums. i realized how much that impacted me because this game is loud, brutal, fast, and wild and it feels great, and that quiet peaceful moment hearing not a song but just a simple tune brings it all into stark contrast with the rest of night city and makes those amazing touching, emotional and beautiful moments shine all the brighter because of it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,"i'm too can't seem to stop thinking about cyberpunk. this game somehow just keeps me coming back time and time again. characters are definitely the best part of the game and especially pl. i cried and laughed so many times on the first play through it's kinda crazy. that was a great video man, thank you so much. i'm literally in tears writing this comment after watching the video  you did a great job!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-27,"just the night city itself is beautiful enough to keep me staring. the more i like the art design, the more i feel bad for not being able to see the full of it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,"wow thank you, the first few minutes alone explain exactly to the point how i feel about cyberpunk im actually tearing a little, no game, series or film has ever made me feel what i felt playing this game. when i think back in a few decades i hope to remember this game and the great great time i had"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-25,"you just described how i feel towards this game and why i am still playing it. thanks for that, great video."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"much love my choom, thank you for this video 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-19,"if you've played cyberpunk, what's the reason you keep returning to it? edit thank you amazing chooms for all the love ! stick around for more content like this, just talking about the games i love"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-25,"the game, the characters, the world all felt so real to me and i loved every moment of it. there were times i would just boot up the game to just walk or drive around to just live in it for the time"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"what a beautiful video this is, a true love letter. sharing your emotions and about your depression, i can relate so much to this, i was close often in my life to end it all but decided to push through it. you had me crying instantly talking about jackie and seeing panam, hearing the pl song had me in absolut tears. i never was as emotional as playing cyberpunk 2077, it's the best story game for me. i'm on my way to get my diagnose for adhd and autism, i'm 37 years old and just started to live my life. if you struggle and you read this please don't stop fighting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-03,"game has changed me at my core. instead of fearing the obvious coming dystopia here in real life, i say let's face it head on, and take it over.... also has helped me through a deep depression."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-27,"holy fuck dude i literally got shivers down my spine at the intro around 340, i'm so glad we're finally talking about the wonderfullness of this cyberpunk world, i too cant get my mind off it and am in such awe just like you wonderfully put in words. thank you so much for this video, this game deserves all the love there is"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,"i get you. i played old version many times with all it's flaws. night city is the best built city in any video game. seriously it makes other developers look like they are not even trying. the city just feels alive. when i play i never go from point a to point b. i explore, parkour and sometimes just stand and look around for minutes. when you go to city center and corpo plaza the absolute size and marvel of the city hits you hard. makes los santos laughable. you can honestly look at city as it's own character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-24,"the phantom liberty theme played through the end credits is now one of my favourite pieces of music. also, that end credit sequence had a very james bond movie vibe to it. a very intelligent and thoughtful essay, choom. i could hear the passion, love and sensitivity in your voice. i'm in my early sixties as a kid, there was no cyberpunk, just sf  f. even personal computers were a thing of fiction, let alone that the new pc sitting on my desk is probably more powerful than a super computer of the 1970's was. thankfully, i've never dealt with depression or other mental health issues. i once described myself as chronically well adjusted and generally content, if now downright happy. oddly, i think my real life almost nomadic childhood had something to do with that. moving so often, i became very good at adapting and letting go of what was left behind. a brief stint in the canadian armed forces equipped me with endurance and selfdiscipline. that service is also what lead to my deepest connection with v. of course, i have tried all possible endings in both the base game and expansion. the one that hit me hardest was when you take the cure from the nusa and find yourself unable to use cyberware, becoming just a face in the crowd. as a very young soldier i'm talking 17 to 18 years of age i was capable of doing things my nonmilitary friends weren't. it sometimes made me feel more than human. but over the years my spine curved and gradually became worse. it continues to get worse every year. it has taken away a lot of my physical ability. so like v after being cured, i find myself remembering what it was like to be so damn good, but now i've lost it all and i'm just another face in the crowd. but i persist i have endurance, i am stubborn and for crying out loud, there's just one more thing i need to do in one game or another before i go! lol keep up the good work. you've got a good head on your shoulders. if your videos cast a new ray of light and hope into even one person's life, then you've done the world a good turn."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"platted the game just yesterday after starting over with the 2.0 update . had the game since launch and experienced so few issues, even on my old ass ps4. throughout all of the controversy, i've sung the praises of cyberpunk and cdpr, and phantom liberty and the experience of platinuming the game really cemented the game as one of my favourites of all time. this video expressed everything i've been feeling about the game recently. great job dude!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-30,"im still obsessed with it, any news on the game, updates, etc, im just infatuated with the lore of cyberpunk, its intricate. glad i recently bought it after refunding it years ago, introduced me to the show, so im even more into it, but just in general, the entirety of it doesnt ever bore me"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,thank you so much for making this video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-25,"i love every single part of this video, the music, the image, the narrator with a touching end that i can relate to, everything is so perfect doing justicie to my actual favorite game right right now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,i feel you so much. i literally cant tell what about this game has me so enamored. i fell in love with all the characters to the point where it actually saddens me to see them after their questlines when they just repeat the same 3 lines i fell in love with night city and i dont think ill get over it anytime soon
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-27,i did only 1 playthrough and now i'm waiting for a little longer in order to forget as more as possible before my next playthrough. definitely the best game for me as well. watching shogun recently reminded of cp 2077 because i got stuck with that feeling after finishing the show. very well written and presented characters makes you care like they are your real friends.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-15,"107 i bought a 3090 to be able to play this game at 4k60. bought the game at release, got through the glitchy prologue, then proceeded to put the game down until edgerunners came out two years later. edit when i picked it back up, i fell in love. wasn't this obsessed with a game since witcher 3."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-04,"love this take on cyberpunk. i knew it was special when i started playing it the day it came out, even with the shaky launch. its absolutely one of the greatest games ever made. phantom liberty absolutely knocked my socks off and felt like a whole new game in and of itself. its extremely rare for a game like this to come around i think, and im thrilled to have both been able to experience it and to continue to experience it in more playthroughs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"this was my first aaa video game, not counting myst, old atari st games, or pong! so imagine my shock  awe when i discovered cyberpunk 2077 last december on yt. having worked in blender 3d, i was impressed with the realism. but as a mac user, i thought i could never play this game... until i discovered crossover, which allows me to play on my mac m2 in 4k native with no upscaling, which blew my mind! i even got dlss working and archive mods. i completed several endings, cried deeply, and then continued until all quests  gigs were completed. i was still not done and went to night city daily. i now have over 1000 hours and continue to explore. i can't get enough! the music got me, the visuals are amazing, the writing is rich, and the cyberpunk fashion is so cool. ive never experienced anything like this and its changed my life. i dont think ill ever be over this, not until they release orion. i now paint my nails like valerie, i bought a cyberpunk sweatshirt, night city keychain, cyberpunk credit card skins, an official cyberpunk led sign, and bumper stickers! my music tastes have changed due to the game, too! it makes me see precursors to 2077 all around today, such as homelessness, urban decay, neuorolink, robotic arms, corporate behavior, guns, and violence the game is so thoughtprovoking. and they spent 437 million to date  totally awesome! i will never be the same and still cannot stop exploring and experiencing night city! hello, my name is wendy and im a cyberpunk addict!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"i've always loved the cyberpunkvaporwavesynth wave aesthetic, so that's what ultimately made me want to buy this game. i waited until the 2.0 update, and even though it took me a while to really get going i don't normally play open world games, but again, the aesthetic intrigued me, i finally got into the game during holiday break. maaaan i'm addicted! the story, the side quests, the looting, the cyberware and net running, the characters, the slang, and just the experience makes me feel like i'm in a totally in a new world. i found myself playing the game literally all day into the late night during holiday break. i'm still on side gigsquests right now, and still have yet to play the dlc, but i have a feeling i'll be playing this game off and on for a very long time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,ff7 was my favourite game of all time from 1997 till cyberpunk came out. its just an amazing game and an amazing world to be in. i love just walking around the city.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-17,"i love it the same way and i was delighted that you transitioned between quiet moments and most complicated characters with a clip of that conversation with reed. probably my favourite scene in any game, ever. pl's main cast is phenomenal. i love how alex and reed make v feel like a naive newbie, despite her legendary exploits outside of dogtown. that look alex gave me when i said sure, who doesn't love playing dressup and she just goes .... preem."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,"this franchise, this game and it's accompanying netflix anime, surprised me the most because of its character and world writing. never have i opened up an open world game before and became so attached, so enamored by the people and the locations i've been. closest is mass effect, but even that felt like deep down, i know it's a game here in night city, i really can let my mind run wild and think these are my friends, and these are our struggles and i love every moment of it. i'll never ever forget you johnny, panama, judy, jackie. fml i'm getting teary eyed again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,"i can't stop digging night city  jackie wells me neither, choom. me neither.... as much as i hate night city...it feels....kinda like a home."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,i simply cant describe how great of a video you created. it baffles me that you only have a few thousand subscribers.. thank you for your time and passion to create videos like these! this is exactly what youtube was made for! and to grab the core aspect of the video yes  cdpr made a very magical game that is unique in a lot of ways! an experience par excellence. xy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-02,"who would've thought a game with rdr2 level writing, doom level gameplay, an insane soundtrack, and an occasionally beautiful dystopian world would be unforgettable. i don't blame you i love this game to death."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-24,"totally agree, cyberpunkk 2077 has been a game that has marked me in my life. this game came at a key moment in my personal development my time as a student was coming to an end and i had to face my independence as an adult in a new city far from my family and friends. and this game accompanied me on this hard road of growing up, it helped me when i started to feel lonely, when i failed in my first job, when i didn't know where my place was and it taught me that you have to enjoy the small moments with the people you care about and to take care of them. it also taught me that ambition, in many cases, is an empty dream that does not bring happiness. for all this and more, thank you v and night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,"this kinda described me too, i played it a little after its release date and even with all the bugsglitches, i saw the vision. i played it every day, just exploring the world and feeling fully immersed in its world and story. i got a little tired of it for awhile and then phantom liberty came out, ever since that dlc came out i cant stop playing, ive already beat it multiple times, and i still find new things about the game. even with so many playthroughs i still take my time every time i play it and i cant say that about any of my other favorite games. the game usually pops in my mind at least a few times a day lol. great video man!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-20,wait why does this vid only have 700 views?? its so fuxkin good!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-26,"cyberpunk 2077 is such a good game, the world cdpr built and its atmosphere is just above perfection ! i cant wait to play the sequel in few years !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-21,pretty much agree with everything in the vid except for how they handled jackie. don't get me wrong he's a great and likeable character but v's relationship with him felt pretty rushed. i would've really liked to have more time spent with him at the beginning instead of just a minutelong montage and a time skip.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,"speaking of being grounded in our world, i just noticed at 1527 that exact scene is directly inspired by  borrowed from a spot along the 10 freeway outside of los angeles headed towards palm springs in southern california, a place that feels more and more like a corporate dystopian hellscape every day."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-09,"bought this game a while back when new reviews starting coming out, talking about what an improvement it was compared to the launch. i never got to playing it though for various reasons. after seeing your video i knew i had to play it soon i skipped the spoilersections. i love games where you feel immersed in the city, where you don't feel like you're playing a game. thanks for the motivation to boot up the game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-19,"i used to shit on this game a lot during release cus i was reasonably hyped and we all know the launch day state, but update 2.0 changed my mind plus pl, now it sits on one of my most fav games. the customization, weapon balancing, new weapons, etc. and just being stable, it became as it should've been at launch date."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-23,i can live in this game. when i'm bored of every other game i go back to it  just like skyrim. day off work? cyberpunk. ill? cyberpunk. depressed? cyberpunk. waiting for orion now and believe me i will be booking a week off work when that drops.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-11,"im super late to this video but i also need to say im obsessed with this game, the characters, the stories, the environment, the music, etc is all just so amazing. i swear every time i come back to this game i have to do everything, i have to do every gig, every sidequest, get every weapon, get every vehicle, get all 60 lvls and it takes me a pretty long time but i enjoy every second of it. i wish they had made more than one dlc bc phantom liberty was so good but i understand and it makes me that much more excited for the next entry into this universe."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-20,this video was amazing. i was blown away by the professionality this video had compared to how little your channel was. just recently got absolutely roped into cb2077. finished my first playthrough about a week ago and got the panam ending and really didnt explore much and just worried about the main content of the game itself and still thought this game was a masterclass. after watching more and more videos like this ive come to realize this game is amazing. endless opportunities. keep it up man im definitely subscribing after this!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-03,"amazing video, thank you short g, one of my fav moments in cyberpunk 2077 is when you get the cut scene with jackie and v smashing through night city as proper pimps, collecting wonga etc. good vibes, cannot wait for the next....... game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-20,thanks babe. i am happy to be starting this game right now after it has been fixed since it's rough launch. this video is just making me more excited to dive into night city!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-04,"well, having been going through my own cyberpunk binge as of late. finding this video has been so great because it resonates so well with me. much like you, i had originally gotten the game on last gen. i got lucky enough to get a refund and play on pc. through spoilers, bugs and all i dived in. this game is just such an amazing slice of a universe you just can't help but throw yourself into. amazing video by the way, great work, much love from michigan!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-25,"agree 100 percent, the world and characters are so well realised, i couldn't get over how raw and real the characters were. i was in from launch and i'm glad i stayed along for the ride."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-17,"first of all, thank you for the great video about cyberpunk. i recently unpacked the game again and i have to say i fall in love with the world again every time. in addition to all the missions, i love wandering around the city and just looking at everything, always good for an adventure"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-09,"the graphics, the city, the vibe, the friendship, the relationship, the lighting, the ambience, the feeling to stand in the big city with futuristic cars, billboards, neon lights everywhere. wow. the weapons and items. the fight style and dynamics. it all just feels so incredibly alive. you can go to every npc and talk to them. i mean yes the answers are quite boring and i wish we could interact even more with the world, enter the buildings or talk to npcs. but cyberpunk is just an awesome expirience. i just cant get enough of this city and vibe. i love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-08,i love that so many people have this fascination with this world everything about it swallows me every time i witness it it feels comfortable
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-07,"man, i understand. once i got into this game, it just consumed me completely. this is such an awesome experience. i love everything abou it and one can easily just imerse himself in it so deep, its crazy. the amount of detail, content and overall quality is insane. ive just started dlc and holy shit. cant stop just walking around and drool over that graphics and everything. true next gen."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-06,"that's actually insane that you and i had extremely different experiences in phantom liberty. i never have seen this scene you shown in this vid before. instead, so mi and i got to the spaceport to send her off in space so she can get operated on. mr. blue eyes is helping fund her survival yet i was confronted by reed and unfortunately he knew what i had to do. i killed him and president myers practically has a hit on me. that's crazy you could have an extremely different ending. and i played this game for well over 600 hours. that's what blew my mind the most in this vid. excellent stuff dude"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-15,somehow burning bright in a city with now happy endings seems to just be such a breathtaking experience. never fade away
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-15,"cyberpunk will allways have a special place in my heart, played it on launch on a pc and the story was so dam good. during that time my grandfather was on his deathbead and died 9 days after this game launched. this was my escape.... i dont normally replay single player games but... ive played this game over multiple times and i still love it every single time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-27,i'm glad it's not just me that's obsessed. really relatable video.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-05,"i myself have several save files on cyberpunk. edgerunners was the reason i decided to play the game and boy did i play it. i remember doing 3 different play throughs back to back after phantom liberty and having to physically stop myself from starting another one. i made myself stop playing for almost a year until just recently, and once i stepped back into this elaborate and imaginative world i still loved every second of it. the characters, the lore, the combat, despite its hardships in development ive loved from the beginning. theres just something i cant describe about getting fully immersed in night city, it never gets old. this truly is a special franchise with so much potential"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-30,"this games been on my mind since the e3 announcement, it got even more so when i got to finally play it, it was a game that released in a horrific year for me but i thought whatever happens, ive got that to look forward to, it gave me peace after a long year and im forever grateful for it. moments like the skye clouds conversation are where i truly fell in love, i had to shake myself because i was so immersed in the scene and i didn't want it to end, and i remember being in awe during pieces, what a quest that is, all 4 of the character questlines were also a huge highlight for me, especially judy's and panam's, this game took over my life so much that i started getting into the tabletop lore and the beauty of it is, the more you know, the deeper this game's story becomes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-20,"i also love how a sort of end times we might of imagined for our future is so subtilely but hugely playing a part in the whole theme. theres so many references to a sort of prophetic biblical end times its crazy, down to hearing homeless people that probably cant afford cyberware talk about the mark of the beast to seeing a preacher on a tv talk show struggle with the morality of cyberware, to even being attacked by drugged out hobos going on about mark of the beast and the devil and all that. cyberpunk is such a trip at every angle man."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-30,awesome video man you really hit the core experience of playing cyberpunk
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-19,i used the plan b for a good 20 hours of gameplay before i realized it was shooting my money lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,"me with around 650k eddies yeah sure why not, its not like im wasting ammo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-19,plan b is legit a great gun to keep around for when you run out of ammo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,seraph is goated its a fucking warhammer bolt pistol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,"you can also, if you missed any iconic weapons, buy them in the stadium in dogtown."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-24,by the time i realized plan b was robbin me i was all outta eddies
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-17,"i used black unicorn up til the point i got byakko, and i did each gig onebyone, oneatatime for each fixer across night city... so you can imagine how long that took..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-17,i use jackie's guns they are a beast
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,i just got headhunter like this morning and its honestly the most fun ive had with a throwable weapon.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-18,what did silverhand do in deshawn corpse? is that a middle finger?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,me whos been rocking the kongue or what ever yorinabu arasakas pistol is from the start... all my iconics be collecting dust my guy

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,byakko is op for sandy melee builds. its unique effect lets you just mow down enemies
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,"there are also a bunch of iconics that you pick up from dead enemies, like moron labe and psalm 116"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-19,"some of the iconics dont even go on the wall, actually soul crushing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,"when i collected plan b from dexs body, i sold it to a weapon vendor on northside, but not just because the gun simply take eddies, but also because it was a perfect way to punish dex for being the catalyst of what v had to go through with the relic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-28,every time i go out and find dex i mimic hawking a loogie at him irl its just muscle memory
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,bro you just saved me from going bankrupt with the plan b one like i was wondering why i had 100k bullets and kept loosing money

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-25,netrunners lol weapons....hey watch me cook this guys brain.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"i did a hyper immersion play through where i only had weapons realistically carried at once but when you go back to your house before a mission to grab on of those off the stash display for it, feels pretty bad ass"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-27,"good to see this game actually became something years later. i hope it gave you all the spark it promised me, but never delivered."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-28,if you missed any iconic weapongear phantom liberty has a weapons vendor that sells them
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-27,"when i first played cyberpunk and got dying night i didnt realise that it was an iconic and uncrafted it, since i was still on a buggy version i never got the crafting recipe for it and now my main save is missing one single weapon to complete my stash wall"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,most op wepons has to be the double barrel shotgun with a tech that dismembered enemies when you shot them on the leg. always 1 shot kill
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-15,headhunter is my favourite throwing knife tbh its perk pairs so well with sandy builds
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,absolutely loved plan b. had millions so i never ran out of ammo.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"nihan and satori are found during the konpeki heist, if you miss them they can be bought in dogtown stadium market"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-18,i love the plan b and i paired it with a katana

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,that panel of him pouring his wine over banner's head was mad disrespectful lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,"shooting money is smart, it just skips the step of having to buy ammo, and it could still probably kill somebody"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,the two knives are and 1 other weapon which i still don't know where to get from are actually the only two weapons that i still needed so thanks!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,man i love using sereph it just looks so cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-20,"if you are looking for a good run and with some fun guns, smart guns are a good choice if you're running intelligence and cool"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-27,too bad it'll just collect dust in your stash. i'm dead
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,a true man knows the value of ammo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,seraph is the best handgun for silencer attachment...hits hard  overall pretty good stats
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-14,"i played this game on old gen on release and still had a great time, played through twice i need to replay it on new gen with all the updates that have happened."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,"headhunter  dex's pistol with a silencer is mad fun stealth build. hit the head, then blast em for good measure lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,byakko is so fun shit swings so fast if you have all the perks for it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,"with my pistol and katana build, byakko and seraph is a beast to use."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,probably  i mostly use johnny's gun and the window maker
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,byakko and seraph are the reason i even got to dogtown they just go hard af

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,ayo whats that red katana? that looks sick
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"don't forget about la chingona dorada, jackie's guns. you can get them by returning to his ofrenda sometime after doing the actual quest where you take part in his ofrenda. you have to have the quest done, but you don't get them as part of the quest, it also counts as finding them in the open world. it's the only iconic weapon you can naturally have two of because jackie doubletriggered them, and they have a cool passive that gives you extra ammo everytime you equip the gun, scaling with how many headshots you hit, which means you can switch between them constantly and keep getting extra ammo and never run out of bullets. assuming you hit the headshots, ofc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-19,"so ur telling me i was missing weapons in my stash bc i refuse to buy anything from vendors and exclusively only use weapons from quests, loots and enemy corpses? makes sense."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,this is the reason why newgame plus would be an amazing addition. then people could have the stash and also for personal use
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,besides the gig ones. you can also buy them at the dog town black market vendor
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i'm like 25 hours in and i've only been in my apartment twice
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,i finished all game with byako dlc included you can feel samurai blood running in your veins by that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-04,its called plan b because you can use it when you are out of pistol ammo. plus eddie's are easy to come by by the time plan b is available. great starter weapon to grab after ghost town
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,my last playthrough was a byakko based build with sandy and it was just devastating. used achilles xmod2 with chimaira core as my secondary for distant gangoons who needed zeroed. fun weapon
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-06,"the phantom liberty tlc ads quite a few weapons that can be added to the stash, and most of them are bought from what i recall"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,i dont know why but el capitan was my favorite character in cyberpunk the bloody maria was just a bonus
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-07,"i played the older version of cyberpunk when it first came out, and back then, iconic weapons had serious damage potential. unlike now, you had to raise your tech skill in order to craft high quality items a feature i kinda wish they brought back and as a result crafted epic and legendary weapons did some serious damage to cover the opportunity cost. iconic weapons in particular, however, had some absolutely wild powerscaling back then, and in most cases getting any given iconic weapon from common to legendary quality would often give it a dps of well over a thousand. i started replaying the game recently and now i feel like i rarely touch the iconic weapons, which makes me feel bad because they often have some pretty interesting gimmicks behind them fenrir is op lmao."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,plan b is gooooated. my main gun when clearing an entire base with no one knowing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-29,"goddammit i wanna play again now, favorite game of all time hands down"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-06,plan b has an insane amount of ammo. i had over 50k worth of rounds at one point. sereph is one of my faves because of the explosive rounds
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,i never paid attention to the fact plan b shot eddies
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,seraph has been my favorite stealth handgun
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,you can also find rebecca's shotgun from edgerunners in a bush beneath the giant goldfish hologram in arasaka plaza
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-08,comrades hammer crafting spec is found at a ncpd scanner event and besides messing around when you want to blow stuff up i haven't really used it in any of my playthroughs

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"the ba xing chong too, which you get by beating the game and returning to the locked room on the ebunike. you won't find it's outline on the stash wall, since once you put it in your stash it adds its own frame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,"i had a bug recently with some or all iconic blueprints being made available in my crafting menu again after i crafted all of them before, so now i have some duplicate iconics, which suits me because i like my wall complete but i still wanna take psalm and fenrir for a ride!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"i took the gun from arasakas room in the beginning have upgraded to legendary, and the thing is a freaking beast. its got like 80 damage."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,i was so disappointed to find out this wasn't an achievement filling up the stash wall

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,i can't believe john wick was the bay harbor butcher
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,"headhunter with saburo the katana you can snag from saburo's air shuttle during the heist along with the knife on his person those 2 weapons are such bread and butter for any pure samurai build. silent range, and deadly close combat sword that isnt a akin the a nerf sword with the painted branding on it. also komadore cannon probably botched it was a goated pistol pre 2.0, capable of 1 shooting just aboit anything, but still serves as a pocket cannon in a pinch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-14,"bro, i just wanna give a shout out to this game with having really bad ass weapon animations. like when you pull out a gun or knife, you havent used before and you do like a thorough inspection or you flip the knife or you run your fingers across the sword like its just hella cool"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,i actually use seraph with a suppressor! it's a really good weapon for a stealth build
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-02,or if you have the dlc go to the legendary vendor in the main social and he sells them all that you've missed mission wise
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,"i'm working on getting all of the stash guns, i'm down to i'm pretty sure only two left to craft from the organized crime alerts, but i completely missed two of the weapons, i got second in the shooting tournament so i didn't get the prize gun, and i didn't realize i could grab the cleaver at the start of the voodoo boys section. and unlike just about every other weapon in the stash, you can't go back to get them. hell, even saboru's sword and knife can be collected later if you know how to break into konpeki. that being said, i don't have phantom liberty, so i might be able to get them at the black market weapon vendor, though the wiki doesn't say they're there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,"seraph felt like a wh40k bolt pistol for some reason, the fire rate and the oomph it has is similar"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-06,byakko never left my inventory after i got it love that sword
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,"headhunter is my main weapon, love that thing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,"plan b is actually my main pistol, the bonuses are nuts and i usually have 6 figures of eddies. after a majority of fights, i will have spent less using plan b than if i were to just buy ammo afterwards."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,"plan b is good to use and actually inflict toxic damages, one of the best weapons in terms of toxic damages and if you have lits of eddies, it wont bother u. it is my 11th game and i still use it as my main weapon"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-14,the gun that shoots money instead of bullets is like shooting a .50 cal irl
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-23,"hey hey hey now i actually use seraph, beautiful gun"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-26,i was not aware it shot eddies in my first playthrough. i just saw it high ammo count and assumed it could shoot all ammo types.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-20,"i use plan b a lot in my campainssorry for this i have bad english is a very god weapon for stealth builds and gunfigther builds, it only costs like 1 ediz per shot, its very reliabke, if you have a good source of income you basically have infinite ammo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-10,damn he really chose that quiet life. a bit too quiet if you ask me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-30,i remember picking up a low level sniper that could shoot through walls. went through the entire game with that thing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-05,"if you run a stealth build, plan b is actually pretty good. i always run it because selling a few guns will net me several hundred rounds of ammo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-23,i had no idea headhunter was one of the ones for the stash. i've been using it for the past like 5 hours of gameplay cuz it's cool
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,"i just used plan b, i dont miss a lot so 200 hs bonus made up the few eddies spent of bullets"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,one of the main reasons was because of edgerunners
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,from a buggy mess at launch to a total masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,"in my honest opinion, soundtrack artstyle and gameplay are the 3 reasons why this game is a masterpiece. the story is also good, but the surrounding elements allow the best delivery"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-26,the fact when u take 2nd playtrought its totally different
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,"replayability should be above 10... like 1310. with how incredibly vast the differences can be from one playthrough to the next is insane. 7 playthroughs in now, 1100 hours ..... still finding new things and types of playstyles i haven't tried."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-24,"i wish the clothing choices and character design were better but other than that, its a good game"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,the chicken game reference is to back to the future. marty was fated to lose a street race to needles causing him to have a horrible crash with another vehicle. through his character growth he ended up backing out of the race and changed his future. btw his girlfriend jennifer was in the car with him.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"i think they've seen that the approval of 2077 has turned around, phantom liberty and edge runners boosted the ip massively and the next entry is definitely still a while away. releasing updates keeps 2077 in the spotlight while orion, whatever it may be, is developed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"subcontracting studios to work on updates to kill bugs and convert mods while the main studio is working on new projects is a pretty good idea. probably more than just a single patch in the works this way, and it keeps community focus on the game and studio for longer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"i personally would love a fixer update, just to get random gigs just to feed into that immersion of being a merc. they dont have to be flushed out but like, a bounty here, pick this up there. just felt weird after finishing all the fixer gigs they kinda just disappear, never reach out again"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"im so glad that cdpr is willing to fund work, by virtuous or anyone else, to keep cyberpunk development officially active. its a great game that deserves a longer lifespan."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,the movie reference is back to the future! needles is the punk that races marty mcfly marty crashes and breaks his hand. marty also hates being called chicken.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,the cat interaction isnt new i came across that about a year ago in a playthrough i was gonna make a post on reddit about it but i figured people already knew about it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"cyberpunk deserves attention up until the day orion releases, imo. its a magical game. i hope cdpr keeps the good times rolling."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"blue glass is a hallucinogenic drug that makes you see colors kind of like a kaleidoscope, not to be confused with the drink blue grass. confusing, but there you go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"the most rational explanation for the future of the game considering they outsourced the latest update was as a reallife testing the abilitiescapabilities of virtuous to deliver. they agreed on a small update with many little additions but technically diverse to assess their abilities. if they pass, they work on something bigger... so well, a riskreward assessment i would say."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"because of how popular phantom liberty was, this patch was prolly a test of a larger xpack. good way to let a developer learn the tools, and it only be a patch as introductory instead of throw in water for a whole xpack"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"cool update and an interesting video, thanks. the cat, however, was not added in 2.2. i'm not sure exactly when it was added, but it's definitely there in 2.13 as is the one in pacifica."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"don't forget that cyberpunk 2077 is releasing on new macs next year. my bet is that virtuos are also the ones working on the port to apple silicon. it's a good idea to keep adding content and updates for a game that has sold 30 million copies plus 8 million copies of phantom liberty and that it's coming to a new platform. they may be even working on a port for switch 2, who knows."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,0124 it's a reference to back to the future
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"why hire an outsource for a patch? i think the answer is pretty much a given. it's a field test for orion. they wanna see if virtuous can handle and respect a cp77 style guide so they gave them a little something to do , and if they are happy it means a bigger part for them in orion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"the whole chicken scene is likely a reference to back to the future. needles is the guy who'd frequently goad marty into trouble by calling him chicken, with marty crashing into a rolls royce being a plot point of the future timeline. and jen fournette referring to jenifer, marty's girlfriendfuture wife"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,013 looks like they still haven't fixed the nuclear flash from closing the map
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,pawel sasko went out of his way to do everything he could to help me past a bug via twitter when pl first came out where my save would randomly wouldnt load on startup cause it would think pl wasnt installed when it was. never had a game dev go out of their way like that. i didnt tag him either. he spent a good chunk of time too helping too.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,i would love it if they would give us cyber arms customisation option. also new hairstyles.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,cdpr is working mostly on the witcher. third party is probably working on cyberpunk updates
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"cat has been in the game prior to 2.2. i've triggered this as far back as when phantom liberty released, i'm not sure but it could be even older."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"across the street from the clothing store that's near the chicken event, there's a ncpd mission with a bunch of netrunners you'll be up against. pretty cool"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,it's also likely the add some tiein content base off the new showanime in the future just like they did for edgerunners.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"needles seems like a back to the future reference. they race after marty gets called chicken, which he hates. jennifer is the girlfriend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,bro your cyberpunk content is helpful and informative but these thumbnails gotta stop man
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"another reference is that one of the new quadra cars, the jen rowley, is a reference to the famous dukes of hazzard car, the general lee."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,218 fucking thank you for confirming this. i didn't get why twintone was a thing and guessed that there had to be cars with unique skin that we could otherwise not replicate through crystal coat ourselves.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,you have no idea how much i look forward to your videos. love finding new cyberpunk 2077 content!!! thank you!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,its back to the future!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,love this approach. each new updates makes me and new folks play it more. keep em coming!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,this cat you mentioned was there before. but i have so many saves that it's possible that they removed it and added again with this update. i forgot he existed until this video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,"if they give us more cyberpunk 2077 content i would be very happy. if we get another expansion, even if not on the level of pl, i'd be so excited i couldn't post about it on it without being censored."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,its a back to the future reference. 138
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"458 that cat was there in 2.1, maybe even 2.0. i saw him months ago. edit i found the cat on march 19th 2024, whichever patch number that was."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"the first one is a clear reference to back to the future. marty, jennifer, needles  all characters from bttf part 3, referencing the street race at the end of the movie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,my guess is that they outsourced the update to the other studio because they're working on something else. maybe a little something with orion in the name
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,"i wish they'd release something like skyrim's content creation kit for cp77 so we can take modding to the next level and add completely new environments, characters, quest lines and more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,needles was played by flea in back to the future 2 and 3 maybe 1 but for sure the other two and he got wrecked trying to force marty into a drag race
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"i kinda wish they didn't abandon this engine, yeah ue5 is great, but this engine was also just awesome. if they worked on it i bet it would have been an engine you wouldn't want to mess with. but ue5 does give them the chance to not worry about developing an engine and just focus on making the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"new game plus, a mission to the moon and have a mission with lucy. that's all i want next"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,the secret race is a back to the future reference. marty as in marty mcfly gets a serious car crash racing with needles. this was in back to the future 2
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,marty mcfly hurt his hand playing chicken with needles in back to the future two
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,bro has the best cyberpunk thumbnails in the history of thumbnails
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,you kinda forgot a really simple major reason why you do an update now. its to sell more copies of the game after the sales go down. its also right before christmas. its very smart. plus no gta6 for awhile. so i never got why they would have stopped with updates. they have a huge runway here to keep people buying this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,i loved the npc addition to photo mode. it made me use it more. i was disappointed they didn't add alex tho....i love hershe was a main character...she doesn't get enough love
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"to be honest red engine still considered as state of art engine and cyberpunk easily beats so many modern releases with its excellent graphics. personally i've never understood why cdprojekt decided to not continue dlcs and ditched their red engine after working so long on it. with a second season of edgerunners and more good dlcs they could easily continue for years and even make the game more popular. it doesn't make sense to me, perhaps they changed their mind too and there could be a dlc cooking.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,the chicken game reference is for the back to the future movies...mainly part 3 and referenced in 2015 future timeline.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"marty and needles are back to the future reference where needles and marty race and marty has a crash, with his gf jennifer in the car. but in the real timeline, marty backs out of the race, thus never crashing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"so they add balatro easter egg to cyberpunk, nice"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"love the video, a small thing though, can you use chapters instead of timestamps in the description? youtube only recognizes the chapters then i think"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-30,231 that chameleon skin is called pearlescent and the rainbow one iridescent
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,the chicken race is probably a reference to james dean's movie rebel without a cause from 1955 where a car drives over a cliff when a chicken race goes wrong and the lead antagonist who dates the leading lady dies.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,that was a back to the future reference needles convinced marty to do things usually making marty mcfly pay the consequences
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"just an fyi, the chameleon skin you're talking about at 225 is called pearlescent paint, its a real thing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"the chicken race reference is based from the movie back to the future 2 and 3. the protagonist marty doesn't like to be insulted in that way, so he race against needles and lost his ability to play the guitar due to an accident"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"...needles, marty, and a game of chicken? it's a back to the future reference."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,why cyberpunk videos always have a baddie on the cover smh
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,very cool patch. thx for the list. i would have never known about many of these secrets otherwise.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,go watch the game awards
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-19,"cd projekt reds world building is absolutely insane. the witcher and cyberpunk worlds are the only ones ive been able to fully get immersed in and nerd out. i love it, i love them. favorite video game company of all time and i will always feel that way"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,"i think if it were possible the devs of balatro should hook up with cp2077 further and port balatro into the phone, so you can play it while playing cp2077. you would have to buy it again but maybe they could make it a lot cheaper. gta aswell could do it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,i never thought i would see my motorcycle featured in a video ad.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,"the balatro collab makes me so happy!! really cool to see. loved this type of hunts in other games, botws for example was really cool. well have to see if my 800 hours helps because my memory and orientation skills are very very bad ahahahah"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"maybe they hire them so that cd can focus on their other projects but still give cyberpunk 2077 more love and updates. i mean they have 2 shows coming, they are working on a sequel, and now they announced the witcher 4"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,i love how the secret features add more to the world.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-18,"having a third party provide updates while a sequel is in the works honestly sounds like a great idea. project orion is going to take a while, why would cdpr want the mindshare of the cyberpunk brand to disappear during that time? they could easily sell millions of more units by providing steady updates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,holy that thumnail
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,juicehead a real one for using the ad product irl.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-28,139 needles is the name of the character in back to the future who challenges marty to a drag race. played by rhcp bassist flea.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,animals are rare in night city. theres a dog by the first fixer and the rest of the sigtings are less than 5 all together
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,one thing i noticed in this update i haven't seen talked about is sometimes when you check out yourself in a mirror johnny will be there instead and v will freak out. i captured it on video and only have seen it once though
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,i think a good theory is they want more content for us. i welcome it. i hope they open the game more and put more things to do in it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,another cool feature would be to actually go into other stores that you otherwise wouldnt be able to or even go into joytoy places and participate
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"i once found a really hippie looking van that reminded me of the mystery machine the colors were the exact same, i've yet to see it since so hopefully this update brings some cool vehicle skins to use."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,they may add some stuff from the upcoming live actionanime like they did with edgerunners  davids jacket.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"hey juice congrats on the reference by the man himself. that's awesome, and i'm happy for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"these updates keep the game aliveactive while helping the hype for the sequel. there's are so many activitiesmini games and ops they can to the game, along with new interiors. mod support is the biggest though, needs to happen asap!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,"i read a theory that the cat  510  is a reference to a cat named oscar who resided at the steere house nursing and rehabilitation center. oscar was said to be a death predictor as he would gravitate towards people who would end up passing away shortly after, even ignoring other people to be near that specific person."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"i'm just hopeful we get at least one or two more expansions, like, i gotta be real, i know that 100 hours of gameplay across the base story and phantom liberty is still a pretty significant amount of time, but i'd really like to have more content, and maybe another section of nc to get either expanded, or even a whole new area. like, i'd like to go to the moon or the crystal palace, and i think the fact that the crystal palace has been name dropped as many times as it had been in both the base game and phantom liberty makes me wanna believe we might go to the crystal palace in the near future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,found another cat at the rollercoaster in pacifica  it sits in the entrance where you'd buy tickets for a ride and you have option to feed it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-03,"on the console you can't put pictures in the pictures, it shows that the sibsa slot is occupied, press x and nothing appears"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"the reason they are outsourcing the update is down to them focusing on witcher 4, probably."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,the street race is kind of a reference to needles and marty from back to the future
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"you realy really deserve to be mention in all of the srteams of the games you talk juice, literally the best content creator over this games, follow you since the beggining even i dont comment too mutch, always my like and my recomendation to my friends!, i wish they keep updating cyberpunk until at least we get the oficial mod tools."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,i'm super excited to see where this will lead us.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,i really hope theyre working on a ng. they said they werent planning on one years ago but now that theyre providing more content for the community
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"so, fun fact. in the tabletop, 2020 and red, blue glass is a hallucinogen. every time i see the drink in game i just imagine it was the original thing from the tabletop games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"juice, what they are doing is making cp2078 even bigger, basically going straight from witcher 1 to 3 with this. theyll come out and say, we never expected the response to and demand for this game, so were changing out road map to buy them time for the next one to be the crazy, unbelievable game we were all expecting for 77. shooting for customization like you see in the show and npcs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,great scott
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"i just got back into this game a week ago. i've had it for years, but they kept adding and changing things. i didn't want to play through it, just to have to play through it all over again to experience all the updates. nice to know the game hasn't been altogether abandoned by cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,i honestly thought the whole joker gang thing was a reference to batman beyond! it seems pretty fitting to me!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"level 43, been avoiding water like the plague. didn't even know we could swim lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,"i know people made fun of the going bowling with your cousin in gta 4. but i would actually love a feature like that in this game. something simple, a few new little side actives you could do with some of your companions. drinking at clubs or grabbing a bite would make the world feel a bit more alive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"honestly, this update may not be large, but it did feel like a solid thank you gift."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-16,"i think the why hire an outsourcer for just a patch could be pretty simple. i believe that they were given this project to get them acclimated to the production pipeline, toolchain, and generally working with cdpr as sort of an onboarding task that grew into we could ship this as a patch. my pet theory is that virtuous is assigned to help with orion and their work on the 2077 patch was to onboard them and make sure they have the right headcount for work with orion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"pretty surprising in a good way. if there are more little updates to come until orion is done, i'm with it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"honestly the game still has so much life, we the fans want all they can give and id love to see the just continue to build the world of cyberpunk, theyre is so much lore to build on and stories to tell"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-23,i think thats cool that they still added content to this excellent game while collaborating with another studio like virtuos. it means that they still love their game despite all that happened and still want to make the best experience for the player while being focus on other projects like the recently annonced the witcher 4. i think its a great way to work and it helps their artists to be focused on one project at a time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,"225, i actually owned a 1997 camry while stationed in japan that had a paint job like that. it wasn't as dramatic, but it did changed from metallic gray to green depending on the view angle and lighting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,"i clocked 68 hours in 5 days. if you do the math, it's very very sad. but one of the greatest game experiences of my life and i am old as f. game made me cry like 3 times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-12,"my wife and kids basically didnt see me for a few weeks straight. i started using words like choom and corpo and generally started to see the world very different. this is a master piece, it changed me. and i have seen a lot of games 45 years old, got into gaming when i was 14"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,you can just drive for 10 hrs straight listening to all masterpiece music. lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,very accurate i get scared to play on my days of work because of this lol.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,"so true, cyberpunk 2077 is very immersive"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-06,"cyberpunk 2077 has replaced my life, i feel better in this world"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,why does no one talk about this hardmodded gameplay  flying with a street car over night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-01,the amount of times this has happened to me is insane
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-06,"that was definitely me. but in my defense, a lot of the time was spent driving around, and listening to the music."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,"that was me when i played it first time, except i saw the sun set and rise and set again"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,honestly one of the greatest games ever made imo. i've clocked over 300 hours.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-28,started nov 27. finished the first act by dec 5th. played until nov 12th and finally learned to stop by january. that's dedication
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-08,it's impresive how sucessful a guy can be with exactly the same clips used for every video game ever made.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,this is so very accurate for me i haven't almost been late to work in years and then i started playing this game recently. i just kept pushing back bedtime.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-04,good morning
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,just started it. im loving the game so much.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"it's beneficial to try and buy cyberware early, cause if you wait till later everything is super expensive as they only sell tier 5 legendary cyberware after a certain point and a lot of the time it isn't that much better then the lower tier stuff."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-28,good thing to remember is to kill bouncers at every bar n club for money or perk shards.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-15,just bought cyberpunk as it has a sale going on right now. i'm about to start this game today!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,great guide thank you! don't have the time to start a fresh save and this has helped get back into it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,"you can actually use an old save, you just had to have beaten the last mission and selected one more gig. song bird will call you. edit i know this because that's what i did after looking it up. you've gotta get one of the endings, otherwise they won't call you on an existing game prior to the dlc. so beat game with existing characterplay dlc with said existing character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,got this game day one. got to lvl 20 and forgot about this game. ever since starfield came out my drive for single player games was reignited. now i wanna start this game over and experience 2.0
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,where'd you find the gash grenade at 613? started a new playthrough and that was my favorite. it doesn't show up on any vendors that i can find and the old locations for it only contain clothing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,never played cyberpunk. i have been waiting for it to be fixed and for 2.0 to come out. now i think its time to jump in!!! and quick tips and tricks for a first time ever player? i guess a poss is i dont have to relearn the game before 2.0?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-19,if you hold 1 2 3 default keys keyboard you will lock at your weapon cs style like the first time you eqip a weapon
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,"that is definitely not a beginners guide, as you describe all the new features and not what everything actually does for someone that doesn't know anything about the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-18,"bear in mind, that if you start your playthrough directly from phantom liberty and not from right at the beginning of the game and getting into the expansion from that specific point, you won't have levelled up sufficiently to where you will need to, to get through the phantom liberty expansion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-20,bruh i have no clue about any of this i'm just picking up random guns and shooting people
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-03,"its wild, i havent played this game in months i did that race mission and did it so id get the dudes car for saving his life or what ever and i literally never got the car. this was on xbox series x tho. im on pc now and lol now i can get that car at the clock of a mod lmao"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,forgive what might be a stupid question but if i dont buy the dlc are the developments like the vehicle combat not inputted into the base game?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,this is if you have it downloaded and not the old version on disk?

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-02,you really didnt like that dude you shot in the leg and tossed in the air

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-16,"bro i didnt even know you could do half this shit  good video, ive been playing cyberpunk all wrong, running around like its cod, nothing but assault rifles, smgs, and grenades, as loud as possible every mission lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-03,the fact he clears out the grunts with grace and style then has a gruesome bludgeoning session with matilda's cranium kills me . 451 almost hard to watch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-05,"came to see what the video was about  showing. stayed for the mods aesthetics. your play is smooth af, but those mods got me interested, especially the arms."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-02,impressive! so smooth and relaxing to watch!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-11,thank you so much for making this video. i just remembered why i decided to play this masterpiece. 80 hours in game and it was perfect. thank you for the good impression that u gave me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-15,"if they had more missions, even simple ones would be great"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-12,"i really love just being a ghost and fucking with everyone through the cameras, netrunner is seriously the most fun ive had playing this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-04,i love how you missed that one shot and you let us see it. and i like that this wasn't 10 seconds of preplanned gameplay it's like two straight minutes of trying to get it all perfect. last thing is that some sort of special skin you're wearing?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-04,this is an s tier run of this mission. incredible!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-18,this game is a lot of fun have 250hrs on it only thing i could never understand is why cdpr didn't give us the 3rd person view as we spent hours collecting outfits and building characters but never see them ???
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-10,this is so satisfying to watch. thank you
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-05,"wtf?! you move like a sweaty ttv wraith in apex, yet this is actually incredible to behold. how do you move so damned fast? i honestly can't fathom running into that mission like that, you're the chuck norris of cyberpunk 2077. they need to update the game and add a benjaminwinters to afterlifes drink selection."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,watching this for inspiration before i start playing the game for the first time  d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-06,i'm sorry for ever touching the game it's clearly yours
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-22,"1k hours to practice that run, yea evident"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,great gameplay. if you're looking for more of a challenge though i've been doing a run with no cyberware and it's fun as hell. also no scanner time dilation. stealth finishers is a mod that would compliment your playstyle nicely too.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-11,"this video, and your character was so awesome i watched it more than once."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"after only about 50 hours, i can just walze in there like the terminator and erase everyone in the building in a fraction of the time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-24,"hahaha i just completed this mission, no where near as smooth as your gameplay. amazing how you can diversify a build! enjoyed the video alot"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-02,if that dude gets even more hours thell just immediately drop dead when he enters the building  well played man
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,genious! what a smooth timed movement. oo nice!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-02,this was so fun to watch! educational purposes only
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-31,i would love to see a landscape single angle view of this entire invasion. just watching v fly around the building as bodies start dropping without a single one of the enemies noticing would be the perfect combination of comedy and epicness
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-02,you're a master and i want to understand your mastery. how did the other one die at 237?

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,im pretty sure after 1k hours in cyberpunk i would die inside cuz the endings in this game and some characters dying are just too sad after ending the dlc i felt devasted so hard thats just unreal
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-27,i don't know what the fuck is happening but i can't stop watching either.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-15,this is actually insane and so cool. i only have about 60 hours in this game and know i could probably never do any of this even with the amount of hours you put in.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-28,people need to super dive cyberpunk. i cant state this enough. it is insanely fun when you get deep in to it. ive done so many playthroughs now just fucking around
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-06,bad ass gameplay openin my way trhu the beginin

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-30,"legendary invisibility cyberware, system reset, short circuit, and unalive quickhacks is my go to combo, the game became trivial after that. also bonus for camera control because i can quickhack them without them seeing me. it's how i do most of the stealth gigs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-13,a full length scifi film featuring rowan atkinson and keanu reeves would be an immediate oscar winner.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-22,the part where he's flipping everyone off in the car is incredible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"the middle finger part was simply too perfect. you're a goddamn genius, man."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-28,"are you feeling lucky, punk? should be mr bean's victory lines if we got a game starred him"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-21,"i applaud how insanely this is made man, well done!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-27,"it really is a credit to both the acting of rowan atkinson and the concept of the mr. bean character, a wellmeaning but bumbling man who reacts more with his actions than his words, that he can be placed into any situation or context and will fit in perfectly everytime"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-16,when a video is so good you have to stop everything you are doing to watch it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"i like how the ominous music doesn't start until mr. bean arrives, implying that he is the danger, not night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-11,this is edited so well

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-27,a masterpiece we never thought we needed so bad
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-22,i like the plot idea of a dystopian future where everyone is so bloody useless that mr bean is seen as the only trustworthy crime fighter.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-13,"i've never seen such art before. this is is mind blowing, this is way ahead of its time, this is revolutionary, this is magnificent"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,holy shit this is perfection

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,"his main storyline quest excuse me, i'm looking for my watch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,"remember boys rowan atkinson has a master degree in engineering, this makes mr. bean even more suitable for this kind of story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-15,"a real life rowan atkinson and keanu reeves collab would not only break the internet, but destroy it beyond repair."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"this is just perfect! your videos are absolutely stunning, but i personally love this one because mr bean is my favourite childhood actor."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-16,i love how every single one of those scenes fits mr. bean perfectly
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-16,sad thing is that every masterpiece like this has an end

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-15,"i'm right back to being a kid discovering the internet for the first time when i see a video like this. that's what the internet was for me early 2000's, glorious creations everywhere. things i could never imagine seeing on dvd or on tv."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,the police not reacting to the middle finger was a nice touch.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,wake the fck up mr bean...we have the city to entertain  johnny
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-07-07,not only is he great at editing but his sense of humor is on point too

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-15,holy shit! this was perfect!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-13,"knowing mr. bean, he'd likely survive any life threatening situation in cyberpunk. he always creates and somehow solves his problems in his own weirdo ways."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-15,"you know, mr. bean has mad driving skills. he would actually have a good place here."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-18,makes me wanna watch mr bean and give cyberpunk a 2nd chance 1010

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-04,the amount of effort and care that went into this is incredible. and vbean at the end is perfect profile pic material.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,this is amazing keep it up!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,this actually had me dying. at 049 when he's dancing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-20,haha the editing is amazing. never thought mr bean in cyberpunk was the blessing we all needed
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-15,"so in addition to create amazingly funny videos, you're a killer at matching the lighting of the two excerpts ! great job, again !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"i almost passed this by, because only one person does this kind of thing well. then i realized that it was made... by that person. fantastic work as always!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-25,this was clearly one of the most genius edits ive ever seen. and by todays standards thats afreakinlot lol. well done!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-11,013 the character is tied to the ground better than 80 of 3d games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-02,i know i'm late but i thank you for this genius. never thought that such a perfect combo is needed these depressing days. now we just need mr. bean's theme cyberpunked to fit the game bgm.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"you need a round of applause, this is such incredible work!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-06,"this really brings a smile to my face. as a kid i used to always watch mr.bean and i enjoyed the heck out of cyberpunk 2077, so thank you for this! this is so good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,this is a certified mr bean classic!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-26,every frame is perfection. that rollercoaster thing killed me .d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-14,omg! this is just gold!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-20,"everyting is perfect, the scenes, the humor, the colorlight work, impressive man"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-10,"pure genius! i now have thoughts of mr bean running with a turkey on his head, avoiding gunfire, through a dystopian scifi city, thank you!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-01,"i thought this would be good, but it has way exceeded my expectations. the love for bean shines through."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-08,the editing in this is unbelievable. brings back so many memories too. amazing job!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-09,"as someone who grew up watching mr. bean, this is simply just breathtaking"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,this was breathtaking.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-21,probably the best and funniest editing for a meme i've ever seen
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-01,"first london. now night city. this city is truly lost! as always, love your work. it always brightens my day!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,bean and johnny hanging out looks wholesome.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-13,this mans ability to have some of the most hilarious facial expressions never ceases to amaze me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,this is the most brilliant one of these types of videos i've ever seen.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-09,being a long time mr. bean fan i've gotta say...this is a masterpiece. well done.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-03,the middle finger scene got me good. one of my favorite bean sketches repurposed. bravo!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-03,"i thought seeing rowan atkinson was already a win, but the editing makes this a masterpiece!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-27,can anyone appreciate how good this guy edited this cyberpunk video
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-14,rowan atkinson should be in a game honestly
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-12,amazing how well mr. bean fits right in. and the editing is well done too!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-03,i watched a ton of mr bean growing up. and seeing this has made me so happy. i loved every bit of it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-25,mr bean is just vibing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,006 didn't expect he'd enter that way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-24,this is absolutely brilliant. i've watched it times and times over and it doesn't get old
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"the editing is out of this world. i struggle to imagine how much work was put into this video, this is what makes the internet so amazing. good job!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-21,118 me after watching edgerunners
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-17,"i am surprised that mr bean survived all the way to the end. mr bean is a legend, no cap"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-13,amazing. you placed mr. bean in more realistically than half the characters in the initial release. the lighting. the weight. the hilarity! well done.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-03,"i have to say, the editing quality and the timings are outstanding, it fits just so well"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-02,"this is comedy gold, you make stuff that is new i have not seen this on yt done so good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-16,this is truly epic! hope we see more bean's variations d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-25,"if this was the actual trailer for the game, i'd have bought it in an instant. glitches would be way funnier that way."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-19,"the editing is the real selling point here. props to you, man!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-19,i truly love when people make theses kinds of videos with me bean!!!! incredibly funny
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-11,this meme is so finely crafted. you can almost feel the love poured into it. subbed.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-01,this guy never misses!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-16,110 im crying
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-09,marvelous content as always
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"some incredible editing work as usual, i have no idea how hard it must be to make these videos! they're some of the most incredible things on the platform currently"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-14,"this is probably one of the best things ive ever seen created on the internet in my life.. ok maybe mostly because i love mr. bean so much .. but nonetheless, this is really awesome!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,your edits are so well done. i literally dont see this quality anywhere else on youtube when it comes to green screen editing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-30,"oh maaaan, this is the first video that made me enthusiastic about finally trying out cyberpunk 2077!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-22,"i always thought that v, after getting revived, became a high functioning cyberpsycho, but this reasoning is more in line with how soulkiller works"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-22,"i think depending on how you play v, there could be an argument that they're a high functioning cyberpsycho"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,i think someone said it best the players is vs cybersycosis
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,honestly any player bored trying to see how many stars they can get without dying is a cyberpsycho
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-22,"david also was special not going cyberpsycho because he had things around he cared about. it was only when lucy became isolated he started twitching, and the cyberpsychosis started. lucy coming back also cured his psychosis. regina jones missions are also all similar, they all lost everything they cared about before going pycho. we have johnny in our heads to maintain our humanity"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-27,"everyone says rip david but no one ever talks about maine's death. his death was so upsetting, even the moments where you see him developing cyberpsychosis.. maine deserves to be talked about more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,silverhand is alluded to as having cyberpsychosis as well multiple times throughout the story
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-23,johnny silverhand is v's mental buffer and what keeps him in check.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,i just realized that the kabuki fighter twins are an opposite representation of v. v is 2 minds and one body while the twins are 1 mind and 2 bodies.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,now a days if you got a lot of cyberware you can go cyber psycho for a moment where the screen will turn orange and youll hear v laughing maniacally
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-05,"i view cyberpsychosis the same way panam explained to me how the panzer worked once you hit a certain amount of tech strain, one mind alone will no longer be able to handle the burden  which means in order to handle more, you need another mind. v and johnny in their chromedout body is just like v and panam hooked up to the panzer, just on a smaller scale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,v is in constant full psycho mode we are the psycho that controls v
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,"i like to think that cyber psychosis tries to take control of v, but each time johnny shows up and essentially says fuck off, its occupied"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-16,there is times in game if you go on a killing spree that v will enter into a state of cyberpsychosis and just start laughing maniacally
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,the real thing that makes v immune to cyberphycosis is a moral player
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-06,then youve got adam smasher fulfilling his childhood dream of being a walking warcrime
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-22,i thought that laugh noises when the screen turns orange everytime i kill people is one of that phase 1 of cyberpyscho.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,v is constantly murdering and talking to a long dead c list rockstar. she's 100 a cyberphsycho
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-08,"it would also be reasonable to assume that the times you lose control, johnny takes over so you end up drinking instead of mass murdering"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,"mike also said johnny is a full blown cyberpsycho his metal arm and pistol would talk to him wanting more blood shed, hard to become something your other half already is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-23,imagine the cyberpsychosis was just the friends we made along the way
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-08,v is almost definitely a cyber psycho off the getgo. you dont mow through hundreds of people and not be whacked on the head.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,"honestly that makes sense, with all the emotions v goes through it makes sense v can power through it, as well as johnny, it honestly brings be back to red vs. blue, in the later seasons, you learn that in order to use advanced tech you need an on board ai to help displace the strain on the brain and body itself, so johnny would basically be a buffer to any hardcore tech without realizing itand yes im aware thats a bit of a long stretch but hey it works."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-05,it certainly helps that v is basically a zombie. hard for your body to lose control of its own functions when its already been killed and is teetering on the edge of deciding whether its alive or not.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-05,v is actually built different
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-18,"cyberpyschosis is not only an overload of cybernetics, its the aggressive amount of cybernetics plus if the person has past trauma, dead relativefriend ptsd, anything"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,i thought the running idea was that v is a high functioning cyberpsycho like adam smasher. both just happen to have jobs that allow them to release their violence in a constructive way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,"i actually got used to johnny being there. if he gets removed, ngl, gonna miss johnny"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-23,"reminds me of adam jensen in deus ex human revolution and mankind divided, he had been immune to the effects of the augmentaitons due to experimentation that happened to him as an enbryo. he didnt need any of the medications to deal with the issues others did."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,in the lore. it's states that johnny's pistol creates a weird cyberpsychosisstate that allows for faster than borgware or mil grade cyber reflexes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-10,"if you really qant to get technical on it, v actually gave his body time to adjust to the cybernetics with how the capacity works in game. david went from 0 to 100 instantly and only kept going after that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,v be built hella different with ol johnny in their head
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-27,it's truly all about the humanity stat in cyberpunk. v has johnny in his head so his humanity stat has simply doubled making him practically immune to cyberpsychosis.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,chooms going crazy from one too many mods while tech priests in m40 plugging dreadnought cannons into their brainstem
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,v was having a fight club moment and it helped him
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-14,silverhand kicked out all the incoming cyberpsychosis probably saying that there's only one dude allowed here and that's him.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,wouldnt have 2 personalities make v already a pshyco ? also depending of the ending you can see johnny change his personality completely. too many questions
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,david im special! v suffers from hallucinations
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-23,"i think the fact that he akready has two personalities means hes already psycho, but a fully functioning one af that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-02,"unironically the way i'd explain it is, johnny is your cyberpsychosis"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-02,david wouldve survived had he dated rebecca instead of lucy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-02,v always having johnny made it easy. it's like always hanging out with your older brother that makes fun of you but also helps you when you need it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,i always figured that it was because soulkiller is constantly 'fixing' overwriting v's brain
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-25,v is already a full pledge psychosis when the player takes over
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,dont forget that soulkiller is also wiping the brain constantly and replacing v with johnny. this could mean some parts that experience cyberpsychosis just aren't there
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-03,david built different v built stupid
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,so can we say thanks to soulkiller?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,v is just built different.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,"wow bro, i had this same question. thanks for the fact bro. peaceeeee"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"that's kinda what i thought. like, v has 2 minds to take the strain of all the cyberware v has"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,sooo basically v has 247 emotional support and that's why he never goes psycho sounds legit
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,because v is v. she's built different
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,choom my v already has cyberpsychosis because i play them
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,can't have the voices in your head win when you got another one's voices to keep them at bay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,rest in peace so mi songbird. i never betray him even i going to die very soon. i gonna give her his freedom any of costs
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"i love that in nc having true friends, family and deep bounds makes you having a tremendous feats because in nc having that is more rare than behind a powerfull corpo or merc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,i see it as the relic constantly trying to repair their brain into johnnys neural network as undoing any potential neural degradation into cyberpsychosis.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"david i'm special v nah, chum. i am !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,v is fueled by johnny's hatred for arasaka neat
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,v and johnny are like major after the '95 movies.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,adam smasher can ypu see me?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,"great you mentioned david's humanity in particular, as that's the derived stat in the cyberpunk ttrpg series what the video game was based on that decides how much chrome you can install before going cyberpsycho. that being said, here's the thing it still damages your humanity and empathy empathy being the stat that decides how much humanity you have. skills that use your empathy stat, being only human perception and conversation within red, are actually negatively affected the more chrome a choom gets. with all that being said, if you enjoyed edgerunners and have some chooms that might be willing to try out the tabletop game, then i totally recommend the precon gig in the cyberpunk edgerunners mission kit!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-16,miraak tries to drive the dragonborn insane but dragonborn already has a voice in his head controlling everything they do.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-10,dude its like the robots from pacific rim thats sick
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"idk, the random killing sprees and wreckless driving is a pretty good sign of being a cyber pycho lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"for adam smasher, i figured it was how little advanced cyberware he actually used. he got a full body conversion, but that's apparently pretty normal. corps offer free full body conversions to employees working in hazardous environments. however, that just means your brain needs to control two arms, two legs, ten fingers and ten toes, which it was already equipped to handle. if you look at smasher, he just has a big metal body, but he still just carries a big gun, shoots it with his hands, and has a rocket launcher on his shoulder. all conventional stuff. he has a sandevistan, but he uses it sparingly. plus, he's been adding tech to himself slowly for a hundred years, not all in a few weeks or months."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i always thought it was a mixture of natural resistance, johnny's engram dilluting the neurological load of the augmentations, and the relic constantly repairing v's brain like it's supposed to."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-24,"bro thos guy really out here causing feels every damn time with either an edgerunners or jackie clip. my boy please, i aint recovered yet lol"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,"actually because of the introduction of phantom liberty you can go cyberpsycho, was one of the new implements in the dlc which added the cyberware requirement bar and if you go over it you can start glitching out and using skills without you physically using them"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-06,"i felt like johnny did not only provide a buffer, but also acted as an anchor, especially as he became less antagonistic towards v."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"dakota  get that guy out of militech fort, but be quiet v   bet"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"it is worth mentioning that david didnt start loosing it till lucy started getting distant. he felt like his love was slipping away. and with it his grip on reality. by the time he learned the truth, it was too late."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-12,me randomly hearing i want to stay at you house gave me vietnam type flashbacks
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,"i always thought he couldn't get psychosis since johnny is slowly shutting his brain down, like making unable to entirely because of it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-16,"i also figured it was a matter of time. v is on a short timer, if they have more years and were decked out head to toe in chrome, they would snap themselves. a lot of the cyberpsychos we fight in regina's missions are war vets that have served full tours with their cybernetics and were exposed for years on end."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,oh yeah thanks for the ptsd trigger straight out of nowhere
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,always having someone to talk to is a really good way to stay grounded when you feel like you're loosing it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"in the tabletop, you can stave off cyberpsychosis by going to therapy. it's no big secret, it's just that most chromed out solos aren't gonna spend hardearned eddies on expensive therapy that could go toward an equally expensive upgrade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-12,v can't go full cyberpsycho because v is an engram in mikoshi that we are riding.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,v gone coocoo after slotting the relic.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,cyberpsycho music playing in a background is a nice touch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-11,bruh tugged my heartstring when he put david and i really want to stay at your house
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-20,excuse me. v is suffering from cyberpsychosis. they have skitz
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-22,"according to the creator of cyberpunk, v has an abnormally high hymanity stat, which offsets the cyberware. essentially, cyberware capacity in game. johnny also helps alleviate it, adding to the humanity stat, along with v having a goal, a mission that keeps them going."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,"honeslty, it's a good reasoning to explain the missing mechanic of cyberpsychosis in the game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,"let's also add that v can withstand and control the blackwall via militech canto mk. 6 essentially making v the most dangerous person, not just in night city, but also in the world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-26,"kinda depends on how you play, because when you reach a 5 star wanted level you will hear dispatch call you a confirmed cyberphyco"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-17,"in short, johnny would humble v so much that he would snap out of a mental illness. i love this game so much!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,in new version your suggestion probably work. but before 2.0 version you could grind all map and install almost everything in vs body
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-22,imagine end game v going full cyberpsycho. good luck maxtac .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-24,"i've always held the idea that johnny helps v run his chrome in some way. they share the body. sensory info, thoughts, and even motor control are shared to varying degrees. it's not a huge leap to think the mental strain of running implants is split between them as well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,in the ttrpg chroming up was for people with high empathy stat. honestly you don't chrome up in the tabletop much because it's expensive and you die pretty quickly. there are no cyberpunk campaigns just oneshots. with a high enough empathy stat you can seriously chrome up with zero chance of psychosis. or for the same price buy a mech suit for zero humanity cost or even better spec into reflexes and guns for free and just call headshots which kills just about everything in universe until your dm decides every enemy npc needs grenades.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-26,"cyberpsychosis i believe is inherently linked to personal experience as much as it is cybernetics. cybernetics interact with your nervous system and brain, so perhaps it's a combination of stress, grief, prior mental conditions, etc. that would cause cyberpsychosis."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"i wish that we could've gone even further with the cybernetics. i'm taking about major changes like replacing limbs, adding limbs, eyes, and even going full borg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,i saw johnny as vs inner angerpsychosis manifesting in johnnys reactions and comments
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-14,"if you take the edgerunner perk, and overchrome yourself, v definitely goes into cyberpsycho mode when you kill enough people, the world turns red, and you can them laughing meniacly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-01,johnny was actually starting to go cyberpsycho before he died he thought his arm was trying to kill him or talking to him or something
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,bro has mental plot armor
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-02,v does get cyberpsychosis but only to an extent  sometimes when you're playing and you overdo it your screen will turn a tinge of yellow and he'll start laughing as you kill people
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-28,"the edgerunner perk basically gives you cyberpsychosis. v is for sure some kind of psycho even before that. who tf thinks any of what he does is okay, and actually does it?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"i started playing cyberpunk 3 weeks ago for the first time and sitting around 100 hours playtime now with phantom liberty just started. i havent had a game which addicted me so hard since rdd2 and im so glad i havent played it before. just expiriencing this story and this world in the state it is right now was fantastic. when it first launched i heard about the bugs an all and didnt check on the game since, so i had no clue what i was expecting but damn this game is s tier"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,nearly half a decade since it released hit me different... damn....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,absolutely worth buying. game changed my life. especially during a time of my life when i thought things would end. the story made me appreciate life so much mofre
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,idris elba is a great actor. you cant go wrong when you employ talent of his calibre.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"i'm playing cp2077 for the first time. started around dec 2024. game is incredible good. story wise, gameplay, music, and a lot more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,dan definitely had a stroke saying idris elba 918
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,this game made me pick up playing guitar again because of samurai. i learned all the songs by ear and even had a blast before all these updates and dlc. been wanting to jump back into it since completing kcd 1. thanks for that push!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,short answer yes ling answer hell yes!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,the story has not changed since release. it's always been goated
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"since launch, i didnt have any issues. i was lucky i guess. but, i always defend cyberpunk 2077. always. even in a domino's pizza, when a random father told me that tha game was bad cuz he saw my cp2077 t shirt. and i said give it a try. i really good. now, im so glad that ppl can finally see, play and enjoy the game, at is best way possible. big congrats to cdpr d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"2.21 patch is most recent. i started playing middle of 2024 and love it. actually, keep starting over before finishing because it is so much fun. the camera maybe cool for some but i shut it off because it kept coming on right in the middle of the wrong places. game is awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,"the design is really good. however, last time when i tried to create a third walkthrough, i started asking myself what the hell am i doing here at 35 years old, in this empty city, shooting random banits?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,when the video on patch 2.2 was made i made a comment on if cyberpunk 2077 was worth playing on ps4 since i wasn't sure when i'd ever upgrade to ps5. that was back in december. with tax return season fast approaching i decided to finally upgrade and will be getting a ps5. i bought the ultimate edition since it was on sale a few weeks ago and despite being on ps4 i've been absolutely hooked on the story and gameplay and can't wait for when i get my tax return. it'll be the first game i install on my ps5.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"started to play cyberpunk nearly a month ago, had an amazing experience! this game is definitely in my top 3i am on my second playthrough rn"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,"i started playing cp2077 a few weeks back and your videos have been super helpful as i explore and get the most out of this game. im so glad the community is still growing around this game, i jumped in at the right time!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,yes its worth it im playing it now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,still waiting for ng 5 years later
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,had a side quest of a guy who had a bad implant and needed a ride to the closest ripper doc. i took him and much later he called and sent some eddys. preen content.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"this is a great and very thoughtful review, thanks"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,i hate that i was a cod only guy for so long. im finally starting to play more games. cyberpunk is next on the list. im glad to hear its now a great game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,817 it warmed my heart when you mentioned far harbor
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"great game, deserves more dlc, vr patch, and a sequel"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"got back into night city since thanksgiving. playing every day ever since. all i can say is, its fuckin nova! preem video, big dan."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"030 it's been nearly half a decade since it's cyberpunk 2077 been released no! no! it cannot have been five years ago already stop it, passage of time! stop! it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,i was one of the ones that refunded it in the beginning. i bought it again when 1.6 came out and im glad i did. one of my favourite games of all time
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-16,i bought this right when they rereleased it and it was on sale for 26 its one of my favourite games of all time. every update just always seems to bring me back man i love this game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"as a pcvr nerd, i hadn't even heard of this games redemption until recently, boy was i missing out, and playing it for the first time with a ps5 controller in 3d on a vr headset brings to life what is quickly becoming my favorite game world setting, despite or partially because of all the dark sides of night city. truly amazing game. wish they hadn't fumbled the launch because a lot of us tuned out and may have missed a masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,it's one of the greatest video games ever made. i sitill consider the mass effect triology as the goat but cyberpunk was just perfect. elements of the game were truly revolutionary too. cd projekt are now at rockstar level. plenty of other devs i love but rockstar and cdprojekt are the absolute top dog gold standard.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"yes, next video"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,i think that edgerunners helped significantly in cyberpunk's redemption too
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,"so glad i waited to dive into the game from the launch troubles to the 2.0 updates, stability improvements and then the expansion, this is how the game should really be enjoyed. unfortunately so many larger rpgs require months or years post launch to get the best experience. the fact that cyberpunk is still used as the standard testing ground for pc graphic performance is a testament to the team at cd project red"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"i'm replaying it right now, and it's fucking glorious, choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,me and buddy randomly started playing it 3 weeks ago. then i saw afrosenju and others playing it. idk why so many startingreturning to it this month
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"started playing it a week ago im at the panam badlands mission around 50 hours in , been doing a lot of exploration and side gigs , i fking love this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"big dan. youtube deleted loads of my subscriptions, yours among them. i have no idea why. you popped up in my feed again and i shot you a like and subscribe."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"started second playthrough last week, definitely a top 3 game of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"we have never seen a game start off so bad during their launch day and then completely change around with patches and upgrades. especially the added phantom liberty, you have to get props to those but never gave up on cyberpunk 2077 you know and keanu reeves who is an awesome actor but also he's considered like a really down to earth really good guy that everybody likes which makes the game pretty badass."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,its an amazing game and has been since phantom liberty. i still playbit now. i would happily pay again to have more dlc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,954 oh oh some one should tell him that cd pr took the esg pill in october 2021
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"one thing i realized playing this game since day one. regardless of all the bugs people experienced, i thoroughly enjoyed it for one reason or another. such an awesome game. glad i got it then and really glad i still have it now. may put it down for a month or two but always playing it over and over again. glad it is still being played by new players til now and hopefully for many more years to come."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"im 30 seconds in, im gonna say play it. absolutely play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"i started playing oct 2024, and i already have 263 hours invested, and i'm on my 3rd playthrough, trying to do all the endings, and then to 100 the game, this is definitely going to be and likely remain my most played game of 2025 and i now have an invested reason to upgrade my hardware to take full advantage of this beautiful game, cannot wait for project orion and what cdpr brings us in the future game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,is it worth it still? absolutely with gamings current offerings im struggling to get out of night city. nothing recent is even close to this perfection.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"i been playing this game since launch. i never gave up on this game. it's great, people recognize this game for what it is, even if nobody collectively recall what it did good before. i still play on last gen even though i got it on pc too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"same like alot of comments, started my first playthrough of cyberpunk ever 2 weeks ago. i'm playing it daily for as much as i can, incredible game, soundtrack and storyline. i just can't get enough of it. finished the main story line once and i'm starting dlc right now. for me it's in 10 top of all time, no game ever got me hooked instantly like cyberpunk in 2025. i just can't get enough of it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,only game i can ever go back to and actually play anymore as an adult
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,this game was always good but in 2025 its never been better fully updated one of the best dlc expansions ever yes its worth it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,yes it is worth replaying but fans that have been following the game since 2018 and before will still be disappointed
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i would love to do some things in the city that have nothing to do with the story, such as gang warfare in the streets, gang hierarchies with bosses to kill, and hit squads on the lookout for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"one of the most incredible redemption stories in gaming history. just goes to show what a company can do when it honestly owns up to its mistakes and makes a legitimate goodfaith effort to correct their errors in performance, promise vs delivery and corporate philosophy. cd project red should be an object lesson for every other developer out there. unfortunately, as with anything truly extraordinary, they will be seen as an anomaly with nothing to teach ubisoft? bethesda? hello....?."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i started playing around 4 months ago and right now im at about 300 hours and on my third playthrough. i didnt know about the controversy with the beginning of the game but i absolutely do think the game and dlc are worth it. its beautiful, lore heavy, a ton of replay value, great character building and world building. i love it so much."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"bought it on steam when there was sales on december 2024. it has been 200 hours since then and i will say it is absolutely worth it. there's still some minor glitches in some occasions, but not game breaking one. it is some of the best games i've been playing recently."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-03,"man i love this game. i had several runs and 600700 hours playtime. i always rushed the game and always fast traveled i have this habit in many open world games like kcd, fallout. but after long time i startet a new run with mods like dark future you have to eat etc. and new gun behavior and stuff. i walk some parts and always drive now. now i can really appreciate raytracing and pathtracing because while slowly walking over puddles you can see the gorgeous reflections. i can appreciate this game in a view i never had and i love it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,started playing cp'77 two days ago. on 3rd platform. i've spent 1200 hours on stadia from release day till day it was shut down. then on nvidia play now to play phantom liberty and now on ps5. still feel great just driving around and doing ncpd calls and other random stuff.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,"one of the best games ive played. night city feels like a functioning city. excellent dialogue with great animations. decent amount of builds with varying playstyles. the most glaring problem is no ng. by the time you create a complete build and get good with its playstyle, much of the city is cleared of quests  missions to flex on. i love starting new builds, but i also would love to take on the entire game again completely kitted out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,top three games ever order can change but for me 1 witcher3 2 cyberpunk 3rdr2 haven't played it yet lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,just me or is everyone playing cyberpunk 2077 again?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"i can't quit playing this game, i love it so much. after update 2.0 it was great, and the rest are just icing on the cake."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,i find the character editor to be rather pointless since the entire game is in 1st person view. the only time i can actually see my character is riding a motorcycle or looking in a mirror.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"as an owner of ps4, i am very disappointed in fact that they decided to stop supporting ps4, we didn't even get pl"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,i got cyberpunk for my birthday the other day and im addicted to it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,yes it is
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,short answer absolutely.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,is cyberpunk worth it? guy who played it like ten times lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,i got it about a year after the release and then stopped playing after 15 hrs. i picked it up again around december after watching edgerunners and saw they released phantom liberty and a new patch. i must be around 80 hours and still going strong. i bought a new rig and just been lost in night city
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"sequel wishes make driving fun. driving is one of the most infuriating experiences in this game. add new game . add fly able aircraft. add hoverboards add rocketsgrenade launchers add stunt setups. like random ramps throughout the city. add controllable drones make clothing better. customizable clothing. ie shaders? make it so i can addsubtract sleeves on a shirt, pants into short vice versa.. maybe like a sewing machine in your properties more options for romance. try to make your lover less robotic. frustrating that all panam wants to do is sit on the couch. lol add section 9 as like an easter egg but if i only could get one wish out of this its make driving more intuitive, and fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"easily up there among the best games in the 20212025 era, and i predict it would still be besting big games that would be releasing in the next 5 years until the sequel is released."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,i remember it crashing on me every hour in 2020 having to save so as not to lose any of my progress and even then i still loved it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,game is amazing not to the max. the dlc is so awesome. replayed it few months ago like valhallafallout4ghost of sushi all these games are so good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,is the greatest singleplayer rpg of all time worth playing? hmmmmm lets see
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"what i would like is way to skip some contents of the game, they get really tedious after the first playthrough. skip options i would like to have 1 all braindances. tutorial and otherwise. 2 johnny's memories blowing up arasaka, alt's story in the blackwall, etc. 3 romance final quests. i can't tolerate anymore to have to dive with judy, or play with river's kids. sometimes i would like to play it again, but i can't be forced to see all this unskippable stuff once more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-12,"if you need to ask if cyberpunk 2077 worth playing you need to ask yourself, do you want to experience one of the greatest stories in gaming history ? if so, go for it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,i've loved the characters and world since i played it after work on launch day.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"i got the game at launch and being on pc it wasn't too bad for me.. yeah, there were bugs.. but nothing too crazy for me. i really enjoyed it, and i came away from it thinking it was a 'good game.' over the years, the updates and improvements have upgraded it from 'good game' to one of my favorite games of all time. phantom liberty was insanely good and the game feels so polished now.. it's a real joy to play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"i got this at launch on a hard copy, obviously traded it in, started it again 2 weeks ago, absolutely hooked and on doing my 3rd different ending, absolutely amazing game, the launch was an absolute disgrace though and i wont forget that next time they release a game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-14,this game is most definitely worth it now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"have well over 50 hours on this game and during my time of waiting for the final update to drop and giving the game another fair shake, its hands down sits as one of the best open worlds i've played in a long time for just how alive the world feels, not just that but it actually letting you just walk into buildings with 0 loading screens just makes it that much better to games like gta 5 or hell maybe even gta 6 if they don't take some queues from both this game and rdr2"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,just started a new playthrough after stopping a few weeks after release. it's drastically improved and much more enjoyable. i still wish the city had more little side activities etc. to imurse yourself in
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,i hope this game is fruitful. iv always wanted to play with this art style
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"i started playing it 4 weeks ago, currently on my second playtrough. never played a game like this in my life. if youre thinking about starting it, trust me its so worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-13,"i feel what hurt the launch for this game was they had to make it for two consoles. the old xbox playstation and the new xbox playstation. the old really couldn't handle the graphics so they had to kind of scale it back and it was just tough to have a balance for it to work properly. had this just been for the new consoles, they probably wouldn't had nearly the bugs that it had initially"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,i recently did the sinnerman gig and i failed the car chase when i hit a civilian. that is new i think.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,tldr yes its one of the best games ever made
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-06,"i bought it a couple months ago and haven't played anything else since. this game is one of the best i've played in quite a while, definitely worth it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"i absolutely love this game, my only downsides is the lack of ng, and the fact that the npcs get much cooler clothing than you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,i only just beat the dlc recently. my second play threw was before 2.0. over all it feels like i've played 3 different games since i waited and played at different times. i originally played the game on a ps4. thats why i've done 2 playthroughs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"its a 6.5 maybe a 7 at best, but id say its worth a play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"loved the game when it launched, but it's an even better game today with the expansion and 2.2x. passed 700 hours recently."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"11400 you've gotta remember that the more the game progresses, the more you become like silverhand and he becomes like you...so it would make sense that he would become more selfless. that and the character development isn't just oh we've become closer, but rather you've only known silverhand by the negative actions, and this is him finally showing you a positive side"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,"this game honestly probably has one of the best soundtracks in modern aaa gaming. not to sound cringe or anything, but not many games can encapsulate the feeling of being a borderline superhuman through the soundtrack alone. like the music throughout the dont fear the reaper ending. makes you feel like the badass you are, mowing through dozens of arisaka grunts while invading the tower completely solo. something not a single merc has ever achieved, and whole organized groups could barely do. meanwhile, v just up and invades on a whim and tears them down from the ground up."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,1450 i think that's a reference to the office where the hard to understand warehouse worker tells his story about him being the worlds best surgeon and killing the yakuza boss on purpose and darryl saving him when he comes to america and giving him a job at the warehouse.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,massive bonuses are dished out to management. something about this line feels like the worst thing that came from the game itself.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-25,"gamers are done no more preorders, no more hyptrains god if only that were true if only that was ever true"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-02,we need to take a moment to appreciate the sweet irony that is this game. a game about fighting against corporate greed gets released to early due to corporate greed.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,2 years later and now its one of the greatest games ill ever play. cdpr has truly made a masterpiece. just sucks you had to wait 4 years until after the actual release to get an actual good game that you were promised to have when it released
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"one more thing that no one picks up about cyberpunk 2077, literally a third of the city itself is in accessible. there's a huge sports stadium on the map, impossible to get to without wall hacking."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-21,coming when it's ready we leave greed to others the whole game is going to be a meme i just love these quotes!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-22,"massive bonuses are dished out to management. management caused decades of hard work by the developers to go down the drain, and yet they are the ones who got rewarded while the developers are left to shoulder the blame and continue working on putting out the shit storm. we truly do live in a society."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,the big issue is that reviews came out before launch saying it was great. that's fucked up. paid off pos reviews so people would keep their preorder.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-22,cyberpunk will be amazing to play with every feature they promised and amazing dlc by the time we reach 2077
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-18,"the big boss is back let's goooooo welcome back man, we've missed your unnecessarily buttery smooth voice"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-24,moral of the story is always wait a year until all the patches and errors are fixed so you can play the game of the year version
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-23,i completely burst out laughing during the neo and morpheus sequence
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,this video needs a sequel specially with how cyberpunk is now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"god this 20 minute video feels like an 1 hour video, but here i mean it as a compliment, you condensed the information so good that ever second i hang onto your words for a while, its great."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-03,"thank you so much for mentioning the missing features. most people keeps mentioning that bugs destroyed this game reputation. while the bugs we're pretty bad, they can and will eventually be solved with work and time, as for the missing features, no amount of work or time will ever bring that game to what is supposed to be according to all the cdpr marketing. promises and lies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-19,man that matrix sequence was absolutely hilarious. or were you looking at the man with no head. made me cry like i rarely do. edit because that signs scene with phoenix is also absolutely hilarious.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-25,305 lol how he manages to be everywhere man!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-21,"for me the problem is not the bugs. those can be fixed. for me its the cut content and the fact the game barely has any rpg features and is instead more like a looter shooter like borderlands. oh and your lifepath barely changes anything, and if you do nothing during the onrails car chases, you still dont lose lmao. they skirted around all this in their nonapology haha so they are not getting my money ever"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-07-01,where you listening at me? or you where looking at the man with no head? i literally laughed for 10 minutes straight lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-30,cyberpunk really is a game that makes you feel like you've been cyber punked.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-13,did this dude just predicted the witcher 4  447
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-08,"elden ring gave me some hope for the future of gaming. they launched a finished game. no promised patches, and no dlc's. a added bonus is that there's also no micro transactions, or currency where you have to spend real world money on. everything is achievable in game, and available once the game is purchased. everything is out there, and waiting for you to find it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-23,1418 that whole segment is so creative i cried laughing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"821 seeing this again makes me sad... you can tell the developers had so much planned for this game. being able to actively construct a simple backstory is such a brilliant way of making players feel like their character is unique, even if all it does is unlockalter dialogue options. i would've much preferred seeing development time put into this, instead of spending all that effort to give the player three different game intros."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-11,"crazy how much of a comeback this game had, edgerunners and phantom liberty really clutched"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-08,i remember telling everyone at school that cyberpunk wasnt gonna live up to expectations and everyone made fun of me for it. to quote a famous chess club member look whos laughing now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"10 months later, the legend is back."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-25,this was the first game i ever pre ordered. lesson learned
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-02,2158 gta vi are you sure about that?
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-18,seeing people fawn over a model of keanu reeves is a good example of how dumb this industry has gotten. all you have to do is slap a celebrity name on any game and people go crazy as if that's going to make it good. the pandering from fans and developers is on another level
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-02,"even putting performance to the side, what was promised v.s. what was delivered... the game seems like a demo with a full story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-25,man i still dream of the 48min gameplay demo.. that looked soo good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-19,"it is official as of 42024 not a joke btw, cyberpunk 2077 now does live up to what the trailers are. kinda sad that it took like 3 years to get here though"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-06,came here expecting a compilation of bugs. expected to watch for 2 minutes and 30 seconds at most. but i got really surprised with an incredible video! i had to watch it in one go and i loved every bit of it. thanks for the content and the perfect presentation
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-18,"i simply love that even tho todd's addition to this plot is more of like a b plot, its inclusion makes the thing 10x times funnier"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-24,i love the side plot of todd struggling lmao
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-29,"cp2077 7 years of hype, a demo of bugs hl alyx 5 months of hype, brought vr to the whole another level"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-21,"anyone else think this is a work of art? the editing, the use of memes, videos, content, the commentary, just sublime. absolutely creasing myself at times!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-12,"videos like these are good to remind people why cyberpunk 2077 was even badly reviewed at the first place, the anime just made everyone forgot the broken promises and lies that were delivered to us in spade. until this day, the story and side quests still hard carry the entire game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-23,"honestly, cyberpunk 2077 was too ambitious imo. after hearing all it had promised at first i thought that's gonna need a hell of a lot of power to run"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-30,bought the game a few days ago. cant stop playing it. they have done such a good job fixing it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-23,"don't buy into the hype and don't preorder. but as long as people do, this will continue"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-18,"genuinely laughed out loud at the does that look like a katana to you?, you said it so sincerely. amazing video mate."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-25,"1620 these glitches got me rolling on the floor, but the priceless one was good luck, got a feeling we'll be seeing each other. and then the dude flies up in the air, nice sound fx going on, and feet dangling from the roof. xd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-21,1942 this bug is still in the game in 2.12 patch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-22,looking at the man with no head got me the giggles.... great morpheus and neo scene work
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-27,imagine a world where people looked at games like this critically and held game companies accountable for their actions. too bad it doesnt exist and many more cyberpunks will follow as people cant get enough of buying games from the same corporations that they just caught trying to fuck them over.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-16,"1418 is so good. the transitions, the clips you used and the way neo responds makes this amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-08,"1239 i love to think that there are people genuinely think that people would be executed for developing a bad game, as if it was the middle ages' witch hunting"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-30,1942 jesus christ man i'm sick rn when i saw that part i went into a freaking coughing fit from laughing
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"i lost it at the morpheus part. amazing work as always boss, your videos are entertaining as hell. thanks for everything, stay healthy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-20,"you'd think that after something like no man's sky when it first released, game devs would've learned not to overhype their game to the audience and give them expectations that couldn't have been filled at the time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-10,"i prepurchased it, played it for a couple of hours and deleted it. after last patch in december 2024 i downloaded it again. it was worth the time waiting, one of the best games ever made. bethesda will never be able to get even close, with the gameplay, story, fixing bugs, etc. starfield is pure example. nobody plays it, while cyberpunk is in top 20 played games on steam for 2 years now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-11,"good artists copy, great artists steal. after all, the internet historian can't cover everything..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-13,funny how cdpr went from arguably the most loved developers to almost completely forgotten about because of one release
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-21,"i didn't even care about the bugs, what made me sad the most is that the game was not like what was promised, soo much cut content, the world felt empty.. dead.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"coming back here after some months and omg, bigboss certainly went to the future on 447 as he just foresaw the following witcher installment lmao"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-18,"he actually returned unlike a certain academy edit october 3rd, 2022 salmonella academy actually returned, this is not a drill."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-28,"with or without bugs, the game just feels unfinished, the city is not the city they promised .."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-01,1935 that is the most hilarious thing ive seen its like cdpr saying peace to your refund lol
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,"i've just watched this, 2 days after phantom liberty and patch 2.0 release and my god was i glad that i bought it just a couple of months ago and didn't have to go through all that pain. great video, keep up your excellent work!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-29,"cyberpunk was and still is the only game i ever preordered, i only did this because of how beautiful witcher 3 was and i thought to myself if they can do witcher, they can do fucking cyberpunk well... i guess i was wrong to trust a game company. no more preorders for anything ever, thanks for teaching me a lesson cd project red !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-25,"after waiting 80yrs, dying of old age, living in heaven for 100 years, and then reborn again, finally he made a video."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-22,1418 i keep coming back to that section. this matrix scene is the best use i have seen in explaining why cp2077 and other stuff is broken d
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-27,something i find really funny is how in the actual versin of the game the people on wheel chairs do not stand up anymore
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-22,"the biggest blow for me as a player with a pc alright enough to generally enjoy the game was them removing the metro system. i played star citizen before on free flights and the best part about departing and arriving on a city planet is the super immersive train they have, i was so excited to have something like that in cyberpunk, at least modders are starting to make that a reality"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-19,"we always talk about the fall of bioware and bethesda leaving us with nobody but cdpr... but maybe if we didn't show our lord and savior such disrespect, gabe would learn to count to three..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-21,"they're not bugs, it's just cyberpsychosis"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,650 are we not going to acknowledge rockstar dropping red dead redemption 2 to monumental acclaim? feels like the moment we started really thinking rockstar went downhill was when they released gta trilogy the defective edition.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-08,"1628 the fact you levelled up stealth as well, made it even funnier."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-07,"oh my god, the storytelling made me sit still and consume this content like a pie to a toddler! great work mate, subbed for sure."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-21,1707 is the exact part of this video that forced me subconsciously to hit the like button.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,quick update the patches worked. the game is the best thing in life right now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-04,1454 that look like a katana to you? absolutely ended me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-06,"found this video again literally on the same night i finished the story. despite the game's state, the story is actually very emotionally addictive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-25,"the glitches made me burst out laughing especially the one of johnny just straight ascending out of the elevator. i played it at launch and one glitch i remember having that drove me crazy was that my car would explode and kill me instantly just because i lightly bumped the car against something while turning slowly down a street, but then when i actually crashed my car hard enough that an explosion would actually make sense it would be fine. this glitch would also happen sometimes in cut scenes i remember the first time i played river's quest line where you go to the farm to rescue his nephew, in the scene where he smashes the fence open with his truck, the glitch kicked in and made river's car explode when he hit the fence, killing us instantly and i was crying i was laughing so hard"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,"this video is fantastic. we need a second part with data to date, to see how much the game has managed to recover from its horrible launch and still release an incredible dlc and the 2.0 update."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-14,"this is one of the most entertaining videos i've watched recently. loved the matrix touch, dead on point. you got yourself a sub."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-27,"sir, i had to pause this video multiple times from crippling laughter. that whole segment at 824 killed me. great work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-05-13,"walking around the games world it is beautiful, shame this game didn't stay in development for another 2 years it could of been a masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"and yet, here we stand in 2025 with cyberpunk somehow being fully redeemed"
