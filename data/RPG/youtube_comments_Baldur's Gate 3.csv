This game is more of like an immersive-story, narrative-driven, turn-based-strategy, simulation game. It‚Äôs comparable to expecting Star Wars, and getting Star Trek, instead. Amazing cinematics. Great character story depth, but the game mechanic is not hack n‚Äô slash, as expected- which was really disappointing for me b/c this was how I remember playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate as a kid. This game is more along the lines of the original Dragon Age saga game mechanic. Real-time, Turn-based-strategy. Just to add my review, if your looking for an original, hack n‚Äô slash, Baldur‚Äôs Gate game, sadly this is not it. However I don‚Äôt want to dump on the developers, b/c it looks like a lot time and development went into this game- amazing cinematics, great voice actors, In-depth character driven story-lines, the list goes on‚Ä¶however it‚Äôs just not hack n‚Äô slash, and this was the major turn off for me.",0

my only point is i would like a bit more explenation from players base as to why it is that this is more known then dos but in reality the mechanics are less tought of, again the game is amazing but i feel like this dice roll mechanics is 80 % of the dialoge and story, and with saving u can guaranteee an outcome u want, in dos u have to commit points and i think this is a lot more better because it gives u a sense of worth of character, if i want to talk to someone, i use my persuasion or dex or charisma char, here i just use anything save and roll till i win, i must say i do no appreciate this aspect of the game and would like to discuss further, thank you very much for reading i really enjoy both of these games and the community and the mod community that makes them so much imerssive, enjoy and ty",0

There was one small fight i played through recently where 4 or 5 different spells missed in a row on this one guy cast by Gale. My melee characters just walked right and hit no problem. Im examing the target and it gives no explanation as to why the most powerful caster atm could be hit something with 16 ac. Guess it was just 5 very unlucky rolls in a row.",0

X9MOORXyRtI,@Okamiobidala,2024-05-09T19:44:18Z,"True story (But a bit long! Sorry!) I count myself as a gamer. I truly do. But my first taste of the MMORPG Elder Scrolls Online playing with a guild of people made me question whether I was allowed to have that title or if I actually was a fraud. I felt anxious that I wasn't following their game-savvy lingo or the game mechanics and I got cross with myself for being slow to be able to manage a build for the first time. I'd come from games where it was story based and beautiful and that was the experience. Anyway, after playing with the guild I'd selected who were friendly, if a bit more hardcore than me - I tried becoming one of them by learning the mechanics and grinding extremely hard for so long to get the 'right' armour/weapons/various different fragments of things that have to be put into another thing that had to be combined with the OTHER other thing etc etc. 

And you know once I did it and had it down, I was told that the satisfaction with the build I'd created would be a substantial gaming high - I learned instead that I was making myself sad. I took a look at what I was doing and I asked if I was having fun playing the game and the answer - shockingly - was nope! natta! 

I'm reminded of Viva La Dirt vid - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJW_8EcNzUY

I retreated from ESO to delve back into Okami, Skyrim, Zelda, Telltale and story based games or indie games that appealed to me and I had a blast!

My point is that coming here and hearing you say that it's ok to be a little perplexed is such a huge weight off my anxiety. I've been bullied a fair bit (especially on ESO grouping with a random) and people use the phrase noob which just makes me want to quit playing with others altogether. (What a terrible term to exclude people! Surely encouraging gamers into playing and trying harder helps the entire franchise and it's fans!) Why did it take me so long to realise I wasn't a dumb, idiotic, clueless noob - I was someone who had achieved the heights of that type of gaming and said: ""No thank you. I'm gonna do my own thing!"" üòÇ

The color-coding, highlighting, etc. are all very important visual displays, and go along with the plus upcasting markers, etc.  The opening starter area really needed to provide a lot more information on how to read the UI.   Don't get me wrong:  after you figure everything out, it works--it's great.  But if you're  brand new to this game, the opening sequences of combat in this game are utterly abysmal.",0

In specific I've been hoping to start a campaign with friends once patch 8 comes out, and I wanted to play starting the game as Astarion as the Dark Urge, using one of the in game mods for Vampire origin mods (assuming one of those allows me to be Astarion (?), and I ALSO hoped I would be able to customize Astarion's race and appearance.  Until now I think the in game mods wouldn't let race and face and stuff be changed, right?  I was wondering if you know if it now will be possible?

Related to that I saw comments on the in game mod for magic mirror saying it wasn't working, and I wondered if you know if that's true or not?

- With almost no items/support helping Necrotic damage
- Conflicted with itself with 2 melee feature (Channel Divinity only acceptable because of Inflict wounds, and worst feature Divine Strike), and 2 spellcaster feature (Reaper and Ignore Necrotic Resistance)
- With a new cantrip pretty much tailored for this class, except it's another freaking Saving Throw cantrip

Multiclassing will always be much more powerful. Larian has already accepted the extra attack stacking as a feature. Might as well let the Hexblade's extra attack stack with it. And, it's not like if they did allow it to stack with Hexblade that multiclassing would give a 4th attack, it would still just be 3. I'll work with what Larian gives, but it seems unnecessary considering it exists in the game already thus forcing a multiclass if you want to be the best ""Hexblade"".",7

r2vbC42QfYA,@omnaik1217,2025-02-26T23:19:07Z,"-This might be my least favorite update of all time. They nerfed a lot of the fun stuff out of the new things, especially booming blade. Storm scion hat was already really weak compared to fire and weapon acuity helmets and booming blade was finally a great way to get some consistent, repeatable thunder damage without Drakethroat buff or some specific weapons (Hammerhraft, punch drunk etc.). The fact that they nerfed these and haven't fixed so many items (battlemage gloves) is lame. Not to mention all the elemental augmentation items are so much less useful because it's so hard to justify using all those items for a once per round cantrip.
-Death cleric did not need the nerf whatsoever when Swords bard can already double target enemies with ranged flourishes. Death cleric's lack of necrotic equipment compared to radiant focused clerics getting the absolutely busted rad-orb gear was already what made it weaker, and this just made it worse. 
-Starry Form Druid did not need the nerf, it wasn't OP enough to justify it. 
-I'm not gonna go into tthe warlock extra attack nonsense yet because I genuinely have no clue what they're doing. Hexblade was already a silly introduction into the game when Pact of the blade already existed, but whatever.",2

x1kSdR3sTL8,@cacarot6020,2025-02-19T21:44:23Z,"BG3 is fun but is also incredibly overrated, the combat system has the worse aspects of a D&D game, the dialogue options (usually between 4 and 5) always has the same two outcomes (good or evil) , the dice throws are straight up rigged and are required for absolutely everything, combat, exploration, dialogues, even to scratch your own arse you have to throw a dice , the game has a lot of issues that could have been solved if they had made the right decisions instead of just ""have fun"", I wasn't surprised that the DLC got cancelled after the clusterfuck they made, Larian studios got fired from the project so I guess after all that talk was good for nothing, I'm sad because the game is clearly good but is overshadowed by a really unsatisfying combat system, the fake options in dialogues don't really matter but this game clearly doesn't deserve all the good praise that it got, they should have included more rpg aspects and less D&D dice rolls, if you unlock the luck feat you can see the dice rolls your enemies get in battle, the game was rigged from the start, not a luck based game if the game constantly gives high rolls to the enemies just to increase the difficulty 

Artificial difficulty makes games less fun to play, BG3 is a really easy game that doesn't need an added difficulty in form of a false randomizer (it isn't random if enemies get an average of 19 while the player gets an average of 14 on dice throws, it isn't random if the math says otherwise

Combining 2 of my favorite things: shoving people and fall damage? Possible in many scenarios (the amount of times I made Minthara and Cazador fall for me... literally is unhealthy)

Throwing things I would never use in my inventory at people? Possible in every battle. Though I have to applaude Luality here, the poetic irony of beating Cazador by throwing rats, the thing he fed Astarion with, at him was beautiful and something that would've never ocurred to me.

Dance breaks? Hell yes.

Explosive barrels? Though idk why I use them because I always end blowing myself up. 

I even got to drop a building on my companions because I was like ""the narrator is a coward, what's the worst that could happen when I already killed everyone?"". I strongly advise doing this to Astarion.

They did really well. The full game blew me away, although i felt like some things in early access should have been kept in like the open deck of the ship, and when you run into the ilithid underneath wreckage a group comes up to you to help you save the ilithid.small stuff but it doesn't take away from the game. 10/10 game for me.

But the rest of the game is pretty good. they just had to jam that virtue signal boost in there, just a shame. and you know what I find irritating? is that Karlach is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. literally the worst race in the game for the barbarian class + she's a very likable character and there is no happy ending for her, they fucked that up royally.
personal verdict: 7.5/10, it needs work here and there. But overall pretty good, but it's no Divinity Original Sin 2, which is a vastly superior game in my opinion because it allows  you to play 2 characters instead of 4 and then gives you double the stats, so you are twice as powerful to make up for the fact that you lack 2 party members, this can lead to some crazy builds in the end game.

Having played D&D before this is nothing new to me, but I would say that it would be difficult to follow if you had never played traditional D&D before. I had assumed that this video would be more on the gameplay of the game and some tips for building characters. I‚Äôm halfway through it and it‚Äôs mostly on the backend mechanics, which are really important but not what I was expecting. Still it really is a masterclass that can be used not only for BG3 but for D&D as a whole. Great job!",0

Every fight i have i am left normal basic attacking or normal rang attacking until i die or they overwhelm me.

It is OVERWHELMING how things work in this game. Like I had played Star Wars KOTOR when it came out, and knew that the combat system was based on D&D mechanics, but I'm guessing that game is dumbed down to an extent that it's playable for gamers who don't really know D&D.

But on my first playthrough, by the end of act 2 and up until I hit lvl 11 i had to go from stretching my resources thin to maximize the value of my rests to buying every scrap of food I could find and taking partial rests when i could afford to. For my last 3 rests before getting access to Hero's feast i had no food at all, and was desperate to find anything i could to stay alive and make it to the next level. That was on balanced with only the lower food requirement. The amount of food in the game is meant to sustain people who arent checking every crate, who aren't exploring every inch of the world.",0

-VCJEEOroZM,@TheGlenn8,2024-12-09T09:05:15Z,"Personally I think Divinity Original Sin 2's combat kinda sucks. The armor system is a bold experiment that failed. It's better to just have stun chances than to have to burn through a secondary health bar before you can just permastun someone. It had lots of downsides like punishing mixed damage types and encouraging alpha strike burst strategies. Meanwhile enemies must do the same to you, essentially making every combat a two sided damage race to see who gets to permastun the other first. Combat is heavily constrained by these factors. 

This is not to say that Baldur's Gate 3 (and DND 5e) don't have problems. But you're way less encouraged to push the boundaries, letting the majority of players stay within the fun middle ground where they have options but combat is difficult enough that choosing the right one matters.",0

Between BOTW offering you a true sandbox to fuck around and find out in with no visible guardrails and rules to the world that makes complete logical sense but take the players experimentation to discover for themselves and Dicos¬†Dice roll skill checks and general openness to let you experiment and still any situation around with creativity, you have the audience primed for two of the major components that make up Baldur‚Äòs Gate 3.
Both of them cover different ends of the ‚Äöyou can‚Äòt actually fail‚Äò feeling game design that makes Baldurs Gate 3 (and a good D&D Campaign)  so enjoyable. They both allow for SUCH a variety of approaches to a problem, that you never have to feel bad about your decisions, even though they have very real consequences.

Couple of things I disagreed with, the examples of quests that you think did not matter in the grand scheme of things, namely The Githyanki quest and not using the tadpoles. The githyanki quest did not matter for the player himself but it certainly matters to Laezel. This is her Nightsong moment where she starts her journey from believing a lie that she had been fed her whole life into freeing herself, waking up and smelling the roses. The tadpole choice on the other hand matters the moment when Emperor offers you the super tadpole. If you had been resisting the tadpole powers, you have an easy time to resist this offer too and not become a vile looking mutant. If you have been very liberal with the tadpole powers and consumer new tadpoles left and right, you have hard time resisting the Emperors offer. You either have to throw a straight up crit 20 or have one helluva pile of bardic bonuses and blessings to succesfully resist the temptation.",0

-VCJEEOroZM,@basil8940,2024-10-21T05:47:39Z,"I have 3000+ in NWN, 750 in NWN2, 1200 in the Witcher series. 300+ in DOS2. I thought BG3 was going to eclipse all of them. I gave it my all but uninstalled after 50 hours. I think the game is a disgrace. The companions being the worst part. You said the companions are introduced as unlikeable as possible. This is an understatement. The companions are the main reason I hold such distain for this game. I hate all origin characters.

Karlach - She has an unnecessary foul mouth and has a forced two year tantrum burning the paladin's. The only right thing to do I let Wyll kill her and the robe reward you get is worth more than her.
Wyll - Pretentious ideologue hero wannabe who turns into a massive sook.
Lei'zel - She's RPing as a Gith. They got that right. But hence the reason why everyone in Faerun hates Gith and why the Gith hate everyone else. Too much tension without a redeemable feature
Gale - He's a pussy
Astarion - Probably the only character I had any like of, did two unforgivable things. He tried to bite him, and for unreasons, didn't have the option to tell him to go bite Gale because he sits at camp all day doing nothing and no one likes him. Then at the party, he wanted to bed me which is just awkward, can't any of these characters read the room?
Shadowheart - She's generic and closed off. Look, Eskel is closed off, but you can hang out with Eskel and Lambert in Kaer Morhen have a few drinks and shits n giggles. You have a glass of wine with Shadowheart, where's the banter? Where's the laughs? Boring.

I was unhappy with some of my early choices and restarted, and clicked through many if not all conversations. Something I've never done in NWN2, or the Witcher. In fact, the only game I remember where clicking through so much boring asinine dialogue is Mass Effect 2. I loved ME1 but hated ME2, and it was mainly that the companions in ME2 were forgettable losers, everyone with daddy issues. ME2 is clicking through hours of boring dialogue in ME2 just to bed Miranda. I don't need this. We've P@rnhub and Rule 34 at our finger tips.

Witcher did sex the right way. There was tension, attraction, chemistry, and emotions between Shani and Geralt. I've been offered relations between Astarion, Lei'zel twice and Minthara and they've all been awkward ""wait... what?"" moments. BG3 romance writing is like relationships via TikTok. Even Witcher 1's romance is better than this game. For instance, I killed three Ogres, my party is half dead, covered in blood and the Lei'zel decides amongst the corpses is a great time for some hanky panky? Even though up until then there's been nothing but rapport breaking exchanges. It's weird. I feel the people at Larian are more interested in making weird Rule 34 p@rn than actual dynamics and meaningful relationships.

The main story is not interesting. And mind you, I only got so far as saving the grove and massacring the grove. The Artifact strikes me as the 'continuum transfunctioner' from ""Dude, where's my car?"". The main story has you trying to remove the tadpole, but then one night you dream and therefore now you want more tadpoles in the brain. I'm confused why my main quest is to remove the tadpoles, and continues to be that quest, but whenever I kill anyone, I take their tadpole and put more in my brain. The execution of this part of the story is poor. The whole story to meet Minthara, I'm holding my nose, playing through ridiculous events committing genocide on the Tieflings. But why? Because the person I was supposed to kill asked my to commit this genocide with no reward offered and for the sole reason ""the Absolute"" (aka ""The Leader"" from The Simpsons) said so.",2

I think it's the best video for us novice people, now I need to find a video of all the side quests, so that way I don't miss anything, I remember my very first playthrough, it was bad enough a certain things and equipments on exactly what they do, and even spells, I remember going to the underdark and I completely miss last light inn camp, and when it was time to invade the castle of Ketheric Thorne, I seen a bunch of Harper's and Jaheira who I never met, so I just figured maybe they're just extras and I actually finished act 2 and was going on to act 3, but for some reason something was telling me that I miss something big in the shadow curse Lands, not to mention that I was trying to romance Karlach and she told me that we missed the opportunity to get together, so what I did is I quit my playthrough then erased it and start completely fresh one and this time in the shadow cursed land, I made sure that I will explore every inch of it and that's when I finally went in the last light Inn, I just couldn't believe it of how much I quests I missed,",0

HDsD_sH-RJg,@rangersnut,2024-08-26T14:02:28Z,"This game is phenomenal in so many ways. There are things that bug me though that I wish Larian would address. The slow loading on PS5 is pretty inexcusable. It feels like I am back innthe PS3 days and not using an SSD. I don't know why its like that. 

For accessability and just to make the mini map objectives clearer, it would be handy if we could highlight the one we want to do with a different colour or marker. Sometimes with so many yellow markers it is frustarting and hard to see. I tried using the custom marker and then it shows on the map but not the mini map. 

My other gripe and this one drives me mental. Its not constant, but it happens is when firing a cross bow or bow, sometimes my character randomly walks forward even though all I am doing and telling the game to do is aim at an enemy. I wish the game would not do that, or randomly go up or down a ladder even when you don't highlight the ladder. Small things but things that could be improved. Outside of that though I love it.",0

Personally, not my bag, baby. 
But now if you play as character (which is all games) they put RPG in there. 
RPG used to mean 'avoid' to me, but now I just don't know anymore and have probably missed out on games I would love because they were listed as RPG.

pNnIO-p-5xs,@1SaG,2024-12-26T12:42:42Z,"4:55 Pretty sure you can find the key to that tollhouse vault-door at the base of the cliff underneath the tollhouse (near the river and near to where you pick up Karlach). It's a bit hidden IIRC and I'm not sure if you need to pass a perception check to spot it - but I've always been able to grab it so it can't be a very high check if there is one. While you're there, grab the Smuggler's Ring which is loot on a skeleton that's kinda hidden inside a bush down there by the river. It's strictly a swap-in item as it'll lower your CHA by 1, but it'll give you +2 on stealth and sleight of hand - in combination with Gloves of Thievery, this makes lockpicking/disarming traps a lot safer for non-Rogue characters. 
Also (since I've *just* discovered it for the first time after 7 or so play-throughs): 
Use persuasion or deception on the bird in the grove who is busy re-arranging his nest (he's close to the sleeping bear in the area with the idol). Then you can pick up a single piece of gold and, more importantly, the ""shiny key"" from the nest without it counting as theft. That key opens the aptly named ""shiny chest"" that sits on a bunch of pillars near the bird's nest. You have an easier time spotting the chest from above though (it's one of those small ones like the one you find near SH's pod on the Nautiloid). Go to where Arron is or near to the kart that sits between him and the overgrown portcullis. Look down towards the inner area of the grove and you'll see the chest sitting on a platform on top of some pillars. You can probably jump down there using feather-fall, but I used Gale from above (next to the kart) to cast Mage Hand onto the platform. Weirdly enough, the Hand was strong enough to throw the chest right up to where Gale was standing and I could simply open it up there. The loot isn't too spectacular, but it's pretty good for a low level party - I think I found a potion, an elixir, a magic scroll and over 80 GP in there. Not too shabby.",0

Crypt: use the ""shortcut"" to trigger all NPCs into a stack next to the oil barrel. Enter normally for a big burst start into the fight to make it easier.


Tyr: outside halfway to Karlachs location is a corpse, loot it for the key so you don't have to break down any doors.

Kagha: just loot her chest behind the bookcase and read the book and note. That way you don't need to pass a perception check and just can do the fight, steal the note and confront her.


Extras: behind the harpies is a chest. Continue the path and youll find the nest with a ring for colour spray after a jumping puzzle. Requires either a higher strength character or misty step to access or the githyanki jump. Pass to the right on the way back and there is another jump puzzle for a chest to dig out. Next to the idol of silvanus is a chest hidden on one of the stone passages, requires misty step to access. The key is in the birds nest beneath it, but requires to be stolen. 
Down to the beach is a bear with a small jump to reach another chest.


Tieflings: the cupboard can be easily accessed after the tieflings left. Basically the whole area is free loot.",6

At the beginning of a game there is an NPC (Withers) that you can do a small side quest to unlock. After you do a mysterious cabinet is going to show up in your cam if someone else makes a co-op character. When that person leaves the game you can put their character inside that cabinet until they come back allowing you to take out a party companion.

y7X1CLPS2Ns,@SRWill64,2023-12-14T06:57:01Z,"Nope. Dice hate me. If it's important to me I ALWAYS save and reload. Likewise with choosing my responses to my companions.
I love this game. It deserves Game of the Year 2023 and yes, it got it. I have played some seriously repetitive games but this is not one of them. My first character was a dragonborn paladin. I missed so much with him, 
I made a ranger. I enjoy the ranger but he's a lot more squishy than my pally was. Additionally he can't jump like my pally could. I just wish they had stat buff items in there. Potions to raise just one stat, a few a extras for finding something most people would pass by. I would raise the strength on my ranger instead of drinking potions of giant strength. Also, add a few more points to my pally's intelligence. Running around with an 8 intelligence and 17 Charisma is just not logical. He can charm the pants off of anybody, to remember history or religion...not going to happen.
Rating from me is 9.5/10 Excellent but a few small things.",0

Still a good game for most I'm sure, but I just can't get into the divinity style fighting mechanics that just stop everything vs live action thst the actual BG series offers.

My main issue is that this is basically Divinity III and not a Baldur's gate trilogy. Just call it D&D or Divinity III. It's just not Baldur's gate III in reality when you've played them. Just not. 

Again, happy for D&D fans and think they did the absolute perfect job when it came to developing this style of game, but just wish an actual trilogy was made instead of making it another divinity game.",0

PEUbDy5gNbU,@billwiley7216,2025-01-07T13:15:55Z,"Larian in my opinion partly did the best most gracious exit from possible future BG talk they could do.
My personal opinion is that there have been stories for DECADES of WOTC are t-total A$$holes with large egos and demanding virtually total control to the point they are nigh on impossible to work with.

I believe when you have such a hit both in success and monetarily as BG3 with a basically open ended story that lends itself to further chapters and even worlds if a gaming studio just shuts the door on those future possibilities there are things behind the scenes unknown to the general public.

If this is actually what happened here then in my opinion WOTC hurt themselves and the D&D games popularity as for the mainstream population the video game version is going to be much more attractive than the boardgame version which is much harder to find groups or the opportunity to participate.

That does not take into account the added immersion into the fantasy world the video game by actually putting you and your character in the world and that the game handles and eliminates a lot of the tedious keeping up with a character or parties equipment, trades and leveling or spells that the video game keeps track of with easily accessible spreadsheets of those items or levels.

Whatever the reason I think Larian deciding to walk away from the franchise does not bode as bright a future for future chapters in the BG saga as if they were still actively involved.

My first introduction really to BG and a D&D ruleset based adventure was on the PlayStation with the original BG releases and I spent hours in that game and was thrilled decades later to see BG3. 
(But even back then it was rumored as to how hard WOTC was to work with and that was why the original franchise died back then in reality)",0

This would mean Alfira, Halsin, Minsc and so on would all have their own personal storys throughout the game, would be fully voiced, romancable, and given all the weight and depth of someone like Gale or Shadowheart, Halsin mostly fits this bill already and so would just need to be fully voiced as a Main Character.

Not only would this all be great to see for future replays but it would mean that instead of 6 characters you could play through the game as you'd have 10.

Then I caught a nasty cold a couple of weeks ago and while recuperating at home fired up the game once more and... I'm completely immersed again. Yes: I've seen quite a lot of the game during all these runs, but I'm fairly certain I haven't *really* experienced it all - although that could be due to the fact that I loathe playing an evil character, so I kinda limit my experience myself in that way. :)
That said: I wouldn't mind some DLC or a good expansion, but we all know how hard those can be to pull off.. especially with a game like BG3 that features such a detailed and rich story that has a definite ending to it. Expansions to a game like this can feel quite anticlimactic - I'm looking at you, Dragon Age Origins Awakening. I guess what we really need is a new, full-blown ""module""/adventure, aka BG4 - hopefully with some of the old characters making a return.",0

I have many of the same feelings although I do have to admit that even though i think the characters have some good stories and interesting arcs I find almost all the origin companions to be a bit annoying. As far as driving the industry forward I think at the very least it proves to bigger publishers that a CRPG can sell and that could mean bigger budgets for devs. On the other hand big publishers can be bad. These types of games have mostly been a labor of love up to this point and I‚Äôd hate to see them exploited. Stories like the PoE and DoS kickstarters are amazing,2
owjosaOjhVs,@Lessdeth14,2024-03-12T13:37:57Z,"It is rather good, if very reminiscent of every other game they have made.

owjosaOjhVs,@KaiSaeren,2024-03-06T12:21:15Z,"Im one of those people who dont really like the canon version of the Bhallspawn saga, just like many others. Not really because it ""invalidates"" my choices, I dont really believe that at all, my head canon and my characters story is for me to decide and all that, and I understand that canon is neccessary for smooth continuity of the universe. However I do think its incredibly cheap that they just esentially retcon and redo some of the major and notable events from the past games. Imo Bhaal returning should have happened far into the future, if at all, since we have already  beaten him as an enemy, he really wouldnt be high up on my list. Same with Sarevok, I dont think he should have returned and this portrayal is rather dissrespectful towards the possibilities for the character and canon ending of the previous games as well. Moreover, these things just do not feel neccessary to do, or use by both wizards of the coast and larian. On top of that you of course have the issues you mentioned.

Im not much of a gameplay guy so story is king for me and while I adore BG3 and believe it deserves all the plaudits it gets I do have more and more issues with the story and characters as I play the game more. 
Some small issues for me include handling of Jaheira, whom, while well written imo and consistent, should have been used a lot more to iron out immersion issues with the PC Bhaalspawn from previous games. I have seen this done before and it would have been awesome to see here, but using Jaheira as a springboard to set up who was our previous MC and how he/she behaved was imo a neccessity. Abdel is nearly absent from the game in all but name so headcanons could still easily prevail and even in just Abdel there is a lot of options in how the player imagined his personality and past relationships. Point is, we could have had Jaheira actually talk about their relationship, who the PC was etc. all based on our questions to her. I would have loved that.

Im also not a huge fan of using old characters improperly as well, like I mentioned with Sarevok. Jaheira and Minsc are fine ,great even, tho Minsc being alive is a bit cheesy but Viconia is the other character who got the short end of the stick with her being barely recognizable beyond just her name.

Im also not a huge fan of the, I dont know, just general structure and focus of the story I guess? With the game being so spread out and outcomes so varied (which is a good thing of course) it is hard to actually know if you are getting the most out of your playthrough, at least the first few times. I feel like too much is hidden, especially about the main plot and companions, behind optional and conditional or hard to interact with events. Even character interactions in the camp seem to be very limited in my opinion because so much is told and found out in the quests themselves and I just prefer the more standart feeling of character interaction where you get a clear baseline at the begining and it develops from there, like how Pathfinder games do it. Just a lot more easily digestable and understandable form of experience for me.

But honestly my biggest issue an annoyance is in the form of cut content, more specifically all the interactions with the tadpoles and the swap from Daisy to the emperror. I do not find this at all worth it and I am honestly shocked that they did this so late in the development (art books do not even have the Guardian, only the hearts desire Daisy character) cutting so much interactivity with a MAJOR part of the story that led to a whole lot of dialogue and consequences with both your party and others. Emperror is fine as a character but its clear he was repurposed into a different role and they completely removed any sort of moral or gameplay consequences from using the Illithid powers, which is imo a huge mistake on part of Larian because this should be a roleplay decision and not a gameplay one. I get that they wanted us to interact with the system more, but good characters would simply not want to do that, irregardless of whether the Emperror is more persuasive or not than Daisy (he isnt to me with how needless and out of place he consistently asks you to just embrace being an illithid). 
And at the same time they cut almost all of the possibilities of roleplay out of interactions with Daisy and the Emperror, as with Daisy you could genuinely go out of your way to immerse yourself in your actions and decisions, whereas Emperror is reactionary and almost static character that just is whatever you want him to be, if you want him to be a nice guy who helps you, thats fine, he doesnt betray you in any way, if you want to see him as an evil manipulating Illithid, thats also fine and eventually he will give up on you if pushed far enough, you dont have to feel bad for either, just like with using the tadpoles. Changing Daisy out for the Emperror just removed choices from what I considered to be one of the major roleplay pillars of the game.

It also changed the feel of the game, quite significantly from the EA to the full release, with all the decisions being a lot more easy to make and carrying less of a negative consequences, like with your companions being a lot more judgmental, your decisions in regards to using tadpoles carrying negative consequences, Gale innitially needing actual important items to stop the orb etc., I wasnt a fan of the ""timed"" aspect of the game in the EA, but if you are doing a story where we are supposed to believe we can turn into Illithid at any point, the tadpoles should actually feel like danger. 

I dont know, whileI appreciate BG3 for what it is, I am sad about all the lost potential and what we could have had instead if they didnt change out so much for sake of engaging more people with the shiny system they made. Sure it may make for a better or more fun gameplay experience for many, im not arguing that, but it also introduces a lot of story issues for people who care or pay attention. And I also miss my sexy seductive version of the guardian :( 

I think that eventually maybe with the enhanced edition they could add Daisy back, maybe make it unique to the Durge origin since there was a synergy and interactions hinting at it being tied to it, or making a choice between Daisy and Guardian sort of similar to Orpheus and Emperror, which I believe was innitially supposed to happen much sooner, people even speculated that Daisy/Desire was Orpeus on one form or another, with the other options or the other part of the character being the Absolute itself etc. It just seemed like such a cool and core concept to the game that cutting it out so completely as they did imo innevitably just hurt the experience and cohesiveness of thes plot. I hope they bring it back, and most of the cut content in one form or another.

You talk about this a little bit yourself and I hope this gives you the answer (or most likely one anyway). In short, being able to switch to Orpehus sooner likely was a plan at one point, but it would cause huge issues with the tadpole powers, ranging from Orpehus wanting to kill you earlier on since Netherbrane wasnt a thing yet and he wouldnt be forced into cooperation, to obviously him just not allowing you to use the tadpoles any further at the threat of whitholding his protection etc., its already ridiculous that you being half turned into a mindflayer has no impact on anything anywhere (clearly a late stage adition imo) but Orpheus would absolutely not let you get fucked up with illithid powers any further, again, cutting you from the shiny system Larian wants us to engage with.

Imo Balduran being the Emperror was always part of the script, I just dont believe he had the role of the guardian as well.

Also, Im personally strongly against the way origin characters are done. They simply should have been companions, I absolutely hate that there is a lot of content simply hidden behind being forced to play as not your character. In Original sin its fine by me, thats their franchise, but in dnd it makes absolutely no sense to me, dnd players thrive on being able to play whoever they want, being shoehorned into a specific character or just straight up being locked out of that content (interactions, dialogue, decisions and consequences unique to the origin characters, even some quests from what I hear) is abhorent to me and a really bad call. Imo its just a waste of resources and seemingly most people didnt care about them whatsoever, as from a poll 93% of players played as the Avatar, not even Durge, just the PC avatar in the first few months. It will innevitably go up a bit as players experiment and whatnot, but I dont think they were neccessary in the first place, not the way they were done. I love them as characters and companions tho.",0

The one I found boring was Wyll. I like his characterization, but he‚Äôs just shortchanged in terms of interactions and character development. His story quests aren‚Äôt even really about him! Rescue his father, find this dragon he heard about. Only the one about his pact is actually about him.",1
owjosaOjhVs,@cirdanx6,2024-01-24T18:41:20Z,"A very good review that reflects a lot of my own observations on this game. While i do like it, i will also point out that this is not a sequel to the original games at all in my view. It¬¥s D:OS with a paint job. As harsh as that may sound, it¬¥s marketing and there it was a hit, not the least because the nature of this game (all the fun stuff) plays perfectly into the streaming/youtube/shorts crowd. Remember how the made a big deal about the romances and sex scene, yet there is hardly anything of substance here and they are overall really subpar. But the Halsin love scene gets the views, so a marketing success. 

The writing or better narrative really breaks apart in Act 3, for some reason Larian thinks rewrites late game are a good thing, they did this in other titles as well and it shows. Especially the cut content hurts the ending really bad. A few months more in production could have done wonders. I also agree with Minthara, who is still bug ridden to no end, and that Minsk in Act 3 was a mistake (originally planed for Act 1). Overall I couldn¬¥t really get into the companions, they felt very generic to me, despite some interesting moments in their personal stories. In the hands of better writers this could have been amazing. 

It¬¥s still a good game and I had a lot of fun with it. Hopefully they will make a Definitive Edition and at least fix some really glaring issues with the last act. 

Anyway, I will take Pillars, Pathfinder, BG original series etc over BG3 any time. I think you are spot on with the analysis that many people are so in love with it, because that¬¥s their first venture into this genre, so hopefully this will also bring some more attention to other titles as well.",3

Personally I have had more fun with this game than anything I‚Äôve ever played in my life. I think BG3 is a stunning achievement by Larian and it‚Äôs difficult to see it being topped any time soon. I agree with you that it will be very interesting to see what the true ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù of this game is given its huge commercial success despite how Larian is sort of more of a niche studio.

I have watched quite a few of your videos but do you think you could do an updated video on CRPGs to look at after BG3? I have played Divinity 2 and POE 2 but will certainly look at other RPGs once I clear BG3 the third or fourth time",1

owjosaOjhVs,@sayo5885,2024-01-09T14:28:18Z,"This is by far the most comprehensive so-called 'objective' in-depth review I've ever seen of BG3. You carefully weighed all the positives and negatives thoroughly each aspect of the game whether it'd be gameplay, story, progression, combat system, etc. without having a particularly strong bias whatsoever (aside from your adoration for the genre and previous installments which is perfectly fine.) All-in-all personally, having to spend over 100 hours in the game and having never played DnD I'd say that I'm extremely satisfied. This has been one of those every-once-in-a-decade type of experiences in gaming for me.
 
The one glaring flaw I find myself agreeing with you the most is that we aren't given a choice to side with the githyanki prince over the Emperor and later free him anyway? That was the first moment in the story where I felt like my choices didn't really matter all that much. 

I never really enjoyed turned-based strategy games (aside from Civ) but this game has changed my perspective to the point that I'm willing to give a chance to other games in the genre.",0

So every so often, even if you dont need to, just partial rest to keep the camp events flowing so you dont miss out on anything. This was especially helpful on my honor mode run since i still wanted to see all the camp events, but long resting was SO expensive",0

lJCwezyHNlA,@SpecialInterestShow,2024-12-16T01:52:34Z,"And a bonus tip from me similar to my last one 

(which was ""throw poisons, acids, etc on the ground or set something on fire and you've got yourself a DIY dippable surface)

So, for tip #2 from me to you:
I call this one the ""Drop Drive-by""

Summary: go up to enemy, drop bombs, high-tail it away, make bombs explode

More detailed explaination:

note:
			a. A Rogue is great for this, though any character with high movement speed + opportunity attack evasion works
			b. Alternatively, you can use a caster with teleportation spells.

Steps 
1. Go up to the enemy.
2. Drop however many explosives your chaotic heart desires!
3. GTF outta there! For this, either use a teleportation spell, or use an bonus action to disengage and run away. 

4. Use your action (or if need be, the next pc's action if they're next in line) to shoot a spell or arrow that can trigger the explosives!

5. Watch the carnage ensue...

BONUS:
OldManGltichez on reddit has pointed out that you can load a whole pouch with explosives, lob a flaming/burning explosive at said pouch.... And watch the nuke go off!",1
lJCwezyHNlA,@SpecialInterestShow,2024-12-16T01:31:30Z,"To give back to this amazing comment section, here's something I've found:

Something I just learned in a Steam discussion by user serahcornelia (but that I have extra tips for)
I call this one ""DIY Dips""!:

Don't have a dippable surface/something burning around? Just throw a bottle of poison or acid or whatever on the ground, and it'll break, and making a puddle you can each dip in! 
(I think this works with oils too? 
The best part is, the puddle stays for a good while! I'm not sure how long, but at least a long rest or two iirc!) 

(Note: I'm unaware as to if the enemies can also Dip, however. Also, be aware that some (if not all) oils may be flammable. I'll test this soon and edit the comment later.) 

But also, I have an add-on to this tip, though: think outside the box! Potions/explosives aren't the only ways to make surfaces! 

Don't have a bottle of poison, but have that acid arrow spell that drips acid on its way to its target? Well then, boom, you've got an acid puddle to dip your weapons in! 

Set something on fire? You can Dip into pretty much anything that is burning. Need to make a big fire? Cast Grease then set the grease on fire! Got lava nearby? That's dippable babeyyyy. 

An enemy just chuck poison or acid or whatever at you, or set you on fire? Well that sucks, but use it to your advantage! *Come closer....* It's free -real estate- Dip.",0

lJCwezyHNlA,@Lucifronz,2024-11-21T02:51:31Z,"Long Rests are dangerous. I avoided them quite often in my early playthroughs because of how often they would fuck over a quest I had started. Put simply, there are a lot of moments and quests that are too urgent to simply come back to later. There are some obvious ones, like the burning building, but also ones I didn't realize would progress, like the duergar and deep gnomes and the trapped Absolutist.

It was frustrating to encounter situations like that, see things progress on me without my consent, and not be able to trust long rest anymore, because long rests are *essential* to recovering your characters in the game. It actually pissed me off a few times, because I felt like the game was pressuring me too much and forcing me to miss content or go into it entirely unprepared.

I somewhat get the point of it, but at the same time... it's a stupid mechanic that makes the game too strict and should have been thought out some more before implementing it.",0

lJCwezyHNlA,@1SaG,2024-11-08T08:30:36Z,"Re trading with ""improperly marked"" traders: This is pretty important when it comes to Volo. On *all* my play-throughs (7 or 8 now IIRC) he was always the one who held the ""Whispering Promise""-ring - which is a pretty awesome item for your party's healer. I used to pickpocket the ring from him before I knew I could initiate trade through the dialogue-screen - which runs the risk of getting caught and then him running off and leaving your camp for good. Which sucks if you still want to obtain ""Volo's Ersatz-Eye"" from him. 

Speaking of trade: You should really consider bribing some of the more persistent traders in the game very early on. I usually do not sell anything (or not much) to Dammon on day one but I use all or most of my loot to bribe him into upper yellow/low green territory at least. Just add whatever you want to bribe him with to your side of the barter screen (both wares and GP will work), then click ""barter"" without clicking ""balance offer"" first or selecting any of the trader's wares. Game will warn you that you're about to give stuff away, but that's not really true since we're making a long term investment.. :) This isn't as hard as it sounds if you consider all traders will always buy anything you throw at them. I usually pick up *everything* with a value greater than ""1"" this early in the game ... all those ""Vampyre""- or ""The Umclaimed""-books in Withers' crypt for example. 

Whoever does this should, ideally, be high CHA and as low a level as possible because that will make the bribe much cheaper. With a level 1 or 2 character, it's usually enough to donate 200 to 300 GP to raise friendliness-levels quite a bit. Not sure how much exactly is needed for max discount, but I think it's around 400-500 GP for a lvl 1-character. 

Non-cheesy way to do this is recruit Wyll super early, don't level him up and instantly use him to bribe Damon. Of course: You can still use the Withers-route (reset your party's main trader, then bribe the shop-keeper as a level 1-character) if you don't mind the cheese. Don't forget to pickpocket Withers afterwards to get your 100 GP back.

IMO, the traders where this should be standard procedure are the ones who show up in multiple acts - meaning Dammon is the most obvious choice since he appears in all three acts and sells pretty great gear you'll probably want to buy anyway. Next on the short-list is the Zentharim-chick who first shows up at the Goblin-camp and later on at Moonrise. The gag is that, unless you do something stupid like trying to steal their items in front of them, the traders will keep their attitude towards the character who bribed them. So, bribe Dammon in the Grove in Act I and he'll still give you the same discount much later on in Act III when he's moved his shop to Baldur's Gate. Gotta remember though that the discount only applies to the one character who bribed the trader - not to the entire party. 
A third possible trader where this could make sense is Derreth Bonecloak (sp?, the Dwarf-lady from the Myconid-colony) - with the slight caveat that this probably depends on what you plan to do with the Noblestalk from the Underdark. She does appear in two acts, is a reliable source for pretty rare ingredients and does sell some interesting items, too - since I never helped her out, I'm not sure how her shop will look in Act III if you give her the Noblestalk, but I'm not too sure bribing her is worth the hassle if you have other plans for the Noblestalk. She'll still be open for business once you get to the city, but her cash-levels will always be super low, no matter how much you bought from her the day before. Not sure if any of this affects the size/quality of her inventory, though.",0

If you know you plan to take a feat with a +1 to a score or intend to make a deal with a specific individual in Act 1 for a buff, odd numbers can be better if done right. For example, say at lv 3, you have 3 odd numbered stats. You take the bargain offered in Act 1, then take the ASI feat. You just boosted 3 stats up a +1. This really depends on how you intend to play your game/character, though.
16.) This is not true for all casters!!! Bards, Rangers, and Warlocks cannot do this. I think Sorcerers and Paladins can't either, but I'm not sure. I've never played one.

another thing i learned is that gravity seems to do the most damage compared to anything else in the game. get the ring of fling from arron and the returning pike right from the start and get your character to height, and just toss that pike. the pike does its normal damage, but the fall damage from the pike is ridiculous and does 25+ bludgeoning with only a few meters of height difference. i  transformed laezel into a thrower and used her insane jump skills and misty step to get her up high and she just one shot most things - its even stronger than the silver sword if she gets that. it feels like cheating despite being a completely legit strategy. once you hit level five, you can one shot two creatures per turn or four with action surge. or six if you drink potion of speed. once she gets three attacks (six throws by herself, eight with potion of speed, ten with action surge), she can one-man-army most _encounters_ and in fact, i used this strategy on the forge defender from the cliffs above and she was doing 70+ damage per throw times six throws.",0

Act 3 Video can be found here: https://youtu.be/uOgiMiSsDMM

Info on what tricks/exploits are still working can be found below.

Update: knocking out vendors no longer gives ALL of there unique items (but it does give a few).

Update: Due to a balance change (or possibly bug) here is a new method to get ""Pest Control"" achievement.
1. Use Shovel in his Invisible form (or other invisible companions) to destroy the two clusters of eggs that are furthest from the Matriarch while outside of combat, BEFORE engaging the Phase Spider Matriarch Directly. This includes the cluster of eggs on the bottom level, as well as the cluster on the norther plateau, which can be reached by shovel by climbing down the vines to the south, then by moving them around the chasm to the north and climbing the cragged rock. The Matriarch and other spiders must be far enough away for Shovel to destroy the eggs without being detected.
The final cluster of eggs is more difficult to destroy without alerting the Matriarch. What I've found to work is use Karlach to gain surprise on the Matriarch with a flurry of blows. Then use her action to throw a Alchemist Fire on the final cluster of eggs. If any remain unbroken, another party member can use a firebolt, magic missile, or other ranged attack to destroy them. Sometimes the spider near the bottom cluster of eggs won't move away from them. In that case, you'll need to have another party member throw a second alchemist fire on that cluster while the Matriarch and other spiders are still surprised. 
The Matriarch will no longer die from falling in the chasm. However, major damage can be dealt by shooting out the web bridges from beneath the Matriarch, which will cause it to take fall damage. You can also make use of Potions of speed on Karlach and Lae‚Äôzel to help them kill the Matriarch faster. 

As of 04/06/24 (Patch 6) all of the following exploits/tricks still work:
- How to get Silver Sword of the Astral Plane early/in Act 1. (This still works to get the sword, but now seems to trigger an unavoidable combat.) I would send in just one character (the hireling) to get the sword to drop. I would then have a character with high initiative (alert feat, high dexterity, etc.) run and grab the sword, then run back/away and flee combat. The hostile Githyanki can be dealt with fairly easily upon reaching level 5 and it shouldn't negatively impact any questline. The game may determine that Voss holds a crossbow instead of his greatsword. If that happens, I do not currently know of any way to get the Silver Sword to drop and it may not be obtainable.

As of 04/06/24 (Patch 6) the following still work as shown in the video:
- How to get all rewards from Kagha Encounter (Broodmother‚Äôs Revenge, Pale Oak, and Faithwarden Title).
- How to get Auntie Ethel‚Äôs Hair & still defeat her/ save everyone that can be saved. (If you have to pick one, probably go with the Hair!)
- How to give Noblestalk Mushroom to BOTH Shadowheart AND Derryth. (If you have to pick one, Derryth provides more tangible/mechanical benefits, once you get to Act 3.)",351

If you kill all of the Duergar allied to Nere without triggering combat (I lured each to the edge and threw them one by one into the pit) and then trigger the Nere fight, youll get the dialogue choices as if you had made the deal with Brinthier or whoever, even if you had never even talked to him. He even gives you a split of the gold he ""promised"" you once Nere is dead without having to pass the checks where he'd normally try to extort you. It skips that dialogue tree altogether he just hands you the money and leaves - without the gnomes.",0

eTh_P9sH2t8,@darrellonholding9866,2025-01-23T16:19:44Z,"Great guide, enjoying following it. Good tips in the comments as well, even had to start again because I didn't read the comments before playing as a lot has changed since the initial video (as expected).

Things that I noticed whilst playing the most recent update are (currently at 1:38.00):
1. Arka is a pain in the Arka - Followed a comment on here that suggested sprinting through the gate immediately after the battle with the Goblins and up the ladder to talk to Arka before she leaves. You automatically get the waypoint after the battle so you need to be quick, but this ready does work.

2. I couldn't distract Rugan & Olly with the Lute, so I followed the video guide up until the point that Flind was fighting for us and then with Karlac, used Dash & then Click Heels to sprint into the cave, steal the chest and then sprint out again. Continued the fight and made sure that any other character was closest to them for the conversation. Apparently they haven't noticed that the chest is gone!

As of 1:47.00, I have also noted the following:

3. Following on from another comment, I can confirm if you do infact ignore Rugan and head straight to the two locked gates, you only have to hide and unlock instead of jumping like in the video. The method of taking the chests to camp is still the best way to steal the chests quickly. Have you lockpicker unlock both gates then fast travel back to the entrance. Then take your strength character to go and collect the chests whilst hiding and send them back to camp to open at a later time.

4. Whilst knocking out the guys in the cave works, I recommend doing this after the above step. It worth pointing out that you can no longer still their entire inventory and hardly any gold. This includes the chest that you gave away.

As of 1:57 on the 24/01/25, I have noted the following:

5. Using the Fighting hireling with only a invisibility potion has taken me 27 attempts for the sword to drop when using disarming attack on Voss, he seems to vary between instantly engaging in combat and starting dialog. If the attack misses, Voss parries the attack or doesn't drop the weapon due to a saving roll, then he will initiate dialog, if the weapon drops then he will start combat and likely your hireling will be demolished before taking action. If the weapon drops and he is surprised, then you can either bring in the Calvary or steal the weapon with the hireling and take the beating before reviving the hireling from Withers. I suggest that as soon as you pick up the weapon with the hireling, transferring it direction to another character's inventory.

As of 3:05 on the 30/01/25, I had a funny interaction;

6. I followed the guide, killed off all the slavers in the Grymforge during the fight with Nere, then afterwards, the already dead Slaver tried to extort me! As soon as I finished the interaction with him, he fell on the floor dead again haha!

Will update with anything else that I notice along the way.",1
eTh_P9sH2t8,@cole0889,2025-01-22T16:32:27Z,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to point out a few things since I'm revisiting this amazing guide because of the recent news about patch 8, and I also needed a POE2 break, with 600+ hrs I needed a change of pace. lol
 
#1. First off everyone needs Brinna Brightsong in there everyday BG3 life. Hire her ASAP and change her class to Wizard, increase her wisdom att and add medicine proficiency,  give her Experimental Alchemy at lvl2 and add cleric class at lvl 3 for 4 lvls for the extra feat before adding the bard class for another 4 and the final feat. Increase wisdom, medicine and make sure to pick all the skills that boost ability checks long the way. Now every morning good old Brinna can be swapped in and out to use ""her"" spell slots on giving everyone in camp there daily buffs, allowing us to save spell slots and change our mage armour and Long Strider spells for something else. Now with Brinna's ""Halfling Luck"" and ""Experimental Alchemy"" she has a increased chance of making 2 potions instead of 1. (Increasing in level, adding stats and ability buffs will increase chances even more. The ""Lucky"" feat also stacks with halfling luck.)  Good Old Brinna is something else all right, dont get me started on her as a thief. lmao

#2. One item which is really helpful for locks and this walkthrough is the ""Smugglers Ring,"" so right after jumping across the river on the way to meet Karlach, turn left and just a few feet away it can be found on a skeleton against the cliff.  (Its hard to see the skeleton.) 

#3. The gloves ""Fleet Fingers"" can be found inside a buried chest to the left of the entrance to the Blighted Village, along with gold and other items inside a nearby tree with a single alchemy ingredient growing right in front it. (Perception check required but also gain a little Exp.) 

#4. Unlocking and using the elevator behind the illusionary wall inside the Zhentarim Hideout gives 1 Guild Artisan inspiration point and over 100exp in total. Plus using the lift brings you down to 3 locked chests, tons of supplies like food/wine/lockpicks and alchemy ingredients. (Using the lift before speaking to the Zhentarim doesn't effect quests or guide but if you hand the Caravan Strongbox over, leave the area and return there is a chance it wont be on the leader anymore. This happen on one of my playthroughs so be careful as I had to redo it.) G** D*** ü§¨... says my in game character...

#5. I just remembered that if you read all the Plaque's anytime in the Emerald Grove before battling Kagha, Gale will get 1 inspiration point and Shadowheart will get a new dialog option, but the best outcome to doing this is the easy D5 ""History"" skill check option that shows when convincing Kagha to join your side before the battle with the Shadow Druids.

I think that's about it, I'll add more if I remember or discover something else in my playthrough but if you guys know some act1 tips, items or secrets that ItsShatter or myself missed, can you reply in the comments plz, once patch 8 is released I'll most likely be back here again and any new info you've got would be helpful.

Not sure if it's anything I've done but I have followed this to the T and I only get the dialogue of I fail in getting the sword to drop.

My guess is that maybe due to the fact he has his sword in the dialogue options so it bugs out if he no longer has it equipped?

Im playing on ps5 and at 1.43.58 where we steal the strongbox and gloves from the npc's im unable to find them. This seems common also when stealing from merchants.

eTh_P9sH2t8,@carrastealth,2024-12-24T12:41:09Z,"2:23:00 I recommend after killing Auntie Ethel before talking to Mayrina you use ""speak to undead"" on her, getting her to confess she was going to eat Mayrina's unborn child.  This will help you in the conversation later to show her how badly she was going to be used and make her your ally.

Also when defending the Druid grove, I recommend saving Minthara for last, and using non-lethal strikes to knock her unconscious. You can still loot her, and she'll become a party member later. Always worth it, and it saves an additional life imho.",1

eTh_P9sH2t8,@jdalegria26,2024-12-24T01:14:36Z,"It's December 2024, and I‚Äôve recently started playing the game for the first time. I‚Äôve been using your guide as a reference, but I‚Äôve noticed several discrepancies between the guide and my gameplay experience.

For instance:

In the Druid Camp, I didn‚Äôt encounter the ‚Äúreturn the locket‚Äù scene with Meli,  she is not anywhere in camp to trigger the event. You can only find Meli in their hide out but there is no interaction and the locked has not yet been stolen.  

The only lady merchant who you speak after dealing with meli is not present in the camp either. 

On the other hand, I‚Äôve experienced several cute scenes with characters that weren‚Äôt mentioned in your guide.
This has left me feeling a bit lost at times, as I‚Äôm unsure if these differences are due to the game‚Äôs randomness or if the guide is outdated because of game updates.

Would it be possible for you to update the guide to reflect the current state of the game?  
Most guides online are from 2023 from the game first came out so they are not useful when trying to find out what to do. 

Thank you for all your hard work",0

However if you use the ALLOY to craft the ‚Äòspecial items‚Äô from Damon in act 2 he can craft you all 3 of them with only one piece of the alloy. Using it to fix Karlach will only let it be used once so use it for the items. Thus saving your infernal iron for karlach. Also I may have just missed it. But did you comment on the cult of boooal and the buff/weapon you can get there? Very good buff and depending how you go about it you can get it on the whole party permanently.

If you were ever wondering how the jumps through walls work, it's simply put a mixture of spamming the jump input and the clicking input to force the game to jump regardless of whether or not you could make the jump. You can do this almost anywhere in the game with varying results and it's actually really silly.",2354

tNhsvjo2NHU,@galaxy6251,2024-12-22T03:51:00Z,"Idk why people treat fighter like this all rounder class that can fill any or almost any role in the party, cuz not really honestly. 

Ultimately, for a well balanced, and optimal party, your party should consist of a frontliner, a healer, a mage, and a dexterity based character. This is fairly common sense and sentiment amongst anyone familiar with rpgs. And a fighter doesnt actually fit any of the roles besides frontliner. No real reliable team healing option, they are strength based so forget the dexterity, and only one subclass allows you to only be a hybrid of a mage and a brawler. So realistically no, fighter isnt actually this all rounder that people pretend like it is, its very much similar to the barbarian class, and fills the roles that that class would. 

The ranger is actually what everyone likes to descibe the fighter as. The ranger class can fill many different roles, the main 2 ability scores are dex and strength, along with its proficiencies can make it both good at a dexterity based role, and a frontline fighter, and on top of that, the ranger is also a spellcaster, capable of cast different spells and such. So yea the ranger is actually the true all round versatile class imho, and the fighter really isnt.",0

Not knowing what her character was about or what to do. I had a friend ask me to try to describe what the game was about, like what's the gameplay like, and i couldn't really explain. They're both the same problem. This isn't a game that can be explained. It's a game to be experienced, crafted to the players own tastes and preferences. It's entirely up to the player how to play the game, what makes the game appealing and fun for one person may make the game tedious and annoying to another, there isn't a way to explain this game much like there isn't a way to explain d&d until you experience it yourself.",0

Although from a similar perspective. Baulders gate also being my first instance of this specific type of rpg ( I‚Äôve played games like botw/totk and just started horizon) I knew that romancing was an option going in (and the very obvious nudity meter was very obvious) but I actually went in for my first long rest after a couple small fights after collecting my party members  because I was familiar with the concept after a few rounds of dungeons and dragons (the reason I even picked the game up to begin with) and was VERY surprised to find a pale elf trying to suck my neck out of the blue I didn‚Äôt even realise that he was a vampire at first and was more distracted by the fact that astarion was voiced by the guy who was two different characters in Detroit become human and my fav character that I saw when I watched a play through of resident evil village.

My first playthrough of BG3 was like living a new life. As someone who‚Äôs been gaming their whole life I am comfortable with this, but I also didn‚Äôt know everything about the D&D systems. Through my game though I just did things, and let things happen. Let the dice decide and made decisions based on what I think my character was thinking and feeling based on knowledge they currently had.

Wizards: the Nerds of D&D needs to get spell and does magic by studying a lot.

Druids: the Disny princess that Does a lot of Nature magic and can speak with animals.

The cleric: the religious nut job that often heals people gets their power from their god.

Sorcerer/Sorceress: the Trust fund magic user that was born with magic.

Warlock: the Suger baby who gets their magic from her sugar daddy/ sugger mommy typically a Demon/Fey/ dragon/ or another extremely magical race.

Bard: the Musical Disney Princess 
That cast spells thew song and dance üòä

Fighter: the meat head that likes to hit things and plays hero. Maybe not really smart but really tactical.

Ranger: Aragorn/Legolas. Need i say more?

Paladin: another religious meat head that likes to hit things and play hero, But for their god.

Rogue: the best class in the world.
Probably the smartest one and that everyone will depend on the most. They are the ones who has the most amount of skills.
They are the thief/assassin can do massive amount of damage. 
And is capible of using magical items and maybe become a magic user too?
Plus they are capable to talk themselves out of any situation üòä

I did need to research a lot other experienced players to gain guidance and clues to help me through places got stuck which happened a lot for this newbie. Though my son said I was cheating,  he still needed to help me through stuff too and explain the benefits of reliable spells and weaponry. It‚Äôs interesting perspective about not hearing your player‚Äôs voice having that would be nice, I agree. I found it difficult to know what order the story flowed and my kids had to redirect me back a lot as I felt compelled to entered other locations before I was supposed to. I will definitely continue the game again and definitely stay on explorer mode there is so much more to learn and loved the interactive nature of the game ,challenges one‚Äôs moral compass. It‚Äôs a big jump from harry potter to bg3, violent graphics  took some adjusting I found it quite an emotional experience,like connecting to actors in a movie.",0

SvrY9xlgAr0,@Rogue_kat,2025-01-08T17:23:04Z,"I find it kinda funny that a lot of the points you brought up at the start also applied to me because I am someone who usually hates fantasy related genres. Prior to this game I knew nothing about  D&D nor have I played anything with these types of mechanics. At the start of character creation I felt a bit overwhelmed and knew nothing but a very base idea of what some classes did and even then I too was on the same boat as warlock, sorcerer, wizard all looked the same to me. That being said I went with rogue because the I thought it sounded really cool to just be the backstabbing character. I am a bit glad though that the rogue kit is super simple with really only a few options for attack but the main thing I had to worry about was my positioning to get the most out of sneak attacks. 
For my first time playing I did play with 3 other ppl so I never had to manage other characters but if I did I would probably spend hours in combat and on their level up page just trying to understand what all they do. 
I will say my biggest struggle was at the start till I understood the game and world more but once I figured how it all works my previous game knowledge started to kick in and helped me get through everything faster.",0
SvrY9xlgAr0,@crabapple1974,2025-01-08T08:52:25Z,"Interesting video but one observation is that I think YOU approach the game a bit too mechanistically seeing it as a min/max for combat. I did the same first time due to having played lots of games over the years, beeing used to that is how you usally play it.But BG3 has so much more than combat efficiency. On my second play through I just played the game not focusing on what was the best. You don‚Äôt need to. The  DnD system takes some time to understand. Took me awhile before realizing you could press ‚ÄúT‚Äù and hover over all those keywords on a spell or item.",0

SvrY9xlgAr0,@VonGeggry,2025-01-05T22:39:04Z,"Ive been playing BG3 with my wife and it's been a whole ordeal mostly me because of me getting frustrated as its the first game shes ever really played so things like the bottom button being select and the right button normally being cancel learning the difference between the bumpers and triggers  (me too honestly haha) and even the start button. 

There's also been a lot of issues with the jank of playing with a controller. 

We have also been playing split screen and I HATE not being able to adjust the view when the screen combines. It's absolutely a game more designed for keyboard and mouse.

Overall she has been having fun. But i need to limit our sessions to not get frustrated. 

My other big issue is patience. I need to be more patient. She's just going to take a long time making decisions in this type of game and shes like learning a lot yet. But when we have been in a fight for an hour i start getting irritable.

Edit: wanted to add one last note. The game is seriously impressive. Yes it has a lot of bugs. I can't imagine how much better it must be now than on release, but you can tell most of them are just from HOW much stuff and how many options there are in the game. Only one I've seen regularly is the line for showing movement not showing up on after taking an action at times. Which i find rather frustrating.",0

The last game i played was Neverwinter and although I loved the game in the past, over the years it has gone downhill, with a toxic player environment, pay to win system and their constant reworks, where you need to constantly just sit there for hours working on your character to min/max for end game or you become irrelevant in the game for group content. I work all day and have a life, I don't want to come home and feel like i have to work again on my characters and that's what NW started becoming, it felt like another job and not enjoyable anymore. Prior to that I was a Guild Wars Vanilla veteran. I'm not sold on BG3 yet, the game seems kind of lonely, just being solo, with no other players to interact with aside from NPC's, or team up with, strategize, or just BS with over discord while playing etc... but with these cold and early nighttime winter evenings, I'm looking for a new game to get into, how hard is this game for a new player to just jump into?

AU5Wp9hHE6A,@JazzzRockFuzion,2024-12-27T02:55:37Z,"I've started the game three times, each with very different character builds - and each time made it most of the way through Act 1 before losing interest/getting frustrated and bouncing off. I just don't feel that BG3 is the 'second coming for RPGs', as is frequently proclaimed. 

I *LOVE* CRPGS - Planescape Torment and its sequel; Dragon Age Origins; Wasteland 2 & 3; the Avernum and Geneforge series'; Disco Elysium; Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous...heck, my 2023 GOTY was Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader - a phenomenal CRPG that was largely overshadowed by BG3. 

Personally, I feel that BG3 very much *wants you to play a certain way* and the player is mercilessly punished for not doing so. Whether it's attacking Auntie Ethel in her hut off the jump, causing the whole rest of the questline to glitch out irrevocably...or pushing the tiefling woman off the bridge into the githyanki patrol, causing them to inexplicably target your whole party immediately...or trying to fight Nere in the Underdark and getting absolutely wrecked, unless you painstakingly set up the party and cheese the battle in a specific manner...I find that I'm often punished unfairly for taking chances and trying things. So much of it just feels like sadistic trial and error, until you come to the couple of ""Larian-approved"" options in any given encounter. And don't even get me started on the RNG in turn-based combat...

I appreciate BG3's production values, cinematics and attention to detail. However, I've found that the return on my time/effort is simply not worth the investment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ",1
AU5Wp9hHE6A,@Multifidi20,2024-12-27T00:49:17Z,I hated it at first. Didn't know what I was doing and even uninstalled it on my xbox series x. I can't remember what made me reinstall it.

LHJ2Zz8mPWU,@JuanCarlos-lp4ug,2025-01-31T22:08:32Z,"with the game having been beaten by doing nothing in combat, by not ever taking any actions, and by never having been seen by anyone, it's apparent that any remaining challenge would have to be some more absurd enforced rule instead of a limitation. My suggestion is beating every battle by killing every enemy by only ever using the runepowder barrel and the main cast (no summons or hirelings). You'd probably have to add in a no-innocent casualties rule, and permadeath. Maybe finding ways to not perma squadwipe or kill innocents could be interesting",0

Gnomish Assassin? For the RP of being the kind of jovial friendly guy that no one will ever suspect can just straight up shake your hand, offer you a smile and stab you right in the back all at once. Walking away whistling like he's done not a thing wrong.

Ranger - Go Go Power, wait, I'm a ranger? Aww damn it... so much for the ""power"" in that fantasy. I'm not even sure a Drizzt build would save it lol. But I really, really want that panther statue...

Dragonborn Monk; for the Dragon-Style Kung Fu is strong with this one.

Then with a few failed multi-player attempts  (almost impossible to find a consistent group online) I ended up doing the first part of the game like 5 times in a row. I just got bored and dropped it. However I saw some streamers I know recently picking it up and decided to redownload it. Downloading my mods now. It's fun watching them but they're not... out of the box thinkers most of the time. I wanted to see a group playing that's more serious. Seems like this is a solo play so not exactly what I was looking for... but this channel was recommend so many times when I was researching.

rsnlokMpx-c,@game-enjoyer13,2024-01-01T18:31:55Z,"SPOILERS:

















It‚Äôs incredible how after finishing the game, and wrapping up at least a couple companion quests‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you realize the HEAVY foreshadowing they put RIGHT there in the boot up screen and title screen. A statue looking over baldurs gate. Very nice scenery. At first playthrough, completely blind, that‚Äôs all it is. Just a nice landscape shot. Then you realize it‚Äôs a statue of THE Balduran, the legendary figure and founder of Baldurs Gate himself. Ya know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the guy who BECOMES THE EMPEROR MINDFLAYER and, to an extent, kicks of the entire plot and background for the whole game, even BEING THE ONE WHO INFECTS YOU AT THE VERY START. Amazing choice of a title screen. 


But THEN it shifts downward, revealing a hidden, dark, evil looking lair or dungeon‚Ä¶.below the city. Of course referencing Bhaal and the Dead Three, something very very attached to Baldurs Gate and the titular games. First play through blind, probably thought nothing more than ‚ÄúOh yep, classic Baldurs Gate theme and location, nice.‚Äù And never gave it more thought. A reference? A fanservice? Simply cool contrasting imagery? Beautiful city with evil dungeon below? But then you realize after playing, well oh shit, this game IS indeed centered around The Emperor (Aka Balduran‚Äôs Mindflayer form), The Dead Three AGAIN, AND yet again Bhaal and the cult play a huge huge part of the story. Definitely not as subtle as the Balduran statue and city upper screen, but still, at first glance it‚Äôs just a cool contrast and reference to the classic BG1-2 games. BUT THATS NOT ALL, later in the Dark Urge new origin character, it‚Äôs revealed that, as history repeats itself lol, he is ANOTHER Bhaalspawn very similar to the BG1-2 ones. 


But one more thing that I found out: The boot up screen. It‚Äôs Larian‚Äôs logo yeah, but looks suspiciously like Balduran himself with the helmet‚Ä¶..and then it transforms into a mindflayer‚Ä¶.incredibly on the nose and blunt messaging actually. But at the same time, meaningless UNTIL you beat the game, and boot it back up afterwards. 



I love this game lol. So much foreshadowing and references and plot details sprinkled EVERYWHERE, many of them can basically spoil future plot reveals if you find them/read them. But i quite like that. Player agency, I see it as. You CAN potentially figure all this shit out HOURS before the story actually reveals it. And then again, you also COULDNT if you breeze through it and hardly read the books, listen to NPCs, look between the lines. Another great example of player choice and how their experience plays out",0

I6qlhmjkQ44,@Locutus47,2024-08-21T19:50:18Z,"The story of Baldur's Gate is basically as old as the pen and paper / D&D universe itself. Since the first Baldur's Gate was released, it has almost single-handedly transported the pen and paper feeling into the digital world. BG2 has made it even more extensive and a bit more interesting. Since then, many games have tried to put this feeling into their own projects. We basically all know them. Skyrim, Witcher, etc. One studio that discovered the feature of consequences for itself was the young studio Quantic Dream. With Fahrenheit, the sequels Heavy Rain, beyond two souls and finally Detroit Become Human. So many different ways to tell your own story where certain people can die right at the beginning. With Skyrim, it was the variety and design of the avatar. And of course to some extent the story too. The world feels tangible and comprehensible. And now, over 20 years later, after 3 years of Early Access, the long-awaited Baldur's Gate 3 is coming out. What I (we) had hoped for was actually the same as in BG2, only with more story and interesting characters and, of course, enormous freedom of choice. What we didn't think, however, was that Larian Studios had overdone it in every phase of what was humanly possible, to the point that it leaves you speechless after the first 10 hours. Wow, even the Early Access phase doesn't even come close to doing the finished product justice. I can't find the words to describe how deeply grateful I am personally to be able to consume something like this. In times of spectacular disasters and the worst games ever released, BG3 stands out so much from the crowd that you can't ignore it. YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Metacritic, every platform agrees. BG3 The Best F... Game of The Year. And I for one am glad that there are people out there like Naughty Dog, From Software and Larian Studios who still dare to do something and produce games for gamers and not primarily for the shareholders. And what have we learned from games like BG3? Well, that you just need a leader in steel armor who runs around the studio the whole time and motivates his employees to do the same. Please Larian, don't lose your fire like Blizzard or Activision. Because then you'll quickly end up in the top 10 worst games on Steam and who wants that? I'm happy to be able to consume content like this and I'm excited to see what else Larian will conjure up. Fill me with magic and take me with you wherever it may lead. Love lots of love and a 12/10 for the best adventure in my gaming history. 180 hours for one RUN btw.",0

Later with source necromancy/fire book and 1 normal you could make Mass Explode Corpse, same as normal but AOE and unlimited corpses, one of the strongest spells if you use many corpses.

In dos2 you couldn't pick up corpse so your only was to unlock full potential is either manually teleport everything or use it in big fight.

If BG3 version will be also AOE and not just ""choose more corpses"" then with ability to pick up bodies it could be one if the strongest spells",1

Just build a party withnall around high strength and good melee builds so they can jump far to reach enemies and since non lethal attacks only work for melee weapon attacks.
Monk, Fighter, Barbarian, Paladin would work amd have you covered on dex related shenanigans as well.
I guess you're gonna go about it more creatively, but since the challenge is just no killing, not no violence/being a pacifist, I immediately thought the non lethal attack option would make this a breeze.",0

I'm just not sure if holding people still so your NPC companions could kill them is technically pacifist, though. You are aiding in their demise. Casting invisibility on her at the beginning of the Ketheric fight I think is fair game because you're (as far as your characters know, I mean) just aiding her to help her run away, too. In the emperor fight soon after, though you are taking direct action against enemies in the emperor engagement, so I think that's a bit glossed over. But I guess otherwise it might have been impossible. 

Edit: After seeing the rest of it, yeah I'm not sure if just putting a bunch of explosive barrels near anything and then whistling is really not murder, but you know what, good job either way lol.",0

3: To inspect a creature you can just hit ""T"" when your cursor is over them. That saves you a few clicks

Your goal is to reduce the enemy's actions per round (often referred to as action economy in TT) therefore unless there is one enemy that just needs to die (such as a wizard) I tend to focus on the minions first, and leave the beefier targets for later

Say you are fighting a dude with two attacks and 3 minions with 1 attack each. You could very easily focus fire the minions, and if you knock all three of them off the board the enemy is getting two attacks per round instead of five, whereas if you only knock the big guy down to half hit points, the enemy is still making 5 attacks per round",1

How hard is it to add a dialogue box saying, ""Are you sure you want to cast this spell that requires concentration? You are already concentrating."" Or how about an optional icon or aura around the character (but not enemies) that tells me at a glance who is concentrating on a spell? There are very simple UI design choices that could make concentration easy to manage, but there's nothing.

Don't wait to do the cool, flashy thing, or deal the killing blow with a certain character, just end things as fast as possible.  I was playing FFT, the battle where Ramza fights Weigraf solo, and I had him down, but I wanted to kill him with something specific because it would look cool.  I wasted a turn, he recovered, killed me, and I had to replay the fight several more times before I got the win.  I vowed to never do that again, in anything.  I DO concede that in DnD, the storytelling can supercede the gameplay, so if losing or redoing the fight is worth it for the narrative, then there's a better argument for it.  But otherwise, learn from me, learn from Prince Oberyn, don't let your ego suffocate a victory with defeat.",0

-RavauwcjMI,@1SaG,2024-11-08T08:55:38Z,"I used to ignore ""permanent"" (meaning: until next long rest) buffs quite a lot. Things like ""Longstrider"" or ""Aid"" for example, all of which should be part of your daily routine, very early on. 
For example: Longstrider doesn't cost a spell slot, can be cast as many times you want/need and gives a very nice mobility boost to everyone in your party (including summons/familiars). All it costs you is that one party member needs to have it prepared and keep it prepared for the day. Cast it at higher spell levels to apply it to multiple characters in one go. 
""Aid"" is another very useful buff you should include in your morning routine - even if you can only cast it at minimum level, because 5 added HP per character makes a pretty big difference early in the game. Pick up and save those Aid-scrolls you find early in the game, as they'll allow you to use the spell at level one without even having to expend a slot. Once I get the spell-slot restoration amulet from Omelluum, I'll always cast it at level 3 (+15 hp), then immediately use the amulet to have Shadowheart recover that spell-slot. 
Later on, I'll always use things like Heroes' Feast, which, combined with a high level ""Aid""-buff will seriously boost everyone's HP and resistances. Just make sure if you're using summons/familiars, those are already present and within range of your caster when you fire off those buffs. 
You should also try to further buff everyone with elixirs if you have them. Arcane Cultivation or Battlemage's Power for your casters, Strength/Bloodlust-elixirs for your damage dealers or Viciousness for your CRIT-machine.",0

Me, who obsessively buffs the party to an absurd degree because I don't want my flaming Barbarian to get hurt: Don't forget Darkvision (if you don't already have it), Warding Bond and Protection From Poison.

But the main reason to check those ""ask"" tickboxes is to make sure your less important reactions don't trigger and prevent you from things that are quite crucial. For example, as a spellcaster, you probably don't want to use your reaction to attack someone leaving your melee range, especially not when you're holding up a counterspell. So the reactions that aren't crucial you should almost always be asked about.",0

A full run takes me about 90 hours, and with how much bullshit the game throws at you sometimes, or how possible it is to die to a stupid mistake, or a bug, I don't want to stress out over having to do it all *again*. In actual tabletop, you can, theoretically, reroll a new character, reset to an earlier point in the adventure, talk to the DM, etc etc. That's not possible here, obviously. I had enough situations where I simply misclicked, because a character's idle animation moved them one pixel and instead of attacking I moved a character, or where I throw something, with the line indicating the trajectory showing everything is fine, only for the thrown item to clip on the ceiling and fall onto a destructible bridge which instakilled my party; stuff like that isn't really fun or challenging, it's just frustrating.

SI09shYnEZo,@RadishAcceptable,2024-10-21T00:32:20Z,"Small tips for folks that try this kind of run (I haven't played outside of Honor Mode for long, only getting through Chapter 1 on Tactician, similar to Kelski).

You can hire a druid NPC from Withers and use all their casts on summoned magical berries each night before sleep. At around level 3 it's enough for 20 supplies. Then as the game progresses, you get two more druids. You need the druids to STAY in your party after casting or the berries disappear, so cast them immediately before sleep, and the three of them should be enough to make food a complete non-issue.

You can have a Withers mage cast Mage Armor on party members to save spell casts before swapping them out as well, and you can give a Withers NPC the feat for better potion brewing so you don't suffer combat opportunity loss on your main characters.

You can have a withers priest NPC cast Poison Resistance and Aid on your party members to save on casts as well.

Having an escape plan is by far the most important way to ensure you don't wipe. An easy way is to simply have one member stay at camp until a fight starts and then have them join only when you know you're going to win the fight, or by keeping a member far enough away to be able to get away easily. Sanctuary is one of the strongest spells in the game for this. Shadowheart can cast it on herself along with dashing and long strider to get away from almost all fights. Misty step is also very strong for this.

Bard is likely the strongest class for honor mode, and either Sword bard or Keeper of Lore are top tier classes. You can dip 2 levels into Paladin if you want, but it's fine to go full 12 levels in bard.

Lucky is probably the strongest first pick for honor mode on all builds outside of very specific builds, especially if you're using druids to make long rests much more free. It's 3 free conditional rerolls on either attack rolls, saving throws, or enemy attack rolls.

Divination wizards are super strong for honor mode for a similar reason as the Lucky feat.

Ambushes are OP. If there isn't some urgent reason to finish a fight the first time, like an NPCs life on the line, running away with everybody and re-engaging on your own terms with an ambush is stupidly strong.

Halflings have a stupidly strong racial ability for Honor mode, being able to roll all natural 1s, including attack rolls and saving throws. When you consider that nat 1 is auto fail, and it's a flat 5% chance, you're taking that auto fail and turning it into just rolling again. It's stupid stronk.

You don't need to abuse things like Withers respec and/or strength potions in order to beat Honor Mode in your first play through. I've never used Withers to respec anybody. You also don't need to have busted builds. My first time through was pure class for each character. Just be prepared to run away when you need to.

Even with all this, you'll still fuck some things up and/or roll bad sometimes. It's okay! Play it out! That's what this mode is about.",11

jYzBDWCq9i8,@–ù–µ–ø–¢–æ—Ä,2024-12-22T00:31:24Z,"Waiting for a second attack till at least lvl 6? And using your bonus action on it??? And missing out on a feat till lvl 7???? And picking GWM that gives you an additional attack that also consumes a bonus action???????? What the ü¶Ü 

This build is basically junk for a normal playthrough and people who are new to the game will taste a lot of deaths if they try to follow this ""guide"". Of course it works as a build you can use when you're already lvl 9+, but untill that point, you're way better off even just sticking with a pure fighter or barbarian 

""Look for these items"" - one requires you to kill a major mid-boss in Act 3, another to go to hell, what a friendly build

Plus this is also missing the point of Guts. He started out as a barbarian, raised on a battlefield, fighting for his life for as long as he can remember. When he first met Griffith, he was defeated like some random thug, so starting out as a ""Battle Master"" is, no, that's just wrong

The True Guts Build:

Start out as a Barbarian. The first ability scores should be 16 14 16 8 8 12 to get started. When you stole enough elixirs of strenght, respec to 8 16 16 8 12 14 or something similar. If Guts isn't the face of your party, 8 16 16 12 14 8 will do nicely

Builds that rely on getting +1 to some ability score from the hag's hair are not good builds, so don't center your own builds around a single one use item

Pick Berserker at lvl 3; pick Savage Attacker at lvl 4 (you can pick GWM, but it's high risk - high return and sometimes your bonus actions will overlap, so I'd recommend a safer, more consistent option); get a true second attack at lvl 5; multiclass into a fighter at lvl 6; pick Champion at lvl 8 for extra crits and better sustainability or Battle Master for more options; pick an Alert feat at lvl 9; respec at lvl 11 into 7 Barbarian / 4 fighter, with Savage Attacker and Tough or GWM feats, depending on yiur playstile. Both options fit Guts. At lvl 12, respec again into a 9 Barbarian / 3 Fighter, to complete your Crit build, since since Barbarians get an additional dice on crits at lvl 9

For equipment - basically anything. A big sword, some medium armor, and you're good to go. All the other equipment is trivial

Edit: I'm not proofreading this a second time, so deal with it",1

W/o a doubt in my mind, it is the greatest video game of all-time.   Nearly flawless.  Its replayability makes it the best financial deal in video game history.  üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüíØ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",0

66-eMpcnM0Q,@coffekihlberg,2024-12-27T06:07:23Z,"The new games are going to be based on critical role and Matt Mercers Exandria.
Think about it, huge fan base, Matt Mercer already has ties to Larian studios and knows Vinke, the world is already fleshed out, lots of characters and a lot of voice actors are tied to CR.
Now that Larian has the engine it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to convert the system into the one CR are doing.
I've said this since they said they're doing another ""similar"" game but not in forgotten realms.",0

I know they don't want expansions or DLC, but damn, I wish they'd continue to add more and more for decades. I would happily pay 100 bucks every couple years for massive content drops.",0

I did this with Divinity Original Sin 2 as well because I thought I made a mistake with something. so while I think DoS 2 is one of the greatest games I've ever played, I only finished it once. I need to replay these are finish them lol. I think I'll go with Evelyn's Stealth Archer build, playing as the Dark Urge, since he/she is the main character of Baldur's game 3 (spoiler alert). I'm sure Divinity Original Sin 3 will be another masterpiece once they release that in 2026 or whenever",0
