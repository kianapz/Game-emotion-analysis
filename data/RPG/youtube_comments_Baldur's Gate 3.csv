Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@nathanmejia7000,"When I bought this game, I was expecting a hack n‚Äô slash, Baldur‚Äôs Gate original. This game is more of like an immersive-story, narrative-driven, turn-based-strategy, simulation game. It‚Äôs comparable to expecting Star Wars, and getting Star Trek, instead. Amazing cinematics. Great character story depth, but the game mechanic is not hack n‚Äô slash, as expected- which was really disappointing for me b/c this was how I remember playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate as a kid. This game is more along the lines of the original Dragon Age saga game mechanic. Real-time, Turn-based-strategy. Just to add my review, if your looking for an original, hack n‚Äô slash, Baldur‚Äôs Gate game, sadly this is not it. However I don‚Äôt want to dump on the developers, b/c it looks like a lot time and development went into this game- amazing cinematics, great voice actors, In-depth character driven story-lines, the list goes on‚Ä¶however it‚Äôs just not hack n‚Äô slash, and this was the major turn off for me.",0

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@Ben-zr4ho,Not a D&D guy but Im pretty sure the slightly lackluster loot hauls are rooted in D&D where magical items are supposed to be pretty rare. Although with Gale sucking them all up... Ahem. Probably should have given us a bit more. Or at least more magical items that do more than giving you a shitty level 1 spell.

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@Ben-zr4ho,"The amount of replayability in this game is INSANE. From character builds  that have subclasses that you can multiclass that you can subclass. The fact that those builds affect dialogue. The choices you make the can really affect the game seemingly every 5 minutes, including main characters dying. Like there are multiple Wrex moments, some quite early in the game. Just the branching paths of branching paths of branching paths. Its truly the most impressive thing about this game. No game has ever come close. I mean I always thought it was crazy that people played Mass Effect 3 with Talia when she died for me at the end of 2 but in this game its like, ""Oh all those things that did or didn't happen to that major character in your playthrough? Interesting... I barely remember that guy. I killed him in act 1."" Again the branching storyline tree would be a mile wide if you wrote it out on a wall. I swear 50% of the development team spent the entire development time just writing. The variations a single dialogue can take.",2
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@Ben-zr4ho,"I never quite got into Divinity 2. Lot of little weird mechanics I just never quite got into. The lack of polish (probably not really polish, just lack of development money) in cutscenes. I never got into the characters. The fact that if you went right instead of left at a fork in the road you encountered a combat that you were like 3 levels behind prepared for and you were just completely fucked, no warning at all, its not like you wandered too far off the beaten path or something, like those damn scarecrows like 10 feet away from the fishing village you first encounter after escaping the prison Island (which does occasionally happen in BG3 but not nearly so much and its usually a little more your fault for wandering a bit too far) The fact that you encounter your entire playable party like right away but then basically have to just choose half of them and the other half is never seen from again... The lack of a good hub or camp. There just being too much gear you dont care about and how cluttered your inventory gets. I didnt like the maps which just didnt feel open world enough. I didnt really care about the story. I quit playing halfway through the game and that is just something I NEVER do...
Im loving BG3 though. The cut scenes and the writing is AAA instead of AA for one. But if I had to describe the difference quickly it was like Divinity was 100% Larian and BG3 is like 75%% Larian with like 15% Bioware, 5% Bethesda, 5% Black Isle. The game is definitely Larian but with like just enough Dragon Age and Skyrim and Fallout 1 & 2 / Planescape.",0

Steam is also unable to make KB&M the default for both players in couch co-op.

Player 2 will then be prompted to create their own character in their half of the split screen ; this character cannot be used separate to the save file as it will be locked to the profile handling the new game.

Console players feel like first class citizens and not like they're playing a port of a PC game. Of course, a massive part of this is that combat is entirely turn based. A comparative game, to an extent, would be Dragon Age: Origins. This uses a similar kind of control system but it didn't work so well in DA due to combat being real time with tactical pausing. With the turn based combat here, and pretty much infinite radial menus it all just comes together flawlessly and you don't feel like you're getting a raw deal on console.

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@mikewright2858,"I played D&D as a kid in the early to mid 80's and still remember spending most of $15 I received from my grandmother on my birthday at ""Ask Your Mother"" - a little hobbyist / tabletop gamer store in Brunswick, ME. That day I bought the ""Player's Handbook"" - my first of the nice, hard-back rule books after starting with the paperback Basic D&D (red?) and Advanced D&D (blue?) books. The rules books themselves were fascinating in and of themselves. The sheer amount of lore, detail, and original artwork have no equal today in the era of ridiculous AI-generated imagery. And, let's face it - when you're 11 or 12 years old in the early 80's some of the artwork were soft-core porn by the standards of those days! 

I played the original Baldur's Gate many years ago, and finally snagged this one just yesterday. I am very early in the playthrough, and despite being several major rule versions behind, I am having little trouble jumping in. I'd suggest if you're not at all familiar with D&D or tabletop role-playing games in general to do a little reading for an hour or so to familiarize yourself with some of the terms and concepts, like armor class, saving throws, and the like. 

One thing I really like about the turn-driven nature of combat is you don't have to be an over-caffeinated (even though I still am as an early-50s software engineer!), spends 10 hours a day in the basement gamer with the mouse dexterity of a Minecraft ninja to play. The focus is very much on tactics. Who do you position where, and what weapon/spell/etc. are they going to employ? Who to target first? Combat resource management. Stealth. Cover. It's a nice change from the frantic click-fests of COD and top-down RTS games. Need to spend 10 minutes on a turn? Go ahead! 

Like I said, I am VERY early in the game, and so far I am VERY impressed. My system can run at 120FPS with everything on max (thank you VR and DCS) but again, the turn-driven nature makes frame rate a little less important which should make the game more accessible to many. The only thing I think this game really NEEDS is Ray Tracing support. This game would look incredible with RT. Its use of HDR is really nice and it looks great on my HDR 1400 monitor - but Ray Tracing would be the icing on the cake. I hope they can add it. I doubt it's on the radar as that is not what this game is about, but it would be incredible. Seriously - it could be a paid enhancement and I'd pay $10 for RT support in this game. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this if you're even remotely interested in the genre.",1

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@Kataleptyk,"BG3 is an excellent game, even though some elements were not completed, not used in the plot, or even just due to simple bugs. But as a cRPG game, in my opinion it has one gigantic flaw that none of the reviewers of this game mention.
The game is great fun in single-player mode, but it takes on a completely new quality when we play multiplayer with friends. And here comes the above-mentioned problem - the game does not offer any form of internal voice communication between players. Absolutely none.
This means, that you have to look for a potential game partner on your own, completely outside the game, and then determine the method of communication with her in the game (TS, DC, others).
If you enter multiplayer mode in the game and try to join another player's server, almost everyone will reject you for one simple reason - they will not have any voice communication with you.

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - Before You Buy,GhUXwcYqLdg,@-2high2fly-,"Idk why but I just can't get into these kind of games. This has like all the aspects of games I don't like, the top down type camera angle, the million things to be constantly on top of that seem somewhat trivial, the dice rolling in pretty much any capacity when it comes to any game for movement other than Mario Party, and worst of all the turn based system. Other than Pokemon and Yakuza Like a Dragon, I never played a turn based game I liked. Thank you for making this video so I had a good idea of what I was in for prior to purchasing it! And to those who do like these kind of games, enjoy! I may not be a fan, but I can see the allure for people who do like these mechanics in games! To each their own and I hope whoever buys this game has an absolute blast playing it! Ill stick to my AC6, Spiderman, Ratchet and Clank, GOW, RDR, Jedi,  those types of games lol üòÅ",1
