RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,quick tip. first major battle that is 30 to 40 minutes. save right after. the game doesnt auto save after the battle not at the celebration.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"i bought this game immediately after hearing a multitude of other game developers were saying, don't expect us to make this level of game.!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-11,nothing like watching a before you buy right after i bought the game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,hard for me to get a table top dnd session going. hard to do with with a busy life. a game like this that virtualizes that experience without needing to trouble a dmaster? perfect! can do it with friends too? even more impressive. the fact too that you can romance characters and approach situations in so many different ways makes this a very entertaining game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,didnt even need a before you buy for this game. the fact that other aaa devs were bashing the game because of its grand design told me all i need to know. instant buy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i've never played a game like this but from the great reviews to seeing the freedom of choice and honestly if nothing else to support a developer that believes in giving a full experience from the jump with no micro transactions is enough to purchase the game. after seeing so many devs complain about this game as an anomaly and not to be expected from other studios makes me want to support it that much more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,ive never played a crpg. but ill give it a try with this game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"voice actor for zanner toobin here, its so stupidly awesome to see how much people are loving the game. bg3 fandom are truly the goats!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i'm playing a single player campaign as a halforc ranger and a mp with my brother as a dwarf warcleric. the racial and class differences have already made some major changes and it's already felt like a completely different game several times now. also in my sp campaign i defeated a miniboss with some positioning and cheesing and knocked them into a cavern. i got the xp, they certainly died, but i didn't get the loot. it was early on and i figured meh, the xp was the real reward here because i was probably slightly too low of a level to be fighting that and winning anyway, so i let it go. 3 levels and hours later i found the body in the underdark, and got the loot. my characters even commented about how it looked like it fell a long way. that's some attention to detail, most games would just say meh it's gone, delete the npc, but not in this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the fact theres so many different outcomes to situations, makes this so replayable and immersive. i absolutely love this one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,gameranx still making videos after 11 years is respectable dedication
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"just one more minute i cannot describe how true this statement is for me. now this is coming from someone who had no dungeons and dragons experience and in fact i despise most and every rpgs i've played. this one couldn't be more different. i cant stop playing it, it feels so great to be immersed in a world finally. i could never see the appeal when its just a boardgame and thought it was lame af to have an entire boardgame around thinking about almost everything and total imagination. seeing it in a video game world completely made me fall in love with the genre and i keep saying to myself just one more minute. had this gameshared with me from my brother who's friends bought him the game. we have almost complete opposite schedules so i can play his games and he can play mine basically whenever. he told me about it and i downloaded it took me 6 hours due to insanely slow internet which is also why i rarely like trying new games especially those within a new genre. couldn't be more hooked and i wish everyone to at least try the game, even if you think dd is lame or boring or nerdy or whatever give this game a try and then give a final opinion because if you can't get immersed into an rpg with this game then genuinely there might not be anything to get you into the genre. genuinely people try this game i hate medieval skyrim, chivalry, etc. i have always been a shooter  br guy for a lot of my gaming years i hate fantasy, i hate rpgs, anything this game has i hate but playing this game made me change my opinions on all this stuff and i am hooked on a genre and game i wouldn't have seen myself playing in a thousand years. thank you for listening to my ted talk y'all, it just feels so good to finally be passionate towards a game considering how seemingly difficult it is to get totally enthralled in the game like when you're a kid. i haven't felt this level of passion and joy towards a game since h1z1 kotk best gaming experience ever hands down and that game has been dead for over 5 years now. thank you larian for making this game and i hope this game gets all the recognition it deserves."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"one thing i'd recommend to newer or casual type players in a game like this don't be shy about the easier difficulty mode. these games tend to be pretty tough and are more than happy to kick the crap out of you for not understanding everything about them. if you're new and just want to have a fun time in this massive world turn the difficulty down and use that to learn at an easier pace. i have learned that multiclassing is for some silly reason turned off for default explorer mode. there's a super easy workaround if you still want to multiclass though, just play on the custom difficulty instead turn down everything that you think you might want toned down to a lower difficulty but turn on multiclassing. takes like a minute to set up. d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,the simple fact that this game gives you real rewards for and encourages off the path exploration hits me the best
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,as a non dd player i am so hyped for this game. since i was never lucky enough to gather people to play dd this seems like the best chance you can get to play it by yourself. definitely going to buy that when i can spare the money
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i love how much the combat system rewards thinking a bit, without even entering exploit or cheese territory. sneaking around for reconnaissance, splitting the group for flanking, using the high ground, funneling people into choke points, none of those are abusive but standard, common sense ways of approaching fights. last time i played a crpg many years ago you just had to make sure your tanks stood in the way to protect your casters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,honestly after three hours its just wild to me how many choices there are and how impactful they can be. the amount of stuff you can just walk passed and not even look at which actually was important is so cool
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"the characters are what impress me in bg3. your companions are all very interesting, clever and have very strong personalities and even individual mannerisms. no copypasted animations. even down to their minute facial experessions. i don't think i've ever had a hard time deciding who to romance, theres usually only one option i really like. i have some tough choices ahead lets be real it's gonna be astarion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i bought this game 3 years ago just to show my support. it was worth every penny.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,i am not typically into this type of game but i have absolutely fell in love with this game. it is astounding the amount of content they have.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,game developer that respects the player base and delivers. so rare in game developers theyre the one only ones left.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,i never liked turn based combat in games but this game seems so deep in everything else that i'd probably forgive the combat and just play the game for what it is. looks like you could get deeply immersed in to this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i think larian has finally established themselves as the guys you call when you want a kick ass rpg. they have been crushing it. watch out aaa devs, the new kids on the block ain't messing around"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"i bought this game as soon as it came out in early access. i played through the early access version by myself and with friends countless times. when this came out as a full release i don't think i've ever been more excited for a game than this one. i am a big dnd fan as well so having a pretty true to life game version of its current 5e rule set with certain tweaks is really enjoyable. i have recommended this game to friends who have never played this type of game or probably normally never would. however every single one of them has continued to praise it and played nothing else except this since its been released. i would easily say this is one of the best releases of the year, and definitely one of the top crpgs ever made. larian did an exceptional job with this one, and the fact they actually are actively listening to fans and their feedback to make improvementschanges shows they truly cared. if only this level of commitment and care was a standard across the industry,"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"playing this game with friends is a shockingly accurate recreation of playing tabletop dungeons and dragons with friends. especially the tension of watching each players' turn, knowing every player's decision gives an important nuance to the situation makes group play really dynamic. and the satisfaction of finding where you're useful to the group. and when you're playing solo, masterminding a solution using your tools, environment, and party is so satisfying."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,it's amazing. i played the prerelease and it's different enough i'm not bored. the story is much better. i love it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"haha, jokes on you, i already bought the game. your well thought out reviews will not thwart my blind impulse purchases today!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,hadn't much fun playing a turn based game since the lord of the rings the third age back in 2004. well done to larian for this incredible game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,great to see a crpg doing this well in 2023!! the fact that larian is continuing to make these while obsidian is making 3d games like outer worlds makes me happy at least.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i had no idea bg3 was made by the same people who made divinity 2. i love that game and it was extremely reminiscent of dd. now that they made a game officially backed by dd, i cannot wait to play it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"actually i think the controller support for this is one of the most impressive parts, i would never even consider playing a game like this on controller, but its a really good implementation especially if you are playing on a tv and the ui is too small for you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"the game not autosaving often is actually one of the best feature for me. that way i can quicksave before engaging key moments and try different dialogue options. best game of 2023 and one of the best rpg of all time, hands down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i played the original baldurs gate a couple years ago. loved it. some games are timeless.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"never played a crpg but the more i hear about it, the more excited i get! this sounds like everything that i've felt was missing from modern rpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,the sorcerer goes in. caster is just fun in general imo. game in general is just lore rich doesnt even feel like a hassle to go around the world. like other turn based. you guys are
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-11,i bought this game a few days ago and i am absolutely in love with it. this is my first d  d game and i normally don't like turn based games but the story and quests so far are freaking amazing. took me a bit to get used to the combat system though. this is gonna go down as one of my all time favorite rpg's. absolutely amazing game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,don't know if this one is for me but i always appreciate a game studio that doesn't forget their main audience and water down the game that made them in order to appeal to a wider audience. everything doesn't need to be for me and i'm cool with that as long as people who are into it are happy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"i played early access and the game has changed in so many ways. even going from the final ea patch to this release version, i am noticing so many changes. the game looks even better. some balancing. quite a few qol changes mostly from the early days of ea, but some new ones too. this game is a masterpiece and i can't wait to explore as much as i can. i'm also so interested to see how the game changes now that it is released. sure there will be some stability patches. but in the past larian has included some surprises as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"a few things that i really liked when i played the beta was that combat encounters weren't necessarily fixed to be combat encounters. in the gnoll fight at 637 you can use your mind flayer abilities to persuade the gnolls to attack the people in the cave. afterwards the gnoll leader comes back to you saying they're still hungry, in which you could persuade them to attack each other. once the other gnolls die, you can persuade the gnoll leader to canabilize itself for food. an entire fight avoided thanks to 1 spell, crown of madness, and the mind flayer leech."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"a few of my friends did a one off dnd campaign because i was curious about it and i wanted to play. it lasted about six hours and i honestly really enjoyed it. i thought dnd was more of a really hard to understand takes months to get into sort of game and i personally never cared but after that, i got really into it the possibilities the imagination it was honestly just really cool then i heard about baldurs gate three dnd taken into a video game world. and coming from a gamer i was immediately intrigued. then i found out that the entire campaign was playable multiplayer and i got even more excited. i decided to play with one of my friends after we convinced each other that the game was worth 60 we are currently playing the entire campaign together and from my experience, not knowing a lot about dnd or playing really any games like this. its extremely difficult in the beginning, but given four or five hours you pretty much understand the entire combat aspect and from that point forward, youre just having a blast. the story is absolutely mind blowing. the characters are funny spicy and so full of life. i recommend this game to anyone with the money and anyone with even a little bit of interest, i promise you wont be disappointed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"game works great, i had one quick save that got corrupted and i had to revert to the previous one. luckily it was just a few minutes of rollback. very impressed so far with the story, combat and just about everything. i play a high elf paladin and i love the roleplaying that keeps me in check as paladin as i love helping ones in need"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i played dnd 5e for about a year, and i am so excited for this title. it's been a really long time since i bought a game close to launch and even paid full price for. what i especially love is how larian puts so much money into bg3 and don't shove mtx down our throats. i hope it sends a strong signal to treeple a studios that this is what we want from them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"don't usually comment on your channel, but after watching this video, i did another thing i've never done. i've never bought a game the same year it came out, much less the same week, but i am so glad i did! easily one of the best rpg's i've ever played, finally unseating skyrim for me. so thank you for that! and keep up the good work!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"as someone who finished the bg1 and 2 back in the day, this looks awesome. my main worry is that i don't have enough time to meaningfully play it, as it doesn't seem like a very casual game and i have less time then i used"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"damn, waiting for the ps5 version to release is going to be torture. i'm so excited to play this!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"hey, jake! thank you for the before you buys!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i was on the beta. i'm super happy with how it's come out. the prologue level is much shorter, so you're in the actual game proper sooner. the new items and the proficiency bonus skills allows for a lot of variety in combat. i love having the option to play the npc characters. i'm super excited to see what's beyond act 1."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"been playing with my brother using local co op, it's been a blast. just like when we were kids playing baulders gate on the ps2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"bravo !! larian for pushing the mark as of creative and extensive rpgs, great to see what gaming has come too !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the cool thing about it is larian have been actively seeking this project for years. after divinity 1 they approached wotc and asked if they can develop baldurs gate 3. wotc said we like you but you dont have enough experience and games in your portfolio for us to trust you yet. larian said okay bet. made divinity 2 one of the greatest rpg games every made and then wotc approached them to make this game. theres a lot of love in this and it shows.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"it really is an amazing game. i haven't been this pleased with a game in a long long time, it's been so long since a game just totally sucked me in. i feel like i'm a kid again playing baldurs gate 1,2, and neverwinter nights. i can't think of a game in the last 10 years that made me feel like this except maybe the witcher 3, and red dead 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"this isn't really my type of game, but i will absolutely buy this to support larian. finished games with love and effort put into them always need to be supported."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"started playing since yesterday night and yeah, a few hours in, its pretty awesome. i know there are some discussions out there on whether its really an heir to bg2, but when it comes to how it makes me feel, its like being thrown back 23 years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i already bought. i don't normally do crpg's, i tried divinity and haven't been able to play more than a few hours into a campaign before getting overwhelmed and disinterested. i bought this game on aug 3 and i'm 52 hours in so far, i can't put it down. one of the best games of the year by far, highly recommend even if you don't traditionally play these kinds of game, especially if you don't"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"never played a game like this, just bought it to support a company that compared to all the tripple a studios seems to be on the right path with fans and values, i actually started it yesterday and it is god damn georgous"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-11,"terrible game. zero micro transactions, no battle passes, no loot boxes. what were the developers thinking."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"i never got into dd, but i've dabbled in a few crpg's. those didn't really click with me, but the choices you can make in the story plus the indepth combat really makes me want to try this game. plus, it's basically a giant middlefinger to aaa gaming, what with missing all the microtransactions and such. still on the fence, but it looks good"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,thanks jake! always love a good before you buy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,silent watcher for decades. it is now part of my buying process to always watch 'before you buys'. outstanding work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"this was my first hardcore rpg, i played a bard. honestly you will stumble a bit with the combat at first, but pretty quickly you get pretty good at using the most of your team"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i need to say that gameranx reviews are the only reviews i trust at this point. the fact you guys maintain your composure in the face of something as amazing and standard setting as bg3 has confirmed my faith in your judgment is not misplaced. please keep doing what you do for the community and continue to hold the industry to a standard acceptable to the community they deliver to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i got early access day one.. loved every minute of the near 200 hours spent in early access. finally it here and i cant think of a game im more pleased with.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"i've already purchased this game for console to have it as a proper sit down and play for a good few hours type game, but this game just looks and feels perfect for the steam deck! also now that it is verified on the deck, it opens up so much versatility to the game! maybe having a full on roleplay character for my console, but then having a more jokey clich character for my steam deck playthroughs would be a nice idea!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i like how i've never really heard of baldur's gate before now, but it's kinda the only new release i'm interested in because it looks so different from everything else that's been releasing. this year's been the year of the remakeremaster but this game is interesting and seemingly sprawling with effort."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i have been great watching people play the game on live streams, with all of the great voice acting and character interaction, then the dice rolling. people in chats get very invested in the outcomes etc. i think bg3 will probably have a very good lifespan."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is simply put, the best rpg ever made full stop. the amount of love, work and care that has obviously gone into this, puts ea, ubisoft and all the others to shame. the new standard of how rpgs need to be made, coming from an indy company. edit indie means independent not small company."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-01,"the amount of replayability in this game is insane. from character builds that have subclasses that you can multiclass that you can subclass. the fact that those builds affect dialogue. the choices you make the can really affect the game seemingly every 5 minutes, including main characters dying. like there are multiple wrex moments, some quite early in the game. just the branching paths of branching paths of branching paths. its truly the most impressive thing about this game. no game has ever come close. i mean i always thought it was crazy that people played mass effect 3 with talia when she died for me at the end of 2 but in this game its like, oh all those things that did or didn't happen to that major character in your playthrough? interesting... i barely remember that guy. i killed him in act 1. again the branching storyline tree would be a mile wide if you wrote it out on a wall. i swear 50 of the development team spent the entire development time just writing. the variations a single dialogue can take."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"1131 welcome to dungeons and dragons, or literally any ttrpgcrpgs, where the next step is so open ended you have no idea what to do next. it may be a drawback for some, but this issue is actually the greatest feature of dnd and other ttrpgs, so really larian embraced it and gave made it tangible. i only see this as a success"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,jake jake oh man i've been watching reviews for years but you guys at gameranx give the most sincere and genuine feel of all the media. you've become a mustcheck for me with every new release that catches my attention. thanks and keep up the good work!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-06,"just started playing this recently after never playing a crpg or a single game of dnd, and i pretty much agree with everything jake says here. it can seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get a hang of the combat, everything clicks. i also realized pretty early on that this game is so dense with stuff to docheck outexplore that there's no point in trying to get through it quickly. i highly recommend it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,viola a underrated fighting game character from soul calibur v and the only female fighting game character i've ever loved and mained across all fighting games i played will be my character on bg3 since i'm on a relentless spree to insert her everywhere since bamco abandoned her. day 1 steam deckgaming pc player here. downloading now on pc.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,this seems soooo much like dragon age origins which is still to this day my absolute favorite rpg. im so hyped
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,larian is really setting the standard for rpgs. prepare to see tons of clones down the line.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i've been playing multiplayer with my buddy and i've had a couple of crashes so far, and the autosave feature doesn't go as often as i'd like. but beyond that, this game is amazing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,thanks to jake and gameranx for helping me prepare to get into a series i havent played and from a developer i havent played but have heard lots about! it really was helpful!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"been playing since 2020 and i have seen some tweaks for the better. this game is awesome. hats off to larian they have made a fantastic game. full of amazing characters and dialogue and etc, etc. the list goes on, they have packed so much into this. you do not have to play the 1st two games even though i have to enjoy this. some characters pop up here and there and there are a few easter eggs, but new players can jump straight in. it helps to either watch or read up on dnd structure if you have never played that type of game before. have fun fellow adventurers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"my friend and i spent an hour and  trying to take down the introduction boss you're not supposed to defeat. it was somewhat of a pain, but if you're running a barbarian you get a sick flaming great sword that will last quite a few levels."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i'm buying it... not cause i generally play this kind of game or even will but cause this is the kind of effort, love and finishing i want to see in games"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,really looking forward to this one this weekend. what a great year for gaming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this looks like one of those absolutely amazing genre defining games that i could never play with just how little time and patience i have for gaming these days. i mostly need quick easy fun pick up and play type of games and this is not it lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,first play through and going as a barbarian. currently loving the barbarian  intimidation checks where i have advantage on the roll cause barbarian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,i was going to say something really stupid and arrogant but if people like this game  good on them and the devs ! this is what gaming is about theres all types of games for every type of player !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i love this game. i'm currently running a high elf noble wizard with a necromancer sub class.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,love reading dnd booksnovels. but i havent really played a legit dnd game ever not counting kotor the rules always seemed confusing to me. but i am looking forward to getting into this in my old age. the next couple of months are going to be frothy for game releases
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"god this is the first game in years to make me want to play on pc, been too comfortable playing consoles for the last years that my pc probably cant run this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,i thought i wasnt gonna buy it when i saw this video like 2 weeks ago . but today i bought it . i never played dungeons and dragons . completely new to this . but it looks cool . and i see it coming up everywhere . in 6 hours im gonna start the journey . letsgooo
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"final fantasy, elder scrolls, elden ring, no matter what rpg you've played, dungeons and dragons is the grandfather of them all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"weeks of playing it later, this game is freakin incredible. the level of depth is absolutely stunning and ive tried a few different plays and all have been different."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"thank you jake and the gameranx team! before you buy is probably one my favourite series on youtube, informative yet entertaining. i watch every single one of these videos, doesn't matter if i'm interested in the game or not. that being said, i think i'm getting this one on my next pay cheque!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"i played dd as a kid in the early to mid 80's and still remember spending most of 15 i received from my grandmother on my birthday at ask your mother  a little hobbyist  tabletop gamer store in brunswick, me. that day i bought the player's handbook  my first of the nice, hardback rule books after starting with the paperback basic dd red? and advanced dd blue? books. the rules books themselves were fascinating in and of themselves. the sheer amount of lore, detail, and original artwork have no equal today in the era of ridiculous aigenerated imagery. and, let's face it  when you're 11 or 12 years old in the early 80's some of the artwork were softcore porn by the standards of those days! i played the original baldur's gate many years ago, and finally snagged this one just yesterday. i am very early in the playthrough, and despite being several major rule versions behind, i am having little trouble jumping in. i'd suggest if you're not at all familiar with dd or tabletop roleplaying games in general to do a little reading for an hour or so to familiarize yourself with some of the terms and concepts, like armor class, saving throws, and the like. one thing i really like about the turndriven nature of combat is you don't have to be an overcaffeinated even though i still am as an early50s software engineer!, spends 10 hours a day in the basement gamer with the mouse dexterity of a minecraft ninja to play. the focus is very much on tactics. who do you position where, and what weaponspelletc. are they going to employ? who to target first? combat resource management. stealth. cover. it's a nice change from the frantic clickfests of cod and topdown rts games. need to spend 10 minutes on a turn? go ahead! like i said, i am very early in the game, and so far i am very impressed. my system can run at 120fps with everything on max thank you vr and dcs but again, the turndriven nature makes frame rate a little less important which should make the game more accessible to many. the only thing i think this game really needs is ray tracing support. this game would look incredible with rt. its use of hdr is really nice and it looks great on my hdr 1400 monitor  but ray tracing would be the icing on the cake. i hope they can add it. i doubt it's on the radar as that is not what this game is about, but it would be incredible. seriously  it could be a paid enhancement and i'd pay 10 for rt support in this game. anyway, i highly recommend this if you're even remotely interested in the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"the resource mechanics are refreshingly good, something usually one of the worst things in any game. for example i keep running out of thief's tools cause i am running without a thief so my tool consumption is kind of high trying to open stuff. that doesn't make lockpicking tools exciting, but it makes them feel meaningful.  well maybe exciting too when you imagine what might be behind that door or in that chest."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,thank you for your great review! i really appreciate how you give tips and pointers without spoiling anything important about the game! great work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-15,i have never played a game like this. its incredibly overwhelming and the learning curve is steep. yet im loving it. i started the game over 4 times already within the first few hours to get my character right.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"i have no previous experience with crpg's, nor do i know anything about dungeons  dragons. still caved in and bought it, absolutely incredible so far!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i gotta say this is one of the best before you buy videos you've ever done, jake. i can't wait to hear you and the fps crew talk about it together."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"thanks for the review, im so glad you nail every aspect. i found divinity original sin overwhelming as it required so much focus and required you to remember so much which you forgot if you just played casually every few weeks, and then became very frustrating when you came back and had no clue what to do me progress the game. but these games can also be great and immersive if you dig in."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,as someone who played baldurs gate 1 2. this game is amazing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"i have a good and evil save on this game, and i must say they are both very enjoyable. the story is so customizable depending on your actions, its unlike any game ive ever played. i highly recommend slaughtering the grove."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,looking forward to picking this up in a year or so.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,this actually makes me want to go and build a pc just to play it. i've been considering building one but expensive ya know? well this game might push me over the edge and finally go and get the parts!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,"in the older editions, the bladesinger did actually sing as they cast spell and fought. it was a cool little detail that's gotten lost over time!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,is it on xbox?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,im still waiting to hear if theyll be adding any new items. would be a little disappointed if they didnt especially for druid which has a unique armour set for each subclass but stars wouldn't.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-20,"i dont believe that most crashes are fixed, they are way to many. they need to optimize game further"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"not just the 1010 score, but the fact that this review was delayed because the reviewer was so invested in the game and insisted to see the ending shows how monumental this game is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"voice actor for zanner toobin here, its so stupidly awesome to see how much people are loving the game. bg3 fandom are truly the goats!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,props to the reviewer for completing it. i'm still at act 1 lol.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,32 hours in. still creating my character. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,i'm so glad for larian. i've been playing their games for years and always felt they were underrated. they finally get recognition they deserve!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,defends baldurs gate and says it should be industry standard  waits 2 weeks before releasing a review to have time to fully complete the game  gives 1010  refuses to elaborate this is the best ign's been since they started reviewing bravo.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"70 hours in and just started act 3. to say its been worth my time is an understatement. this is like showing up to play dnd and your dm has every battle map, mini, a binder of world lore ready to tie into your own backstory, voices every character perfectly, lets you pickpocket the boss because its fun, and tells you they got nowhere to be so you can play for the next four days."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"take notes. this is not a multiplayer shooter, this is not a gamesasaservice. this does not have microtransactions. it's just a great game. fix yourself, industry, and follow this shining example of what gaming should really be about."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"honestly ign, ive been impressed with your coverage of this game over the past few weeks, keep it up because we need more respectable voices in the industry"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,kudos to ign for waiting over 2 weeks to release a review of the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"masterpiece indeed. can't stop playing it, can't move forward from act 1 so far... larian studios are geniuses!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"as someone who played dragon age origins so many times as a teen, playing this game feels like meeting a long lost friend and it made me so happy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"im 50 years old and started playing on a atari 2600 and this. this right there, is the best game ever done in the history of video games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,a reviewer who put some serious time into a game. props ign
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the time dilation with this game... it's like the opposite of psychedelics. you think 20 min has gone by, then look at the clock, and it has been hours, and it's now 3am, and you have to be up at 6."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,they gave it a 10
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,this game is pure excellence! i'm convinced this masterpiece will be studied by many game developers for years to come.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"what a delightful game. im 45hs in and havent finished act 1 yet savouring each moment, trusting the dice, not spamming quicksaves and living with my decisions. amazing how many choices and how they affect the game. 1010 indeed. to me it is like two of my favourite rpgs, neverwinter nights 2 and divinity 2, had a love child baldurs gate 3 ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,started a second playthrough and its wildly different. 1010 100
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"just like baldurs gate 1 and 2 took the rpg genre to a new lever, baldurs gate 3 does the same. such an amazing game!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,when you leave act2 you will make a camp upon the city border.walk around you can find a place that overlook the citys night view and the background music will change as you get theremost wholesome gaming experience in recent years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,you know a game is well crafted when your camp looks like the area you are in. they literally made so many different camp versions just to match the area you are in so it doesn't break immersion. larian is a bright light in the dark gaming industry
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,no microtransactions for shitty skins and armour. this is a 2023 game with the heart of the golden age of gaming. this is a gem
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,such an incredibly well made game. it very much deserves a 10 and at the very least a 9.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,a genuine masterpiece. so happy to have discovered divinity original sin 2 five years ago  only to see larian studios elevate their craft to such amazing heights.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,man what's a nostalgic thing to see. bg2 was the revolution at its time and now bg3 is again the revolution. no one was brave enough to make bg3 because bg2 was such a legend but you guys at larian studios did and another legend is born. what a masterpiece
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,what is crazy about this game as well is how a new game with new characters and classes will have a very different story. every story arc plays out differently depending on who is in your group. currently on my second playthrough and it's way different than my first.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"just started act 2, 40 hours in. have loved every second. 1010."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the reference to dragon age origins is really accurate, we've finally got a worthy successor to that classic of an rpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"developers nowadays seem to be in despair, cautioning players don't let yourself be spoiled by the quality of baldur's gate 3. in today's gaming landscape, games have to be released with bugs, feature microtransactions, and consistently provide less than what was initially promised, and we have to accept it. this situation reminds me of the release of the witcher 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"it's experience is nearly the same as a table top game of dd with the sheer amount of options to do, and branching storylines, with a few houserules from larian. it is the roleplaying videogame."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,the callout to dao is what sold me. i'll jump in then. cause if that's the company it holds it should be incredible.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,63 hours in. first play through. act 2 first quest. can't wait to wake up and continue my adventure!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"most complete game out of the box since the early 2000s. what a shame how far the game industry has fallen. much praise for larian on showing other companies,l that it can still be done!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"after the first 20 hours, i'm simply stunned. they've managed to take everything that i've loved about dd, and distilled it into a video game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,theres only one score you can give this game really  we dont get games of this quality very often.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,larian studios deserves all of the praise they are getting! the game is a masterpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,i've never played a baldur's gate game before but i'm just happy that this game is really well liked and well crafted.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"starting my second playthrough tonight, this game is a 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,game of the decade. you truly feel like the stars aligned with this game.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,really one of the best reviews to come out of ign in recent memory. thanks for taking the time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"been playing it since prerelease, and me and my friends are still finding moments and outcomes we didn't know were possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,larian deserves all the praise. fingers crossed that the ps5 version will perform well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,2023 should be awarded as the best year of gaming with the amount of 1010 games coming out.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,i've been playing with my buddy and we've been thoroughly enjoying it. great pure fantasy adventure with tactical turn based strategy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"loving it!! brilliant game, but sad that many reviewers arent crediting larians work on the dos games enough. dos2 was extraordinary and influenced so many aspects of bg3! right, now thats off my chest, time to spend another 24 hours in the wilderness lol."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"larian studios not the hero we deserved, but the dungeon master we needed !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,"never played an rpg, never played dd, and yet, im absolutely loving this game. the nightsong sequence alone had a powerful impact on me, and ill never forget it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,its like people forgot about divinity original sin 2. that game had some unbelievable openness in its story and gameplay.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,this is the best game i've played in 10 years at least
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,just loved how the plot kept u guessing for so long.. so cool
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"damn this year is busted. re4 remake, deadspace remake, hifirush, street fighter 6, tears of the kingdom, amnesia the bunker, baldur's gate 3, blasphemous 2, armored core 6, mortal kombat 1, double dragon, spider man 2. man such a crazy variety of games and all are absolutely breathtaking."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,surely game a goty award will fall short of the accolades this game desserves. in awe of this game and the path tjat it takes you on.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,the comparison with dao is what really got me. looking forward to playing bg3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"careful, aaa devs are going to cry again after the review."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"its actually so amazing, my friend is doing his own play through and then doing one with me and hes getting a completely different experience and dialogue. its so interesting and shows your actions really do change the story."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,best game i've played since dragon age origins.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,i'm from south africa and my old high school friend works at larian studios. i'm so proud of him.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,must play for rpg fans!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,they made choice truly matter. i'm constantly surprised how events in one act can lead into casual conversation during a romance cut an act later. it feels so natural
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,the fact that 12 years later new highbudget games are still being compared to skryim shows just how revolutionary that game was
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,not sure how we could ever ask for more from a video game. absolutely insane.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,bro i'm not even into turn based rpg at all but this one is fantastic. legit one of the best games i've played in recent years.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,use hirelings and unused origin characters for free buff in the camp. a hired cleric in camp can cast warding bond to increase ac and take half damage for one of your more sneezy characters in the party. as well as increase max hp with aid
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-17,thank you so so much for mentioning the buttons to choose on a controller!!! all the others seem to do computer only.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-29,what platform is this from?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"if i may, and please no hate, but in my opinion bg3 is a downgrade from dos 1 and 2, and the simple reason is the dice mechanic, i would like to express my confusion for both the devs and player base, the option to save b4 dice rolls is stupid af, or it completely removes the rng aspec from it, and it also makes investing into points absolutly unnecessary, why do i compare to dos, well because even tho u can savescum u are mandatory to implement points into stats for dialoge option, no matter how many times u reset, if u do not have enough number u not pass, and this is a lot more fair imho because save will not help u here my only point is i would like a bit more explenation from players base as to why it is that this is more known then dos but in reality the mechanics are less tought of, again the game is amazing but i feel like this dice roll mechanics is 80  of the dialoge and story, and with saving u can guaranteee an outcome u want, in dos u have to commit points and i think this is a lot more better because it gives u a sense of worth of character, if i want to talk to someone, i use my persuasion or dex or charisma char, here i just use anything save and roll till i win, i must say i do no appreciate this aspect of the game and would like to discuss further, thank you very much for reading i really enjoy both of these games and the community and the mod community that makes them so much imerssive, enjoy and ty"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,this is great. now i need a beginners guide to this beginners guide.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"as a brand new player, my biggest criticism of bg3 is that it is not new player friendly at all. the tips that show up aren't very telling and they don't always last long enough for me to even realize they're there and will disappear before i have a chance to actually read it because i'm so distracted looking at something in the world. i was hoping the game was going to have a great tutorial section that did a better job at holding my hand through the first part of the game. they really just throw you into the game and say figure it out which is normally okay, but i've never played dnd so i don't understand any of the lingo with dice rolls and other stuff that's common amongst that community. i'm still enjoying the game, i just spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out thats super basic and im still like uhhh, i guess ill figure it out later"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"as a new player to the dd system, i retained absolutely nothing that you said in this thoughtful video, and am hoping that the game just kind of helps me figure this all out. but your channel is the best"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-09,think my brain melted watching this from the amount of information
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"as an absolute newby in this genre, after playing for about 34 hours i thought damn lets see if theres a beginner guide which clears things up for me. now after this video i think damn lets finds an absolute newby beginner guide because now im even more confused"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"as a complete beginner to dd and new to baldurs gate, this video was super complicated and i found myself getting lost numerous times. it would be nice to explain exactly where you see things too, when you were talking about ac i had no idea what was going on as the screen shows many letters and numbers with different sections. i wouldn't call this a beginners guide, i'd say it's more like a refresh for players who have already played dd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,you need to be an algebra major to figure this shit out angryjoe
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,being 41 and a gamer for most of it i like to think i am pretty good at figuring games out but this game is just on a whole nother lvl.. i have watched this video 5 times in a row and it is extremely well done all your videos are and im still having trouble wrapping my head around it lol. thanks for everything you do for gamers my dude..your wikis online are a amazing and you are a unit of a resource
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i'm just glad i don't have to do the math, and get to enjoy playing the game. love the guides as usual. thank you all for the hard work and time you've put in for us!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,first complete content packed game i've seen released since elden ring. never played a game like this before but i'm hooked
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,would love a beginners guide for players who know 5e but dont understand crpg. heard many people say positioning before fights is huge but not really heard anyone explain it. along with other helpful things even outside of combat that are helpful that are different from 5e
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"im a pure beginner to bg3dd and was watching a few videos starting to feel confident, but not after going through this video.  on my 5th rewind of the first section i thought i may need to start taking a few notes super informative though and im going to be rewatching to get a hang of the mechanics. thanks for this!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,i jumped right into the game and figured a lot of stuff up for myself. i then now watched the video and it was really nice filling in the gaps of things i didnt quite understand. thanks for this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"as far as rest mechanics go, i always short rest after a combat every time and then long rest when i have used all my shorts. i try to mostly plan to have 3 combats per long rest and generally divide spells and resources accordingly and it feels totally fine!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i understood already that i was going to be new to this kind of game especially with the dungeon and dragons mechanics but the information light out here is honestly overwhelming. im constantly going back and trying to slowly digest each section but i think its going to take more handson experience, before i actually understand the meaning behind some of these explanations. regardless of that, thank you for this video fex. im absolutely new to all of this, i love rpgs and spend most of my time in those kinds of games but the understanding of mechanics and systems at play here in this style is definitely humbling and putting me at newcomer level. not against that, i am a proud newcomer, and i am excited for both the journey and learning that comes with all of this is well . ill definitely be making use of your videos in the journey to come"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,larian studios supporting your content bro? you deserve that man. without you honestly their community wouldn't have been the same.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"i've played hundreds of hours of rpgs, but have never played dd, i bought baldur's gate 3 because of the reviews and the desire to get lost game, i quickly realised i have absolutely no idea what i'm doing, so here i am! thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"for me it started with elden ring, then bloodborne after that it was dark souls 3 then diablo iv and now baldurs gate 3. i dont know how you manage to create all these tutorials and wikis but your channelservice is golden, thanks fextralife!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"im really new to this style of game. have always wanted to play dnd, always thought it seemed really fun but i dont know anyone who plays. it can be overwhelming just jumping in. this vid helped me understand a lot of things."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the full game is way way way much better than the early access. i played 40 hours of ea and when i played the full game its like i didn't play it. its like a totally different game. what a best time to be alive on this world!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,best beginner guide i've watched yet. well done and thank you!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,thank you for actually explaining the basics of the game in your video and not just going on and on that you really do love this game and i should buy it like other beginner videos have.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-20,i love this studio. the fact that they are even sponsoring this video for you made me just say wow!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"this is almost too complex, especially for beginners. dumb it down more please. feel like i need a phd in dd just to understand how it works."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"as a youngin coming from playing dnd with older brothers streaming this  learning the game more has been much easier games always help explain things like this,, great work man!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"this was very helpful to me at 20 hours into act 1. wouldve been greek to me before, but very valuable now. time to go respec literally every character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,thank you. as someone who hasn't played dnd this has been very helpful. especially since my first character is a wizard. i should be resting more often. i have 400 camp supplies and was still being anxious about resting.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,love this man's videos such great guides videos always top teir and totally a great gamer. i'm glad to see good people still on this platform.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-13,"i only came here to understand why i wasnt rolling attack or damage rolls, and that was explained in 30 seconds but i stayed for the whole thing! good stuff. im only about an hour in the game right now and realized i need to start over with a new character because i set mine up way bad"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,okay i just watched all of that and i have no fucking clue what to do still literally an hour in and feel like ive been chucked in the deep end
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i loved dos2 played multiple times, hope i understand all of these mechanics seems a lot to grasp"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,thank you. this video is very useful for those of us who are a bit unfamiliar with the dd system.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"hey dude, just want to say that you always produce great content and it is appreciated"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,damn you have a good voice for this type of work. relaxing asf haha. good content too! helps me as a beginner of the baldus series. since ive played dos 2 i support this game studio. other studios should be held to the same standards!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-02,"i'm an outsider looking in. total dd novice, and from what i gather from this very well done beginner guide is all of the concepts and mechanics from bg3 are relatively straightforward and simple enough ... but the problem for ppl like myself is that the vast number of simple things thrown at us are simply overwhelming. and this is what makes the game seem more challenging that it probably should. so if the game has a great tutorial system than there's hope for me and othe rlike minded gamers that are interested in this game. if not, then i wish all of us the best of luck and hope you enjoy the 2 hour demo"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i just opened youtube about to search for a video exactly like this  thank you so much  i was playing yesterday and it was fun but i was sooo lost
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-05,watching this video is like watching my lecturer talking about quantum physics but my lecturer makes more sense.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"them old school dd players must've been some hard core, dedicated players."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,your dos2 guides have prepared me for this. trying to wrap up a playthrough of dos2 with my group and then we'll dive into bg3!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,thank you very much for the job. one thing about rest  when you play to the maximum difficulty you need 80 food supply. i think in normal difficulty you need 40 ? in hard difficulty you still have to be a bit cautious and save your food supply i guess. personnally i love the idea that i have to manage my resources.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,fantastic stuff here! im going to purchase this evening after work..thank you very much for all your very informative videos!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"great video. thank you. im brand new to dd and bg and have to say although i am absolutely loving it, i am also finding it quite overwhelming at times, so i will be definitely referring back to this video"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"this isn't a video you just watch once. you watch it, play, come back later and watch again when you start to put things together. most of this stuff isnt what you need to know. what i came here to know is how to use dash and all those other moves in combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this game is freaking cool. best rpg ever made. it's crazy how it just pulls you in and hours just melt away.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,ty for this video. i have it on story and keep dying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-15,"tbh it was a little overwhelming at first since im so used to games having tutorials and really holding your hand. however, once i started to notice there wasnt really much information i decided to start reading and researching things in game. this has made it a more of a fun experience because figuring out things is what i love to do! and its made it much more enjoyable for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-10,after attempting to play this without knowing anything  i almost uninstialled  then i realized i'm an idiot so i'm came here to fix that bc this game is incredible
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,5 minutes in and im thinking forza sounds great. fast car go vroom.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i cannot stress enough, have guidance at all times. its literally a free 1d4 to ability whenever you need it. its a cantrip."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,"i have played so many games in my life, often complicated ones but i have never seen such a complicated game. it's frankly ridiculous how many things there are to take into account."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"i played like 3 hours now and have no idea whats going on with all the abilities. feels like i need to study to understand the game mechanics, lol. working my way through it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-29,what i learned by just winging it is positioning in combat is key. there are combats where i was absolutely smacked but when i strategized my positioning i was able to beat them. and beat the enemies by chunks not everything all at once.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"ill be honest, the game mechanic is way more overwhelming than div2 absolutely loved that game. but ive only just gotten off that mindflayer ship so still in the early stages of the game, hopefully ill be able to pick things up quickly"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-08,thank you! you made this game a lot more approachable for a new player like myself!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,thought this game was gonna be a totally different thing now im so mad at myself for getting it instead of other options i had but ima just play it and get the feel for it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,i'm downloading bg3 on my series x as we speak!! im so excited to play it for the first time!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i feel like i could work for nasa after watching this video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is a good guide, thank you. i know this because the first time i listened to it, it sounded like charlie brown's teacher. wah wah wah waaaaaah. the more i listen to it, the more i understand the words coming out of your mouth."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,ill be coming back to this video in a month lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-11,"good thing i have a complete understanding of d20, what saving throw even means, there are so many things going on in this game i was lost after level 3. i have no idea what spells are good to pick, what in the world is going on in combat..which tbh takes painstakingly long..just feels like i got thrown into advanved chemistry when i know nothing about it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,that is a fantastic video and very helpful. thank you very much for the information.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,i kept replaying the first 5 min to understand. but thankfully now i understand how it works. thank for the great video.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-13,this is more complicated than a college course wtf lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"not gonna lie ive spent the last 2 days and over 20 hours just winging it and i love this game, figured that nows a good time to look at a beginners guide"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,is there may be a beginner's guide for the beginner's guide... ?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-01,"my main takeaway from watching this video you are very smart, and i am very dumb. thanks for putting this video together. dd is something ive never played, but ive always found it interesting. bg3 seems like a great way to play dd. you can play solo, dont have to remember all the steps or do math."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i'm really bummed i have to wait a whole month to play this game  it'll be worth the wait tho
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-12,"a masterclass in dd5e. having played dd before this is nothing new to me, but i would say that it would be difficult to follow if you had never played traditional dd before. i had assumed that this video would be more on the gameplay of the game and some tips for building characters. im halfway through it and its mostly on the backend mechanics, which are really important but not what i was expecting. still it really is a masterclass that can be used not only for bg3 but for dd as a whole. great job!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"this is probably just me being pedantic, but i think you forgot intimidation under charisma in the 'what is skills' section around 841"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i would be lost without fextralife. thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,thanks for putting this together. i just bought the game and i'm a complete rookie so this guide is super useful.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,"thank you so much for doing this, even going so far as to explain the difference between the 2 options to run the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,amazing and informative content as always.. your channel is an enrichment to the gaming community!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-05,this is by far the best beginner guide out there! great video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"really wished they would have kept the dos2 de combat style, in terms of spell casting anyway."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-16,great guide as always. reading through the comments made me feel better about not understanding jack shit in the game. im just gonna wing it and see how it goes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i wish it was out on ps5 already
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,i've really been looking forward to this game but man am i having a hard time with the mechanics and learning how to play and what everything does it's a bit overwhelming so thanks your videos help alot
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"informative video, thanks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-14,"this is great man, thank you. best beginners guide ive checked out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"great vid, ready to play when it comes out on console ps5, this was really helpful for not ever playing this type of setup , thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-09,"this is a lot, but the detail really helps explain what is going on to a nondd player. thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i would love a video about multiclass because it is very complex to me as a new player.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-15,"thanks you for this guide, even explaining the abilities differences from attributes was so helpful"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"final fantasy, elder scrolls, elden ring, no matter what rpg you've played, dungeons and dragons is the grandfather of them all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,this is so complicated but thank you so much. it will take me a few month to remember 5 percent
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,im gonna recommend this video to my new ttrpg dnd players too lol. great video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-20,very nice builds!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,wish i could grasp this info i really want to play the game but feel as though i would do everything wrong
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i know zilch about dd, i preordered this purely based on divinity os2 so this video has been very helpful!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i know this likely won't happen but i hope larian doesn't just move on after bsg3, i would like an expansion or two followed by bsg4."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i was indeed hoarding supplies and avoiding resting haha thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i died 6 times in the prologue and after 4 hours of playing i cleared the prologue and saved the game and quit to get some sleep, i will try again tomorrow but one thing i learnt is watching tips and guides is useless without playing i put 20 hr into youtube content to prepare myself for the game once the game started i didnt know what was an action vs what was a bonus action, and until now i dont know if i consumed my action so i always try an action and if fails i try bonus action and often i just end my turn because i dont know what to do"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-19,there are lots of assumptions about the player base. i've never played a bg game and never played dd either... needed this video!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,this is the second time i've tried watching this guide and i remember why i stopped the video two minutes in last time. as soon as you started talking about abilities and the maths behind them i just lost all interest and noped the hell out. you make it sound far too complicated. maybe slow that section down a bit.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-18,god bless larian for adding autodetect on supplies. that streamlines everything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"im a complete newbie to dnd and i feel very overwhelmed by not understanding much. outside of knowing how d20 being high  good, its like nothing is sticking. i need a complete idiots guide."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-01,"i took the plunge with this game and i'm learning as i'm going along. i'm familiar with the slangs used since i enjoy reading the dd gaming books which i own a few. but i felt this game just threw me into the lion's den. heck, it took me a while to figure out how to exit my own campsite."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-12,"as much i love this game, it is way too complicated for me. i would rather just go workout at the gym and become better at being a person."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-25,"that fight with rai vs xiv, klip and tal... ...is the best way to have a character bow out of a campaign due to a player being unable to make it to sessions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,i couldn't stop roleplaying for 3 weeks straight and now my mind is no longer my own i share it with klip
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,rai going a good book can change you right before descending into madness over a cursed grimoire is the most absurd way of foreshadowing the most absurd incident in the story.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-16,"my favorite line from all of this after preventing the greatest evil in the land, premarital sex, we committed genocide on the rest of the goblins and went to sleep."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,the detail in xiv's backstory with 13 batteries and another empty one making it 14 in total followed by how xiv is literally the roman numeral for 14 is so cool
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,i can't believe it took klip abandoning the one belief he held dearly and becoming a goddamn mindflayer to finally be able to play the flute.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,you left the hammer back at home?! i... i love this. the only correct way for this adventure to go.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-17,xiv's suspicion of false walls makes so much sense now...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"dude, that fight scene between the team was so insane, huge props to the animators and artists"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"wow, this episode of just roll with it is really highquality, charlie and the gang really went allout with this one"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"i fucking loved this, especially how tal forgot the hammer at home and still managed to deal the last hit in the hypest way possible. this was so cool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-16,the hardest boss of all... scheduling conflicts that's a true dnd experience right there.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"what a wild video. xiv's backstory was incredible, i loved tal's personality, and klip being the one who kinda had morals was what tied it all together. rip rai"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"a slimecicle video, about baldur's gate 3, that's several hours long? i can already tell this is gonna be a banger."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,revealing youve been accidentally romancing wyll the whole game is so fucking funny i am so here for this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-29,the moment when everyone discovers that they don't have the orphic hammer on them i love you can hear them slip out of character for a second while they process what's happened
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-24,"genuinely, that entire fight sequence with rai was terrific, from the bonechilling is that what you wanted to hear? to tal's heartbroken what could we have done to save you? honestly, just art"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,tal going 'double dog' without even daring you first is the perfect kind of characterization i need
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"the wait, wheres rai? and it jsut cuts to the astarion scene holy crap i was caught so off guard top tier humor"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-06,i love that charlie was romancing wyll the entire time just genuinely enjoying his character
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,why is everyone so mean to the funny cool worm in your brain
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-24,bummer rai couldn't stay for the whole thing but what a way to handle him succumbing to the schedule boss.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,and i thought vampires were supposed to ask before coming insi i'm dead
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-11,my fav part is klip's wife getting mentioned once at the beginning and then never being talked about again. where did she go? what happend to her? what did klip do to her?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,damn was not expecting xiv's origin to be so wellthoughtout lmao props to you guys for creating legit backstories for your bg3 characters
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,"i find it even funnier that the gnome that tal threw into the lava was barcus wroot, the very one that they launched off the windmill"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-31,is that what you wanted to hear? my jaw droppedddd that animation was insane and the lines went so hard
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-23,2749 the implications of the song played for the duration of this fight are incredible
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-11,klip being firmly against the parasites the whole time just to romance the emperor and turn into a squid at the end is cinematic genius tbh
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-04,damn i guess xiv wasn't lying when he said he felt no temptation towards dark magic. he finds a dark artifact and immediately gives it to rai
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,i think vampires were supposed to ask before they come inside had me cackling loooooooool
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-10,3244 this is essentially how i explain a typical dnd session goes to friends
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,whoever did the animation did a pretty kickass job
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,tal forgetting the fucking hammer completely broke me holy shit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-02,"l  ratio  not booal followed by attacking shar's statue and the dark justiciars popping out is by far one of my favorite bits in this video, it's just so stupidly silly and the wheezelaugh takes me out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"so fun dnd lore fact ceremorphosis just... doesn't really work on gnomes. like, they can become illithids, but their personality is kept intact and they're not absorbed within the hive mind. so yes, klip just... continuing to to adventure as a mind flayer can be 100 canon."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-07,the foreshadowing of rai holding the necromancy of thay while saying i believe it only takes one book to change your life... is insane theres so much detail.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,xiv and wyll as an accidental couple is hilariously sweet given they both have a complex relationship witth their respective fathers
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,i will never stop laughing about kilp's dream visitor being himself without a beard and just a mustache. so simple but so funny to me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-13,"i genuinely think this is my favorite video on youtube. i can watch it over and over, even multiple times in a day. i love the characters and the humor and the heart... it's just perfect."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"loved xivs backstory, rais death and overall everyones characters, huge props to all the artists and editors making this video!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"i am so sorry for your soul, charlie."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"your ability to weave long narratives out of disparate, chaotic footage is genuinely incredible. you've essentially created a featurelength movie out of your wacky playthrough of bg3 with your friends complete with backstories and animation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-08,"xiv, do xiv things? xiv i summoned another mudthew. tal you need help."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,5405 that's your god. i'm my own god. we all dream to have that level of self assuredness
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,rewatching this idk why but i feel a strong appreciation for xiv being on par with rai in the fight animation as a character that was literally raised since birth to be a powerful magic user but them having wild magic being the one reason they couldn't defeat rai that fight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,love how every single major story boss they fought was killed the most stupidest ways possible
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,"that epilogue had me in tears, man. great story. i think my favorite line was you're the farm now, tal."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"xiv's backstory and name have me on the floor sobbing. leave it to charlie to make the funniest pc who feels like there's a joke somewhere in their characterization, and give them that 11130"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"11136 didn't expect the coolest looking backstory yet to be backed by a track from the greatest horror game of all time... i'm fucking sold, this shit slaps."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-13,10150 just seeing a frightened and confused cat watch a dog glow in radiating light as it ascends an turns into a demigod is the funniest shit i have ever seen. genuinely was cackling at this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-06,"what an absolutely mind blowing video, good lord this was so much fun to watch start to finish holy crap the amount of hours and love you guys put into this, absolutely brilliant!!! superb!! my brain worm approves of this video 1010 superb"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,the whole intimidated the goblins into running away bit reminds me of when i got a nat 20 on an intimidation check so my absolutely insane friend who was dming just kinda said you kill them
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-15,oh! it took a couple rewatchings but rai says killing me off!!.... f r i e n d s after going off to the barn alone. some baller foreshadowing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"the fact that we all watched this for free feels wrong. this is so incredibly funny, well written and packed with actual strats i can use in the future. im also really sad klip's origin story may very well be the last we see of jocat's content. beautiful sendoff and a hallmark of the year"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-13,"glad to know im not the only one who didnt know you could not kill min. literally didnt even get a chance to talk to the woman. snuck into a room, not knowing she was there, and initiated combat against my will."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-23,the last image??? with rai as a ghost in the clouds??? everyone's happy????? i feel like i have watched the most beautiful piece of media ever ... i almost shed a tear
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-18,"i have to learn more, but i dont know if im strong enough. rai, youre one of the strongest people i know. you you shot me once with a lightning bolt and i fell to the ground dead. not many people can do that. that was simultaneously really funny and also kind of sweet lmaoo"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,xivs backstory oh my god. but around 15611 i realised yeah. the editors are not paid enough. doesnt matter how much theyre paid. theyre still not paid enough.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-09,it never occurred to me that you could play bg in character with other people and suddenly i really want to do this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"between the editors, animators and artists, you guys did an incredible job of the post production of this video. brilliant work folks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,... the detail of xiv's name being the roman numeral for 14 is so damn creepy but so good...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"i was fucking glued to my monitor from start to finish, this is insane tier editing and even storytelling. xiv's backstory and big reveal that its actually xiv as 14 blew my mind the fuck out. rai going insane and then fighting the rest of the party to the death feels like it came straight out of some movie i guess he couldnt play any longer for whatever reason and decided to go out with a bang? because if it was just pure roleplaying mad props for that.. this is genuinely an art, i am not exaggerating."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-16,"for some reason, xiv's backstory is the best in my opinion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"massive shoutout to the artists jocat, juicce124, cryingwyvern, complexlyross, holographicros3, floatingmegane, red, and menchoytan truly beautiful work"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,if i had a nickel for every time grizzly and bizly had an emotional final battle resulting in one having to kill the other in an attempt to save them. i'd have 2 nickels. which isn't a lot but weird that it happened twice.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"ah man, i love seeing someones descent into madness, and charlie frequently fulfills that need"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-16,and i though vampires were suppost to ask before coming inside made me laugh so much
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,that animated scene 27 minutes in was one of the best things ive ever seen
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,1300 the sorcerers guide to jelking had me fucking dying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"this might not be the good ending playthrough i was looking for, but this sure as fuck is the best playthrough i found for baldur's gate!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"as someone that loves everything about bg3, cried at the end of my first playthrough, and have played it many times since then, this is the best bg3 playthrough i have ever seen. i love this video lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-14,how did everyone in this video collectively forget that klip is married
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,petition for charlie to upload the entire 200 hour video on the vods channel
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"the fact that klip was the one to reject the worms, just to end up having to accept the one at the end is poetic as hell"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-12,"literally probably my favorite video on youtube. ive seen it like, 19 times now lol and it never gets old, im always endlessly entertained. the art, the animation, the music, the editing, the quotes, the characters, the gameplay, the story... it's just all so incredible. ty for such a masterpiece of a video and for giving me such a good comfort youtube video to always come back to!! 3 i seriously quote this video all the time in and outside of playing bg3 lol. i love xiv, klip and rai so very much but tal really won over my heart!! my best friend says i imprinted on him lmfao i just think he's the greatest ever 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,the fight against rai is genuinely fucking phenomenal i felt chills go down my spine
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,bizly was only there for 30 minutes and he still somehow made a character for me to go insane over again
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"why is slimecicle just so... glorious? every video he makes is somehow unique, regardless of what he does, even if he repeats something, its somehow... different? it doesnt even make sense! but somehow he does it? this man is godlike"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-20,"615 don't worry, i can take it! famous last words"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-13,bro the is that what you wanted me to say? during rais villain arc gave me legit chills
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-31,"rai is my new blorbo now, i love him so much. i absolutely love how you took the multiplayer experience, which is normally very much a play for a few hours and do funny shit thing, and made it a dnd campaign of your own. the sheer dedication to characters and roleplaying makes me incredibly happy and proud of y'all! also rip klip's wife, her husband fucked a squid then became one"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"xiv don't worry guys! we've got the hammer, we can free the prince and not get turned into a psychic squid! 2 hours ago tal slams orphic hammer down onto pawnshop table, how much crack can i get for this?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-14,i love the random polish song lyrics in the book animation  appreciated! 2700
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"i'm sorry?!?!?!!??? who said that it was okay to give us the greatest anime battle and heartbreak in first quarter?!?? that animation was so epic holy shit, give the animator a raise, an award, tell mr beats that they deserve a private island, idk anything, they deserve it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"i'm genuinely surprised i'm not seeing anyone compliment that last picture of the group at the end that even had rai up in the clouds, this was all amazing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,"the amount of nat 20s being rolled at the perfect times is just perfect. like what do you mean xiv rolled 2 nat 20s to almost avoid the fight all together. or like how tal just rolled a nat 20 to beat the boss? all the moments in this video is just gold man, props to everyone who worked on it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-29,2804 holy shit that animation was sick
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-18,chalie screaming wizaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard toooooweeeeerr is forever imprinted on my mind
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"3014 is probably my favorite scene of this whole video. bizly is haunting in that moment. just, a million chef's kisses."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,so thats what hes been doing all this time. that explains everything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-24,i would love to see you guys do the evil playthrough. just having you guys play polar opposite characters that you've already played in doing an evil playthrough
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,"i think tal and grog would be best damn friends. 20726 seriously, tals from the top row! is almost as iconic and hilarious as grogs i would like to rage!."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,"i love how no matter what, charlie can always make characters that i immediately adore. like the second xiv was introduced i was like, oh? a baby? my blorbo? youre mine now. mf just goes, it is i xiv! i have daddy issues, im a silly little guy and my magic is weird and i was enraptured."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"it hunts smart creatures don't worry, with these 4 together they create an aura of stupidity for a 5 mile radius"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,wait...where's rai cutting to rai topping astarion in the woods is comedic gold
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"forever gonna be devastated over the loss of rai, i got attached so fast rip literally the best video ever made can confirm i will be rewatching until the day i die"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-17,"3100 that's badass, this anime is somehow one of the best story telling, a character building, down to the death and detail. best anime i've seen"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,lovin the fact that rai's evil book at 2724 is just lyrics to the polish song chryzantemy zociste written in very agressive cursive
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,2631  spat my water all over the table oh my gosh lmao condi never change
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,yaaaaaay!! jackie!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,can't believe we live in a time where a company releases a complete video game and everyone loses their freaking minds
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,man i can't believe larian put a search bar in the inventory. didn't know such advanced technology was even possible!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,you know a game is good when alex is smiling the whole time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"i must admit, i can't help by be a tad proud of my fellow countrymen. a belgian game developer not only making a good game but making a great game that is appreciated across the world. a game that is made for the gamer not for the stockholders. something that all those big american, british or french game studios haven't been able to do for over a decade."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,you got to admire joe's dedication. a decade since skit based reviews died on youtube but he keeps staying the course...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,finally a company that is bringing back the passion that blizzard once had.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,you must gather your party before venturing forth
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,"you know a game is good when youre running on 3 hours of sleep and already planning out your third play through halfway into the second one. its been ages since i was immersed at this level. i thought i was getting older and losing interest but it turns out,i still love videogames just like i did at 14. games were simply better back then and this one shines like the old ones did"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,i'm sure it's already been said but the fact that alex is portraying a dwarf is fucking classic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"i think the thing that actually sold me was in the spider pit of act 1, there is a hole just in the middle of the room you can jump into, i thought, hey the game won't let me do this, and i jumped down the hole and went splat in a cutscene... i then tried again with feather fall thinking it's just going to instantly kill me again, but no, i survived and went right into the underdark... and died as two minotaur's came over to wreck my level 2 party."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,bg3 is the first game in a very long time where i'm actually happy i bought it at full price. larian deserves every last penny for the work they've done.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,i am literally going to pray for larian to not fall to greed like all our other heroes did
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"just finished it myself today, 125 hours. what an experience. definitely best i've played since dragon age origins"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,if the player base is demanding a dlc you know you've made a 1010 game edit 9122023 game of the year lets go!!! edit 2 sadly larian said there will be no dlc ever.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,give alex an oscar for his performance as the meta player please !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,we need more games like baldurs gate 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,it's so great to see joe actually enjoying reviewing a game again. he deserves the break.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,i've never seen alex more animated or enthusiastic than when he's explaining dd mechanics to the others.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,this is a 1010 solo. can't wait to play with friends on another play through
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"its nice to see alex super into and passionate about a game, and everyone having fun because the game is actually fun, not just cause the group is having dumb fun because how bad the game is and how insanley buggy something is"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,all i can say is larian studios deserve our recognition and support. they are true devs in our eyes who share the love and passion for gaming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"as someone who usually hates turn based games, baldur's gate 3 is some of the most fun i've had in a game. larian for the win!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,i just finished 600 hours of bg3 3 runs with three different main characters. there are bugs in chapter 3 they need to fix but still the best game of the year and possibly the decade. the bar has been set very high by larian and i can't wait for the neverwinter dlc.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"i am 42 years old and i never thought a game would make me happy ever again. i finished it in 143 hours, and only discovered 53 of the content. i plan to play it again with the dark urge. it is quite frankly the best game of the last 10 years imo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,you know it's a very good game when oj didn't hesitate to bear it all.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,its refreshing as fuck to see the whole crew actually enjoying something for once.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-31,"i'm sitting at over 800 hours played and not only do i not feel the need to play something else, but i'm still discovering new things. incredible game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"the amount of energy this video radiates is so brilliant, the game's good times probably made this one feel effortless and fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"just started playing it yesterday and for a guy who neither likes nor plays such games crpgs, i simply love it! what a fool i have been! the best thing about this game is the love and passion that went into making it a true, procomsumer piece of art."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,this was the goddamn best review i've seen of your channel joe. i haven't stopped laughing throughout out the entire video! thank you! seriously skip doing the madden review! you deserve a break for this one!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-15,"whats crazy to me is how much fun this game is for any player who is even slightly creative, but some of the stuff is absolutely insane. if owlbear from the top rope has been discovered in the first couple months who knows whatll be discovered a year from now once people break the game apart"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"for those of you on the edge, its a great game, even if youre not into this type of game. give it a shot. the hype is real."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-02,a year later and the game is still going strong and they are planning to give us even more free content. 1000 hours in and i just cant put this game down. my standards have been raised significantly for what i spend my money on in the future.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"seeing joe in the first few minutes just talking praise of a game and him explaining it in pure delight is pure magic. more power to games of this incredible caliber and thanks a ton for joe on the review, of course."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,i honestly really enjoyed playing solo. the companions are so interesting with each having their own stories
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-15,"my favorite thing about bg3 is that after creating this amazing game, they added fucking split screen, so your friends dont have to buy the game for you to play with them. it makes it so easy to talk others into trying it and getting it idk why more companies dont do it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"it was nice to see joe, oj and alex having fun for a change!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,holy shit that did not feel like 51 minutes. this was one hell of a review joe! had my full attention the entire time and got me laughing throughout the video.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"the amount of creativity the game lets you have is insane. pushing people off ledges, throwing environmental objects, freezing water on the ground randomly or lighting oil on fire, stacking crates to get to knew areas, etc etc etc theres just so much going on thats outside of whats the forward hand hold mechanics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-12,they have a 10 option to buy the deluxe version of the game. and honestly i bought it just so i could give them another 10. this game was absolutely amazing and im not even finished with it yet.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"what an amazing review, thank you so much for the laughs!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,i feel like this is one of the few times where aj and every other reviewer dropped a game review so late and so close to eachother due to how massive the game is
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"honestly, this game is the first in a long time where i'm actually constantly excited to keep playing. like when i'm at work, i'll get excited to start playing again in the evening. and when i do start playing, it's hard to stop playing. don't get me wrong, there are plenty of good games, but this one is special to me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,larian's panel from hell developer updates are the gold standard for how to communicate with your community about changes in ea.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"to help anyone on the fence about playing dark urge. you dont have to make him a villain, he can be a hero. its pretty much just opting in to even more story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"angry joe is really one of the few credible reviewers left, i appreciate giving it a score for solo and with friends."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,they really had aj making out with alex in a bear costume. i'm... so shook right now. this might be the best review of the channel
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"this game deserves game of the year, it's been such a labor of love. i did get the early access, and it was fun to keep tabs on the development. i didn't ever complete act 1, because i didn't want too many spoilers, and i knew they'd make a great product. also getting a free upgrade to the digital deluxe was a nice surprise on a side note, the dark urge feels like such the main character of this campaign, my first playthrough was a good dark urge and there were so many 'oh my god...' moments. i can't wait to replay as the other origin characters as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,the level 12 cap makes sense. it's the same reason why most 5e adventure paths end at 1314. because tier 4 play is drastically different. you're basically demigods at those upper levels flinging some powerful abilities and spells. it feels like an entirely different experience than lower level play. which is basically what larian said as well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,i'm still in act 1 on a multiplayer play through and my personal play through. each has been vastly different in all aspects. i can see myself playing this a few dozen times.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"baldur's gate 3 is the most fun i had in multiplayer with friends since divinity, which happens to also have been made by larian studios. they're on a roll."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-02,"my top songs 1 raphael's final act was so hyped for this epic battle, epic moment, and the song fit perfectly, and the fact that the actor for raphael sang the song himself, chef's kiss! 2 harpy song i legitimately didnt want to kill the harpies because i was literally mesmerized by the harpy song! i understand why, but it's a kinda shame it only plays in one part of the game 3 bard dance! 4 the power orchestral version"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,baldurs gate 3 feels like a game made by people who actually care about good gaming. could not tell you how much laughter i got from actually pulling off an owlbear from the top rope.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,this is the first game i've considered buying multiple times just to support the studio and developers
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,great production value put into this!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,you know joes feelings right away if hes smiling that wide at the start. yup i love this game and the way it lets you just do whatever you want within reason
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,this game is actually insanely good! i found myself immersed for hours without noticing its surprised me and i wouldnt be shocked if this game get nominated for awards.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,oj never disappoints to make us laugh. great review joe.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"i have been following larian for years, ever since dos 1. they are, in my opinion, the best rpg studio in the world right now. their passion for gaming is admirable. absolutely love them. if they keep this up, i'll be their lifelong fan and supporter."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-05,"just before the epic final showdown, i gathered with all the allies i had collected from this incredible adventure. i gave them a rousing speech to inspire them for one final fight! they all pledged their lives to help their champion defend baldur's gate. unfortunately, i accidently stole a silver tray, my allies really did not like that, turned hostile, killed me, so i was unable to save the city and everyone died. seriously though, amazing game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"he didnt mention it but this game has 4 player couch coop on console and its amazing and perfectly integrated, not enough games care about couch coop anymore"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,i have about 200 hours into this game. 100 in prerelease and just hit over 100 in full game. i can say that this is one of the best games i've played in a long time. definitely feels like one of those games that defines a decade. i think we'll start to see some more like this coming out taking inspiration hopefully. i'm pumped for starfield but taking their release date might have backfired. they better nail their release.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,they should really just allow every party member to have a companion where you can take one of the story party members around with you but they effectively disappear during combat if you're playing in coop or have a full party etc. i think it'd be cool and it would solve the quest issues.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"i've never played a game like balder's gate, literally and metaphorically. i've never touched rpgs until this game, the closest thing i have is ck3 coming from a first personopen world background mainly. i have played many a game whether its just to try for fun or something i really sink my teeth into, but this game makes all minus a select few pale in comparison. i have never played a game so rich and detailed and with such a tremendous amount of depth. i thought the passion for great games died awhile ago and everything, even most passion projects sell out and become cash cows with ingame purchases. its good to finally see a real passion project done right, and justly so."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,its been a long time since ive played dnd but baldurs gate 3 looks like a blast and ive been thinking about trying it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,thanks for convincing me angryjoe team. i usually wait for your honest reviews on big releases. downloading the bg3 now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,the skits in this were as fantastic as the game a everyone
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"after putting in a good amount of hours, i have to say this review is 100 on point. i totally suck at turned based games but after a while of trial and error i can enjoy it at a oj level of the casual player lol. been running a separate campaign with two other friends and it makes the game even better."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"it's the little things that get me, like the fact you can engage an npc in dialogue then have a stealthy character sneak up behind them and attackpickpocket them. it just lets you do so much that other games wouldn't or would bug out if you somehow managed to try. i love talking to animals too, but... beware the swamp frog."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,i got the game four days ago... i am already 26 hours in. this game is gonna roll a 20 against my social life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,they did a beautiful job of making the previous games not required but solid value adds to the lore of the world in this third installment.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-12,"the best part is how the studio kept listening to criticisms, reports about bugs, and has continuously improved the game since it launched. they just dropped a bigass major patch 5 which added lots of stuff and fixes, so it's even better to play as time goes on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,this game and elden ring are legendary. bg3 is probably the best game ive ever played. its so immersive. hated turn base combat but i love it in this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"just leaving a comment to say you are the man, joe. i've been watching you for probably more than a decade now, since i was a little kid. it makes me so happy to see you still making these reviews with exactly the same style, the same enthusiasm, the very same leather jacket and tshirt. keep doing what you do. to me, you're one of the greats."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"other joe, you're the hero this show deserves, your segments and skits are always the best!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"just got the game in early december, yeah its been out for a year, but just didn't have the money till now. purposely stayed away from content about it as much as possible, and i'm glad i did. this is my new skyrim, and witcher 3. thousands of hours will be put into this game. for sure."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,played bg2 over 20 years ago and it blew me away when i was a kid coming from the great jrpgs of the snes era. since then my tastes in gaming have changed drastically so i was skeptical about whether or not i would still enjoy a crpg in 2023. i can safely say the game and its world hooked me yet again and it is a masterpiece.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"can i just say, it's amazing seeing angry joe not angry at all with the biggest smile on his face. with such a great game reflecting it's experience on joe's face before the review even starts... idk man. this is just special and i'm here for it. c"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,i been watching your channel for years and i just thought i'd throw a little tip in to show support for this awesome channel and awesome review you guys are awesome!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-07,"the customization thing was added in patch 3, so yeah, larian, in addition to being superstar devs, actually listen to the audience with their patches and hotfixes"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,how does it make any money?! because its a good fucking game! well said!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,it looks like you guys had almost as much fun making this review as you did playing baldur's gate. the other joe stuff was hilarious!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,i really like you people and your sense of humor. thanks!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,"joe's review of bg3 made me buy the game, i am coming back to this review to blame joe for making me lose 350 hours of my life and i am about to lose 300 hours more."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"bro i've been watching you since i was 1213, i'm 26 now. so happy to see that you're still going strong  you were a massive part of my childhood."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"when joe starts the video with a smiling face, you know that your game is good, such a masterpiece of a game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,oh my goodness an almost hour long angry review?! you bless us
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-19,"i remember when they first announced this game, because baldur's gate 2 is my favorite game of all time, i was a little bit worried. it felt almost exploitative that larian was calling this game baldur's gate even though it had divinity combat and the story was seemingly disconnected from the other two games. i finally beat the game about a week ago and i've started a coop playthrough with my friends. baldur's gate 3 did the impossible, it's surpassed baldur's gate 2 in my mind. don't get me wrong, both games are still absolutely fantastic but you can see the progression of crpgs over the years when you compare bg2 and bg3. you can see how they integrated mechanics from games like disco elysium and divinity original sin 2 into the formula that was defined by the original baldur's gate games. bg 3 is a milestone in gaming and it will likely not be surpassed for a long time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"besides act 3, which has minor bugs, this game is perfect. it's a reminder of what we should expect our games to be on release, complete and functional. congratulations to everyone who worked on this game, it is exceptional."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"a quality, and hilarious, review for a quality driven and delivered game. the game industry should be shook."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"angry joe expects us to make finished games, that's rock star level scope"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-08,"here after goty. congrats larian, we love your hard work and dedication"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"way back in the day a few years ago, i bought what i thought was access to the beta of baldur's gate 3 back when the open beta first came out, when the game was just the watered down prologue. come 2023 i had mostly forgotten the game existed, then heard about how the game was amazing. went to check the price, make sure it was 'full price' to start saving up, and found a download link instead where i have seen many studios turn their betas into seperate products, larian gave me the entire game years later for no additional charge. honestly surprised me a sad state of affairs, true, but a nice surprise still, best 20 i have spent in a long time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"the exact moment i felt this game was magical was when i was in a particular companion quest turning point, it's either i convince them or their story heads in a disaster with a difficulty class of 20, no inspiration left, then i freaking roll a nat 20,and i didn't even have any bonuses, all i was guidance, i almost freaking screamed in the middle of the night. i will remember this game forever"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,this is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. i hope other game developers and publishers take note so we can have more amazing games in the future instead of the trash most aaa companies have been making.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-08,"what's amazing is larian addressed all of joe's criticisms over time, some of this is with mods which larian included in the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,great review joe! i'd say single player is even a 1010. getting all of the stories from your companions make it extremely satisfying in the end.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"this game has been one of the best coop multiplayer experiences i have played in an extremely long time. and on top of that, it even has splitscreen so you can play with your reallife friends too! incredible!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"remember guys, playing alone or with friends has their own positive and negative such as didn't experience the character development for the npc etc"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-03,"5 months late but, u have to give alex his due. sitting there, in a furry costume, getting onesided, tongue kissed, by joe... that's, dedication! well done, sir!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"the smart move for larian right now is to never touch dd again and work on original ips, leveraging their prestige from bg3 to just do whatever they want. don't get trapped like telltale into propping up other people's ip, become like preea bioware, taking the fame from making knights of the old republic and using that to create dragon age and mass effect"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-06,spoiler theres about 8 seconds of discussion about the cancelled dlc.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"larian has launched a complete game, it does not require any dlc's. the fact that they keep updating the game and adding new stuff for free is a testement to their virtuosity. they have delivered us a lot more than most companies, and baldur's gate 3 is a generational game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,why do they need to do any more? the game already has more content than 99 of games and is considered by most to be the gold standard of crpgs. games don't need to keep getting updates forever.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,wizard of the coast. thats why
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"larian had promised not to make any dlc and just deliver a full complete game back when it launched. if only more studios followed this formula, maybe the video game industry wouldn't be in the sad state it's currently in as there's only so much greedy corporate blood sucking ppl will tolerate before enough is enough.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"they have achieved 10x more than any recently released games in terms of content, quality and gameplay. the game is one of the most feature complete games around, no need to add more content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,bg3 patch 7 has now added official modding support...those disappointed about not getting an official dlc expansion need not worry...the modding community always comes through for us.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,damn.. these guys are top tier. drop the best game of the decade then peace out because they realized their hearts aren't in it anymore instead of just powering through and putting out a turd to rake in some cash. respect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,i'd only want a dlc to finally help karlach get that engine out of her chest
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,its all because of hasbro. they've been milking dnd like crazy for all it has
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,baton pass to the community with in game mod manager and leaving like a legend . waiting for dos3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,im still playing itno goodbyes from me yet.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-01,"the cold and hard truth is that wizards if the coast has been leeching dd from its well established fanbase, if it weren't for some really talented developers and teams like larian or critical role, we would only be looking at crap like dd dark alliance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"fact none of the people swen worked with during bg3 production are now working at wotcs, all them got fired."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"the old adage comes in. sometimes, it's best to end it on a high. well done larian! i've played over 350 hours yeah, not as much as most but its one of the greatest game experiences ever. its made a disillusioned gamer like me have fun again!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,pretty sure it's due to wotc wanting a bigger cut and control. it's been infered quite a few times
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,let's be honest if it wasn't for wotc being numb skulls i'm sure larian would of loved to make an expac or more constant updates but it's clear they want to focus on their own ips now and make even better games in diff worlds.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,of course larian studios isn't going to work on the sequel for right now and who would blame them baldur's gate 4 for the next game in the series could be announced in around 10 years this game now has modded support baldur's gate 3 technically last a lifetime
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,anyone else remember all the developers that attacked bg3 out of jealousy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-05,"wizards booted all of the people larian worked on bg3 with, and that soured the mood is what i've gathered."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"larian studio has done a phenomenal job, this is how games are supposed to be. come out finished, and move on. it wasnt too long ago in which this was the norm."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,it would be amazing for them to do their own thing for couple of years and to come back later to do baldur gate 4
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,"and this is why, when they were working on the game, it took them 6 years to get to this point. 6 years of their commitment to the game and they earned the best overall achievements for all the categories they got."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,larian is proof all is not lost for the games industry.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"best game of the last 10 years. dont comment saying crap about how you dont agree or think im stupid for saying it, because youre wrong. the game is a stunning achievement and deserves every award it got. edit to the trolls who insist on commenting here anyway. ask yourself why are you commenting on a games video that you supposedly dont like? haha living rent free in your heads. you trolls are getting more and more pathetic again, why are you commenting on vidoes about a game you say you hate??"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,congratulations again to larian and everyone involved. that game changed my life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-18,i can't be the only one whose fondest desire is a larian made oldschool fallout game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,"i've just started a new dark urge playthrough and after several hundred hours in this game, there's still new cutscenes and wildly different scenarios playing out. they don't need to do anything extra. thank you larian for many years of top crpgs and many more to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-05,looking forward to seeing what these guys make next!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"bg3 was my first real rpg, my first dd, and now i'm on my third playthrough. incredible game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-10,"larian has earned life long fans, im sure whatever next project they do will sell massively."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-01,and all this led me to a little ship called the lady vengeance and my new love of malady.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"larian! best company on the market! sven the best director! larian staff the best staff! sound and loyal staff policy! sound and non greedy prices for their products and no greedy microtransactions, lootboxes or similiar! great games in the forefront of the industry! keep the good work up larian! you are a great example to the rest of the greedy and shady gamin industry! looking forward to your next two games larian and sven with high anticipations!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-25,bg3 really feels like what happens when everyone on a project absolutely adores what they're working on.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-10,larian being both gracious and funloving is such a good quote. sven please keep doing whatever you do.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,if they released a modding kit that would allow people to make their own campaigns that would probably be more than enough.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-02,"when i learned the same studio as dos2 was doing bg3, i knew it would be great."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-08,tldr clickbait title with no answer in the longwinded unrelated video itself. typical ign bullshit.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,"we will bring avenus! the mod toolkit is ours, thanks larian!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,this game is so much better than 99 of games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-20,i'm 52 years old. i have been gaming since my atari 2600 years in 1984. baldur's gate 3 is the greatest game i have played in my lifetime alongside mass effect and zelda ocarina of time. these games have changed the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"dropped dlc, gave the players the tools to make our own dlcs instead. mfs legends.... can't wait for the community to create baldur's gate 12 remake on bg3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-02,a rare instance where we got close to perfection and nobody screwed it up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"you clearly forgot to mention the predatory behavior of wotchasbro. they want to squeeze every penny from every dd material, and they want to silence every competition. that's why the gm mode never arrived in bg3 even though dos2 has it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,while i can't say i'm not sad about the cancelled dlc. . .i can say i'm more than happy of what larian will cook up next
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"larian doesn't need to make dlc. they did what they wanted to do, and now they're moving on. the future of the game is in mods, and they know that. toolkit unlocked already introduced possible customer campaigns."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"absolutely tragic that were not getting more content for this game, but theyve more than earned the right to move on to something that gets them excited again. looking forward to whatever they come up with next!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"there is simply no game like baldurs gate 3. it's an amazing game that has a captivating story, fantastic immersive voice acting with challenging, tactical, yet flexible gameplay that has mechanics that conveys the idea of adaptability and freedom in everything you do that will immerse you in the world and will grab and hold your attention all day! larian studios has definitely delivered. it's sad to see them move on from this franchise. but onto the next project!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-02,this is perfectly fine. this game is huge and already has insane replay value. handing it off to the players by giving them official modding support tools as a thank you is a perfect sendoff. i look forward to larian's next project!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"if wotc had any brains at all they'd offer larian complete creative freedom, throw money at them and tell them to make whatever they want so long as they take a cut of the profits."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,great job larian! they are what blizzard used to be. can't wait to see what they come out with next.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"let modders do their work, instead of a dlc. let larian focus on their next game, which we all want as soon as possible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-16,"because wizerds of the coast is absolutely off their rocker atm, more so then usual."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,give the licence for bg4 to ubisoft. watch the poop hit the fan on the internet.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,exactly the decision they needed to make. free themselves to really make whatever they desire. also your pronunciation of joachim vleminckx was absolutely hilarious. it's pronounced yoacheem vlayminx  greetings from a very proud belgian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,the game is already more completehas more content then most games in years. it's good that they are moving on and don't have to milk bg3 for the rest of their lives.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-03,very good. it's nearly impossible for bg4 to be better than bg3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,larian made a good game. they're not interested in making a content farm. wish some people would know when to let things end.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-04,omg swen getting stopped during that tga was just d d d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,that's for the better. we have already received a masterpiece and in the future i'd hate to see the name ruined by greed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-14,"as long as larian never loses their passion, i think they'll do great!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,"because wizards of the coast is terrible to work with and simply does not respect it's artists, that's why."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,well if you paid for the more expensive version that said digital content you wasted your money.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,hasbro is idiot for letting larian go
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-22,i love bg3 !  300 hours
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"honestly? why does it need a dlc? its good to make a complete game for once. a hit it and quit it success is refreshing in an industry where if a game does well, it gets drug along for sequel after sequel, to spin off, and then eventual remakes and remasters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,"larian just dropped the bomb! 12 new subclasses is officially on the way on the next patch, photomode and others."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,you never answered the bloody question.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-30,larian would make my decade if they bought dragonlance from wotc and made that into the biggest crpg ever made!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"if they do a warhammer 40k rpg... or cyberpunk, i'm gonna flip out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-04,wotc making horrid business decisions and ruining dd as a product probably didn't help larian decide to keep developing dd games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,its the game of the decade surely. next 10 years this and maybe gta6 will be rememberd as the golden games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-05,larian intelligently listened to the fans and made a banger
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,this game is perfect. they don't need to do more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,"wizards of the coast  convince us that you'll do justice to our ip with a presentation larian  produces a copy of dos ii this is our presentation wizards of the coast  say no more, you'll make us proud."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,imagine larian doing a warhammer 40k game. my mind will go crazy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"i like larians decision and talking about content, as long as i understand it right, it is possible to build maps and content and implement it into the existing main campaign, so modders will do their thing, as allways!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,the prime example how games and devs should be.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-23,a dlc from larian or even bg4 takin us from lv 12 to 20 a la bg1 and 2 would be awesome
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"bg3 almost complete because every single character has it own story and every character is playable, with 6 characters not included the dark urge the playing time can easily exceed 200 hours play time just to go through all dialogues and unique story line. it still not complete because it still lack something like crafting because you can do alchemy but not crafting which is weird."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"they said goodbye for two reasons one if youre going to leave a series you leave on a high note and you cant get much higher than this second if this is the high note that you hit with someone elses franchise you naturally want to do something similar for your own own franchise. now you have clout now when your next game drops people are going to pick it up. divinity original sin 1  2 were amazing games, but they were the springboard for bg3. literally 10 years of developing their own engine went into bg3. divinity represented all of that work all of that understanding and now theyve said lets go do it again, but this time put our own franchise behind it because you make more money that way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,larian is the new bioware.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-02,larians the best studio out there cant wait till whats next
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"next, original sin 3 please!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-04,larian outdid themselves  baldur's gate 3 is amazing 1 year later. i'm still discovering new things  amazing!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"so...they ditched their critically successful project to work on smth...less stressful and demanding? but at the same time setting even higher standards? fair enough, but that sounds like ditching not just a successful project, but a huge chunk of reputation. great games are hardly ever easy projects. overall a decision that is hard to understand from a business perspective."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-02,gotta shoutout larian for giving us a complete game that doesnt need a dlc for the amount of content we already receive
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,better then starfield
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,this video is the equivalent of a movie analysis video essay that turns out to be 95 plot recap.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"is it a good game? havent played 1 or 2, should you play them before?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-30,its like progross and process. things must move on. its on to the next. whether its breaking rules or making new rules
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,40k game would be sick
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-15,larian wrapping their heads around how to raise the quality bar even higher. meanwhile i'm still happy as one can be about the quality bar being picked up off the dusty floor.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,hope they remake the first game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-29,"dammit larian. they could make a dlc not about what happened after the main plot, but about what happened before the victory. if only they add a new location within the city, a few quests there, a bit of content for each companion and maybe a couple of scenes for each of them  that would be enough for us to scream shut up and take my money!. pleeeease"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"wtf you mean it was hardly a blip on anyones radar? it was the most anticipated release of the year, with people excited for all the years in open beta. typical ignonsense."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-02,they will come back. and we will storm through the years as we wait
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-02,how is this news? they literally publicly stated that almost a year ago?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-28,"if the game gets any longer it will become a chore, for me personally its hit the perfect spot of long enough to really get into the game but not too long that you rush to the end just to finish it. mod support has been added to pc and sometime in october it will be added to consoles, which adds a massive amount to replay value."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"no microtransactions, no lootboxes, no nonsense. this is how a game should be 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-11,"imagine you're playing baldurs gate when you're a kid, you fall in love with it, and you become a game designer. with 35 people you make a hit, dos1, then dos2, which are your own versions of this love you played as child. at this point you grew to 450 employees worldwide, and you can finally go to present yourself to the creators of your childhood best memory. ask them if you can continue the story. they accept and you do it with such passion, such love, that its sucess reaches far beyond the exepected audiences and sets new standards for the gaming industry as a whole. this memory you had as a child, you gave it to millions of people. this is the story of swen vincke, founder of larian studios."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"thank you larian for all the hard work you put in, your fans salute you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,finally after so many years the release is here! good luck to everyone and have fun!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,thanks larian for the hard work developing baldurs gate 3. we appreciate the high standards you have in the modern gaming landscape.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"you understood the essence of baldurs gate you respected the original games you respected the source material you respected the lore, the characters, the world. in short, you respected the past  yet you werent limited by it. you believed in your own vision, your own creativity. youve managed to marry together tradition and innovation, respect for the old and embrace of the new. the result feels like something groundbreaking  yet also, in the best sense, old school. to cut this post short, its absolutely amazing. a historical achievement and a wonderful, wonderful game. thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,a prime example of how games should be made. thanks larian!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"most anticipated game of the year, rightfully deserved. developers who are not just a cash grabber, but a passionate gamers. rock on, larian!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"damn this guys went all in on the development, let's take a moment to appreciate all the people that worked on this game."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"bought it right after launch. i never pay full price for a game and always wait for a sale. i don't even have the time and patience to play video games anymore. but i buy this game at full price even though i'll never finish it just because you deserve it. it is insane what you accomplished, the sheer scope of it, the production value. everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"years i've been waiting for this game, and many years playing divinity too. you guys are phenomenal, and i can't tell you how happy it's made me to see so many people come out to support you and this game. good luck on this launch week. much love"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i remember seeing larians goal on their kickstarter was to create the greatest rpg ever made. looks like they finally achieved it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,you did it guys. you freaking did it. the game is amazing and a true successor to the original bg1 and bg2 games which i played and loved. all i ask now is that you do not abandon this game but that you break with your tradition and release at least one or two expansions that add new campaigns and take character levels to 20. do it while you are in the zone of this game and make history. if you do that this game will be remembered for generations.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"brings a tear to my eye. thank you larian, i was there the day of launch of divinity 2. i loved and played the game for so many countless hours with friends. i can't wait to do the same again in baldurs gate 3! i can't wait to see what more you all come up with in the future, i will be here for every moment."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i've never played a game like this before... always been a action adventure type gamer. your story trailer along with watching a guy playing it and explaining the mechanics so well in early access. i was fortunate to play 2 hours of it in early access and can't wait. however playing on ps5 is more my style of gaming so i'll will be waiting until next month. congrats to everyone that worked on this. let's goooooo!!!!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"ive been an avid gamer since the crowds around space invaders, in my 50s now  i must say that i bought into early access at the very start having loved bg2 shadows of amn. i played the early access once till the end of what is now act 1, and then just followed the news feeds as larian progressed with their development. i have to say that although im still on act 1, with content familiar, and new! that this game was well worth the wait! this independent studio has really crafted a piece of work that will stand the test of time! i am so thankful that i can play this absolute masterpiece of a game! you have really done yourselves proud with this, you have stayed true to the name of baldurs gate with a fantastic storyline, believeable characters that both enthral and beguile. sensational graphics, fantastic musical score i could go on and i know i have! but i would also like to add that you kept true to your objective, to make your players very happy with what they got for their hard earned cash, although im still on act 1, im already thinking about what ill do my next run as! im going to enjoy this game now, while you guys at larian decide what youre going to do next and when you do, ill put a bit of support your way again in early access, because this was well worth it! celebrate, stay well and true, and congratulations!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"i also want to thank the larian studios as a whole for this love letter to the fans. it's most appreciated and i'm gonna put a lot of hours into this masterpiece. also i just learned that larian studios was on microsoft radar to be purchased and i'm so glad that they sayed no, fearing that money would be the driving force instead of freedom and creativity. you have my respect for that decision. i hope you guys will remain independent and continue to show the industry that their is an other way, a better way... the larian way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"woke up right at 8am from the excitement of launch day! i couldnt sleep! six years in development and nearly three of those six in early access, i thank you larian and everyone who made this game possible! im sitting here waiting for the game to finish downloading and i cant wait to sink so many hours into this phenomenal game!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"the sheer size and scale of ea was wonderful, and i can't wait to finally play it. from what i've played and seen, larian has raised the bar for tbrpgs, a massive crowning achievement after the excellent dos2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this game has become my new addiction. what a fantastic time i've been having. larian and fromsoft have renewed my faith in the gaming industry. what a masterpiece! other devs take notes, this is a master class in gaming."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"this game is insanely detailed. endless amounts of choices and consequences. i enjoyed the hell out of early access, and i wasn't even near completing just act 1 lol."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i played bg2 soa in high school over 20 years ago. blows my mind that bg3 it's finally here!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,"257 hours in bg3 and i can honestly say this is the best game i've played since my childhood. in comparison to all the incomplete and moneygrubbing games that have come out in the last 10, 15 years, this masterpiece stands right up there with the legendary, such as elder scrolls, fallout, kotor, mass effect.... once i finish it, it will probably become my favorite game of all time. even if the crpg gameplay is not your cup of tea, no one can deny the respect and love that larian has for their community. we need to respect and support this attitude and force other developers to also be respectful and passionate about what they make instead of making shit games and excuses for them! thank you bg3, thank you larian, long live!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,larian!! i am so happy for you! this is an amazing game! i have been along for the ride since ea launch. i fell in love with baldur's gate 3 then and am still in love with it now. i know. i know...that sounded creepy and i digress. i just wanted to say thank you for all your hard work and dedication that went into this game! and screw all the other game devs that are trying to poo poo on your parade!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,what an absolute gem of a game! thank you larian studios for putting in the time and effort to make something fans would love. a very 90s move and it's awesome
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i dont play games like this, and havent tried a turn based game since pirate101. but i wanted to buy the game in support of larians incredible effort towards making an extraordinary game. turns out i actually like this game, and its growing on me quickly. thank you for gifting us this gem."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i can't wait to spend hundreds and more hours into this game. happy launch day.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,100 hours in this game now and... truly a masterpiece. swen vincke  you are my new god.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,thank you larian for being the best studio to ever exist!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,what an amazing experience you guys  gals at larian have crafted for us. couldn't have asked for more! look forward to your next project.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,what classrace did you choose for bg3?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i love all the actingcosplaying you have in your videos, really makes it more entertaining, also hope your okay, don't push yourself for us at the cost of your wellbeing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,macros the kind of dungeon master to make a whole campaign then have his friends playing with him completely avoid it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,bg3 is where i can live out all my dnd characters that'll never make it into a campaign
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i got baldurs gate and i have no regrets, it is such an amazing game, i love playing dnd with my friends and now i can see what i have imagined come to life 1010 game for me!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,32 hours in. still creating my character. 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"honestly this game looks like a lot of fun, i always wanted to get into dnd, this is the best way, i'll definitely play it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i personally recommend playing on the balanced difficulty for the first time, because it is fairly difficult, making you use everything in your arsenal more tactically than just for pure damage. i got so much use out of heat metal in tough fights to make the bosses simply drop their weapons, or using tasha's hideous laughter to make them skip a turn and give advantage on every melee attack against them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"note as of patch 2, you can now remove coop pcs from the party, to make room for a regular companion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"this game has so much replayability it is amazing. after putting 90 ish hours into my first playthrough with 4 players so i missed some of the companion stuff, i am going in for a second run in as 4 dragons in the hard difficulty. and on the side i have my single player and two player saves as well! amazing game in all!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,when the gate starts balding
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-02,i absolutely love how many different stories you can get by playing its so cool. there are still characters i've never met yet and im so excited to do more playthroughs
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,im so glad you made this video  i never actually played dnd but i was curious about playing this game nd u simplified it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,that squirrel one was so unexpected for me. that caught me off guard
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"as a dnd nerd, i can finally say i m not a noob anymore ! i actually was really into the vid cause well  i m a dm and i know all of this stuff."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,macro talking about dd at the start as an actual player is hilarious
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-05,i have never heard of this game before so i am watching this video because i am not sure if i want to get it and at 700 i literally had a heart attack omg. that squirrel was so cute and i was like awwww than  i am sold now tho lmao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,730...the girl subtly poking over his shoulder clenching her teeth in disgust is hilarious.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,something else that can be annoying is the camera when you are trying to look around in an area and it gets stuck in a weird angle or it is tough to get it to move back to where your characters are...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"all i want is to be able to manage partiesinventories across characters more easily at camp. cuz sometimes i dump something to a companion, forget they have it, then go looking for said item, then talk to them to join just to access their inventory. especially annoying as a game hoarder."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-22,"bg3 has been a blessing for me, being stuck as the forever gm of my various friend groups over the last 28 years of playing trrpgs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,love the intro as always macro! thank you for making content for us!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-15,"excellent video, i love it, but im watching this video in full screen in a dark room, and that pros and cons transition felt like being flashbanged in bo2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,shadow wizard money gang we looove casting spells
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,people really be like man dnd is for nerds and then put 2000 hours into this game and say its the best game ever.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,"this looks like a really well made game, makes sense why it won goty. i probably never heard of it till now because it's not the type of game i would like or play"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i'll wait for the definitive edition... where act 3 will be finished, the annoyances you mentioned get adjusted, and it likely gets added features similar to mod support."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,macro i love you i was just trying to find a video game that is like dnd and you just explicity tell me that thats what this is and thats exactly what i needed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"ive never played a crpg and i cant put this one down. 24 hours in and havent even made it to act 2, i just cant stop talking to npcs and exploring. it is so much fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i never expected there to be a baldues gate for noobs, nice to see"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"i don't even play many of the games or characters in these videos, but they're so entertaining to watch."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"705 you convinced me, already buying it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,"yunno a long time ago i watched an apex vid i dont remember which one and you were talking about carter aces song i think im normal since then i just became a carter ace fan and disassociated his music with your channel and just listen to him, and occasionally i come back and remember oh yeahhh thats how i found that dude"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,please do another the finals video! you really should get the game the attention it deserves and it should have a lot of players when it comes out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"i played the dark urge and kicking the squirrel was just one of the options, not automatic. you can even miss her if you lose the melee roll."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-08,"if you want to romance a specific companion i would suggest searching up the steps beforehand bc there are some characters that won't romance you if you make certain choices. an example is that i wanted to romance shadowheart, but i failed to save the grove, and i didnt know why i wasnt able to be romantically involved with her. it turns out theirs a scene that only unlocks if you succesfully save the grove, so im not able to romance her on my main run anymore"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,i think it would be very cool to see a dnd podcast featuring macro
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,macro never falls us with his intro skids
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,overwatch we are a competitive shooting game baldur's gate 3 you get to fck a bear edit credits go to offbeat outlaw
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-17,embracing randomness feels like i dont have control over what i just wanted to do. feels like im gambling for everything
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"i will never forget in the underdark when i had told everyone to jump over the dangerous lava, and they all decided na. i'm gonna run through it then move 2 inches away from where i wanted them to jump to and then jump. like wtf?!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-22,"made a dark urge vengeance paladin, multiclassed into draconic bloodline sorcerer for some cheese pact of the blade warlock also works great. it was actually amazing when you fight to resist giving in to the dark side, and then get the chance to go full psycho on the wicked, emerge covered in blood from head to toe, smiling like patrick bateman. sorcerer also has some crazy megalomaniac lines that go really well with a darkerminded character. bard is tons of fun, in and out of combat. hell, every class and race has its quirks, situations, scenarious that make you squee. unfortunately, playing the regular tav doesn't have as much colour as with companion characters, or the dark urge."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,nah that ad during the dark urge part was perfectly timed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,what they really need to do is make a map builder mode that also allows you to input custom text. it wouldn't be voice acted but then people could start making their own levels aka campaigns and that would be sick!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"i think bg3 deseves much more than a 8.5 while the inventory is a bit clukny you get used to it, the glitches are few and far between compared to any other big game release, and the other things like the frustrating party system could easily be improved"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,843 woooooooooaaaaah
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,whats funny is my friend actually gifted this to me a week ago for my birthday and im about to start the game tomorrow. so this was pretty convenient.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,656 bros intrusive thoughts won
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-19,i have never played dnd but started watching podcasts about it and got in to it so i tried bg3 to see if it was as good as it sounded and instantly fell in love with dnd and its turn based gameplay. i used to dislile turn based games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"perfect timing, just bought the game and looking forward to my first pc game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-01,"honestly i have always wanted to play dd but all my friends who play are busy as heck and so buying baldurs gate has been so fun for me and i am living out my chaotic goodness finally, its been fulfilling!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,nice setup i'm so excited for you're next stream
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,the best thing about bg3 is knowing your shitty party members wont cast eldritch blast at the back of your head while youre fighting an enemy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,you know a game is good when almost every con is just a quality of life fix that will be easy to add
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"never played dnd, and not really into rpgs but what the heck ill give it a try!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,never heard of baldurs gate until that one bear video exploded but this really got me interested because i saw nothing else for the game after that
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,im the friend who'll mess with you in dnd

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,i love playing dark urge. i love meeting a character at campalfira and then brutally disemboweling her even tho i was looking forwards to her being in my party.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"now we need him to play armored core,please."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-29,im playing baldurs gate just like my dd games keep forgetting the main objections because someone asked for help.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-13,bro the character in my left in the thumbnail is exactly my bg3 character but with red eyes
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,you should play armored core 6. its a mech game made by fromsoftware
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,cant wait for this to come to xbox so i can finally play it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"this was a hilarious game review! i loved the music choice, humour, and depths"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"pretty sure baldurs gate is dnd, because theres a location in the universe of dnd called baldurs gate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,love seeing sports boi back in a vid

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,i've never played anything remotely close to balders gate and i'm as new as they come. my buddy convinced me to take the dive so here i am. i'm hoping balders gate 3 gives me the same feeling i get when i play skyrim or the witcher 3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,that intro hit too close to home

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"playing a half elf drow warlock. would rate this game a 910. you also forgot how plentiful the modding community is. i've seen so many quality of life changes added, like 5e spells bieng added, and true initiative and custom hair."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,idk i think the randomness of people is the best in these games

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"i was at least half expecting the dog to play fetch with me when he brought me the ball in camp, but was still pretty delighted when he did. what i did not expect, however, was that after teaching him this trick he would then fetch the leather armor i threw down to cover up the cloudkill vent and helpfully give it back to me as i was trying to cross, killing my party."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"the difference between ranged spell attack and spell attack rolls is that the latter also applies to melee spells, such as shocking grasp. ranged spell attacks are the ones that have disadvantage if your character is threatened."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-31,making a rock lee vs gaara reference amidst this gargantuan review is why youre one of my favorite youtubers
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,i'm starting to get the feeling that this channel is really into rpgs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,baldur's gate 3 is the the crpg evolved through aaa presentation and production. as if it comes from an alternate universe where dragon age origins was the most influential rpg of 2000s.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-04,"minsc simply joins your party wayyy too late into act iii to have any real agency in the story. sure, he hits hard but you only have him for a little while before the end of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,i was actually shocked the passage of time wasn't taken into account when resting. my first time playing i did the entire nautiloid crash region on one rest because i really thought everyone would turn into squid monsters if i took too long.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,you're introduced to many different terms that mean the same thing ... so youre captured by mindlfayers and get infected by an illithid tadpole and now you have to escape the ghaik ship 13020
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"there's certain youtubers that when a new video drops, you sit back and watch with full attention instead of multitasking. good stuff dude."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"14217 this feels a bit like oversimplification of wyll's backstory. he didn't want to help people, he had to make a deal with a devil in order to save baldur's gate from cultists which seemed to be successfully performing a ritual of summoning tiamat, a dragon that would level the whole city if the ritual was to be finished."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,hell yeah! larian represents a by gamers for gamers studio. glad we have a company around like this in modern day. good thing is they are currently working on 2 more rpgs. great vid so far still working through it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"the level was capped at 12 because, if you play dnd, you know that high level spells are not only absurdly powerful. they just arent something easy to compensate for in a video game, some of them can even stump a dm."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"10322 hearing you talk about this took me back to the blackpit voidling battle in divinity original sin 2. wow. what an incredible puzzle of a fight that was. i know some people found it frustrating but finally being able to save gwydian after numerous attempts and knowing it was thanks to my careful planning, strategy, and understanding of the game's combat was one of the greatest feelings i've gotten from any rpg ever. i hope the success of bg3 encourages more people to play the rest of larian's games because they're truly worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"great video. to explain a ranged spell attack, this is a subset of a spell attack. the other type of a spell attack is a melee spell attack. spells like inflict wounds are melee spell attacks, while spells like scorching ray are ranged spell attacks. if something gives a 1 to spell attacks then it will give a 1 to both a ranged spell attack roll and a melee spell attack roll. so there is a mechanic difference between the two. you also have spell save dcs, which is the target number an enemy needs to hit when rolling a saving throw."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"i suspect that larian stopped at level 12 because that's where most 5e players like to stop. high level 5e play is not popular. the usual complaints are that the combat starts taking too long, the choices become less strategic and impactful, and the characters become so powerful that meaningful problem solving goes out the window. maybe that's the reason. or maybe it just didn't feel good having to remove a lot of the fun high level stuff that would probably break a video game, with planar travel and reality warping power. i'm not sure how they could have combined high level out of combat abilities with the interactivity they wanted the world to have. my hope is that working on bg3 gave them some ideas that we'll see in their next few projects."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"not gonna lie. i really admired the unhinged off the rails humor you brought with this one. there's nothing more authentic than trying to explain an obscure anime analogy to further the point of a sensation of a dungeons and dragons video game mechanic being used sparingly to increase satisfaction, because god dammit it's just proper."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"thanks for your loving review of bg2. the new baldur's gate is a fine achievement, but bg2 remains my favorite rpg of all time. and you explained exactly why."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,glad to hear minthara and you are still on good terms with each other!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"one of my main and really only criticisms of baldur's gate 3 is npcs, specifically, companions, have little to no agency once they are a part of your story. there should be no reason. shadow heart doesn't go into the temple of shar with or without you. gale should force himself to be at the initial motherbrain area and you have to talk him down from blowing himself up. halsin should do the antishadow ritual with or without you. once they're in you're party, they're amazing characters if you play their game, but are otherwise mannequins if you chose to outright ignore them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-04,"dude, minthara is the best girl! shame she lacks content, esp in act 3. so much locked potential"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,the first baldur's gates did a rather good job at playing evil. it locked you out of a couple characters and a couple quests but the same is true for playing a good character. if you really did want to minmax good was still better but overall didn't make much of a difference.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-04,"brief tangent but it really feels like the emperor is designed to always be exactly the result you want it to be. you can dig deeper, or even just enough to make him suspicious of you and he gets heavier handed and becomes potentially a betrayer. or you can just be chill and do what you need to do without throwing anything off and he gives you everything you wanted exactly with 0 consequences. he just wants to be free, and as a mindflayer, free will is something he has little trust in. yet he can be easily viewed based on your playthrough as a mastermind duping you, or just a dude who needs you while you need him. plus there's 0 reason for anyone to believe the prince won't immediately kill you off when he first sees you. if you read his mind i believe it's even confirmed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"great video as always! by the way, there are quests in baldur's gate iii where resting leads to failure, happened to me at the end of act 1 when i had to get explosives to open a rock on the mine. i rested before delivering the explosives and when i got there everyone was dead lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"the thing i love about letting shadowheart decide herself, is that it is not a guarantee how she will decide, she can also kill the nightsong. it actually depends how u have interacted with her and if u picked up some hints."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,ahhh!! i had to drop everything watching this is how im gonna spend my friday night! thank you!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"man, imagine if you were a less zen, less ironwilled unshakable reviewer, you mightve really been messed up by that minthara failure!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"he made it, he finally made it! and right as i'm going through my dos2 playthrough that'll thus complete my larian holy trinity that started with bg3, which'll likely cement them as one of my fav gaming studios of all time, but more importantly, the one studio that brought back my hopium that there actually is a strong audience for these types of rpgs  they aren't just a relic of a bygone era and dragon age origins was their peak. and here i was worried you'd never make a review of this...phenomenon of a game... and we'd just have to make due with brief mention of it in your history of rpgs vid at the end."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"i agree so much about the part on saves and honour mode. being able to save mid dialogue or mid combat is ludicrous. the returning joke with minthara is also hilarious. gj mate, glad to see your channel grow 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,gale was also manipulated like the others btw!! mystra started manipulating him when he was basically a child
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"4000 so, in 5e you have 2 types of spell attacks, ranged long distance, like a fire bolt and melee like shocking grasp so that weapon gives you a 1 in ranged spell attacks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-10,"thank you so much for your hard work as always, the indepth analysis of this channel is unmatched on yt"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,100 agree with the elimination of excessive pre buffing. it makes the combat in this game so much more enjoyable than bg1 and 2. was happy to see it mentioned. excellent work as always!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"11850 prebuffing in bg3 still definitely exist. most buffs have 410 rounds of uptime so if you buff for 1 round before initiating combat you still have 3 rounds of buff uptime, almost every fight i would start by buffing my fighter with hastearmorlong jumpbless. the reason most people don't gravitate to pre buffing is because the game is so generous even on tactician that it doesn't really matter what you do, you'll just win as long as you do something every turn."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-10,"was wondering why this took so long and now i understand why. you did a great job with this indepth piece and in the end, i totally understand the time involved in getting over that wretched drow minthara."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-05,"in regard to the tadpoles, way back in the alpha using ilithid powers too often was greatly implied to cause you to turn into a mind flayer. it was also implied that you would eventually turn into a mindflayer if you rested too often. sadly all of that was removed, even if they were empty threats the alphabeta had such a differnt feeling to the main game. also minthara can be saved by using a nonlethal take down when you fight her, but it's barely worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"about the balancing of rests, i feel that it was best done in pillars of eternity 2, where food had specific bonuses, and many rare ingredients were, well, rare.. it meant that you wanted to rest to be maxed out on your spells, but at the same time, you were potentially giving up huge bonuses from rare foods that were limited in availability. something that i found very well done in poe2's rest system."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"when i see this video posted i dropped everything, grabbed some snacks and a beverage, turned played this on my tv and sat for the two hours straight just focused on your analysis. thank you again for the great content and as always ill be waiting patiently, looking forward to whatever you post next."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,im really glad you talked about bg1 and bg2. the world should not forget how legendary and important these games were.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"for the confusion at 3931, range spell attack roll is for spell attacks at range while spell attack rolls are for both melee and range spells. example of melee spell is inflict wounds"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-19,"man, what a great video! you seem super sympathetic, i loved listening to your thoughts. your closure with minthara made me gasp and then laugh out loud. thank you for these nearly two and a half hours of great entertainment about a topicgame i love!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-16,"on your section about spirit of adventure i think you hit the nail on the head for one of the reasons i loved baldur's gate 3 but just kind of bounced off divinity original sin 2. in dos2, it felt like you had to do a completionist run of an area or else you would be underleveled for the next and it just got monotonous after a while, feeling like i had to explore every nook and cranny just to stay in line with the power curve. with baldur's gate 3 i felt like i could just explore at my own pace and ignore areas i didn't feel like visiting, but it made it more rewarding when i would explore and found something cool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-29,checking in 7 months later to finally watch this video thats sat in my watch later queue until i could beat the game. 150 hours and i loved every second of it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-26,"i think it's very interesting how much our opinions on the story differ, lol. i don't think there's a game who's illusion fell apart so hard for me as baldur's gate 3. act 1 truly had me believing in magic. it felt like every single possible choice in dialog or in gameplay was somehow being accounted for. but by act 2 there were fewer places where there even appeared to be large divergences and by act 3 i had begun to see all of the game's tricks to make you feel like you're making choices. the companions stop bantering during travel, stop commenting on your choices, and eventually just become mannequins one by one as you finish their stories. i just remember having a moment where it felt like all the color had drained out of the screen. i went from gleefully completing every single quest i could find to just forcing myself to finish the game. i think realizing that it doesn't even matter if you use the tadpole or not was the ultimate death blow for me. definitely didn't help that the overarching story was so unfocused and strange and the endings so quick and unsatisfying. your perspective on the story being about trust definitely helps me appreciate it more but ultimately i find myself in a really unique place with bg3's story where i just wish it was different. it's typically a hard rule of mine to not give criticism that boils down to write a different story, but with bg3 it's hard for me to imagine a story that looks anything like what we got that i personally like. i wish it had focused on the mind flayer gith stuff or the dead three bhaalspawn stuff, not both. even as i was watching it for the first time the reveal of the dead three involvement felt comical and strange. i hate that after all that buildup, your conflict with the emperor ends up feeling so petty and inconsequential. if, in a game about trust, the emperor is my character's personal struggle with trust, then kicking that motherfucker's ass should have been the culminating moment of the story, not just an incidental prerequisite to beat the netherbrain, which it's self doesn't even feel like the main villain due to aforementioned dead three shenanigans. i hate that the world is so dense, as you say, because even though i know this game has an absurd amount of content it feels so small compared to bg1 and 2. only having three major areas, seeing the same faces everywhere i go, i didn't feel like i was going on a grand adventure, making a lasting impact and forming lifelong bonds, i felt like we had simply taken a quick roadtrip to go deal with this illithid thing before my character would go back to traveling and finding small adventures and doing the stuff i wished i was actually doing in the game. i hope one day my disappointment with the end of the game will wane enough that i can enjoy it again because the gameplay is truly truly special and the characters are too."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"neverknowbest thank you for first focus on the previous game and explaining their appeal! i didn't want to watch this video before playing bg3, but i never played it so i thought f it and now i actually want to play it! without spoiling the beginning 1940 i am 26 and i really hope i will feel that feeling man!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-20,larian has garnered so much good will that their next game will have every benefit from the start. i truly hope that they can live up to the bar they've set with baldur's gate 3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,this video is worth it for the classified info on minthara alone. i feel the urge to try this out myself now. awesome vid as always!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"heh, 1 balanced, 2 tactician and 1 honor mode runs later and i still can't get over the fact of how badly viconia and sarevok's characters were ruined... viconia, even if not romanced, is not the same person... bg12's viconia was exiled because she flinched and refused to sacrifice a child to lolth, but bg3's viconia? kidnaps a selunite kid to turn her over to her goddess, via a lot of torture. what gives? don't get me started on sarevok, who i turned to the side of good 9 times out of 10... so he not only regressed back to evil, but somehow started worshiping bhaal? in og he only worshipped bhaal as a manipulation tactic, to garner bhaal cultists on his side, he didn't give a damn about bhaal or worshiping him, aside from what he would get out of it. come bg3? he turns into a religious zealot. again, what gives? they should've let vicky and sarevok rest, together with minsc..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"i did not check the comments to see if someone replied but the difference between ranged spell attack 1 and spell save dc 1 is who rolls spells where the attacker rolls, like fire bolt, are affected by the first. the attacker is rolling to hit its mark spells where the targets roll, like fire ball, are affected by the second. the target is rolling to save himself 3950"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,bg3 is the first time i ever played a game of its kind and the next thing i noticed i had 350 hours in it by december on my ps5 with the platinum trophy. i decided to support larian by buying the physical deluxe edition because they deserved it. it became one of the favorite games of all time. i even tried skyrim for the first time last year and i hated it. i watch one person play bg3 for like 10 minutes and i was instantly obsessed because its something ive never seen nor experienced before. i then bought played and got the platinum trophy on both divinity original sin 1 and 2 because i wanted more.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"i started a replay just as i finished the video d one thing occured to me pretty quickly that you dodn't mention, but i think really contributes to the feel of the game is the excellent use of a narrator."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"i was right at the beginning of act ii when this video dropped, and it took me until now to get to a point of completing the game that i felt satisfied with, and i am so glad i waited to watch it. another incredible entry into the nkb catalogue!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,the lack of upsides on a evil run is why i thought the update that allows you to recruit minthara without massacring the grove takes away so much from doing an evil run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"10900  there are situations where time passing is important in bg3, the underdark passage for example. how much you rest has a big impact on how the questline progresses in the second part."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"i agree with most of your praise of the game, certainly about the combat, gameplay, level design and implementation of the 5e rules, which are all amazing. where i disagree with you and seemingly everyone else is with the story and characters. around 155 you say dont feel bad if you didnt see through the emperors manipulation  and i didnt. i also didnt feel i had enough information to make any of the highly impactful choices the game threw at me. i was wandering around in a state of total confusion for pretty much the entire game, watching the narrative twist and turn in ways i couldnt possibly have predicted or exerted agency over. the way you describe the game posing the who can you trust question sounds great, but my experience of playing it didnt bear that out. i wanted so badly to like this game as much as everyone else did, but for whatever reason it didnt land for me. ive done two playthroughs second one coop and have given up halfway through act 3 both times. regardless, thanks for another excellent and insightful video."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"i think reducing pathfinder kingmaker and pillars of eternity as using nostalgia is a little reductive. poe was obsidian's biggest attempt at the time to make something theirs without executives bothering them or pulling the rug from under their feet. and kingmaker was owlcat's first game, a new studio of industry veterans bringing in their expertise to try and make the first pathfinder crpgkingdom management game which led to wrath of the righteous which some say is just as good as bg3. it's fine to think that bg3 is better, in a lot of ways it is and the impact it had is all due to the effort larian put in but to say that other games are relying on nostalgia just because of being isometric and things like it is a little disingenuous if you ask me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-12,"i rarely comment on youtube, but i just wanted to leave a comment to how much i appreciate your videos and this one in particular really resonated with me. bg3 really is a work of art that transcends above the plane of just 'videogame'"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,"i think that postskyrim bethesda style is an example not of dumming down mechanics, but rather if soulless corporate game design. you could have a simple game that still has a soul. example starting with skyrim, enemy encounters in dungeons are algorithmically placed to simultaneously never overwhelm you but also be spaced apart to that you're always killing an enemy at specific intervals. it's paint by numbers of an ai generated rendition of the mona lisa. also, the house of hope quest in bg3 which is entirely a missable side quest, is more fulfilling than pretty much all of starfield."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"mate, everytime you make something new i'm like, damn, he is really good at this. thank you for still making awesome videos and to everyone else that supports this creator. youtube should be all about content like this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-11,"the encounter design alone puts bg3 above most other rpgs. each fight feels unique because it is and the game does everything it can to make each encounter feel different and have its own flow and solutions. fighting a bunch of kobolds isn't just fighting kobolds, its fighting drunk kobolds in a wine cellar that you have to be careful not to blow yourself up in or use it to your advantage along with variations in verticality. there are almost no real copied encounters and each fight is hand crafted to feel unique. its something almost no other crpg really can claim"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"4620 honestly, i'm not even sure i know all of them is just about the perfect way to explain how extensive the options in this one area are."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,"you say there is no pre buffing in bg3, yet i find myself with mage armour, longstrider, warding bond, aid, bardic inspiration, transmutation wizard stones, false life, darkvision, see invisibility, death ward, freedom of movement, and heroes feast every long rest on all of my characters. lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-26,thank you very much. i really love this game and i have been following your works for months in my other youtube accounts. your content is really good for someone who works at home. you and whitelight are my favorite.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"lest we forget  you can optionally fight demogorgon in the expansion content for bg2. like if you're bored, you can punch out satan... and really piss off a bunch of good guys in the process. bg2 is so, so good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"another great point about saving extremes. a very good middle point could be, no saving midcombat. the current extremes of always or never honour could be improved on"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"sometimes i wonder about the original team at bioware that made the first two baldur's gate games all those years ago. i imagine most of them are long gone from bioware at this point, but i'm interested what they might think about bg3 how it came about, the differences in design and storytelling, the megahit popularity of a series that is no longer under bioware's direction. especially since bioware has been struggling so much in recent years, it's interesting to think about larian having their own moment in the spotlight like bioware did all those years ago, both with the release of baldur's gate games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"great video, this kind of stuff is why i keep watching! hopefully we get many more crpgs to come!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,i just want you to know that i really appreciate the lee vs gaara comparison. it was stupid fun but also on point
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"ranged spell attacks means spells that are ranged, which is why that item grants you fireball for example. spell attacks means all spells including ranged spells, which is why the item grants you blight for example"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-01,"early access for them worked because they used the time to listen to players and pivoted whenever there were complaints about the content, like companions not being likeable and class balances. early access titles often languish for years until they crap out a 1.0 release, but bg3 kept the hype by only making act 1 accessible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"was just checking your channel the other day to see if any new new dropped. keep cooking, brother."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"i personally liked siege of dragonspear, but i understand why many fans of bg 1 and 2 didn't like it. instead of aiming to be a grand adventure like bg1 or bg2soa, it funnels you through a series of linear areas and a straightforward plot with few sidequests, similar to throne of bhaal but not as good on the story or character front. the attempts to link the stories of 1 and 2 together are also a little weak. the dungeon and enemy encounter designs are very solid though, better than most content in 2 and basically anything in 1, and that's what you'll be doing for most of the expansion's playtime. as a dungeon crawler rpg it's quite good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,you are my favorite creator to fall asleep to and to see it tonight makes my whole weekend so much better thank you for what you do
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-04,"11428 one of the worst battles in bg3 for me was when you're fighting that bloodscarred priest in nocturn to save the nightsong. the skeletons just kept kicking my party off the side of the floating rock. it was utterly maddening. i feel no guilt pushing people off cliffs, the game will totally do it to you too."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,i gasped and immediately shared with my bgplaying friends. todays my birthday. this is perfect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-09,i paid the 100 to play starfield early i bought bg3 on a whim during a steam sale. i have about 350 hours in bg3 on my second play through i booted up starfield and played until i realized how bored i was. lesson learned.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,what an amazing video. i love your content. its always a good day when nkb posts. thanks a lot man!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"there is at least one quest that is on a time restriction. its in act 3 and has to do with florrick. on multiple occasions, i have not been able to complete it because i rest too often lol."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-13,ive been waiting for so long for this critique!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,to me the greatest thing bg3 did better than the older games is how larian managed to build interactive reaction to choice and actions within the game most noteable in the early acts. older games had better and more complete stories but it was much more railroaded then bg3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-01,"i've been waiting for this one  thank you! 20550 there is a major consequence from a roleplay aspect if you suck down a bunch of taddies throughout the game, i think you cannot refuse the partial illithid transformation later like, the dialog option isn't there to refuse. i could be wrong, or that might have been changed. my first play through, i was railroaded!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"neverknowsbest, salt factory and joseph anderson. you guys are the kings !"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-02,"great analysis, well crafted and thoughtful throughout"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-18,"other than a couple of brief asides, this video doesn't discuss the biggest criticism of the game that i've seen a few times. that is, its later acts are significantly underdeveloped compared to the first one, a typical larian trait of biting off more than they could chew."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-02,10930 there are actually a few quests that fail if you rest too much before doing them. the emerald grove is one
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-26,wait till he finds out you can knock out minthara and recruit her later on.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,my husband was telling me about this game and he said just find someone who's voice you don't hate and just watchlisten to their character creation... this game is insane with the customizations fuckin' bet! i see morph's video less than 24 hours later.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"this playthrough is vastly different from my own, morph did exactly what the devs recommended not to do, running the dark urge on the first playthrough, yet i love seeing it done by someone else so i can see how very different it is from the path i chose. i've never seen a game with better replay value. great video so far!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,morph being a real horndog in this one
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i don't know how, but they nailed absolutely nailed the strawberry blonde. i wanted to create a black haired character too but then ended up choosing not only the same strawberry blonde but even the same highlights as you did"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-07,"ive been avoiding this series, i thought it just wasnt for me and have been secretly hoping for any game but this in future videos i finally gave in and have watched about an hour. bought the game, have met all companions and am loving it so far. damn your fantastic humor and creative content! cant wait to catch up on the playlist!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-29,"i can't play baldur's gate 3 on my elderly mac, so i'm experiencing it vicariously through several playthroughs on youtube  twitch vods. i stumbled upon your channel, searching for someone who was playing bg3 by themselves, because every multiplayer vod i've watched has had at least one chaos goblin player, who takes off, is not a team player, gobbles all the loot and precipitates fights when the rest of the party isn't ready. i also wanted a player with a pleasing voice who isn't suddenly screeching or making my ears bleed in the various ways some streamers do. i wanted someone doing a complete playthrough, who would take the game seriously enough to actually read the descriptions and listen to the conversations and appreciate the masterpiece that it is. happily i found you. you check off all the boxes. also happily, your magical voice, which is made for asmr, is being applied to reading books to help people sleep. i am a long time indulger of asmr videos to relax for bedtime with, and was delighted to find your other channels are the ones i've had popping up in my recommendeds for the last few weeks. i just subscribed to all three. thank you! i feel like i just won the lottery!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,its like christmas to see a new badmorph video. thank you  youre a present for us and this world! and after that vid back to your bedtime stories

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-30,"when you made that first video, i couldn't bring myself to watch it, as i had not experienced this universe by myself. i'm coming back today with far more experience, and i've got to say, your playthrough is delightful. i'm super chuffed to see someone liking astarion right from the start. sending an assassin, a rogue on the line of the battlefield was hilarious. i wonder what you were expecting at that time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,really enjoyable playthrough! looking forward to the next one d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-01,"i love your voice. i already played the game and watched different playthroughs, but after watching you play cabernet, i wanted to hear more of it. your commentary is hilarious. you calling shadowheart a gothic stress toy killed me."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-05,i just found this let's play and your channel. the voiceover is so good. it's really relaxing after a long workday. i have oer 2000 hrs in this game and no full runs that haven't been done with friends. i spend way too long in the character creator and then end up second guessing my builds and or character idea and starting over. maybe listening to a chill playthrough in the background will help me get a solo run under my belt.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-27,really well done. just the right amount of talking and a good sense of humor.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"this is so excellent, my pc isn't beefy enough for the game and this was exactly what i was looking for to scratch the itch!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-04,i accidentally romanced gale to the point of extreme sexual tension that i didn't pick up till midway through because i thought he would teach me more about magic and wizard stuff.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-08,"on one hand, im genuinely surprised how accurate he was. spoton with my picks astarion, karlach and halsin. but on the other hand, the emperor wasnt mentioned, and therefore im absolutely offended that this man didnt finish shaming me. if youre gonna put me on blast, at least cover the freaks like me who also went for the purple squid man!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-29,my relationship with minthara was just a byproduct of my bad decision making
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-07,"didn't expect minthara to be an option until i played a bad guy run. her romance felt like i was being held at gunpoint, it came out of nowhere."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-13,minthara hits my humor and heart just right.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-24,"i like astarion because he's funny, and somehow me being asexual turns out great in that romance"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"i agree on the girls who are into horoscopes thing. they're all bad news. i've never met a girl who was into horoscopes who didn't lowkey or highkey treat it like a new way to discriminate against people. all of them swear to whatever god they claim to believe in that they're not like that and that they don't do that, and then they turn around and do exactly that. it's like a new form of socially acceptable even though it shouldn't be discrimination and it's annoying. anytime i hear a girl ask me about my horoscope, i nope right out of that conversation, and dodge when they try to ask me when i was born. and sadly, it's a shockingly large portion of women i've met. wouldn't be caught dead on a date with one of them. tried it once, never again. avoid it, boys, it's just not worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-24,gale also threatens to blow himself up if you tell him he was only fine in bed. that's a red flag so large it's visible from space.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-31,"first playthrough i romanced nobody. second playthrough i chose my romance solely based on who i was least looking forward to rejecting, and that happened to he wyll. everyone else was so easy to say no to, but that look he gives you is just so heart wrenching."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,"truly the take of someone who didn't give gale a chance. he doesn't want your best items, he doesn't want the armour off your back, anything will do. he only asks for 3 garbage items that you're never gonna use anyway because otherwise he will die. gale please give me your useless garbage because it will literally save my life players gale is so greedy and takes all my stuff"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,the laezel thing is just too accurate
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-24,"i will take no gale slander. without spoiling too much, mystra can choke. she did this man so fucking dirty. and he's still under her spell, and it's so fucking painful to see. also, wyll is. so good. i love him to death. he just tries to be kind! that's it! he tries to be kind. he's worth everything to me. halsin's was accurate."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,"hey man, you did us dirty with lae'zel. two things can be true at once."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,"i refuse to accept gale slander like that. he's a precious bean that is quite possibly the most wholesome romance in the game. he's awkward, shy, heavily insecure about what he can give you and feels like he's never good enough. he legit make me feel seen by the game devs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-08,"ill admit at first i was really put off by the learning curve, i havent played dungeons and dragons or anything like that because i live in the middle of nowhere. i had to look up a few long videos on how to properly play bg3 but it finally clicked!! i ended up reinstalling the game twice because i thought i had wasted my money on a game i thought i wouldnt play again but boy was i wrong!!!!!!!!! i'm 340 hours in and still loving every damn second of it. trust me guys the learning curve is worth it!!! dont give up on this masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,currently restarting my solo playthrough having sunk 20 hours into the original now i've learned from mistakes but i can safely start again now that i understand about 13 of the mechanics
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"this is excellent thank you. all the other so called beginners guide videos still have a tendency to assume some prior knowledge of this complex system, whereas this really is for beginners. well done, a priceless video for us genuine newbies xx."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-31,you are the only one to explain how spell slots work and why i keep running out of spells without knowing how to check how much mana it had used or whatever dictates it. i now know it's all about those blue squares! thank you.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-22,great guide. where im struggling is the leveling up and deciding how to progress each character. i was prepared to roll play myself but didnt think id be building my whole team with such intense detail. its intimidating.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,none of these tips note how useful shove is. need to get away without wasting an action on disengage or taking and opportunity attack? shove the enemy. park a tank at the top of a ladder and shove enemies off as they climb up for massive damage. need to pick a fight with a faction whose leader is conveniently standing next to a death pit or lava? guess whose dying before the fight even starts. shove. very strong.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"this is excellent thanks! i'm m in my '60's now and only just getting into dd. played gloomhaven for a year or so till covid, but no video games. anyhoo, my son let me know about baldurs gate but i need really dumbed down basics. anything you can do to pick apart down to absolute basics will help this old novice."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,totally new to this kind of game. i'm almost embarrassed to tell how long it took me to realize that i could reunite my party. i thought it was a glitch when my companions stopped following me. another thing was when the game went into turnbased mode while i was walking through a trapped isle. i realized after over an hour that i could just turn turnbased mode off.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,i feel like i need to take a class to figure out how to play this game. i just started playing on ps5 and i have no idea what i'm doing. i don't think this cleared it up either.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,"bard is one of the better beginner classes for one simple reason jack of all trades. excels at charisma checks, yet it is capable of also being proficient at a number of other checks in all other categories."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"changing gear during combat is also an action. e.g. equipping a pair of gloves, weapon or head gear for a skill or perk you want to use in the battle."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-06,"i'm on my 3rd playthough, and i can remember how embarassed i was and how i was struggling at the beginning. do not give up people, this game is something else!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"i hate top down, turn based games, but baldurs gate 3 has become one of my favourite games of all times, thats how good this game is. seriously, if youre not sure, please give this game a chance, but please, please, please role play when playing, because thats where this game really shines. this game rewards players who use imagination and creativity, and play to their characters strengths. most of my favourite moments from playing this game havent even come from combat at all, but rather trying things that i wasnt even sure was possible. experiment, throw yourself at the experience, have fun!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,a very good primer for bg3 and dd in general! really appreciate it aoife!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,i can't believe how little the game explains how to play
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,i dmed dd e5 for over last 2 years 2 weekly meeting for 68 hours per month. spent over 50 hours i bg3 game. amazing tutorial from you aoife! 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-29,"this is super helpful, and one of the best quick breakdowns i've seen of both dd and bg3. i'm new to both, and about to start bg3. thank you for all the great videos on this intriguing but complex game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"proficiencies for sure are important to explain, because the number of times i've seen a cool piece of gear, slapped it on wyll and found he could no longer cast spells is too dang high. i think it's also a good idea to explain surfaces, as they're a huge part of larian games, if not 5e dd as much, so showing some of the consequences of standing in different terrain, getting high ground, etc great video, always love to see your content!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,"ive played for like 10 hours so far and have no idea what im doing. im playing on the easiest level and im still dying constantly. its ruining the game because i cant do anything edit because people lack critical thinking skills i play on ps5. nowhere was there anything that said do this to access a menu that explains eveything. maybe my game was buggy, maybe not, but either way it took me until my third playthrough until the tips and tricks started actually prompting me. sorry that my personal struggle ruined your lives i guess"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"as a from soft noob your elden ring video helped me so much and i love the hell out of that game now, so im confident this video will help with bg3 too!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-05,i have played many video games and the combat in this one is beyond my comprehension
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-26,"watched this even though i don't need it. and i have to say, this is an excellent guide for newbies. good work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"im not too familiar with their most recent edition of dungeons and dragons, but i grew up, playing the pen and paper versions during second edition. i feel like even so it wasnt too hard for me to get back into playing this type of game. i just watched what the enemies were able to do and got an idea how to play better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,some hot goss here  i somehow was able to romance lae'zel. i mean  i was not prepared for that. apparently i was able to be ruthless enough to grab her attention. this game keeps surprising me with each turn. thanks for a great explanation for us beginners i've never played dd but have watched some critical role recently so my experience is limited.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"these things were all very well explained for beginners, thank you. also this may sound odd but so many people narrating things do a terrible job at making you want to keep listening to them talk. you do very well at not talking in a monotonous tone and adding personality to the dialogue. keep it up!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-22,"i got four hours in and realized i was not having any fun due to overwhelm. steam wouldnt give me a refund so i kept trying, set it to easy mode and i will say its getting a bit better. i still find the combat and movement quite tedious, but at least i have some idea of how to strategize. i am still sort of regretting buying it tbh because im such a casual gamer. wish the steam refund window would extend for such a long and complex game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-13,i literally want to cry this game is so complicated for me. i can't get out of the first zone without dying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,"more combat videos, people do not want to miss the best game, ever made, but they will if they give up  dont learn the deep combat, dont feel bad  take your time learning the systems of the game, your not alone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-08,i started playing bg3 last night not knowing a single thing about dnd ... now im hooked to both thanks to your video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-23,"my biggest gripe is how the most impactful things you can do during your turns are an action. if you miss with an action or made a mistake you are at a big disadvantage. also, yeah if you just take a moment to actually read you can figure the game out. there was one small fight i played through recently where 4 or 5 different spells missed in a row on this one guy cast by gale. my melee characters just walked right and hit no problem. im examing the target and it gives no explanation as to why the most powerful caster atm could be hit something with 16 ac. guess it was just 5 very unlucky rolls in a row."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-17,my first dd game and i absolutely love it. it took me a few hours to get used to the combat system but now i know how to set up my characters for a better chance to win. i'm about 23 hours in and the story is awesome as well as the quests. this is definitely gonna be on my all time favorite games list.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-11,i'm an absolute noob to any dnd but this is such a good game till this video i have just been winging it but now i have a good amount more knowledge thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,i got to act three and quit. i was having so many struggles. i was looking up build guides and still struggling. decided to come back a year later and try again. decided to look up what things meant instead of just looking up builds. things got much easier 80 hours into my second attempt and i hit the map buttonps5 and a much larger and detailed description of the mechanics pops up. why is the map button the button that gives you all the information you need to understand the mechanics? i am having much more fun now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"i realized how important the right team combo is. pala, cleric, ranger and sorc is a great team!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"thank you for this. ive been waiting for this game for so long, and i knew it would be a tough endeavor since ive never played dnd , but fuuuuuuuck, did i underestimate the complexity of theo great game. ive watched many beginners guide and they still left me wanting to shit in my hands and clap. until this guide, an actual beginners guide. thank you for it. im looking forward to future videos that you can give us regarding learning this badass experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,"this was very helpful. not only have i never played dnd, ive never played a video game ever. bg3 is the first game ive ever played at the ripe age of 20. i have a lot of figuring out to do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-30,this was a huge help! im a recent player and had little experience in dnd. i just got to act 3 and ive never played a crpg type before.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,are any of you here old enough to remember the good ole days of gaming when games had instructions and manuals? imagine being put into a cockpit of large commercial jet without having any type of aviation knowledge. now also imagine being told to fly it without any training about what any of the countless switches and buttons do. and no assistance will be provided by air traffic control and no navigational systems will be available either. that's how i feel trying to play bg3.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"please do include some lore for the baldurs gate 3 settings, it's world, races and their conflicts with each other. would love to get invested in this world if we know a little about it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"im still having a hard time just navigating the screens. some of the stuff shown in this video character screens i have never seen before. some of the stuff aoife described was, do this to x, and i was like, how?!?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"i'm late to the party with baldur's gate. at first, i created a game and had no idea what i was doing. created another game, and this time, i actually learnt while playing the game  like what works in combat, which missions to do first, what the character we rs are good at, etc i feel like it's trial and error playing the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,i am intimidated to play this bc i feel like i have to watch 20 guides. the real question is the game worth it if you have to constantly do side research to keep going? who found it enjoyable while having to stop and learn?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,"i suck so bad at this game. i think i do a good job exploring, and still like miss everything. i missed gale, i missed that corpse guy, i miss so much. i'm playing on explorer and still get my ass kicked every time i enter battle. it's so frustrating that it almost makes me want to stop playing, but i still do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-21,"this reviewer seems to forget mentioning to save, save, save your game, you can even save on the roll dice screen!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,thank you. very useful for me a newbie to bg3 i wish we had the same bars on the xbox as they do on pc. it looks a lot more helpful and easily explainable
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-27,thank you very much for this guide! things are a bit clearer... just a tad... i will have to rewatch it a quite a few times though. thank you for giving me my 1st stepping stone of understanding. i can build it from there!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"a very useful video, aoife! not just for bg3 which i'm so excited for on ps5. but also for dd in general, which i'm having my first ever game of on the 30th september."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"i grew up playing the original pixel game dark alliance back in 2001. never played the second one and recently played this. having a hard time getting through the first chapter, thought it was gonna be like the og"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-30,"man i have really wanted to buy this game, and i have never played anything like it, or dd this video really sunk me said with love. i just dont know if i could get it all down, and have the time. i have a ton of respect for everyone who plays though, it seems amazing and so much fun, but just way too much. great video though really!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-29,i soooooo want to play this game but wow even beginner videos are insanely overwhelming !!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,this straight up sounds crazy but fun . i've played wow . so i understand binding  spells . kinda what i'm going in with . a good thing my daughter plays . she can help me .  downloading the game meow .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"thanks for the video! ive played a little bit of dd and listened to campaigns before, but this was still useful as i still dont have a lot of experience"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-26,"this is quite helpful but jesus christ this game is so hard!!! i really wanna enjoy it, love fantasy games but i cant seem to keep track of all the information. the game really should have added a tutorial or an intro levelprologue phase for new joiners."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-09,"true story but a bit long! sorry! i count myself as a gamer. i truly do. but my first taste of the mmorpg elder scrolls online playing with a guild of people made me question whether i was allowed to have that title or if i actually was a fraud. i felt anxious that i wasn't following their gamesavvy lingo or the game mechanics and i got cross with myself for being slow to be able to manage a build for the first time. i'd come from games where it was story based and beautiful and that was the experience. anyway, after playing with the guild i'd selected who were friendly, if a bit more hardcore than me  i tried becoming one of them by learning the mechanics and grinding extremely hard for so long to get the 'right' armourweaponsvarious different fragments of things that have to be put into another thing that had to be combined with the other other thing etc etc. and you know once i did it and had it down, i was told that the satisfaction with the build i'd created would be a substantial gaming high  i learned instead that i was making myself sad. i took a look at what i was doing and i asked if i was having fun playing the game and the answer  shockingly  was nope! natta! i'm reminded of viva la dirt vid  httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vqjw8ecnzuy i retreated from eso to delve back into okami, skyrim, zelda, telltale and story based games or indie games that appealed to me and i had a blast! my point is that coming here and hearing you say that it's ok to be a little perplexed is such a huge weight off my anxiety. i've been bullied a fair bit especially on eso grouping with a random and people use the phrase noob which just makes me want to quit playing with others altogether. what a terrible term to exclude people! surely encouraging gamers into playing and trying harder helps the entire franchise and it's fans! why did it take me so long to realise i wasn't a dumb, idiotic, clueless noob  i was someone who had achieved the heights of that type of gaming and said no thank you. i'm gonna do my own thing!  anyway, that's all. thank you for this guide"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,its so popular on youtube it's really difficult to avoid spoilers lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-06,"thank you soooo much for making this video  it's exactly what i needed. i'm loving the game so far, but the amount of mechanics and choices is completely overwhelming to me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-03,this is spanish to someone whos rpg experience extends to only the souls franchise and skyrim
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-21,wtf is with the spoiler intro when this is a beginners guide
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-04,"ive been a gamer basically since birth, i have 21 year of experience and i must say, this game makes very little sense in the gaming world. to do the simplest tasks is brain surgery."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-21,"i am still so very lost on how to play the game, but i guess i will learn as i go along"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-28,"struggling to stick to a playthrough myself i've played dd 5e so the mechanics and gameplay i understand, really enjoy the small tweaks they've added but just feels like im doing something wrong, like race, class, ability scores, etc and then that nagging gamer pride if i dont play a certain difficulty, or a certain way"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"going over the hud showing settings of where things are, how to edit and modify."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"good rundown on some of the nuances of the mechanics, aoife! romanced gale since ea because who can resist tim downie's wry sass? so i must admit i cannot empthatise with people who got bugged with the wizard coming on a little too strong to them. could you talk about some storycharacter details you found appealing yourself? i for one am intrigued what you made of this campaign."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-18,"thank you, i a dummy here! fps to this? .. never played dd. trying a different type of game here and boy o boy i needed some one like you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-13,the last dd game i played was solasta crown of the magister i didnt really enjoy it but im so excited to play this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,"well i guess i am joining the club of the lost ones lol. never played or read anything dnd but had to jump on this highly recommended by a friend, and i am about 10 hours in story mode and i am understanding it a little more but still have no idea on the grand scale of the game lol. however.. i am enjoying it fully very much."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"this is definitely a game that i could only play with someone who knows what theyre doing and could guide me. any bg players living near eastbourne, england? lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-15,"i really tried the trial and error thing, spending hours getting frustrated having to redo important parts and trying to understand combat mechanics. ive never played any game adjacent to dd so i have no basis for comparison. i understand that the game is really catered to grind gamers who mostly have experience, but im bare bones. i love gaming, but ive never played anything quite like this. im on 8 months of playing it and i still hardly understand. definitely more than when i first started, so at least im not a lost cause."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,i feel like this video has too much spoiler footage ... and i don't see why it's necessary at all
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,using thieves tools for lockpicking took me 16hours to figure out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-12,"i actually have no idea what i am doing, but i love the game d it has been a really long time since a was taking things so slow in game as i am now in bg3, it is just sooo great....and i guess when i learn how to play it will actually be even greater d"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,i just bought the game from the holiday sale on ps5 i was on the fence so i played the two hour trial i loved it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-28,controller related gameplay stuff would always be nice. i'm playing on pc and not all the stuff is very intuitive xd like for example  i had to search online to figure out that items are stored under the character sheets menu  that was the last place i thought of looking as i thought it would just be a stats menu of the characters and not their inventory as well i was trying to figure out how  where i can drop items from my inventory
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-30,there is a rediculous amount of things to think about. tough
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,the problem is that you are pressing lots of buttons and i don't know at which point you are showing us something or just having background plays
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"great video, thanks. would love to see a video on how to increase chance to hit. and maybe some examples of battles and what people do. theres so many things to do in battle that i just would never think of  and outside of battle, like throwing a party member across a chasm"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-07,just started playing. learning curve for sure
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-04,....ill buy a notebook to take notes about all of this this game gave me a headache when i started playing

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"been having a heck of a time with bg3 getting my butt kicked  so i figured i would see what i am missing. about 70 of the way through this video i said to myself yeah, this is for dummies, ive already got all this wish i would have found you a month ago."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-23,what's with all the spoilers. couldn't these tips have been made over early game content?? the video isn't even necessarily representative of what's being discussed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-22,i would have subscribed if there were no spoilers
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-13,i went into this game without knowledge prior thinking the play style would be like skyrim and was put off at the fact that i couldn't just freely attack as i prefer being in full control of my character and am not a fan of turn based games lol.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,i'm going to be playing a heavily modded version instead. currently i want to romance everyone
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-02,"interestingly enough, while everyone sings their praise, this game gives me absolutely nothing except for a good soundtrack. sold it after one day."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,i'm 15 hours in and still have no idea wtf i'm doing. lol. there's just so many spells and abilities to choose from.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-06,i bloody love this community
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,"i hear a woman talking about things about the game, while the player who's playing in the video just does their thing more or less unrelated to the woman's story. the video and audio don't work together. i was hoping more like here you see a situation with three characters, they want to fight the other 3 npc's. now if i click on this i select this character, and when i do this you see he'll go forward a few steps.. something like that. the audio is for beginners, the video for experts"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-03,"830 i had a thought of what if i multiclass as a paladin and a cleric of selne. maybe i'll get some cool shadowheart dialogue, but i'll still be able to play as a paladin. i was floored when i found out the game had paladin of selne specific dialogue. it was such a cool moment."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"i played a tiefling druid for my first run and i was so amazed they had a dialogue option for that, bg3 does such a good job taking into account every unique character and involving it in the story"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,this game has the highest replayability of any game ive ever played. larian is also an amazing studio that listens to the community and gives every devemployee a voice. i'm excited to see what the studio does in the future and i pray that it never goes public

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"i like how you touched on how skyrim lets you have the best of all world and how that really takes you out of the immersion of the rpg, and how the restrictions placed on your character in bg3 by how you construct the character was really interesting to me. bg3 is a great jumping off point for dnd newbies, or folks that cant find a group!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,gale is so funny i have no idea how people can hate him

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,the editing on this video is great
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-23,"i do think the funny thing about gale is that the problem with accidentally dating him was a bug. which sucks because he's a genuinely interesting romance, unfortunately people get put off him because of that bug. it got fixed thankfully so i hope people give gale a second chance, he's arrogant and ambitious, yes, but also he's been through a lot and he's very self aware of his own part in his downfall. i love him."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"so happy u did a video on this, though i know you would. absolutely adore the game, been playing for a little while and over 100 hours i just got out of act 1 lmao. i love that it doesnt push you to explore every inch, but if you want too it lets you, and it kets you take your time to properly loot and explore. the character stories and just dnd adventure mechanics are my absolute favourite 3"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-07,"018 i briefly stood next to ed greenwood at gencon years ago, and if he didn't stink there of all places, it's fair to say he probably smells okay every day."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"blorp shpingleding is now gonna be the name of my solo honor mode character, thanks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-28,"i just gotta say, i usually listen to video essays and that kinda stuff as more of a podcast, or just something in the background while i do chores or other things, but this video is so well made that it got me sitting through it and actually watching. i'm obsessed with how you insert yourself into the varying locations of the game"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,guy rim whoaaa there buddy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-12,"134 same here, man. i look like sasquatch down there!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,great content and loved the use of the green screen! there are a ton of bg3 yt vids but this one stands out as being one of the more informative and entertaining ones i've watched. big like on the video and best of luck in growing your channel is a very competitive space. small channel yeah it's relative but glad you got a sponsor and it was handled well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-20,the fact that you left halsin to die is amazing. so many different courses this game can take
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,easily my game of the year for 2023. nice job with the video dude!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"i was never able to explain what it is that makes this game so magical for me as someone whos been trying to sell dd to my friends for the longest time, and you summed it up perfectly. and you know what? those friends have been playing bg3 with me, and they love it too. maybe ill bring up dd again sometime."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,your editing is flawless. i know nothing about this game and you made me want to play it. you could talk about paint dry and make it entertaining.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,"thank you bizly, i came over from the slime guys channel and he said to watch your videos and i saw this and thought it would be interesting, little did i know, baldurs gate 3 is a cow, i will never look at cows the same way again, knowing their insides are that complex and have like all of these people running around, gosh."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-22,the disrespect for bg lore is real in this video. oh we have witcher 3 now do we? bitch i was there for baldur's gate 1 and 2 and throne of bhaal and even siege of dragonspear. you can't handle bg!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-22,i'm repeatedly blown away by the amount of effort that goes into your videos. great work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,love the thumbnails. and i do mean plural.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,"your editing is out of this world. fantastic video, also the manscaped ad read was probably the best advertisement i've ever seen"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"dropped everything to watch new bizly upload. but fr i think bg3 and jrwi have reignited a love of dnd thats always been there but dormant for years since i havent been able to play. you put into words on why i love bg3 so much and honestly the fact that im like 6 characters in and still getting new stuff is crazy. my closest friends have been playing and my boss will tell me how his game is going and mention something that ive straight up never seen in all my hundred hours that he got in 30. its such a good game and playing with friends really does give a similar joy to actually playing ttrpgs with them. also it gives me, a forever dm, a chance to be a player again"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-14,just watched 3 of your vids back to back and love the editing style man. green screening like that is perfect for your style
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"i thoroughly enjoy your channel, humour and methodology. i really hope you grow evermore. excelsior"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-23,bizlys thumbnail roulette
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"you have a cool format, ive dabbled in the green screen format and its not easy! glad i discovered your channel!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-16,wait til you hear about baldurs gate 1 and 2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,"bizly, big ups to you on this video. from the creative green screening into the game constantly stimulating my tiny little pea brain throughout the whole video to casually schooling me on the entire history of all rpgs ever. making vids this good isnt easy. your channel is a gem. also, laezel best character. fight me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,new bizly video leggooo!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-27,"i love the neat little details they add where they're not needed, but appreciated. like how if you're both a cleric of selune and a palading, you'll sometimes get cleric of selune speech checks that are swapped out for paladin of selune"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-17,"the entire main series is like this game. in baldur's gate 1, there's entire storylines you can miss by not working with certain npcs. there are conflicts with npc companions you may never see based on your choices. it's truly an awesome, open ended series despite having a very much present main storyline."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,my favourite part was when bizly said its baldin time. and stole all our hair
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,"another banger by bebo bizlychannel. it's genuinely jawdropping that a game like bg3 exists. it perfectly catches the vibe of dnd in videogame form. like going from an intense conflict between tieflings and druids, to talking to an ox that is... rather odd, to say the least. the game is so good that i'm legit scared to touch it again, cause i know that once i pick it up, i won't be able to play anything else for the next weeks. also, this goes without saying, but this video was fantastic as always. i genuinely think you are getting close to becoming one of my favourite youtubers. seeing a new bebo upload never fails to spark joy and hype. keep up the good work!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,baldurs gate 3 is not only the rpg of the year. the game of the year. it is the rpg game of all time. not an ounce of wasted potential. just above and beyond what an rpg is. looking forward to what larian has to offer in the coming years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,it took me a little while to figure out why your videos have resonated so much with me. i feel like with internet discourse everything is so damn negative it's nice to see a creator put energy and passion into talking about things they love and enjoy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,it's like if nakeyjakey was in a frat house
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-28,how this guy doesnt have more subs is crazy to me. these are some of the best reviews ive seen in a long time

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-24,"this game is boring and tiresome. after act 2, i've had enough. i do not understand all the hype surrounding this game. i believe it is so beloved because there have been no good opponents recently. game 510, maybe 610 for act 1."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"i wish i could subscribe a thousand times, every video you drop is oops another banger"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"i spent two full hours building my character bard gang rise up! and my girlfriend was picking on me for it. when you hit finish and it brings up a second character to build we both bust out laughing. it was unintentionally the funniest gaming moment we've had in a very long time. honestly, this game has given us a lot of best moments so far. love it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,astarion turned me down and said ew. i haven't been that devastated at a rejection since high school.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,as a fan of baldur's gate 1 and 2 i just want to say how much i appreciate the originals soundtrack usage.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,"as a musician, of course i went bard. turns out that bards are f'ing amazing in this game. i actually played it as a joke, because i wanted my friend to have to carry the weight. i kept joking around about how he should head off into the heat of the battle, and i'd compose a song about how he's protecting me while i compose my song. but then i started getting all these crazy spells, and started spitting curses at our enemies, making them miss in battle, and bards are not like i remember them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,i could double my movement if we'd start moving got a pretty good chuckle out of me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,astarion is so much more deep and nuanced than people give him credit for.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"218 the first 590 minutes in my case it took all day don't feel bad. i know 5e like the back of my hand, i made my boyfriend play both the original baldur's gate games before the third one released which i played like a billion times myself already and i still took at least an hour in the character creator, probably longer, because every detail must be perfect... and that's with the advantage of having played early access, and already knowing pretty well that i wanted to be a lyreplaying duergar bardarchfey warlock with free invisibility for a long time. but hey, if you're gonna spend hundreds of hours with a character, you want to love it! no shame in that."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-27,"hello, this is the actor that portrays gnomer simpson in this video. i want to expose the horrific working conditions and attitudes that i was forced to endure while helping to make this video a reality. i signed onto the project under the assumption that gnomer simpson would be the protagonist of a narrative about overcoming adversity and slightly tall ledges as i am god and very cool but upon release of the final product it was revealed to me that i had been working under false pretenses. after the release of this video i was appalled to find that the gnomes presented in this video were treated as comedic props thrown from windmills or detonated for laughs, he unfairly platformed racist subgroups while also promoting harmful gnome stereotypes, and worst of all, i was only paid sag scale. most of my contributions were cut from the final product, especially my portion where i exposed max0r's financial ties to the drowabsolute water filtration industry, or the real sex scenes involving members of tentacle acres and bears. of the nearly 700 hours i spent on set, over half of them were spent in a stretcher as fellow actor reece spent the majority of his offcamera time piledriving my 30 pound body into raw concrete for sport and using me as a substitute hammer and discus for olympic training. despite my valuable contributions to this video, i remain uncredited and unrecognized, both figuratively and literally sold short for the sake of fastmoving entertainment for fickle masses who want their base impulses appealed to. it does not have to be this way, however. it is my hope, that at the very least this message inspires some contemplation in the viewing audience, who deserve to see different perspectives, especially those closer to the floor, and that one day we may be able to overcome this prejudice and defeat gnomophobia. in short, max only cares about the money and hates his friends."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-23,931 is the best part of the video. i've never actually heard max0r break character before.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-28,"1033 i feel it neccessary to point out that mizora is not in fact a demon, but a devil. that is infact a huge diffrence seeing as the blood war which is occasionaly mentioned, is a conflict between the demons and the devils, who had the unfortunate geographical error of being neighbors. in other words calling a devil a demon is presumably highly offensive and calling a demon a devil is also a bad idea because you are giving away your location."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-27,watching maxor's videos is basically injecting yourself with hyperstimulants thats gives endless dopamine. the best part is that you forget a lot of what was on screen making his videos infinitely rewatchable with always something new to discover. loved the video btw.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-12,"when done talking to khaga in the grove for the first time go into the room nearest her, at the back is a little semi secret alcove with a chest. in the chest is a letter and a book, the letter points you down to the beach where you obtain the incriminating evidence reading the book gives a sage background iirc a point of inspiration. so a wee bit more experience."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,"3 more secrets you can save the 4 npc's with the mask in the hag's lair. you need to pass without beeing detected or with a mask and protection against good and evil spell to resist the charm. then, you have to kill the hag. if you let her go, even with successful persuasionintimidation. they will attack you after the dialog. however, only the halfling will show up in act 3 no matter what you do. you can talk to the frog north of the swamp after the hag is dead for a reward nothing special, just loot 1 very rare interaction can happen with the drows petrified near the spectator. if you kill dhourn and the spectator, the others drows will not attack you. since they don't have dhourn to lead them and are no longer charmed, they will go peacefully. you don't have a special reward, just a dialog that probably 99.9 of players didn't hear."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-25,"if you use shadowheart to bless your party on the nautiloid before you start the encounter, you can refresh using the machine and start the encounter with a much easier chance to make zhalk drop his weapon. also, make sure to use dash before going through the door. you'll start the encounter with a ton of extra movement and still have your action to do things."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-14,"if you want to save kahga and have her side with you against the shadow druids you can also first read the plaques inside the druids grove, there are several inside and outside they just grant a new dialog option when you persuade kahga which i like"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-13,"for kagha in the druid grove you can find kaghas chest, which gives you the quest to go to the tree in the swamp. of course you have to be in stealth and lockpick it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-12,"450 for this area there is a key to open the door down near where you find karlach, and your character will even make a comment i wonder what this is for when you pick it up. also the only one of those traps you actually need to disable is the pressure plate in the back room, as without that pressure plate going off, none of the gas vents from the front area will go off. also to open the back room you dont have to have people sit on the chairs, you just have to put a vase on both chairs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,on the way to recruit karlach there is a corpse that looks like he was tossedfell off the cliffside that the tollhouse is on. he has the key for the lockpick proof door near his body.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-22,there are so many ways to do even the smallest thing in bg3 with so many different outcomes. doing a replay now and appreciate this list.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-12,"625 also with khaga if you are playing as a druid and convince her to side against the shadowdruids, you will be given a staff by her and the title of faithwarden. and while it doesnt really do anything outside of being able to tell jaheira when she has you in her vines that she should let you go because you are faithwarden, i still think its fun for role play purposes. i think if there was more druids in act 3 then being faithwarden would have been more meaningful, but the only druid i have seen in act 3 is the dragonborn praying to chauntea to heal the tree."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-05,"you dont have to kill pandirna to get the chest. just crouch next to the chest, behind pandirnas shoulder, pick up the chest, loot it in your inventory, then place the chest back behind her. she doesnt see any of it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,"tutorial zone you can use the chest to block the cambions from entering. the ai will try attacking it, but as it's sturdy nothing will happen. crypt use the shortcut to trigger all npcs into a stack next to the oil barrel. enter normally for a big burst start into the fight to make it easier. tyr outside halfway to karlachs location is a corpse, loot it for the key so you don't have to break down any doors. kagha just loot her chest behind the bookcase and read the book and note. that way you don't need to pass a perception check and just can do the fight, steal the note and confront her. extras behind the harpies is a chest. continue the path and youll find the nest with a ring for colour spray after a jumping puzzle. requires either a higher strength character or misty step to access or the githyanki jump. pass to the right on the way back and there is another jump puzzle for a chest to dig out. next to the idol of silvanus is a chest hidden on one of the stone passages, requires misty step to access. the key is in the birds nest beneath it, but requires to be stolen. down to the beach is a bear with a small jump to reach another chest. tieflings the cupboard can be easily accessed after the tieflings left. basically the whole area is free loot."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,"lol, you don't need to pickpocket the druid. just talk to him, he will tell you to bring halsim back after you do that, he will give it to you as reward."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-05,"the stash below the fake paladins... there is a burrow behind the building that leafs to the concealed rooms. send someone in there. then when you open the trapdoor to the other room, the locked doors open. i did it today using corinna the squirrel from a mod, and it worked beautifully!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,510  you can just put a vase in each seat. no need for a party member to occupy the throneswitch contraption.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,"455 pretty sure you can find the key to that tollhouse vaultdoor at the base of the cliff underneath the tollhouse near the river and near to where you pick up karlach. it's a bit hidden iirc and i'm not sure if you need to pass a perception check to spot it  but i've always been able to grab it so it can't be a very high check if there is one. while you're there, grab the smuggler's ring which is loot on a skeleton that's kinda hidden inside a bush down there by the river. it's strictly a swapin item as it'll lower your cha by 1, but it'll give you 2 on stealth and sleight of hand  in combination with gloves of thievery, this makes lockpickingdisarming traps a lot safer for nonrogue characters. also since i've just discovered it for the first time after 7 or so playthroughs use persuasion or deception on the bird in the grove who is busy rearranging his nest he's close to the sleeping bear in the area with the idol. then you can pick up a single piece of gold and, more importantly, the shiny key from the nest without it counting as theft. that key opens the aptly named shiny chest that sits on a bunch of pillars near the bird's nest. you have an easier time spotting the chest from above though it's one of those small ones like the one you find near sh's pod on the nautiloid. go to where arron is or near to the kart that sits between him and the overgrown portcullis. look down towards the inner area of the grove and you'll see the chest sitting on a platform on top of some pillars. you can probably jump down there using featherfall, but i used gale from above next to the kart to cast mage hand onto the platform. weirdly enough, the hand was strong enough to throw the chest right up to where gale was standing and i could simply open it up there. the loot isn't too spectacular, but it's pretty good for a low level party  i think i found a potion, an elixir, a magic scroll and over 80 gp in there. not too shabby."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"wait...i have a nonlethal passive...? kudos, i guess i did learn something."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,you can also pick up the two big chests from the very first room and set them in front of the door to the final room. this keeps the cambions from entering at all lol

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-13,"as far as the flask goes. i would highly recommend going to the hideout, get the quest, let rugan and ollie die, take the chest back unlocked. once you have given her the chest you get a rare crossbow named harold that inflicts bane for two turns. save, then pickpocket the chest off of her"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"for the toll collector vault, theres a hole behind it outside that a druid can access by being in a cat wild shape. but bashing the door in is probs easier lol."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-07,currently playing this and am about to go to moonrise which i heard is the last part of act 1 so thank you for this. i keep reading articles too and finding out things i missed too and having to backtrack to places which i actually dont mind i usually would in any other game. its amazing just how huge this game is already.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-08,you don't have to kill pandirna. just have astarion stannd behind her and go into hide to make sure you aren't in line of sight. then pick rhe lick and open the chest. once you have had the tieflingdruid party you can come back and ipen everything as pandirna will have left and most other places in the grove will be tiefling free.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-14,"at the druids emerald grove, there is animal statues forming a circle around the sacred idol, but the largest circle around it with doors etc is simply vertical big stones where you can jump on the top of it to find a chest on one of them. also, you can block the way of the 2 infernal soldiers in the big nautiloid fight by picking up the 3 containers ''cartilaginous chest'', this is how you can get the fire sword without dropping the weapon, just by killing him. in fact, i did get the fire sword this way the first time, because i didn't know about ''command'' and drop..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,"for voss, heat metal actually has a better chance of getting him to drop the sword. or you can use a level 5 beast master bear invisible and divination wizard for up to like... 80 chance with advantage i think. i know it's crazy high though"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,that area near where you meet astarion on the beach never got that right probably because i got thrown by being denied the ability to throw it even with 21 strength. have to try moving it like a crate i guess.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-20,what armor mod are you using?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,337 you can also lead her outside with music if you're a bard
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,that chest in the basement that leads to the infernal iron has a ladder to it. the chest on the ground is trapped though so that might have destroyed the ladder.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i cant believe that i knew all but the rat.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-19,"you don't have to kill padirna, if you have a cleric with the restoration spell you'll be fine"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-02,i do not know why all the players want to save the musican when you are the dark urge
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-13,"lmao the blacksmith chest has a ladder, just don't fail the passive perception for the trap next time 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the game explicitly says that any source of light will help against the shadows, but nothing other than the special lanterns will keep it away forever. so, i just did what i naturally thought was right shadowheart hold the blood of lathander, cast daylight on karlach's weapon, and cast light on astarion's weapon and mine. we were so bright it completely ruined the entire mood of every cutscene in hilarious ways. when we first met the harpers, they were peering around trying to spot us behind a tree, when we were a walking nova of light then they were nervously looking around for the shadow beasts when i could see them all perfectly fine. i'm sure the scene was meant to be dark and moody and scary, but everything was brighter than midday and the entire effect was hilariously ruined."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"just a reminder to always click next to your companion when you throw healing potions. otherwise you can actually kill them with it. trust me, i've done the testing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"pick up every backpack. pick up pouches too. i put all the vendor trash in one backpack. all the potions, arrows, and aoe throwables in a pouch, although this requires you to manually stack items, so these may be best left in the open inventory. also, odd bits of items i want to keep on hand go into a third bag. if the bag of vendor trash gets too heavy, just send it to camp and start filling up a new one. rinse and repeat until you get to a vendor. a trip or two to camp to fetch all the bags and you're golden."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-14,"something else i don't remember seeing a lot of people talking about is that throwing potions has a small aoe. if you huddle your party very, very closely together and throw potions on the ground in the middle of them, one potion can heal all 4 characters. this is especially useful early game where you don't have a lot of spells and you're being given basic health potions out the wazoo. it can be useful late game as well since you can forgo memorizing healing spells in lieu of buffs or damage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"there's another big thing about turnbased mode. if you just walk around and initiate combat. for example you shoot an arrow at someone, you will have used your action on this attack, so when your initiative comes up, that specific character will not be able to use another action this round. while if you use turnbased mode and then initiate the combat by attacking, you will still have your full action when your turn comes up in the initiative order. so when you are about to initiate combat, turnbased mode essentially gives you a free action."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"you can start digging even if you didn't pass the survival check. just rightclick on the shovel and point around. or, if you remember from your previous walkthrough, then you click, where to dig."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"additional tip to the small holes tip for the ones you listed for cat and gaseous form, you can also use mage hand to get through them. i don't know how often this is useful, however in the underdark there's a mage's tower that has a locked door at the bottom of it, and a burrow hole nearby. using mage hand allows you to move the hand into the hole and use the lever by the door to open it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,"short, sweet, to the point, no messing around, and no spoilers!? now that's how you make a stellar guide video! amazing job!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"if you use that secret trade window with volo, you can buy a magic ring from him which gives the bless spell to anyone that the character wearing it heals. this includes throwing healing potions."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"357 minor correction no loot is destroyed when you break a chest. however, traps triggered by this action may and do destroy it. additionally, some nonchest containers loose their content when destroyed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,your tip on marking vendors on the map was excellent. thank you. i dont think anyone else has mentioned that tip before.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"my favorite interaction is that if you take the dual weilder feat on a caster, you can have them equip two of the cool quarterstaves you can find and use the bonuses of each. it makes it one of the best feats in the game for casters just for that reason."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,"can we point out, that there is no long intro and only necessary text for each section? this video is golden, thank you. content and how the video is done is 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"at 340 you are talking about saving thief tools by smashing things. thief tools and trap tools are only consumed when you fail at lock pickingdisarming, a other little tip. great video."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-22,"that tip about using disguise self to utilize the burrow holes is amazing. it doesn't work that way in dd, its just a visual illusion and even has restrictions on how much taller or shorter you can make yourself. i'd never have considered it was more of a transmutation in bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"fyi the vendor price modifier is not cha at least not directly, it is the persuasion skill which is based on cha. use the character with the highest persuasion skill. due to the many ways this skill could be boosted, like expertise, you might find that your best commerce character bard or pally with high persuasion is not the character with the highest cha score sorc or warlock who ignored persuasion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,quick note you cant always go back to your camp. if the area youre in had the minimap highlighted red then its an area that locks you out of going to camp and fast travel. usually hostile story points.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"great video, i actually learned a lot. one remark in regards to jumping you can jump past enemies without triggering attack of opportunity, but if you are already in range of it, jumping away will still trigger the attack."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,do not leave attacks of opportunity on automatic. for example when undeads flee after turn undead you might not want them to drop the turned status by the mage automatically hitting them for 1 damage.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"actual, genuine, useful and uncommon knowledge for most of these points! thank you! most videos like these will be like you can swap party members at camp or using your map to find quests can be very helpful but shipping bodies to camp!? disguising then using reduce spell to go into small entries? hell yah"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"because a few people have mentioned it, the game warns you if you have too few supplies in your inventory when you go to rest, but when you actually go click the campfire they will show up!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,you can progress camp encounters without consuming camp supplies by having partial rests.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"you can automatically collect all alchemycamping supplies in your inventory by dragging either the camp supply bagalchemy bag off your inventorydrop it to another character inv.then drop it back down to your inv. as soon as you drop it back, it sucks in all the items in the appropriate bag."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"here's a tip drop your healing potions for alternative ways to use them. what do i mean by this? place a healing potion by someone's feet and then break it. get your placement right and they'll heal off it when you do. but why bother? because now you can dual wield and break it with your bonus action, allowing anyone to heal other's with a bonus action. or maybe you don't need all of your eldritch blasts to land on a baddie and can spare one for a heal. maybe all three of your friends are dying but you can't sacrifice any potential damage, well they'll survive a fireball, but those potions at their feet won't. extra hint warning with dropping potions, npcs are aware that they are there. an allied npc will run up and lob a potion at anyone who needs it, which can turn even a weak escort quest npc into something useful. obviously any hostiles around can steal whatever you drop as well, so be careful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"most op trick here, some npcs grant an aura, you can kill them and carry their bodies to gain and stack said auras."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"mage hand can also go into burrow holes, but it wears off quickly, so it's best to use it in turn based mode."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"you can give away junk cups, spoons, forks etc. in bulk to traders via barter you want to use regularly to increase their attitude towards you. and you can give them in gold as a gift. it's around 68 gold for every point of attitude depending on level and persuasion. edit definitely level dependant so 68 when you're level 34 and it goes all the way up to level 12 where you're spending 45gp per attitude point so more worth doing at lower levels 600800 gold for 100 attitude and a 20 discount from that merchant. so if you hoard trinkets to sell  maybe don't and use them to boost your attitude with a trader you want to use all the time. and if you do spend gold to buy their favour  you can always pickpocket the merchant and get your money back."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,"shove is even more useful if you consider that you can use it on allies, too. you can shove an ally out of an enemie's melee range or shove them out of damaging aoes. additionally, if you have a very strong character, you can probably shove a low strength ally further than they can jump. for example, a 21 str barbarian can shove an 8 str rogue over a chasm the rogue couldn't jump. this can be very important for positioning in fights or using specific shortcuts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-01,"charisma and attitude checks against vendors. i had no idea. also, the carrying boxes around to get to higher spots is genius"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"about changing spells. some classes, like druid, wizards and clerics can change their prepared spells at any time outside of combat. but for others like bard and sorcerer, your spell list is limited to those you chose during level up. those classes offer you to swap one spell every time you level."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"another tip for ranged characters even if you do not want to use your melee set, it makes sense to have a shield equipped there. you may only run around with your crossbow, but the shield still gives you 2 to your ac. or even more if you equip better shields."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,"i am glad for the karmic dice enlightnment, i rummaged through the settings on my first playthrough and saw that option leaving it on as i thought all it'd do was prevent losing streaks in a way it does but it also hurts you a ton in the long run, and it gets most frustrating when you know the results will be bad after a successfull one while also murdering many advantages from your skill points. that will make rolling the dice much more better now and probably combat will be a little less annoying"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,"note daylight on your items is a nice way to deal with low visibility in act 2, however, note that extra casts of daylight will make everything way too bright and actually lower your visibility as a player. learned this the hard way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,from experience i find it's best to have all reactions on 'ask' setting because there are niche moments where you may not want to use even an opportunity attack for example.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"326 it's always especially useful if they are npcs you're going to fight because they'll no longer be able to use the items you bought from them in combat such as throwing objects, drinking potions, etc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-01,"charisma and attitude checks against vendors. i had no idea. also, the carrying boxes around the get to higher spots is genius"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"1. you can drag and drop camp supplies empty bag to collect camp supplies and keys. 2. if there is grease on the floor or a barrel, the explosion damage depends on how it was ignited. a firebolt on grease deals less damage 10 damage to all enemies, a fireball on grease will deal 30 damage"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"was worried this was just clickbait and obvious stuff, but it's genuinely really useful and most of these i didn't know or wasn't sure about, even as someone about to finish their second playthrough on tactician. you can get by without these but my god, is it nice knowing them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,i'm 80 hours in and this video just made me realize gale could have been using a shield the whole time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the long rest thing is quite funny to mention. i had basically no story progression on my characters in act 1 on tactician, because i rarely needed any long rests so i met the dream visitor just shortly before i went on to act 2 xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,my choice for breaking doors and such is eldritch blast. may not break things in one go but when you're not in combat it doesn't really matter.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"man, this is the first tips video i find useful. really well made and you seem like a really good producer. so you got a like and a follow, keep up the good work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"important tip that you missed. during dialogs with a potential enemybosses, sometimes, game allows you to chose other party members and reposition them before the fight starts e.g. get your melee closer to emenies or get the high ground for rangedcasters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"related to the tip at 128, on controller you can select multiple items using r2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"just gonna hop in and add to the long rest point you can take long rests without using camp supplies, that way no resources are consumed. you don't get any spells slots back but the stories will progress and events are moved forward."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"for the light problem i recommend using the light cantrip on a physical attacker, so they shed light, that way they can attack normally and doesnt cost either a hand or an action lasts until long rest too"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the rationale i have against karmic dice, is that most enemies have multiple actions in a turn. this means they are frequently rolling many more diverse than we are, resulting in better benefits for them than us. it may be minuscule, but it's very nice when they start missing all those extras"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,great tips. i just figured out the corpse in a box for animating after i beat balanced. you can drop things on the ground like healing potions and use mage hand to burn its actions throwing them for heals. also if you have characters close together and throw the potion between them just right it affects both. potion of speed in the middle of your characters and suddenly you have haste on everyone for a single potion. takes planning. larian is infamous for barrelmancy. hoard explosive barrels in camp chest. go to a potential fight that is currently neutral. stand next to your target. pop in  out of camp and surround them with say oil barrels. then to start the fight firebolt a barrel and a chain reaction of death will end the fight quickly.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"as a note about the karmic dice setting. for enemies it makes their rolls more favorable too which on most characters you won't noticed it that much. but in particular on magic characters, and on high ac characters you will notice it a ton. ever wonder why those enemy tanks with swords and shields will fold like paper when you have karmic dice on? its because it also affects ac rolls, meaning your 24 ac super tank will get hit just as often as your 14 ac paper boy. as for the magic users, instead rolling your characters attack against an enemies ac meaning karmic dice is in your favor the enemy will instead roll their stat mentioned on the spell for a save, meaning the karmic dice is in their favor. this is why all your spells are missing. after turning karmic dice off, the rolls are notably far more varied and more importantly, both mine and the enemies high ac tanks will actually avoid hits like they should. honestly karmic dice should not be on by default at all. edit oh yeah should also be noted that karmic dice, despite sounding like it should sway rolls both positively and negatively, will only sway them positively. seriously if you are up against a high ac super tank or have one in your party turn karmic dice off and watch how long it takes to actually hit them. which is the way it should be, why be a tank if you are gonna get hit just as often as a 10 ac wizard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-18,"i'm on my 3rd play through, and i did not know you can make statutes fall on enemies by destroying them. this game always got something to surprise me with."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,i've started 4 playthroughs already. the farthest i've gotten so far is about 13 of the way through act 2. and there were still several things in here i haven't discovered yet. great tips!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,another trick i found out is taking chest out in the world and sending them to camp. you can get infinite extra storage space in your travel chest which you can organize items into so you can hoard everything.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-12,"the biggest one i figured near the end of my first playthrough is using your hireling as a transmutation wizard with stacked int, wisdom and medecine proficiency. it can be any of then since the default wizard hireling doesn't come with medecine proficiency so you have to respec him anyway. this has multiple benefits  1  you can use him as your alchemist npc which will make the feature significantly more useful. you'll be swimming in more potions, potions and elixirs than you'll know what to do with if you're very diligent with picking up stuff on the ground. even if you're not big on using consumables, you can sell all that stuff for a ton of gold. some npcs also sell a ton of alchemy mats that you can flip for a profit this way. 2  it makes exploration a lot easier. just stack him with jump, fly, dimension door, knock enlargereduce etc. dungeon crawling becomes a breeze. make sure to give him the dungeon delver feat for good measures. yes the character gonna suck hard in combat but most random encounters are pretty trivial with just 3 party member even on tactician so you can just have him cast invis on himself, or keep him backline just firing scorching rays. obviously once you're done exploring a dungeon go to camp and replace him with a good combat companion before any boss fights or long encounters. but yeah this made what i considered a completely useless feature into a really useful one for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-11,"one of the best bg3 videos. actually helpful, and quite entertaining."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"that gear interface was actually a pretty recent addition so it's no surprise that you just found out about it. i believe larian added this during their latest update patch.  also, loot is never destroyed when you break a chest. loot can only get destroyed by secondary effects like traps going off in their vicinity. so your barbarian can happily smash chests to kindling with their battleaxe and no loot would be lost. good tip on sending corpses to camp though. the only reason i didn't make a necromancer was because of needing corpses but this definitely makes things a whole lot easier. so on my next playthrough i'm definitely going to send all corpses to camp for a nice selection of undead servants! 1"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-07,i've watched a lot of bg3 content in the last 24 hours for useful info and this video is the only one that hasn't recycled the same 10 dumb tips in a 10 minute video. this is the one. thanks.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,that zombie in the trunk tip is so clever!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"415 i can anecdotally agree with this after turning them off i find my team getting out of fights on full hp, because almost every hit is either a miss, or critical strike in which means they rolled nat20 and there's nothing i could do. it just makes sense too a karmic dice doesn't just mean that you have a loaded dice and it will roll 10 results more often than 10, what it does is it will try to balance the 'failed' and 'winning' rolls for both you and everyone else. if anything when you have a competent crew and use them to do the things they're actually good at, turning off the karmic dice will just be an improvement, because the karmic dice will literally try to make astarion fail at lockpicking, because he succeeded 20 times in a row already so he needs to fail now... but oh no he has a 15 to dice rolls, and an advantage, and the lock strength is just 10 so... fuck you, 4 nat1's in a row. there is an actual video where that happened, purely mathematically rolling 4 nat1's in a row has a probability of 0.00000625 if all your character have very high ac my shadowheart for example has an ac for 24 before any spells, then the enemy will need to roll a very high roll to hit, and without karmic dice a chance of 'winning' is 5the number of 'winning' rolls, so if my ac is 24, and they only have 7 to hit chance then they need to score at least 17 on a dice roll to hit, which translates to 20 hit chance. but with karmic dice the game will try to balance 'fails' and 'wins' and so it'll make those numbers that will actually result in a 'win' score more often to bring that 20 closer to at least 50."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-19,"thank you so much for making this!! a lot of these i had no clue about or just a vague idea without the ideal understanding to apply. i just got the game last week and the learning curve is definitely a bit more steep than most games i've played, but it's folks like you making videos like these that make it more attainable. kudos!! the footage you chose with your voice over was super helpful in illustrating your points so thanks so much for taking that extra time selecting that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"255 i really dislike the fact that u can use disguise self to fit smaller openings, when it's an illusion... essentially makes disguise self a humanoid version of wild shapes, and that's pretty op for what it is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-02,marking the math for vendors is so genius ive never thought of that. thank you sir.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,i cannot believe karmic dice is enabled by default and never mentioned... now i understand how my spellcasters kept missing on easy enemies even with advantage... i did an entire playthrough with no idea the option even existed!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,"the problem with karmic dice is that it trains you to think that what you have previously rolled will affect what you are going to roll. it reinforces the gambler's fallacy. so, what this really means is you can no longer believe the difficulty class meaning, if it says the difficulty class is 10, which is slightly better than 5050, it actually is not, because it depends on what you previously have rolled. this is bad on so many levels, but most importantly it's bad because it fundamentally fools you into believing that you are gaming the system when in fact you are not. it is far better to trust the rng and the natural difficulty class. i could write a whole article on this, but i'm too lazy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"you can use the throwing of health potions out of combat to heal more than one character. you can get all 4 if you move them close together. it works for some others like invisibility, too."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,note you still need trap tools and soh proficiency due to traps. if you destroy a trapped chest you detonate it and potentially destroy the loot within. this can lock you out of some quest. even if you don't want to lockpick or pickpocket you still need slight of hand proficiency.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"with the reactions one, i'd actually advise the opposite. always have reactions ask before using. you only get one reaction per round and dont want it wasted on one thing if theres a better option like using oppertunity attack on a high hp target if you might get to use it on a lower hp target, or casting counterspell on a weak damage spell instead of a cc effect spell that'll wreck your party. its wise to have it always ask so you get to decide on whats important enoughto use a reaction on"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"something about jumping it goes off your character's strength and i'm pretty sure it's a bonus action. i use it frequently because you can essentially 'force' a character to jump a distance, and get right next to an enemy, they couldn't normally reach with normal movement range in combat."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,"you mentioned a barbarian dive bombing from 30 ft. it reminded me of a clip i saw of a druid shaped as an owlbear, being enlarged, and jumping into the forget robot for a 1shot impact kill."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"the sleep spell is only limited by hp. some vendors have low hp. 5 finger discount is part of the game. astarion has like 17 sleight of hand with the right gear and advantage on dex checks. failing on a sleeping target only costs you one turn. in other words with an average cost of one lvl 1 spell slot i can steal even the most expensive stuff, like magic armors that cost several thousand."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-13,"pretty good to hear that i haven't searched anything about this game yet and i'm still on the first chapter, and i already know all of these tips, looks like my experience breaking these kind of games made it easier to learn those things lmao i also found out that u could use the 2 captive minds you find in the ship to make them float, and then place a box over them to jump over it without needing many boxes, you just need to stack the 2 captive minds, then right click the lowest one and throw it near you, the one on top will just ignore gravity and keep floating. you can repeat this as long you can reach it, and then just place a box over it to be able to jump"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"you can use shove also to wake up a sleeping ally, learned it by watching the enemies do it lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-29,to add to the first tip on supplies to be sent back to camp. carry two camp supply bags. when it starts to get heavy send the whole bag with all the supplies in it at once. then next time you go to camp for a long rest empty the bags you sent back and take the empty ones back out with you. just makes the process faster saves a bit of time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"one thing i learned the hard way when a certain beefboy, a certain hunk decides to join your party in act 2, you are not able to leave the area anymore without him leaving your party forever. at that point you are not allowed to backtrack into act 1 content anymore"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"this might be a little different, but if you install mods that add any items to the game. do not uninstall them or it will break the run. since the game does not replace missing items with empty slots, it will cause errors. i think someone said that if you drop and destroy the items it should be fine, but needs to be tested."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"here are some i found out myself. if u press h in alchemy there is a button that let you extract all the ingredients this will unlock new recipes and lower you alchemy pouch. if ur characters are covered in blood you can throw water onto them to get clean. if ur characters fail survival check during exploration, there's a probably a chest on the spot. you can manually click on shovel and dig up. you can steal money from the undead man who reset your skills at camp back and he wont mind. ritual spell outside combats can be use limitlessly. friends cantrip give you advantage in persuasion checks, highly recommend to have."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,the game was originally supposed to be narrated in the first person. people didn't like it and they ditched it really early on. there's quite a lot of dialogue recorded for all the tavs and origin characters.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-05,"your wife did great. she did better than i did to begin with. i bought bg3 on day one and after a day of getting beat down and not understanding the game i quit until about two weeks ago and gave it another try. i am now at ketheric thorm act2 and back to being beat down, but this time i'm having fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-22,"when a new player joins my campaign, i tell them to think of a character entirely based on aesthetic. it's impossible to expect someone to parse the countless small but important decisions they make when actually making a character sheet. it's much easier to start from vibes, then steadily learn the mechanics after. something like i want to be a thief prowling through the night, stealing from the rich to give to the poor! is one of the sweetest things to hear from a new player."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-28,"927 the answer is simple. faces made with sliders are almost impossible to animate properly. you can notice that basically all games with sliders for character creation have little to no face animations. as opposed to bg3, where your character's face and expressions take the central stage in basically every conversation."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-22,love this! im so new to rpgs myself. found it funny when you mentioned her playing disco elysium my favorite game and then trying baldurs gate later on. it took me so long to figure out how to play bg3 as a nonegamer. but it was worth it and now im obsessed. anyway very sweet way to bond.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"my mom, who hasn't played many intensive games, picked up bg3 a little while after released, and now has more hours in it then me and everyone else i know who plays it put together. it took her many, many hours to understand how the game worked and all the options at her disposal, but now she's probably better at it than me. also, the floor markings from the smokepowder satchel are where it would spread to when it broke. the explosive radius isn't shown, and extends a meter or two from the powder in every direction. the throwing animation doesn't actually move your hitbox."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"i think the biggest take away from that not all media can be made for everyone. baldur's gate is the most approachable crpg but it's still a crpg, very mechanical hevy, very choiceheavy, and usually very violent heavy. it's not a genre most inside vider games play. but that's fine."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-25,this series is easily the one i keep coming back to the most on youtube. i've watched the original gaming for a nongamer like 5 times. there's something just so cozy but so polished about it that i really like
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"about the dungeon ruin doors it's not that her character couldn't break doors, it's just that those two doors are one of the very few doors that cannot be broken. in general doors that lead to other sections via loading screens are not breakable due to system implementations."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-04,"512 that is a genius idea! i think this could be interesting if they had something along the lines of a class test drive feature that gives you a mini tutorial fight to try say a level 5 version of whatever class your interested in, not only would that give newer players a basic rundown of the combat but also allow them to try out different classes and mechanics to see what they like and dont like, what works for them and doesnt, if they did the trial at level 5 as well arguably the biggest power spike, also not such a big leap in the levels to the point it ruins the excitement of new abilities to try it would give newer players an idea of how the classes would work later down the road and what they could expect from said classes in terms of movement, range, damage output, resistance and health"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,"i will say as a woman who grew up playing video games i never really understood how hard it was to learn video games until i played civilization 6, crusader kings 3 and planet zoo. the kind of system knowledge required to feel confident while playing those games is immense and for some reason my knowledge of most video game genres just didnt transfer over very well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"i believe the pick something that looks cool strategy is a great option for a game where you have zero clue what any of the character creation options mean. i've done that, and then changed or restarted when i felt i knew what i'd actually want"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-24,i love this series so much. shoutout to your wife for being so patient and such a good sport with these incredibly complicated games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,nothing is quite as miserable as watching someone you care about not understand how to interact with a medium that means so much to you. ive had games destroy me and there are people i care about who will never be able to empathize with why.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,swapping this to coop was a really good idea. it shows another side of the experiment and it really brings out the best of dnd.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"how sick is this! you have a chill video with chapters following your wife's progress and how it's for her to play through the game in total single player, until you switch to coop and end it on a high note...and then comes the sponsor video. i can't tell you what a breath of fresh air this is and you are the only one i've seen do it, please continue  there are surprisingly few creators that value their viewers patience with having a tame commercial at the start or right in the middle of their video. totally grinds my gears."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-02,"i think she would be most interested in the mass effect trilogy it has the middle ground you're looking for. voiced protagonist combination of realtime and turnbased gameplay not many gross things approachable in both story and mechanics she will actually like the characters less fantasy, more grounded with extra space"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-03,"honestly and unironically, the objectively best way to choose a class in dd including baldur's gate is to just go with whatever sounds coolest lorewise or what you're in the mood to play. trying to minmax everything ruins the fun. i love minmaxing strategy games, but dd isn't a strategy game, it's a roleplaying game, so you should base your decisions on whatever's best for roleplaying, not for strategy. the difference between a wizard, sorceror, and warlock is how they achieved their power, to hell with gameplay mechanics! liking a class' outfit is still a better reason to choose one over another than trying to make your character as powerful as possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-27,"the combat in bg3 is something i have grown to love. turn based combat is the generally the reason i wont play a game because i just sort of jump around and button smash, or avoid combat all together, and that cant be done in those types of games. i started hesitantly when i played bg3, but then as i got used to the mechanics of it and the strategy, i started to really enjoy it. now its one of my favorite parts of the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"she threw the smokepowder satchel atop a firewine barrel, so she probably got hit with both. didn't realize exactly how much dd got me through a the character creator, b the nonspecific and evermoving target of the tadpools, c dealing with the party characters. i kinda shrugged when astarion held us at knifepoint, because of course the emo rogue was going to try to stab us before becoming best friends. it's just how angsty rogues say 'hello'... i wonder what her playthrough would've been like if she'd found karlach..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"this is me and my wife's favorite video series! it does make her feel better about her gaming skills which have improved exponentially over the 6 years we've been together. she started out with lego indiana jones, and now she has conquered the witcher 3! now we're about to have our first child and i can't wait to help them with their own journey!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-18,"900 agree with a lot of these points so far! ive always been a dd fan but havent had any opportunities to play, and this particular type of gameplay was entirely new to me, so choosing spells and classes with little context was difficult. i was also really surprised with the lack of face customization! like your wife i really wanted to make myself but had a really hard time. have t delved into to mods yet but ive heard they provide a ton more options."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-06,"it's funny that she listens to the game. for me, if someone in a game tells me not to do something, i will find every possible way to do that thing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-28,"it's so funny to me that while playing bg3, removing the parasite clearly felt like a mcguffin plot device designed to move the story forward while you enjoy the game, but your wife very much viewed it as a singular task she had to accomplish"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,turn based strategy games often have a lot of details due to the mechanics of the game design. it can be difficult to sell that premise to someone who wasn't already eager about the genre to begin with.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,"2210 plus there's the whole thing of the protagonist is me! and trying to find enough voice actors or versatile enough voice actors to not only say all the lines, but to do so with enough voices to be satisfying. keep in mind that you criticized them earlier for having preset faces instead of sliders. the same issue would happen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"2945 she was standing in adjacent flammable material. so even though she was outside of the range it shows when throwing the item, it ignited the surrounding area"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-11,"i have a coop bg3 campaign with my wife. itspainful. she has difficulty with the controller, litany of buttons, and camera options. she enjoys dnd so i thought this would be a neat crossover. turns out she enjoys it best when she gets to pick what her character does and what actions it takes in combat, while i control the actual player functions. she has a paper dnd sheet for her character in front of her to remind her what spells, options, are available and thats it. seems to be more fun for her."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"on the note of overwhelming character creation stuff, i found that the game vampires the masquerade bloodlines did a really interesting thing for new, inexperienced players by instead of forcing them through the crunch of the full stat creation, giving them a personality quiz of sorts to help them make a character to their liking, though still with the option to change the stats if they decided differently"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,please don't put that in the video she says... in the video. i guess she failed that persuasion check.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"basic rundown for magic classes  clerics, druids, monks and rangers use the power of spirituality  paladins use the power of friendship  wizards use the power knowledge  warlocks use the power of edginess  bards and sorcerers use the power of sexiness"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-08,"i find 1322 really interesting because that is also something that i see in some of my dd games inexperienced players not realizing that what an npc says is not automatically true or good for them. and i do not only mean strictly lying npcs. lae'zel does not trust mindflayers, so anything to do with them must be bad and harmful, so better not interact with any of it. that is not the game or dm lying to the player, trying to convince them to not interact with something, but a real person with real believes stating their opinion. in dd the dm can slip out of character and tell the party that what an npc says might not be their own opinion. a game like bg3 can't really do that. of course following an npcs advice is not a bad thing or a wrong way to play, but i find the parallel really interesting"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"regarding 2152 there is another big reason as to why having spoken voice lines during conversations for the protagonist could have been cut, because originally origin characters did actually have voiced lines while playing them during dialoge scenes. that reason is projectability. fallout 4 is a great example. there is often a huge disconnect between what the player is doing and how the mc sounds in that game, especially regarding the search for his son. bg3 avoids that problem, but in return asks you to fill in how you would envision saying it. it requires more from the player for a potential bigger payoff, because i can was better project myself into the world, thanks to stuff like the protagonist not being voiced. that character is my vessel so i project onto it how i would react as that character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,2929 she wasn't in radice to be covered by the smoke but the explostion itself is a separate reaction from the fire
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"as fun as this series is, its kinda become clear that more than an inexperienced player, the lady you live with is an uninterested player. so many of her recurring struggles in these experiments seem to come from being incurious or unengaged by the media she is being asked to sit through. a new player who actually wants to be here and engage with the game is far more likely to push all the buttons and be self motivated to learn and explore, because theyre were selfmotivated enough to pick up a game themselves. i want more games to be more accessible to new players, but i dont think the solution to that is going to be the same as making them more accessible to people who do not want to play them in the first place. i hope this doesnt come off as insulting anyone involved, just something ive observed as this series goes on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,i propose that you do an inverse of this concept! raz should do one of his wife's hobbies but as a newbie! idk what his wife is into but it could be fun for a video!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-17,this is the single greatest experimentseries youtube has ever had the honour of hosting. thank you razbuten
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-28,"its crazy to me that older players hate games for hand holding, but like this lady, every person i try to get into games there first comment is idk what to do its not telling me a detailed to do list of objectives. kinda leaves game designers fumbling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"overwhelming character creation is that when introducing a new player to ttrpgs, i always just ask them to do whatever you think is cool. on request i sit down with them and walk through the character creation together and maybe point out some synergies or bad choices. i also have a house rule that while figuring things out, any change goes so that players don't overthink."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-18,im was so happy to see yall got to play with friends. i believe like any true dnd party if youre playing with people you know and like i think that is the peak experience of these types of games
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"me being the lady, a gamer and a huge dnd nerd was so extremely excited for the lord i live with slso a gamer to be introduced to my biggest hobby. and he was happy to have a walking manual right next to him. we took 2 hours creating a character because he wanted to understand all the mechanics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,waking up and having no clue what to do is kind of lore accurate
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-18,"i genuinely think she would have had a much better experience if you actually decided to tell her about certain things straight up and, guided her to wyll, karlach  gale. her opinion of the companions would be completely different if she had them instead."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-17,"what i found so fascinating about bg3 was that when i looked at people who play videogames all the time or even for a living, a lot of them got super overwhelmed with all the mechanics and had a hard time figuring everything out. meanwhile i, someone who rarely plays videogames whose complexity goes beyond stardew valley or point and click adventures, just breezed through all of that and could focus on story and combat approaches from the very start. simply because i live and breathe dnd and have been playing it for almost 10 years on a weekly basis now. goes to show how fantastic this is at turning a pen and paper rpg into a crpg."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"it's funny, being accustomed to crpgs  rtss  trpgs, i would never have imagined someone struggling, or rather preferring not to have to play their companions. but now that i see this video, it seems obvious to me. especially since, as you said, the game knows very well how to do it, since it often plays allied npcs. moreover, they sometimes perform incredible actions, i remember during my first run discovering the game, having a character down in an aoe, without healing and without potions, and if i used 'help,' he would fall again. the npc used 'shove' to get him out, and i felt stupid aha."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-28,550 this might not be the best answer but personally my approach to classes would be the same as what i do in dd which is to describe what they are in world rather than mechanically and have them make a choice off of what sounds interesting rather than what might be their favorite mechanically. that way even in a worst case scenario theyll at least have a character they might find cool.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"i love your wife calling you a nerd, and your quippy comeback. y'all are adorable."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"540 one gets their magic from studying and practice, one is born with it and it comes from their bloodline, and the other gets their magic by making a deal with some kind of powerful being"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-07,just under 5 mins in and hearing your wifes voice she sounds adorable and brings you so much joy in life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"about 13 minutes in and you mentioned about her passing by shadowheart, that isn't a problem like you pose it to be. shadowheart will almost always survive the nautilioid. there's just unique dialogue regarding whether or not you decided to help herand a little affinity boost if you did. that's the beauty of bg3 for me, you could play the game like a checklist but oftentimes even missing content is making you explore new content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"1326 then don't. it's fine! the way you said that made me laugh so much. i sat through an entire playthrough of elden ring with my friend who hasn't played too many games before, and i really felt like that was so relatable haha."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-30,700 that what sounded like how a killer would talk lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-04,"i am really sad lady missed out on meeting karlach, wyll and gale. they are so much more likable initially than laezel, shadowheart and astarion"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,liking having a clear task with freedom over the way a task can be done... sounds like you should have her try out some immersive sim games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-02,"this series really makes me feel more welcome as someone like your wife. i am so used to being called stupid for already knowing things that literally never come up in real life and technically make no sense to non gamers, and it's really nice to see you be able to take many steps back and acknowledge those mechanics ! i think the hardest thing in open world games is to decipher paths correctly. i did the entire act 1 without lazel because the path to her wasn't super obvious to me and i just skipped it. i also tried climbing that mountain like your wife did, for like 30 minutes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"630 i think the best way to help someone new find what class to play is to figure out what character fantasy they want to fulfill. if they've consumed a lot of fantasy media, that can certainly help i want to be like legolas  elf fighter with a bow, but asking what sort of playstyle they want in a sort of flowchart manner really helps. do you want to focus on using magic, using weapons, or a mix of both? if magic, do you want someone who has a wide variety of spells like a big toolbox wizard, bard or a small amount of spells, but can vary their usage sorc? if focusing on weapons, do you want someone who is an expert with all weapons but has fewer talents outside of combat fighter, someone who uses fewer weapons but can also has special abilities when they hit people monk, etc. i dm'd a dd 5e oneshot with my parents and this was how i helped them build a character. for bg3, where racial stat bonuses aren't a thing, i'd honestly tell a new player to 100 ignore racial differences and focus entirely on the aesthetics of what race they want to play. similarly, few classes get their subclass at level 1 only sorc, iirc, so it's kinda not worth it to even bring it up, unless its integral to developing the character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"i think the best way to make character creation fun is looking at it from a roleplaying perspective. do you want to shoot lightning bolts, use a one handed weapon with no shield and be really good at insight? you can do that without worrying if it is good or not. many people worry so much about minmaxing and here i am having a fighter wood elf who dual wields daggers and uses no armor because i rp as a blood fury from heroes of might and magic 5."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-07,"the easiest way to explain the difference between a sorcerer, wizard, and warlock is the kid with natural talent who doesn't have to study to get a's sorcerer. the kid who studies 247 to get a's wizard. the kid who pays someone else to give them the answers to get a's warlock."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-19,"600 i feel like this whole character creator part is just really bad coaching on your part, to be honest. the thing is... it doesn't matter. a new player doesn't actually need to make a complete educated decision during their first game and first time playing. all you need to do is say play what sounds fun. say that mages are smart, sorcerers gain their magic innately, and warlocks are less magical and gain magic powers from someone they made a deal with. no mechanics whatsoever. take default spells that are selected, and choose a race that looks cool. that's what you're supposed to do. it's only overwhelming if you're trying to make sure she's making the right choices, but this game does such a good job of letting you just play whatever sounds fun, there are so many ways to do it. so just ask what type of thing she wants to do, and do that, you know?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"slowly watching it through. just wanted to say that in regards to faces its because every face was 3d captured by larian to provide the best support for how voicelines should be delivered with what facial expressions, which they did started doing way back in divinity dragon commander, its a big reason why the cutscenes looks so amazing and realistic as from what i understand almost everything was recorded with facial trackers on. it does lead to the case of not having a ton of facial customization, and its pretty obvious that gnomes to dwarves to elves all have the same preset face to work around."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-31,"this is quite eye opening. my biggest problem with bg3 was always the fact that it was too trivial. solutions to every problem extremely plentiful to the point where during my entire first play through i only got close to losing a fight once despite playing on the hardest difficulty. now i see that it isn't really the game that's too easy, its just the fact that i know how games want me to think so well by now that i instantly know what will work and how to avoid putting myself in situations where i might be at a disadvantage"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"even though i suggested it, in hindsight bg3 isn't very beginner friendly so it probably wasn't a great suggestion. also it kind of makes sense that a game with so many options, just makes the few things you can't do, that much more frustrating."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,"as somebody who plays dd, i never really encountered any of the problems that the lady you live with did. character creation and role play was intuitive and the controls, while a little rough at first mouse and keyboard, quickly became the most natural sounding way to play this game. at the same time, i convinced my sibling, who, while still dabbling in games like stardew valley and playing dd occasionally, isn't really a big gamer, to pick up the game and try it out. they didn't know what half the stuff did and required a lot of guidance. at some point, i left them on their own for a bit, and they somehow instigated a civil war in the druid grove which i never knew was even possible and caused the death of wyll before recruiting him. we rewound time to before that happened, of course, but it amazes me that a player who doesn't know as much about this kind of game can not only have a different experience, which is expected, but also play through a different story. in some ways, bg3 is basically actual dd  you don't know anything when you start, and you're going to mess up a lot. but, when you're able to get past the steep plateau that starts the journey, you can enjoy one of the best experiences out there."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-30,"these have been excellent videos to watch over the years. this one especially is very cool, given on awesome and complex bg3 is in so many levels. thank you so much for the work and please me my special gratitude to the wife for joining in this adventure of subjecting herself to these games"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,she picked the dark urge and you didn't even mention it before she kicked the squirrel?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-21,wizard studies magic sorcerer inherits magic through bloodline warlock is given magic by a powerful entity there you go.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-02,"glad the algorithm suggested your channel. such an interesting concept, im really enjoying this. seeing games from a non gamers perspective really highlights many aspects that us gamers are either oblivious to or are conditioned to already have a base understanding of. i think a lot of people and game companies can learn a lot from this type of content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-03,"i love that you mentioned that maybe you should play dd with her cause based on her having fun with coop she most likely would enjoy the tt version. it would be a good way to have her shift her take on fantasy, especially with a good dm that approves of creativity and has amazing delivery on the story. additionally, having to mostly use your own imagination will make things that much easier to not get overwhelmed with things like visual queues, etc."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-26,"they also want the dialogue to feel open to role play, she should have role played out something when selecting dialogue, like eat dirt gobos to intimidate them, she says something cool irl and the game plays off it, even if she fails the game vibe would play off the goblins responding"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-28,haha! i'm a mom gamer who picked up gaming again some few years ago and i also chose warlock as my first character because of the outfit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"i can relate a lot to this video. my main interest in playing bg3 was i wanted to try dd but i didn't have any friends. i first played bg3 a couple of years ago and i had no knowledge of tabletop or any of the mechanics. i was very overwhelmed for the first 30 hours and i would say only just started to grasp an understanding of the game after like 60 hours. larian had a monumental task of implementing a tabletop game into a digital medium and making it digestible for the broad audience. now that i have a few more hours under my belt my favorite aspect of bg3 would be player agency, i find it very enjoyable that there are many solutions to scenarios and it's super fun collecting exploding barrels i keep that smoke powder satchel for special occasions thank you for the lovely video"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"it sounds like a great deal of your wife's problem with her approach to playing video games is that she is in a hurry to accomplish the task and get it over with. these games are art pieces meant to be enjoyed. if she is not taking the time to appreciate and enjoy them and their experiences as she experiments and explores what they have to offer then she's going to have a bad time. yes, the game gives you some objectives and that can be helpful to get you going. but if you focus like a laser on objective x finding haslan and don't care to do anything else, then you're not really taking part in the experience as it was designed to be played. if it feels like work, you just want to get it done and out of the way, then you're setting yourself up for lackluster enjoyment at best."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,"when i try fantasy games with my wife, she just goes for the warrior types. as i explain the classes, her eyes glaze until i say something like and this one just hits shit, and she always goes, yup, lets do that one. at the end of the day, magic or no magic, everyone understands a punch to the face."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-30,"i had to pause the video and just say this....i love that you laughed and said that is as good a reason as any to pick in a case like this. all the classes offer something different and fun and she has no preset biases the way you or i do from our years of playing games and knowing our favorite archetypes. my mom once picked her choices for the winners of football games by who's color scheme she liked better. at the end of the season, she had a better winloss than my stepdad and brother who were statssports nerds."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"711 is such a funny and charming exchange, thanks for including it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"a lot of her issues seem to stem from her impatience to experiment and learn what the game is telling her. yes games can be ambiguous but at the same time you arent meant to just fly through every part of the game. her getting discoraged from talking to npcs is a good example, yes not all npcs are useful but at the same time they help to build a more full world as not everyone is linked to a main objective. taking your time in games is very important and not being able to do that will hinder someones ability to connect to the game. also when a character tells her something especially in game like bg3 she should have been told that not everyone is acting in her best interest, a character saying something isnt the same as a prompt in the game telling you something. which for a new gamer i can understand, i guess but at the same time not every game can be holding everyone hand as if its their first ever experience in the genre. overall this is an amazing series and i admire both of you for doing it, but at times i feel as if things could go a bit smoother if you helped to fill in the assumed blanks for her when the game doesnt expicitly spell it out for her."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-27,"i wonder if choosing an origin character would have helped with the infooverload of character creation and also with having a clearer direction of what to do. for my first playthroughs of both baldurs gate 3 and divinity orginal sin 2, i chose an origin character because i wasnt familiar enough with the world and story to know what place i wanted my own character to have in it. so i found that picking one to play as worked really well because the game was able to tell me my general goals and motivations in situations where i wasnt 100 sure how to act. and in bg3 of course their classes are locked when you select them so you dont have as many options at the beginning to understand."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-11,players hating any kind of conflict with npcs and losing interest because they aren't all vanilla and smiley with the player upon first meeting is how games like dragon age veilguard come into existence. she'd probably like that one.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,"this series is so excellent. you do a wonderful job of paying attention to your wife and communicating her experience accurately. i really enjoy how you explain all the things gamers and myself take for granted about the unwritten rules and expectations of a video game. i think this sort of journalism has been tried before, but i feel that it usually it takes a mildly more hostile approach. the 'new player' typically has their faults highlighted and is usually scorned or ridiculed for their inexperience. the 'new' players lack of enjoyment is often painted as their own fault, never acknowledging potential flaws in the way video game media is presented. you communicate the experience of a new player much more empathetically than anyone else has done before, and you have provided deeper insight and context for the rest of us to understand the positions and expectations of outsiders to this hobby."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,"i'm the lady someone else lives with, and i grew up playing casual games like animal crossing and pokemon. i also hate turnbased comeback and much prefer to buttonmash and run, lol. when my husband bought bg3, i was hesitant to try it out, but i'm a sucker for an open world, so i gave it a go. i've never played dnd, so i was lost immediately. however, the game quickly grew on me, and i haven't put it down since. i'm by no means good at the game and spam the same attacks over and over, but i still had a lot of fun!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,"honestly for this kind of character creator, i feel like the best way is to ell them just to pick which things sound coolest to them for now and let them know that if they end up not liking it they can change it later, that way they dont feel too much pressure to know everything during creation since the importance of the decisions is lessened."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-29,i really think that bg3 is also very reflective of peoples personalities in how they play and choose their characters. for example like the how she follows directions and isnt really one to explore and take action and it just really passive
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-01,"while i liked your video, i really hope game studios won't opt their games to appeal to people who're just not into that genre and just want to give it a try. there were scenes i had to endure in game as well, but they felt natural and over all, i liked them! all the emotions that gave me made it feel like a real experience yuck, volo! i also like that i had to grow from what is this?!, how does this work?! to ooh. got it. over and over again, which made a more creative rerun all the more enjoyable. on top of that, i feel like baldur's gate 3 is already a game where they took out a great deal of stuff players could be frustrated with, you just have to explore it and not expect everything to be handed to you on a silver plate. which i love! like how i as a druid can change into a cat and a character can throw me to distant places! another time, a friend accidentally destroyed a ladder and we found new ways to reach the high ground by experimenting. it's always fun! and i don't even like round based games. the companions were definitely why i gave bg3 a try and because i'm dying to play dd, but nobody i know or like wants to! i didn't overly like how some behaved in the beginning and missed my headbutt on astarion after he wrestled me down which bummed me out, but i like that this gives the friendship room to grow! he handles a tav well that got upset because of him and it all can be resolved in humour, the best way there is! he was genuinely concerned about my tav later on, as was lae'zel and shadowheart, which felt wholesome. especially shadowheart has a lot of nice lines, even in act 1, so all the player needs is a bit of patience. and astarion is just hilarious sometimes. i mean, it's like that in real life as well! people who don't trust you right away, might end up to be your most loyal friends. so wholesome. also, gale has the best introduction with minsc early on that made up for the other rough edges, sorry your wife missed him. he said all the things that got me excited has a nice sense of humour, very educated, quite friendly, optimistic, has a cat and a library, doesn't trust you right away, is not ashamed for his talents but not narcissistic either, is enthusiastic about knowledge. almost carried him to camp like a princess. oh. and congrats on your second child, i hope everything goes well!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,worst part when the ai just breaks and they standstill for 5 minutes
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,waiting for the attack to just miss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,and then when you get back you realize the first guy that attacked you started a reaction prompt that you haven't clicked yet.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,me sure! playing a summoner build sounds awesome! also me fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"and then right before your turn you get stunned, paralyzed, restrained and silenced"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,"returning back to your turn, only to find out youre stunned."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"even crazier in real dnd, combat sessions be so productive because ill go and eat dinner, come back and it still aint my turn"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,i was waiting for the shot of you raising a family and growing old with them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,she's so productive... usually i just sulk staring at the screen aggressively snaking
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,i came here for stardew valley content but now seeing bg and the arc of scythe i think i finally found my place in the universe.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-16,"and then your turns comes up and you miss the attack, classic"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"yooo! you read scythe too! i love that series, it was one of the first book series i really got into! for anyone who wants to know the gist, humanity has found a way to become effectively immortal, even reviving people after deathusually not if theres no flesh to revive or a brain and the world is governed by an almighty a.i. called the thunderhead, which is programmed to benefit and help. essentially the better version of those nightmare scenarios where robots take over the world yata yata. there also is an organization called the scythedom they are the reapers who cull people who have lived really long liveslike 300500 years and do something called gleaning if someone is gleaned they cannot be revived because they were chosen by a scythe to die. scythes help with regulating the population. thats the most ill say on the series. i really do recommend you check it out and give it a read! last i checked theres four books in total, the lady in the video reading the newest one!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,not paying attention to the enemy turns is crazzzyyyyy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,yurgir merregons standing still for 3 business days
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,sooo... you're saying the key to being more productive with my life is to start playing bg3!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,shoutout to the scythe books! first time i have ever seen them in anything at all lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,"that one fight that continuously spawns bats to clog up the turn order, my beloathed"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"i was playing an actual tabletop game online and at one point the turns were taking so long that i finished my turn, got up and ran to the store. by the time i came back and my turn hadn't even come up again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,missed a great opportunity for a perfect loop
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,fr lmao i turn on my music  start mini raving
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"that music tho. the whole time im waiting, im just headbanging"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-14,is it weird that i really enjoy watching the monsters take their turns?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,i wish bg3 had a real time replay that shows the entire sequence happening at once so you can see what it looks like in an actual battle
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,praying to whatever eldritch terror residing in the void that enemy turn doesn't completely wreck your entire hp bar during all that time as well
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,and then it's my turn and i'm silenced i'm a wizard saving up my magic missile
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-19,"it's not even an exaggeration, sometimes i play a game of chess or watch some ytb video while waiting for my turn"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,"now imagine what it's like, when you also have to wait for the actual humans you play with, that take their sweet fucking time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,"i once rewrote one of my short stories for my dd campaign between the fights of act 2 and 3, and my god i was cooking with those long drawn out fights"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,"go off, find a partner, start a family, raise your son, send him off to school, finally your turn misses"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i love watching everyone take their turns and being able to strategize as a team
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,the worst part is when your finger slips and you accidentally press triangle and you skip your turn and you have to rinse and repeat
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,and then you miss every one of your attacks and gotta wait again.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"that's why it's important to prevent the enemies turn entirely. knock them down, freeze them, shock them, paralyze them, anything and everything to prevent their turn."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,"too painfully accurate  there was one fight where i ended up against a whole army with a few npc's on my side and all my characters got stuck, stunned, put to sleep and so on so i was just getting wailed on for 15 minutes while i played a game on my phone"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,the music of battle in baldur's gate 3 is epic!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,love when a group of enemies dash at the same time like yes save us all some time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,"i kept going upstairs to talk to my girlfriend during that fight and saying, i need you to understand that right now, in the video game, i am in a footrace that is both boring and stressful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,anyone else pay attention to every move being made? like i'll typically having a video playing in the background that i'm listening to but i'm still paying attention when it's not my turn. saves me time figuring out where everyone moved to.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,"i can't do that, my builds have too many reactions to just walk away"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,sounds about right. i have a second monitor watching vids till my friends said your turn.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,this is real cause i played this with my dad and it took 5 minutes for it to be my turn even tho he had nothing left
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,explains why your place looks cleaner than mine.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"and when you finally come back you realise after all that, youre dead"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,"normally it's not that bad, but this one and that one particular gondian fight made me actually consider going and getting food while waiting, lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,love the ones where you leave for 5 minutes only to comeback to a reaction pause
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,this is why you can control your party. literally to let you play more often
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,real dd be like this too. s'why baldur's gate is so good
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,you're not even wrong sometimes you have to get up because one time i saw one enemy hit karlach like 10 times i was like. what the fuck with that? i was so upset. that game gives me high blood pressure sometimes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,worst part is when your dead when you come back
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,if your big into summons then its a relief to get to not think for a few seco hours.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"xcom 1  2 solved this problem with player and enemy rounds, but both games could've benefitted by having enemy units take their turns simultaneously."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,its all fun and games until you realize youve been waiting on a reaction for the past couple hours
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,this is too true. i had one evil cat stuck under a tree in the creche and i just had to wait until it clipped out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,"the best part is when you summon ghouls, they run to the enemy and after that, they just stand there and they take 2 min each one to pass the turn."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,its just like real dnd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,still better than the three hours it takes my actual dnd party to get through combat.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,i love it lol i can sit back with my tea instead of being super stressed during real time combat lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"pov your quasit stepped in water, so you had it go invisible again so it wouldn't die in combat, only for each enemy to play a three minute animation of them looking around at the end of each of their turns."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i prefer rouge trader for this reason..i can properly build my team for ill strike first and buff the team and i dont care how slow i am cuz my teammates are going to give me extra turns with abilities plus the enemies in rouge trader have an officer or one commander and they do the actions of buffs that take longer but the action is fast to bring back to your move.. bg3 is a watered down version more interested in talking not building a deep character
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"the worst part is when u die on the last one f8, f8, f8, f8... hurts so much"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"this is especially true with my friend with his spores druidnecromancer wizard he switches classes quite often and his countless armies of minions, familiars and everything i can't think of right now"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,this is why you don't let them have turns... duh p
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,i can't even be upset because the last couple of fights are exactly like this!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-23,"my biggest question is, where can i find a woman like this to share my life and gaming passion? she's my holy grail."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,i understand this too well . i usually start my audio book during big battles and listen while i wait. she's much more productive than i am .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,they gotta add a speed up option when it's not your turn.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,and you come back to find your haste spell concentration was broke and you've lost a turn.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,gale being dead is so real
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"i despise loops, but i've got to say this was actually the best one i've seen, even with her not being in the exact same place. jumping from the end to the beginning makes it look like time passed from making a decision."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,this is why i like pathfinder wrath of the righteous. you can literally fast forward through the enemies' turn.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,"i will never again go through the courtyard, i will always go through the sewers after i found it on the last stage"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,no this is so real. i straight up make sure i have a book or my sketchbook with me or a youtube video or something during the big crowd fights. i wish there was a way to speed up the battles a little
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,constantly impressed by how accurately bg3 emulates the authentic dnd experience
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"i did this fight correctly once, and since then i cast greater invisibility and haste to avoid this fight."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,worse part is when you know your cooked but your hoping the last turn wont fully kill youthen it does
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,nah why did this pop up as i scroll yt waiting for my turn
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-14,and it's actully much better now. i remember the first release when similar enemies were not grouped and the goblin cmap fight had 1520 separate turns for every single goblin hahhaa
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"this music is fire, though"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,what's funny is during early access there were a bunch of hardcore stick to the playbook faithfully only people that didn't like the quality of life system mechanic they added where if multiple charactersenemies from a side are all one turn after the other ex. 5 reds before a blue then they can move all at the same time rather than waiting for each one to finish. imagine how much longer the turns would've been
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"yeah that's accurate to the ttrpg at least, i'm waiting for 4 other players and the enemies ?? i'll just review my character sheet"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,i sense no lies?!  that one guard from pirates of the caribbean
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,"gleanings is a great book ngl, i loved the whole scythe series"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"wait that wholeass time, fully knowing exactly what you're going to do, do it immediately, and the process begins anew"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,you can also start a few bank accounts while youre at it and pay some bills too. this video is so funny. i love love it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,maybe the real goblin tracker is the record log i keep of all the mischievous and beastly little things that i cook and eat when no one else is watching
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-19,another problem is that your friend went afk since his turn was over but his reaction pops and the rest of us are going to wait even longer..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,thats what i did in that exact fight especially when its the turn of enemies far away and theyre like  while they decide what to do. gotta do some chores
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,this is like playing chess and not watching your opponents moves
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,"i only played with one human and he was constantly never pushing the end turn button until i would go wtf are you doing that it's taking so long. waiting on you? no, you're not waiting on me, it's not me doomscrolling youtube, i would take my turn if i got one  ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"bro, this is literally me. ill be in the middle of a long fight and ill just go and do something else while i wait for my turn."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,"as someone who was apart of the day one early access for this, you used to have to wait for the game to load the action of each npc. it took anywhere from 3080 seconds to load each action, and sometimes the npc would move, and then load its actionits infinitely better than it used to be"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,especially that last set of fights holy shit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,that final battle really does add a lot of waiting haha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,you come back and you're stuck halfway through because the game is waiting for a reaction response from you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,this just proves that bg3 did a fantastic job at recreating 5th edition dd!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"in pathfinder they came up with a very cool solution and fights can be held in free play without turns, where everyone moves at once"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"lol, learning you can skip having to watch enemy turns was life changing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,twisted force mentioned. one of the best combat music tracks ive ever heard
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"not paying attention to enemy turns, and having all party members on auto is crazyyy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,"this is what happens in irl dnd as well, except instead you're at someone else's place waiting for a 3rd person to decide on a course of action after 30 minutes"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-11,"100 hours later, i had to come back and give you proper thanks. without you and this video, i wouldn't have been able to give this game a proper chance, but i'm loving every minute."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-05,i know a lot of comments say this and its a year later but this really is an incredible video. the attention you put towards every detail is insane. you should be really proud of this work.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,i was very discouraged playing this game a few days ago to the point i just quit. after watching only 45 min of this video i feel 110 more confident and am actually enjoying this game so much more. cant explain how much i appreciate the time this took!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"i dont think ive ever commented on a youtube video before but this legitimately might be the most helpful video ive ever seen. incredible work, now back to passive viewing for another 15 years."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"i just wanted to let you know, that thanks to your explanation of high ground i now understand why obiwan was able to beat anakin. that sir, makes everything clear now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,best walkthrough ive seen and immediately made my game more enjoyable. hope you keep putting out great content.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the best guide there is and somehow totally spoiler free. well done mate.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-18,i was extremely intimidated and confused when i opened the game. honestly i thought about giving up. ive never played anything like dd and i dont have much experience with rpgs but i really wanted to have a go at this game. thank you so much for the tutorial it really helped break everything down and made so much sense of everything!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,i can't explain how easy this made the game to understand! thanks for another truly complete and comprehensive guide!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-21,"i tried to go into bg3 blind after hearing great things about it. i never played a dnd rpg before and really struggled even on easy mode. i am sure experienced players love that the game doesn't hold your hand while playing, but with my lack of knowledge, i really struggled. this tutorial was so helpful, thanks so much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-22,"i tried getting into bg3 two times and failed both times as the game was way to complicated for me. i came across this detailed guide, watched it and decided to give bg3 another try. currently i have 60 hours on the game and i am in act 3. just about to arrive at baldur's gate. thank you so so much for making this detailed guide that allowed players like me to get into this beautiful world!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-30,"amazing beginner's guide, thank you so much. as a complete noob to dd i watched so many beginners videos but they were all about character building andor how to add up the values of the dice, it meant absolutely nothing to me because i am a complete beginner and know nothing about this game. this is the first beginners guide that actually introduces you into every aspect of the game and tells you about the things that really matter to a beginner extremely well. i realize how much work it is to make such a video so liked and subscribed, it's the least i can do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"3350 small correction regarding stealth. full sun means you cannot make a stealth check, it you are seen you will be removed from hide. half sun means you need to make a stealth check to maintain your stealth and no sun means no check is necessary unless your opponent has dark sight."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-21,"i was looking for something which simply explained what each class, starting abilities, and actions in the hotbar does. this guide does that, and beyond. massive work, thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"ive probably watched like 15 hours of guides for this game trying to get prepared as a first time player. this one video cleared up alot of things i was still confused on! thanks for explaining things clearly and zooming in on the actual things, and demonstrating everything out!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-25,"i wish more people could produce such welldone guides to understanding and enjoying the content they are representing.. well done sir, well done!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,"thank you sooo much for making this video! i am new to dd games and i have been struggling for hoursdays, and googling what does this meando, why can't i do this and that didn't help but this video is the chef's kiss of bg3 beginner's guide i went through a couple of ones and remained as confused as ever. but with this, this masterpiece of a video guide every other minute i was aaaaaa so this is what i need to do,ooooooo so this is how this works. again thank you for doing this and for all of the hard work you put into making this video 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,amazing overview! thank you!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"edit for anyone lurking and wondering, do i really want to spend 1.5hr on a video to play a game better? for me, 100 hours in now and almost done, it made a huge difference and allowed me to understand game mechanics that individually aren't complicated, but as a whole are then incredibly complicated. this game, it's depth and how well written it is, deserves to be experienced entirely and this video allowed me to do that. edit that was gruesome but absolutely necessary. you clearly made it as painless as possible while still covering everything that matters. 90m across four days well spent in my opinion, so thank you very much. i'm ready to start over after a few hours and play for real now"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-04,this is by far the best bg3 beginners guide video i have seen. super helpful that you indexed and timestamped each topic. your explanations were very clear.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-02,i'm about 60 hours into the game and am learning things from this video i didn't even know i could do. trying to convince my sister to try the game out and definitely sending this to her. thank you for putting such a good guide together!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"a couple of impotant points holding alt does not show most lootable containers. so you still need to be at the lookout. another point is that you can fast travel whenever you want from the map. you do not have to actually be near one of the way things. press m, press where you want to go, and vola, there you are. edit even though you can see your bonuses and proficiencies when you choose a dialog option, you do not know if it is the easiest one to pass. one check, where you have 0 bonuses, can require you to roll a 5. another one where you have 5 bonus points can require you to roll a 15. the first one will be a lot easier, but you have no way of telling, except for intuition about what the character you are interacting with is likely to believe and want to hear. when it comes to karmic dice rolls, it removes that you can do a lot of high rolls in a row as well as low, if i understand it correctly. it also does the same for your enemies. so it does not tip anything in your favor, except for both you and your enemy not rolling 1s and 20s as many times in a row. that being said, it is probably a boost in conversations, since if you have like a bonus 10 total, then you do not care about what it is beyond 1, as long as it isn't 1, in any interaction that requires a 10."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-11,"as a complete noob in this genre, and after not finishing the game last year due to lack of time, i came to youtube looking for a beginners guide to start a new playthrough. to my surprise, i found out that i watched this one hour and thirty minutes long video before. 'no way i'm spending 90 minutes watching a youtube guide' i thought. but then, if i've watched the entire guide back then, it must have been worth it, so here i am again d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,this is by far the best guide i've seen. a thorough and easy to understand breakdown on the termilogy and dnd mechanics that is much needed to survive in this game. would love to see a shorter guide for ps5 and controller nuances if possible. thanks for the great content!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"i'm a total newbie to baldur's gate and dd in general but this guide really helped me understand how to play the game and made me feel more at ease and comfortable in diving into the game. this is definitely the best beginner's guide, hands down. you made this video very informative yet super easy to understand without making an hours' long guide and making the viewer feel overwhelmed with information overload. i say this video is 100 efficient and effective in teaching newbies into the game. great job on this, lucky ghost! you earned yourself a subscriber. thank you so much for making this wonderful, easytofollow guide!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,wow! finally someone that actually explains the game for beginners. it has such a learning no curve and you helped tremendously! i might actually pick up the game again now that i understand it better. great video!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,appreciate the effort you put into this mate. learnt more from this video than the other 20 i've watched combined. a true gift to those of us who are new to the genre and dnd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-01,"i made it to the end,  have to say its one of the best game guides ive ever seen! no piaffing, straight to the point, but lots of personality and tips without spoilers, never played the game before  about to jump in, now feeling much more prepared having watched this, thanks, this must have taken ages to do!! a pro youtuber !!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-03,"as avid dnd player, and long long time mass effect gamer somehow they feel simular to me dont at me ok i could figure it out on my own pretty well. but sometimes, even experienced gamers still want their hand held while exploring. thank you for holdin this gamerdude's hand mate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"thank you so much for taking the time to make this. this was the only video that didn't leave me feeling uninformed, or worse, completely overwhelmed. i've been trying to make a decision if i'm gonna get it when it comes out on ps5 because i love rpgs and the idea of a truly free rpg experience is enticing. but all of the things i've seen and read about it didnt really touch on the mechanics in detail. you managed to do this without inundating my brain by prioritizing the key components and staying out of the weeds. you've convinced me i'm absolutely buying this game. immediate subscribe!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i'm completely new to this genre of game so i've felt quite out of my depth with it. your video has really helped me to understand the game better. think i might restart so i can take full advantage of my newfound knowledge. thank you so much, this has been immensely helpful!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-07,"i love this guy!! my brother just had me start playing this game... i've never done this kind of game nor dd, so i'm totally lost!!! i just tried to watch two beginner's guides... what a joke they were!! made me even more confused than when i started! jumping into the game talking about needing to do this, needing to do that, but i have no idea what those things are! then i just found this vid, wow, what a difference. so much better organized, so much better in portraying the info, so much more clarity and just so much better in every way! thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,great guide. i've never played any dd type games so trying to play this game has been a real struggle. this was super helpful.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-17,you are incredible for putting this whole thing together for us new players. i cant thank you enough!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,finally started playing this last night and was so lost. found your video and it's been incredibly helpful. appreciate it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,im playing on my steamdeck and its amazing i just wanted to say this has got to be the most comprehensive guide on the game on yt right now without telling you how to play just explaining what everything on screen means and does noone else talks about that stuff so bravo ill be looking out for your playthru soon
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"crazy how times have changed. we used to buy physical copies of games that would come with a handbook to explain all of a game's controls, concepts, and mechanics. now, we have to take to the internet or youtube when a new game releases digitally to help us get through it. nevertheless, you went into excruciating detail about everything this game has to offer, and it was more informative than any booklet could have been. thank you for the time and effort you spent on this. you've encouraged me, as well as a lot of others, to give this game a go."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-11,this helped more than any other video i watched. i finally don't feel so overwhelmed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-12,"thank you so much for this. for someone who has never played similar turn based rpg games, this was a tremendous help! i can now enjoy playing the game without losing every fight because i wasn't utilising 75 of the actions d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"amazing! i saw the 1.5 hour length and went ugh, but wow did you do a stellar job. you went over everything but didnt dwell to long on anything. i have a much better understanding of the game now and will enjoy it a lot more than if i had gone in blind. thank you so very much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,"made it to the end. i started playing this game yesterday, and felt very overwhelmed. now i feel totally empowered to go have a good time. thank you very much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"thank you so much for this. as someone who is not familiar with anything dnd but who really wants to play this awesome looking game, this was just what i needed. i really appreciate all the work and effort you put into this and it makes the game so much easier to understand from a beginner's perspective. you're an absolute legend."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i've watched several hours of guides and tips while trying to avoid spoilers. i truly learned so much from this video that i'm considering starting back over in my current game. and while i know the basics of dd already, i'm likely to recommend this for new players looking to join my campaigns because you give great basic overall discussions on classes, how combat works, and much more that is the same in table top play."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-26,"just bought the game. so far so good but as there were a couple of things i wasn't 100 sure of, i decided to seek advice. the advice i got was subscribe to lucky host when i asked what they were talking about, they explained you were a youtube gaming guy who does awesome beginner's guides. it's a good thing i realised who they meant  so i subscribed. about 8 hours later i got bombarded with messages saying it's ghost! it's ghost! not host! ghost!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,thank you so much for making this guide! it made the game much more fun and clear to me. keep on the great work! your work helps many people.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-30,"i just started playing this game with my brother yesterday and we have no experience with dd whatsoever. this guide is an amazing help! i tried checking out other guides and i barely understood anything that they were talking about. this is truly beginner friendly and extremely thorough. after watching this video, i feel soooo much more confident and excited to continue my adventure and explore the game! thank you so much for doing such a great job!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"thanks for putting this together, i bought the game and made it to emerald's grove before i got totally overwhelmed. this is so helpful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-04,"dude, i usually don't comment on videos but i had to give you props on this one. very good and informative. i knew most of the stuff in here but it's still worth the watch for the few things i missed on my own. you got a great talent for explaining things and not make them boring."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-09,"man, you went into huge detail! as soon as i noticed how meticulous you were with making sure your guide was complete, i just had to follow and hit the bell. seriously, i appreciate the hours and work you've put into this!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,very good tutorial. i really appreciate you taking the time to produce some really good content for new players. i played the original baldur's gate 25 years ago and enjoyed it. your video inspired me to make the purchase. can't wait to play this tonight!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"i have watched 100 bg3 guides looking for this quality, and wouldn't you know it, my favorite eso cc comes out with a guide that beats all the others. should have checked here first!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,"i dove into bg3 last night basically blind and had a great time, but i'm definitely a little lost with some of the mechanics especially combat. this is a very helpful video, thank you for taking the time to put it together!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-06,"just installed the game but haven't started playing yet and to be honest, i was a bit apprehensive about it, it just looked so complicated. after watching your video, i now can't wait to get into it. excellent indepth explanations, never assuming that the viewer already knows something. you just got yourself a new subscriber."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"amazing guide, can't wait to get in and play the game. good watch while i wait for the install."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,just starting my first ever playthrough. thanks for this video. ive never touch dd but have been curious my entire life. thanks a million times over for this video. truly a masterclass on how beginner guides should be
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"i was always too scared to play these types of games because of how complicated it looks, but this was a fantastic video and its encouraged me to give it a go. thanks for making it so detailed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"fantastic video. your ability to divulge critical information while refraining from spoiling anything in the game contentwise. learned a couple of tricks from this guide, and i alreadybhave over 70 of playtime over 2 characters."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-05,"just got into the game 2 days ago. it's a looooooot to wrap your head around if you're not used to this kind of game, and this guide proved incredibly helpful. a lot of it is explained by the game, but still, in every section, there is something you might have missed or not thought of, so this is pure gold."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,incredible and complete video. the game dosen't explain much and this video works wonders. congratulations my friend. you're awesome!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"this was gold all mechanics, all systems, no spoilers, as it should be! thank you!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-09,"i bought this game a year ago, and after 2 hours i got a refund because it was so unbelievably complicated for someone thats never played anything like it before. i decided to give it another try yesterday and my god thank you for this guide. id never have been able to stick it out without it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,got this game on release but quit because it was so overwhelming. i restarted because of this guide and im having so much fun now. thank you!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"fantastic guide! about 20 hours in and made me want to restart after watching this guide. love that you keep spoilers out of a video that is an hournhalf long. great content, and you do a very nice job at explaining the mechanics of the game. this is without a doubt the goto beginner guide for new players like myself. thank you for the time and effort put forth into it. keep up the content and you got a new sub from me for sure!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,"what a comprehensive, in depth guide. exactly what i was looking for. you definitely deserve more subs."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,"as many others have said, i never comment on videos but for this one i had to. baldurs gate is the first game ive ever played as a fledgling gamer and the ui overwhelm is huge. this video was so comprehensive, welcoming, and straightforward. thank you for making it, i know the editing must have taken forever"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-10,"this was such a great video, ive never played a game like this, and i was super intimidated and overwhelmed trying to figure it out with just the tutorial features. im super excited to play after spending the time to make it through this entire video. youre the best!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,i'm so happy i found your fantastic video at the start of my bg3 journey... it's an overwhelming game for beginners...  thank you so much!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-30,great video! 36 hrs in with a buddy and learned about 30 more information about the game by watching this. great quality of life stuff i didn't know.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"perfect guide while waiting for the download. watched it all the way to the end, very informative and well done. thank you for taking the time to make such a comprehensive guide!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-13,yes a totally comprehensive and understandable tutorial. thank you for your time and effort on this.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,"great video brother, really appreciate all the work you put in and your content style. i'm about to jump into bg3 finally. haven't played bg since the original so really looking forward to it.... thanks again man"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-09,this honestly has been the best guide i've seen. i've never played the bg games and felt intimidated with everything going on but this helps explain everything in a simple yet extensive way that is easy to understand. greatly appreciate the time and effort you put into this video! it's a huge help for new players like myself!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"so easy to sit and listen. not boring, and you keep my excitement level up. you relax me knowing when i'm overwhelmed and relax me when i feel nervous. i can tell you've been there before. you're a pro, bro. thanks for pronouncing genre correctly and thanks for calling me a legend!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-01,"i'm not done yet, but this already helped so much. the other guides i tried watching before this one always seemed to assume that i know how to play dnd which made the explanations pretty pointless to me. but this guide actually perfectly combined explaining dnd in the context of the game. thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,this man here...this is one hell of a guide. baldur's gate was never on my radar. i don't know how i ended up here. but now i'm tempted to pick up this game next payday. hats off to you good sir.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"was super apprehensive about starting, but luckily saw your vid and felt prepared enough to begin. thank you for making things easy to understand!  no experience in dd, and never played turnbased games like this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,"just bought bg3 and i had zero idea how to play it, its very complected for someone that has never played games like this. this is the only video that explains everything a new player needs to know at the start, thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-09,"i was so keen to try this game but it was so overwhelming because im new to dd and games like this but this guide has been amazing, so thorough with all explanations, its like you picked my brain for all the questions i had and just answered them. youve sold me on giving it a go. ps. im going to play as a rogue first"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"don't normally comment on game guides, but this deserved it. a big thank you and well done as best i've seen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-25,looked for combat tips and ended up watching this all the way through cuz i kept learning things i overlooked. appreciate this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,never played dnd. never played bg. my wife and i just bought this and just created or character. we're sssooooooo clueless. can't wait to get stated!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,what a great guide. definately needed this since the game itself hardly teaches any of these basics
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-28,"bought this last night on a friends recommendation, ive played diablo 1,2,3,4  poe  wow  skyrim  dragonage inquestion etc.... i played this for about 2 hours last night and was enjoying it but just felt kinda lost with some of the controls. after watching this i can not wait to go home and dive back in. this gives so much clarity into a lot of little things that seem to make up a whole lot in the gameplay! thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,great job! thanks for clearly explaining crucial features without plot spoilers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,this will definitely be my go to guide when i do start my bg3 adventure once i finish scratching the d4 itch. thanks for the time and effort you put into your guides lucky!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-07,"wow, ive played through pretty much the whole game twice but still learned quite a lot. looking at this to teach my father how to play. he usually doesnt play games at all, but i got him into factorio and now he likes video games so hes willing to play bg3 with me, never thought the day would come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-25,uhhh could you repeat that?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"love your guides! they're so helpful. the guide you made for final fantasy xiv was awesome, and this one doesn't disappoint either. keep up the good work!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-14,"1 year later, got into bg3. this tutorial was something i would pay for! thanks so much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-21,this looks like what i needed. thnx
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"quick tip if you're going for a ranged character such as a wizard there's a hidden melee weapon you can find fairly early that increases your strength to 15 now 19 as of patch 1 while it's equipped, thus offsetting the disadvantages of having low strength for various things."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"insanely helpful. every other video was still talking to the viewer like they were supposed to know things, but you actually explain all the little details that will trip a new player up, like me. i feel a lot more confident with combat now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i doubt there will be a better starter guide than this. thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-25,"i choose dark urge without knowing it lol 10 hours in so far, i saw hot dragon mommy so i clicked"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,a preemptive f in the chat for the drunken kobolds inside the monastary when the drunken master comes rolling in

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,im so ready to jump back to another run and try all this new subclasses please larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"i would really love if you guys added the ability to save a character's appearance to use in a different game. it would help so much with starting coop games or for replaying the game with my tabletop baldurs gate character as a death cleric, since i had to make her a paladin when the game fiest came out. can't wait for the new subclasses!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,i can't wait to play the drunken monk  it's gonna be so much fun getting all the enemies drunk. the kobolds will love me.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,the arcane archer attack animation looks so clean!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,next time is gonna be all my favorites! the new wizard and warlock especially
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,ooh the animations for drunken master are cool as heck. that's gotta be my next one.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"i am really looking forward to the subclass, but i am also going to have so much fun and chaos with photo mode."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,arcane archer and drunk monk are ones i'm super looking forward to!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,definitely going to be playing swarm ranger. that's gonna go great for a reverb build with the gloves of belligerent skies.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,can't wait! i'm definitely doing an honour run with the lads.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,wonderful video. thank you larian!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,drunken master stumbling chef kiss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"026 sorry, i understood oath of the crime"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,cant wait to see more about the hexblade
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,can't wait larian! definitely going to try either death domain or drunken master first. but please give us a date to look forward too
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,soo hyped!! granted ill always be an ancient paladin but the gang wouldnt mind some new playstyle. drunken master laezel here we go!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"picking the swarm rangers sure was an interesting choice. i feel like the biggest appeal about that subclass and dd is that you get to choose what the swarm gets to be which is something you can't do in a video game typically that being said, it does look pretty cool in game and i like that there's options to choose from."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,swarmkeeper ranger lets gooooooooo
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"i'm excited for larian's next project. watching them trying to force the theatre of the mind nature of 5e into a computer logic was rough, but their tenacity won out. going back to a system designed for a video game will let their talents shine."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,we need a video with sven trying the new sublasses against the hag. i feel like it would be funny and nostalgic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,so very excited for this!! thanks for another spotlight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,your oath of the crime sounded like oath of the crime and cofused the heck out of me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"i become dr. bees, masked vigilante with a load of bees dedicated to saving baldurs gate."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,once we start we cant stop! for more than two weeks.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,ahhh this might just push me into a replay  torn between the drunk master and the path of giants subclass!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"first time i completes honor mode was with one eldricth knight archer. sooo cool it will be a brand new subclass, cant wait to try it!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"we have paladins, but this time they're lawful! so... they're just paladins."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,arcane archer is real good. not so overpowered as the tavern brawler but still very versatile  at least until midgame i did not come to endgame yet. i see him as ranged equivalent to the open hand monk.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"i really want to play a bladesinger wizard, can't wait for the video about that!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,been so excited for swarmkeeper since i heard about it. my ranger durge is gonna teach them to fear the tiny swarms!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,looks like they also finally made elfspecific animations work on the strong body types
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,simply amazing!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"im honestly surprised but i think im most excited for the swarmkeepr, i like the homebrewing they did with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i had such a grin on my face when i heard  not the bees!..
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"okay i'm feeling doing a drunken master monk run, while romancing laezel, joyous drunk fighter meets efficient and ruthless one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,amazing voice over
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"i am very glad that years after the release, support for the game has not stopped"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,i have an issue with the drunken master subclass. please add a reason to drink in the middle of battle! that would add so much to the feeling of it all and be super cool!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,larian  you are the best!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,arcane archer is what  was looking for in early acces lol but still it is good to see!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,soooo excited for this! lol apart from goody two shoes hall monitor paladins  i'd loose my oath in 2 seconds.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"drunken master, no doubt. i grew up watching jackie chans wong fei hung film maybe a hundred times."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"after watching this video and the previous one, i can definitely say that my subclass of choice will be the bladesinger"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,seeing actual zhui quan animations in bg3 just tickles my jclei wulong fanboy heart
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"larian, i love your dedication to customer satisfaction and game improvement. but please! i an xbox series s player need this update! my other irl has wanted to try this game coop for a year now. love, kisses, and begging on my knees for an eta on the update ss"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,not the beeees!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,will definitely do a drunken master run  just for the animation
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i agree. the jellyfish are pretty cute.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,of course i have to wait for part 3 for the subclasses i'm most interested in lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"drunken monk! i haven't got the achievement yet, this is the perfect excuse to work towards that now ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"ohhh, those arcane arrow animations are really pretty. as is everything else, ofc i quite like the drunken master. a lot of the monk vocabularyimage is very wholeness of mind and spirit, focussed, precise, trained to perfect the technique. a monk doesn't have to be all that, ofc, but that's kinda the flavour the classability names give off. drunken master just makes it abundantly clear that monks can be just... tavern brawlers. just got good at punching by their inability to stay out of trouble, their wis stands exclusively for 'street wise' and they're probably banned from every establishment in their home region maybe that's the reason they started adventuring, needs more ale!."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i would like a physical change to the dark sorcerer one. just like the draconic ancestory.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,omg i loved the old jackie chan movies. i can't believe i will be able to play as drunken master ddd i'm so happy xd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"we need the wizard of the spiral tower and arcane wellspring for sorcerer. they're one of the paragon paths from 4th edition. just in case anybody ever had doubts that you can, in fact, run a dungeons and dragons campaign to level 20 very easily, 4th edition shows us that. in reality, it's just most gms can't manage mentally. all it really requires is just being a little bit more creative with the problems you push your players against."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,not the beeees! this narrator is adorable.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i always loved the idea of ranger, but never ranger itself... so im definitely gonna try arcane archer"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,i am personally most looking forward to playing the bladesinger. it's also the perfect subclass to tell gale that you do have other means but magic in the sussur flower anto magic field...and get the quack d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,love you so much larian...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,oooo oath of the crown will definitely be easy to keep. not like i end up breaking my oath almost immediately after getting off the nautiloid or anything
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,drunken monk gameplay gonna be fun
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,arcane archer seems fun along side with gale. sniping down enemies from afar with good vantage points.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,where is my hexblade!? they know
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-18,"thank you, daddy larian we all say in unison"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,i have an astarion as a rogue assassin who i just multiclassed into ranger for the sake of going off on archery. arcane archer is my new friend now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,i can't believe they didn't call intoxicating punch punch drunk
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"im really hoping you give arcane archer the same love you gave monks and rangers because, holy crap, do they need it just as badly"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,"i can't wait for patch 8 to drop. been holding off on completing my third playthrough, waiting for it to drop"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"man, i love larian"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,"waiting for the patch so i can start my 3rd ranger run, swarmkeeper here i come!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-02,"you hear stories about games that ended up total disasters because they realized during the dev process they needed to retool some things, and their parent companies were fully brick wall on even calling a single va back into the studio to record a few new lines, because they didn't want to waste the money. larian pushes a free update, after they've gotten all the awards and don't even need to prove themselves, makes a whole completely unnecessary cartoon about it, and gets the entire cast to crack some jokes about entirely usergenerated content."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-01,gale with the beretta we can't expect mystra to do all the work.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-01,155 gale stopped visiting mystra and looked for another god saint colt

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-03,there's nothing i love more than diving into modding and seeing balanced ui mod tweaked for all controls next to astarion but hee hee and it just turns him into michael jackson that's a real mod btw. it truly says so much about the beautiful community this game has created.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,3350 you have an interesting definition of having fun with the game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i like the bugbear assassin at 508 just wailing on the victim. it's like that video where the killer chases you with a spoon the horribly slow murderer with the extremely inefficient weapon.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"retired modder here  the maximum damage you can do in one instance is 46340 weird game engine logic, it's the biggest number the square of which fits within a 32 bit signed integer, so to kill any of the enemies with 224 16777216 health you'd need atleast 363 hits"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"dude the final boss felt like a 5dimensional chess game with multiverse time travel in video game form you would pull out some absurd hyperspecific tech, and then the brain would immediately counter with some obscure hyperspecific counterplay for you, which you would find a countercounter tech to, and so on and so on and the funniest part of this, is how all your playthroughs devolve into this kind of thing, but this is definitely the craziest one"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"my guess as to why ketheric is immune to atrophy is that he's hardcoded to not be able to die since when his hp reaches 0 from damage, he switches to the avatar of myrkul who can actually die. though that's just intuition, slimx could probably find the actual answer."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i saw the 999 ac and just went sure magic missile can just bypass what is their health?? okay i guess we are shoving everyone then  they cannot be shoved, and bosses tp back me alright fine i give up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i just finished watching. this is the most absurd baldurs gate video ive ever seen. the strats here are so complicated and ridiculous only a true mad man could conceive of them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,the amount of blood on the ground around the druid grove was cracking me up. i don't know what that says about me . .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"what do you mean i'll see you in the next one?? how do you top this? superb run, thank you for your wonderful content for all this time d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i am absolutely baffledvon how bouch only has 90k subs when he does the most insane shit anyone has ever seen in bg3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,seeing zhalk's health display in scientific notation absolutely sent me. pray to whatever god you worship.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"hey there ! i'm the creator of the original impossible challenge that morgana and other runners have been playing via the tactician enhanced mod not to be confused with the mod featured in this video, which is courtesy of frycke! and, just... holy shit lol. when i originally implemented the impossible challenge preset as a bit of a joke while i was finishing tactician enhanced, i never could have imagined how the bg3 challenge run community was going to take it. over the past few months i've seen tons of runners defeat my impossible challenge in increasingly devastating and increasingly funny ways. but this right here? this takes the cake. i'm inclined to agree with many of the comments under this video in that i have absolutely no idea how you could ever top this, at least for this style of challenge. this is easily one of the best bg3 videos i've ever seen, and probably the single most impressive run i've ever seen. the degree to which you push the game's mechanics is unmatched! while i know this wasn't a tactician enhanced run, it was in the same spirit as the impossible challenge. and with how close i am to finishing verification of all of the submitted impossible challenge runs, i believe this could serve as a fitting end. if you're okay with it and are willing to send me character creation details for the avatar you used in this playthrough, i'd love to list you amongst the winners of the impossible challenge and give you an ingame statue alongside those other winners!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,honey wake up new bouch just dropped
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"next video beating baldurs gate 3, without owning baldurs gate 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,alternative title baldur's gate 3 but i made a deal with any trickster god in existence to pull off any and all cheese methods imaginable
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"ketheric has an immortal tag until the cutscene of him becoming the apostle of myrkul plays, and that's why he's immune to atrophied. incidentally, cazador also has this tag, but it's removed by a cutscene and would never actually come up unless you were to, say, try to fight him in act 1 a la raphael. also, there's a fun trick you can do with polymorph and dominate beast that lets you take control of any npc. doing it to your dream guardian can get you access to the upper city asylum, where the netherbrain is kept before the fight starts, so you might've been able to atrophy it big disclaimer that the brain probably also has the immortal tag."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,the fact that the game engine was able to do all of that math without crashing is proof how well made their game really is!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i used the kethric strategy from this video to beat my glitched gortash fight and i am sobbing. this campaign thats been rotting in my storage for about 4 months has finally been finished i feel so acomplished rn
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,he was actually trying to nuke his pc with the netherbrain fight. genuinely impressive it didn't just crash.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,gotta love bouch's challenges turning bg3 into a puzzle game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"is it possible to top this? could there possibly be a way to take this game to another level after this? when you beat the game with 0 in every stat, we thought that couldnt be topped, but then you beat the game as cheese. then you beat it without actions, and then without ever using movement. yet again though, you have taken the game to a level we have never seen. you are the goat of this game undoubtedly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"that bend luck segment had me laughing so hard, man could push gods with 500d4 lmao edit oh my god 3145"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,you should beat every possible instance of bg3 at the same time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,art thou mental withers for sure
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"bouch casually throwing money at ketheric... me it's official, he's no longer okay"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"you're cool enough for patch 8, in my heart"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"congrats, i think youve pushed the game to its actual limit!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"857 poor balthazar can't escape fatshaming even from the game itself as shadowheart puts it in one of her dialogue comments i trust this one as far as i can throw him, which isn't far"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i imagine the mod request like modderhow much hp you whats the integral limit for that? after checking with a calculator it is the integral limit lmao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"fitting that you became an illithid this run, because it required some truly inhuman brainpower to pull all of this off. excellent work."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"the second i saw the e notation, my balatro brain just activated like a sleeper agent"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"bouch, my beloved. jokes aside, i love how unhinged your challenge videos are. honestly, i wish they were longer!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"the amount of patience you have for these challenges is insane! great video, as always. it was fun to see gortash simply evaporating. good riddance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,challenge idea beat baldurs gate 4 before it releases
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,absolutely genius strats
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,he's at it again.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,this is like bg3 but all the enemies were made by 12 year olds in dnd beyond
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,this was the most insane run of bg3. your mastery of this game is unreal man. well done!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,im so glad to be living in the bg3 challenge run timeline. thanks bouch i was starting to run out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"hey bouch, you probably knew this but high level monks get sanctuary after long resting, so to do the gith fight you could have just got more xp and deal with it that way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"okay i didnt think you would be able to do this. quite amazed you did, congrats"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"yess you uploaded again. man lately i've been binge watching every single one of your videos and you're probably the most underrated gaming youtuber i know of, 2nd most underrated of all of youtube from channels that i know. man i love you thanks for the videos!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i hope this guy has a very good therapistsupport system because this is pure insanity at this point
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"that was amazing. i really enjoyed watching this. i have played bg3 a lot, but you are so creative. it's so much fun to watch. i managed to kill orin outside the temple in my last play through which i haven't seen anywhere else. i knocked her out with nonlethal strikes when she was pretending to be a journalist at the start of act 3. she transformed into her orin form, but remained passive as i continued to hit her like raphael when you steal his armour in act 1but without the sphere of silence. i managed to get her down to 1hp then left her. when she reappeared as yenna in the camp a bit later i hit her with an exploding arrow before the cutscene was started, and she died. her body disappeared, but when i eventually got to the temple her gore pile was already waiting for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,im hopped up on cold medicine and this video has me tweaking. you teach me so much abt this ridiculous game every time you put out a video.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,the planning that must have gone into this is mind boggling
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,i actually saw the answer to the myrkul fight coming from your beat bg3 only using underwear vid lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"i can see how much effort you put into this video, and it's truly outstanding, phenomenal, breathtaking!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,my man straight up looked at an impossible mod and said lol amateurs. i love this guy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,another goated video... you are probably one of the greatest bg3 tactical players of all time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this was incredible, ive absolutely love your videos man, what a fun delve into the depths of this games mechanics, unbelievable"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i am so glad your hardware persevered. cant live without your ridiculous challenges.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i have posted this in a previous video, but i came with a challenge idea i would like someone to try beating bg3 with only bare hands! no monk class and levels allowed, no weapons or spells including items that give spell abelites slots and no barrelmancy! you are allowed to use exclusively bare hand attack, as well as shove, throw and improvised weapon. the goal is to finish the game as a handtohand combat master, like a classic van damme 80's movie hero. i see the main fun of this challenge would be either figure out a fightingbrawler build that can do a lot of physical damage, or cleverly use aoe effects with improvised weapons to take down groups of enemies alchemist fire grease, acid damage, water to trip enemies and so on. and since you cannot use spells, you cannot use most summons too like shovel, deva, dance macabre etc. since they are technically ritual spells."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,this is why i love this game. creative solutions can be found even in situations that seem nearly impossible.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"bouch, your videos are amazing and fun! i love to watch them, but always think about how short they are in a good way. have you ever thought about creating vod channel with full runs? something like ginomachino has called more ginomachino. again, great work!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,finally... a worthy opponent!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,this is actually insane. you need to be studied at this point.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,the problemsolving and creativity on display here is amazing. i hope larian studios reaches out to you for some kind of cameo in their next game or a job offer.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-20,i have never been so satisfied with 60 fraaaaaaames xd good job man. efforts endured are of minds i could not comprehend
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i love these challenge videos so much  i have no idea how you're gonna top this one, but i'm excited to find out p"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"your videos are a godsend, i like to play bg3 as 14 of a party a majority of the time and these videos have helped me tremendously by showing neat exploits and tricks i can take advantage of. thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"good job on beating this monstrocity of a challenge... idk, if i would even have such a patience lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,855 can't believe you'd do my boy balthazar like that
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,this is the definition of insanity... holy shit well done sir this might be the craziest video i have seen yet
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"in the goblin camp, could you use death ward? have a companion precast it on you, before you talk to the guy. then recast dw after everytime you get hit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"you are amazing bg3 player, love your videos"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"this is absolute madman stuff, thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"casually breaking the game, making it impossible. then beating it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"ahhh the true essence of dnd, breaking the game that the dm set for you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,bouch launches the game bosses why do i hear boss music
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,bro....you need help. great video btw lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,every time im convinced theres nothing new bg3 can offer i see the absolute madness that is this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"2140, this trick kills me! nice ."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"you, sir, are completely insane! like wtf"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i fucking love you man, thanks for doing this! you are the one and only true bg3 challenge runner on youtube!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"bouch, i swear to mystra  jergalpee paw, you are absolutely insane. 1010 video!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"these stats are the kind youd find in some really scuffed homebrew, bravo!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,theres something very funny in gortash being quite literally vaporized in order to kill him.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"this is absolutely insane, but honestly par for the course as far as what i've come to except from bg3 challenges from the cream of the crop like you xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-18,"i just watched the everyone is myrkul video and thought that's it, he's done it. this is the hardest. he's done abusing himself, he's surely found help, it's over. i was wrong. i was dead wrong. bouch please, your viewers are afraid for you! your therapist went mad, but we've charitably chosen to interpret his last words as bouch ya gotta stop this is madness!. step away from the brink! that last turn is hilarious btw. you show up to the big bad netherbrain, and move so fast it can't even see or fathom what happened"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,learned a long time ago never to doubt what sort of insane and unhinged strats bouch can conquer. you could tell me he just beat baldur's gate 3 as yenna and i'd be like yeah he probably did
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,completly incredible! congratulation!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,"i wish you got paid more for straight banger videos every month, i love your channel so much"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,527 hit me as hard as you can! for loviatar! ok. get obliterated
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,the way you solve these challenges is very much like white hat hacking. chaining known exploits and achieving something completely unintended by the developers of the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i think it would be easier to use the filigreed feywild bell exploit to skip the ketheric fight altogether. just insult dolly dolly dolly, become an animal, which lets you quick travel out, which lets you go on to the road to baldur's gate. don't worry, the emperor somehow gets ketheric's netherstone and gives it to you when entering rivington."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,"phenomenal video dude, that was incredible!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,"heya, another impressive challenge done! i'm not sure if it was brought up in comments yet, but i think there was a much easier balthazar skip available. if you drink poison resistance elixir, you are immune to cloudkill, and with sanctuary no direct attack he has can hit you. now, you just start the fight, go invis, step away, let balthazar or his friends not find you, reset the battle... and you can talk to nightsong, opening the portal which you can then use to leave after another fight reset. it counts as having finished shadowfell even if you leave balthazar chilling there. i's also extremely surprised ability drain strat worked on ketheric to get him down to 1 because in my experience and i use ability drain a lot, including this specific battle it caps out at 20. like, you can have 1000 stacks, sure, but stat would be reduced by 20 and that's it. 23 strength enemy would be stuck at 3. i'd expect 1020 strength enemy to be stuck at, well, 1000. and another thing is that in my testing while ketheric was invulnerable, ability drain from throwing coins would not even apply to him. i wonder why our games behave so wildly differently and slightly envious d oh, and cazador also refused to die to atrophy for me before, so i guess some bosses are just built different."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,i give up. here i was thinking to myself how can we top the last video and i thought to myself yeah bouch can probably solo the impossible challenge then drop this masterpiece. whats next? honor mode while blindfolded? you can probably do that while asleep. honor mode and every enemy is a mindflayer? you can probably do that at lvl 1 cleric somehow. honor mode unarmed attack only? no tavern brawler and no gear. while playing as a wizard with 8 str.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,"no idea if there would be an audience besides me! for this type of video, but i would love to see a video of just how you plan your runs! i've played start to finish 16 times all full runs and i still struggle to mentally juggle all the possible items and classes to maximize gameplay in these situations. how do you tackle this? do you plan everything before you start or do you wing it somewhat? edit because i'm forgetful also i have watched all of your videos in the last few weeks and just want to say i really love what you do on this channel and your whole vibe!! thanks for the good time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"didn't know the netherbrain's strategy really is just a bomb party, but with the most complicated one. dealing massive damage to actually kill it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"every time i watch your video, i think that it can't be even harder than that and every time i'm wrong but this time i really don't know what can be harder"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"i think you could have saved you a headache during the second kethric fight, if you had used the halfling follower, which can reroll on a 1"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,who's that pokemon? it's pikachu!!! iiiit's a mind flayer! fu
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,the creativity and ridiculousness of this channel astounds me every time you post. keep up the great work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,good to see that shuffling awkwardly back and forth is still the most op combat strategy.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"if i had to guess, the find a thrall line at 132 is most likely there in case you trigger the dialogue while piloting us with no other characters in range?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,2354 that's because that brain isn't the actual brain but the brain is actually the brain behind the brain
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,larian didn't use any tech to mess up kethric this is a natural consequence of jk simmons pledging himself to myrkul
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,cursed volo is gonna stick with me for a while.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,no but why is it totally in character for valeria to fry a bunch of innocent civilians and claim they were evil
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,841 gremishka standing was something i didn't expect to see and wouldn't want to see again
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,130 i can't believe there's so much content in this game that definitely deserves got. love your videos btw
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,this is pretty cool because the whole can you beat trend started with a ditto challenge for pokmon red.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"florrick sending scratch to save ravengaurd, kobold on kobold violence, facing orin as a grease ball grease... sludge? idk. modders are true gifts to this community. your editing is great too!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,the fact that they have lines for you playing as an intellect devourer in the tutorial is just mind blowing. larian figured their fans would do any thing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,that is wild that they have a line for us in the tutorial. this game is incredible.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,has the spell for summon x but forgot to learn bind x is one of my favourite horrorfantasy tropes  going down to find all those skeletons waiting made me laugh a lot.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"i dont care if its possible, though it probably is, thats a glorious idea."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,i think the pig sitting pose being properly used in the chairr is prolly the biggest wow moment this rrun produced. which is definitely not the only notable thing it produced.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"949 the dodging bunny!! incredible, thank you for highlighting this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,"you should try beating bg3 using only viscous mockery. for more flavour, you must use the most insulting dialogue option. other challenge which would be harder to set up probably is play bg3 as if its real dnd. meaning you cant use examine, hide the enemies hp and if possible hide its initiative. id personally add an extra encounters mod and or absolutes wrath mod to help counter meta gaming knowledge. hope these ideas seem interesting to you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"huge mitten squad vibes from you my man, r.i.p. paul"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,"a little while after finally finishing my first run of bg3, it suddenly hit me that i could watch challenge runs. this video was an immaculate start"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,just gotta say that i absolutely adored all the clips of creatures just chilling or interacting with stuff that played in the backround all the time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"you just keep pumping out fresh new bg3 content, can't wait to see some patch 8 gameplay!  if you made the stress test"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"imagine your best bro gehk pulls up on a boat, shoves you in the water, then yeets the rest of your friends into the water. thats rough buddy. 615"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,man bg3 is such a great game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,cursed volo and dancing akabi are the demons i see at 3 am. by mystras eyelids theyre so cursed!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,how the frick is there a different voice line from the mind flayer on the nautiloid? what possible scenario besides this videos would ever cause that line?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"im glad to hear my analysis of your accent was correct  signed, one of your downstairs neighbors  massively impressive video as alway, mr tactician. i will never be able to unsee that giant tadpole and i imagine it will haunt my dreams for years to come"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"410 but all that time ... there he was. just standing there. regenerating 5 health per second. i glared at the troll. the troll glared back at me. silence flooded the world. and there's nothing you can do about it, the troll whispered."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,always loved the balance of challenge to non challenge vids this channel has. great vid btw not a run id ever think to do
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,insane and hilarious as always  still hoping for the the disney princess run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,138 line is genuinely something no one would ever even get and it still gets a line
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,as a fellow canadian your canadian dollar nightsong joke hits hard and is too real.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"i'm so happy i came across your videos, they remind me of mittensquads videos, especially your humor and demeanor. thanks for filling that void!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,im so happy the devs were thoughtful enough to add a bunch of sitting animations
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,your nonchalant narration is the best
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,2 minuites ago? hot off the press.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,"one of the fist videos i've ever watched of yours, safe to say that i'm addicted!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,you did not just do that to shadowcute
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,ive become obsessed with your channel! thank you so much for creating these videos. your videos are so imaginative and fun!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,that initial cutscene where the mindflayer tells you to find a thrall is crazy!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,this is exactly how a changeling should play if they were in the game! or better implemented in the mods

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,easy to forget how rough the first three levels are when you're used to not fighting until level 4...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,well even with 94 advantage i still can miss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,i once missed 5 times in a row with 90 hit chance and advantage
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-11,"we loved that pokemon logic that if it's not 100 percent, it's actually 50 percent"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,it may been an entirely different game butthats xcom baby
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,it perfectly mirrors real life

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,missing two times with 85 has 2.25 chance.  it is equal to miss once with 97.75 hit chance.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-17,"to borrow a phrase from pokemon if it's not 100, it's 50."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,don't sweat it i once missed a 90 chance three times in a row.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,"what is most messed up about bg3 is how you'll see something like 5 crit misses and then get back to back nat 20s. like, there are other numbers on the d20..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,"tfw you have 85 to hit but keep missing, really feelsbad"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-23,"this, ladies and gentlemen, is why f8 is my dearest friend"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,"i was not expecting to hear reverse 1999 chapter 5 combat ost in a morganaevelyn bg3 video, but here we are. also, true. 85 to hit always misses while enemy 15 to succeed on hold person always hits."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-31,"if its not 100, its 50"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,just like xcom and 99 hit chance while youre standing inside the enemy and you still miss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-20,"epic entertainment, thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"i dont even put that much thought into starting combat. i usually just go in guns, blazing and let the chips fall wherever they may."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-12,"in my first playthrough i fought auntie ethel and opened up missing all my action surged fighter attacks the first turn. i ended up losing the fight by 1 hp. i then reloaded but didnt realize my most recent save was 4 hours before. i then got back to auntie ethel, saved right before the fight started, then again lost the fight, this time by a bit more hp. i then lost by even more hp. getting really frustrated, at that point i did the most save scumming i've down in a turn based game and reloaded every attack and spell cast if it didn't hit. i won the fight with astarion losing like 10 hp and no one else being damaged."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-10,230 hours of gameplay and i'm still waiting for shadowheart to land a hit. one day.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-12,"i had to turn off karmic dice because of this. the amount of nat 1s the game gives you is insane, and that they were occuring so commonly that my coop buddy started to get confused by it."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-20,"one of my last runs i failed freeing shadow heart on the nautiloid. it needs a 2, and i failed with advantage"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-12,the pain
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,"the most entertaining combat in the game by far is that one basement full of rats... just use shadowheart's 'spirit guardians' spell and stand still, the rats will run at you by the dozens and incinerate themselves."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,the worse feeling is having a 99 with advantage and still somehow missing. happened to me so much its not even funny.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,my wyll made me waste his last action surge when he missed 4 melee attacks in a row

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,my wyll has a bad habit of missing eldrich blasts he generally has a 75 chance to hit per bolt but i've watched him miss all 3 on numerous occasions
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,"im doing my first tactician run and i was fighting a goblin with one hp left and missed eight attacks in a row. granted, i had relatively low hit chance 6080, but it was so annoying."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,i've once had astarion miss a 98 chance sneak attack...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-13,the struggle of turning karmic die off
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-11,"bg3 gives me pleasant fallout vibes, the game insists i have 95 chance to hit, yet i critical whiff 8 hits in a row"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,if it's not 100 it might as well be 20 if xcom has ever taught me about numbers.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-19,i was doing a solo run and i wiped jumping to the cave that takes me to boal. i forgot to hit the plant and it blew me down the cave and killed me

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-22,"i'm level 9 and i'm stuck at myrkul because nobody can hit him. should've chosen the other option at the trial of shar, maybe the spear wouldn't miss as much as a literal holy being does."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"i'm lvl4 with my party right now and without advantage, bless and oil of accuracy on my paladin i have 0 chance. thank god for gale and astarion they're most consistent damage dealers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,man this use to drive me nuts when i first started playing.could not under how i was missing so often with 95 chance..and that was on explorer..first few weeks playing game was torturelol.fast forward i completed honor mode and all the achievements..still get misses especially when they have low health

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-22,i got tpk by a lvl 1 hyena. i surrounded it with 3 people and used the 4th for ranged attacks. 5 turns and we all missed every single attack. she killed my cleric and my fighter. we were lvl 3 and got annihilated by a lvl 1 hyena.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-19,"yet to play, xcom you have."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,"95 chance to hit isn't great odds, it's the bare minimum. anything less is a guaranteed miss."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,xcom ah logic
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-23,missed two 95 attacks in a row earlier. bg3 is not installed anymore.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-04,i was trying to get the spectator companion for my oath breaker in shadow cursed lands. it was a 96 and it failed smh
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-19,yup agreed lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,necromites having some of the lowest armour classes in the game at 11
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,"yesterday i had 95 hit chance with advantage, the only way to miss was if i get two 1. guess what happened"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-23,"this mechanic is so unfun as a newcomer to dnd games. its so frustrating doing everything right and just getting rng'd into losing. like isnt the point of dnd to doplay however you want? granted when i started i wasnt doing everything right and sure, okay, strategy game wants to me to use strategy but whats this? im outnumbered every encounter, dont have a tank in my party yet, wanted to play a caster so have no close range options and...yep there goes shadow heart whiffing fireball again or immediately having her concentration broken and yup...that enemy is higher level than us even though this is a beginner area and wow okay everyones dead. fun. some of the best dm's ive seen were much mire forgiving than the damn game is. you rolled a 5 on your sneak attack. you do attack him but he screams out in pain as you just missed the artery and now the guards are alerted. i found that style of letting players do what they want but it doesnt always work out as intended so much more fun than nope, you cant do that. your high fantasy larger than life character steps on a twig, swings, misses, and gets whacked in the face for 22 damage. shouldve rolled better. its not an enjoyable experience for me or my friends to have to save scum and replay the same encounter until we rngesus through it. the games story and characters are so amazing, but it feels like its locked between a fkn slot machine!  ive heard it gets much better once you level up a bit but multiple of ky friends hard quit and when i looked at mods that might let us tweak stuff, apparently its impossible to tweak how the dice rolls work or just nobody wants to because it ruins the point of dnd and the only other balance tweaks for making stuff easier were literally just giving like 10x health and 100 damage to everything...wtf"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,it hits different when its a 99 with advantage. and then you  miss . like homeboy rolled not one but  two  nat ones??
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"how does it calculate your ? the attack roll still needs to beat ac, but the  doesn't seem to rely heavily on the ac. i've had chance to hit with ac1618 up at 85 and miss, and ac12, 50 chance and hit  and it will do that quite often. heck quite often a roll with disadvantage will hit, but a roll with advantage will miss. rage quitting stuff. whhhyyyy??"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,85 chance to miss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,early game bg3 has made me save scum to the point where it doesn't even phase me anymore lmao act 2 and 3 is fine but act 1? i swear the virtual dice are loaded
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,i gave shadow heart this luck thing and she only ever misses and never dodges when i use it its so bad
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-22,"i've missed 90 of my 99 chance hits. i've hit 90 of my 25 hits. the number that it gives is not relevant, it's always 50."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,the number of times we roll two 3 in a row with advantage... and opponents keep getting 16 with disadvantage
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-12,"just like in pokemon, if its not 100 its considered 50 chance of hitting smh"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,98 chance  stunned  poisoned feared and result is miss and critical miss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-20,less than 100 is 40

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,i missed a 99 with advantage d double nat 1
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"this is definitely a game where i'll sit on the creation page for 3 hours, start, then realise i want to start again"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"the bard is actually really cool class i won't play. it's neat that they actually took the time to voice all of these skills and added the ability to play music. you can tell they put a crazy amount of thought into this game. they have my utmost respect, for the work they put into this title."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"thats actually pretty cool that your in game desisions can affect your oath as paladin, lotta games ive played just have it as an rp element"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,"12 hours in, played each class thru to the beach. no clue what happens after the beach. loving the variety."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"spent at least an hour and a half in the character creation screen just to choose the race class combo. got in the game, saved, and went back out to do it all over again. 1110 game just this part of the game alone"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i wish these kind of games would have some kind of combat demo in the creation suite to be able to demo the combat and features of each class before picking them
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"went with paladin for my first playthrough. just seems like a good balance between being able to fight, cast some spells and have charisma enough to hold a conversation too. all around a good guy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the most important choice but also one of the few choices you can change at any time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"never played this series, but i loved divinity so ill have to check this out on release."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"i watched the recent 1  2 recap video and i'm looking forward to your continued, succinct and to the point coverage. forget game of the year, this could very well be a game of the decade candidate. props to the team on choosing whoever this guy is on covering this release. as an aside, credits in the description with socials would have been appreciated. the editors and narrator who put this and other bg3 coverage together, have been doing a really fine job and they deserve a little credit. great job folks! cheers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"just pick an archetype youre interested in, then pick the simplest class of that archetype. i went with wizard, and its been straightforward and self explanatory except for one thing to change out spells, k to open your spellbook, and you can swap from there"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"im loving the sound of bard, paladin, and druid d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"fun fact bg3's class system is very simplified compared to 5e. they cut out dozens of subclasses, subspecies, backgrounds and features to make it easier for newbies. the gith alone have four separate subspecies and 10 subclasses exclusive to them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,you had me at talk to cows.... !!!!!!. worth the price of admission!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,playing as a druid sounds very intriguing!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,im happy that choosing the race has a effect on the class you play and same for background.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i really appreciated the game pad ui footage! makes the wait for the ps5 version a little better
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,best baldur's gate 3 guide ever  thank you so much
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i think for the first play through i'll go with the simplest the fighter. i have had easy access since it came out but have not really played to avoid spoiling. with a fighter i can get a grip of the other mechanics  it's a straightforward class. of course, i'll be a dwarf."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,fun fact the game does have a respec option. so you can undo your class if you muck it up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i'm thinking of making either a female half elf wizard wielding a wand, male half orc fighter wielding a two handed sword, a male halfling rogue wielding daggers, a female tiefling warlock wielding a staff, a male drow ranger wielding a bow and arrow, a female dwarf cleric wielding a mace and shield, a female human paladin wielding a two handed hammer, a male dwarf barbarian wielding a two handed axe, a female gnome druid wielding a scythe, a male half elf bard wielding a lute and sword, a female half orc monk wielding a boa staff or a male dragonborn sorcerer wielding a staff."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-10,i love my warlock for beeing ready again after a short rest. a bit of support together with shadowheart and the rest of the group in near combat.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,there are so many things to take note of in the game lol. its information overload
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i'm 100 gonna go with druid and i'll speak with any animal i can
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"fighter it suits everyone and is the only class you should ever start a dd campaign as. it gets the right saves for multiclassing. it starts with all the armor and weapon proficiencies. it has the best combat subclass eldritch knight. no, battlemaster is mid in 5e and without baitswitch is just bad. wanna play a wizard? start fighter for armor prof and defense style and con saves and that sweet d10 starting hit die. level to two for action surge and then go into wizard. this is how every class should start."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"that moment when you spend waaaaayyyyy too long creating the perfect character. only to start and realise you didnt change the voice ruining the whole thing and needing to start over.. yeah, done that more tomes than id like to admit"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"im having the hardest time deciding over a druid, paladin and sorcerer"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"great, i've narrowed it down to bard, ranger, druid, paladin, and warlock"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"great video! btw, 'ensued' means 'happened after' re the sorcerer class. can't wait for the console version to drop!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"a druidthats actually good!! oh man this is awesome. now i know who to pick, diablo 4 completely disrespected the druid to oblivion. im so glad bg3 is getting a lot of love, ive been playing bg2 for years so this brings a tear to my eye."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,that trickery domain cleric comment was a swipe at laura bailey's jester
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"made the gith woman into a mageslayer and it was awesome. nobody can keep their concentration when she hits them. and the cleric is now a war mage, so concentration for me, but not for thee!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"i love to use a wizard and a rogue as combo. i always use this is strategy and almost always win i put 12 tanks melee in front where the enemies cant pass, can be in a wall hole or a long corridor... then i use wizards invisibility on the rogue and go all the way back to backstab mages,support and range. the ai is so dumb sometimes that they will never notice the rogue destroying their back row while your tanks get all the damage, but the wizard  and sorceror can buff and heal the tanks. also have a ranger with good attack to initiate the battle, put her behind a wall on highground so her accurary doubles where the lower enemies miss it a lot. when that happens make your rogue back stab happily all you want, ai will be so distracted. its a very fun strategy xd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-08,"i wanted to just have an idea of what i was getting into, but i was thinking about druid bc my favorite class is druid. and yup, my bg3 character will definitely be modeled after my first dd character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,patiently waiting for the playstation release im so excited! more guides please!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-12,"video is a bit old now but id just like to say if u pick the wrong class the game isnt over for you, you can switch class whenever you want at the cost of 100 coins"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,i picked half orc paladin with vengeance oath. love it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,i turned into an oathbreaker after simping for karlach. very suprised to learn that it was a thing to break your oath.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-15,"first play through i went with a blue dragon born monk because that was my character of the first dnd game i never got to finish. it is rough in the beginning, but late game because of the bonus action unarmed strike, there are some items that make the monk absolutely savage. not as savage as a barbarian, but i'm having the best time with it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-06,glad classes actually kinda matter here i know you can multiclass unlike in divinity original sin 2 where it just determined your starting abilities
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-01,thank you! this was very helpful!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-08,"nice overview! im leaning towards the druid. but monk, warlock and bard also attract me. the other classes, do, too, albeit to less extent. im so looking forward to starting my first playthru."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,the druid has been awesome!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-27,"i think druid and fighter sounds pretty interesting and fitting for the character i have in mind. thanks for the explanation. i'm very new to baldurs gate, but it's a very good and interesting game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,my irl character is named henry blackjack. a human roguefighter. a petty thief who grew up without parents. on the night of his 18th birthday he learns that he's a lycanwerewolf and that his father was an adventurer who angered the god of the wolves. the god tells him if he wants to remove the lycan curse. he must prove that he's a noble warrior by retrieving an ancient fae artifact and defeating a vampire lord who's a warlock to an old god. henry in his human form is charismatic and cunning and would rather choose to talk his way out of a fight. in his lycan form he's a great warrior. if anyone wants to tell me their character i would be happy to hear.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-08,"this will be my first d  d game and i'm super excited for it. usually i'm not into turn based games but i really want to start trying something different. bought it on at psn, can't wait to get off work and check it out."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,i think i'll just pick druid because i am a tree hugging hippie at heart
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-10,"i started off as a war domain cleric, then moved to a oath of vengeance paladin. that character is for coop with my gf, and my solo character started as a monk and then quickly switched to wizard. having fun with the paladin, but 90 of the characters ive played on tabletop have been wizard and its easily my favorite class. i picked necromancer, as thats my favorite subclass to play, but im tempted to switch to evocation so i can throw fireballs at a cluster without endangering my party."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"great video, even if i will not play for now, it's interesting to see how it works"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-24,"i've been thinking of getting the game simply to build the character i'm using in my current campaign, a halfdrow fiend warlock."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-02,"its just like dnd for me, i dont bother with anything but bards, rouges or druids. but this game just made druiding so fun! i love changing into animals"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"i'm stuck in the current cycle of starting a character, playing for a bit, wondering if i like tthat character, starting a new one... i wanna try them all haha."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"definitely needed this guide  i wanted to playthrough as someone who can talk to animals and also do charisma conversations since i enjoy the storyunique dialogue stuff a lot. i chose to be a noble wood gnome so could talk to animals cleric with the animal god. i've put 12.5 hours in, but only just realised that the talk to animals skill is a spell you have to cast on yourself, so i thought all the conversations with animals were just interpreting them chittering or squawking and was kind of disappointed until i realised you had to cast a spell to do it first  may start afresh with a druid and then do the animal talking properly from the getgo  edit also if anyone has any tips please could you reply with them?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,i really wanted to play fighter but i also want to do all the dialogue stuff so i guess i'm going paladin. oathbreaker sounds cool
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,i always choose some type of magic class when i play these type of games. i wish they had a necromancer class though.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-31,im playing a bard because i never ever pick bard like classes in any rpg so im giving it a go in this game. just downloaded it and started last night. interesting game. im determined to not look at any how to guides lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-13,"what i love about 5e is that classes aren't race dependent ,you may have seen the halfling barbarian memes, but that doesn't stop you playing other odd ball mixes either, halfling paladin is my current build and acquisitions incorporated made famous the grandmoth halfling monk rosie beestinger sometimes there are unexpected synergies, luck for a halfling paladin means i never rol a 1 in combat, and get a charisma and dex bonus making me even harder to hit with my magic shield and magic chain mail"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i just picked this game up today. haven't started it yet, but i know the character creation screen is going to be my new home page for a while. might ever break out my phb for 5e just to figure out my build. not sure yet."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,paladins uphold justice at any cost i will play an evil paladin and nobody will stop me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,tiefling criminal monk basically just some street urchin who has been takin in by a monastery lol art of shadow ofc
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,i dont even own the game yet because i have an xboxbut here i am watching character creation guides in preparation lol. im studying in preparation for spending several hours creating my character when i do buy the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,"i wish the sorcerer, monk, and warlock had more sub classes and that the wizard had my favorite sub class order of scribes"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-14,with 12 classes available artificer crying after not getting in
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-05,no word of a lie i completely missed the class selection screen when i made my character. i was on the screen with the present characters and wanted to be a tiefling because i thought they looked cool so i selected karlach and did the character creation from there. i ended up making a large male tiefling. it was completely coincidental that he ended up being a barbarian too but it fits the character so im sticking with it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this will be my first game like this, and i have noo idea what race or class i'm gonna be"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,only thing im kinda sad about is my fav wizard class isnt there bladesinger so ill probably eldritch knight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,310 doctor dolittle lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,ive played 120 hours and im just excited for my next play through
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,bard is the most fun class by far!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,probably the paladin since thats my go to class if theyre in the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-18,i made an asmodeus tiefling bard. he's pretty dope.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"i've found that having a healer or dedicated support is relatively useless, at least in my current playthrough. i've got supportive items and spells fog cloud, false life, sleep, feign death, etc spread across all my party members but i usually just take advantage of environment and items over health pools because i know if my enemies outnumber me, my healing actions might be worthless."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-30,yeah i'm definitely going to do a barddruid multiclass
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-27,the githyanki on the bridge made me respect fighters.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i'm basically making my dragoborn warlock i use in my dnd sessions with my friends.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-25,i havent been able to get very far in this game because i keep playing for a while and then starting over to try a different class lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,the 2 hour trial in my ps5 wont even be enough to create my character lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this game will go down as one of the greatest in our generation
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-06,my headcanon is that that weird gnometroll hyena thing from the preschool cartoon boobah is a baldurs gate gnoll
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-05,"ranger all the way, played the ranger in bg1 and 2 as well as any dnd paper games i played in... bg3 has been great so far..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,237 feels like a jab to someone.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"luckily respeccing is an option. i've done it and spent centuries on the creation page, lol!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,in the video it sounds like the stats are based off the class. while every class has a recommended set of stats in character creation you can reset all stats and assign them as you want. you could have a strength bard or a dex paladin.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-15,i hope in dlc we can interact with our warlocks patrons. if anything id love for us fiend users to take mizora from wyll.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,"i know i'm gonna spend more time in the character creation than i will in the game i'll sit on character creation for hours, start the game, change my mind, make a new character, start again, etc"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-06,talking to animals is extremely tempting
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,you can swap class whenever. i wouldnt overthink it. its more your appearance you should stress over
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,i can't wait for the ps5 release! so excited to play this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-09,i chose monk. i get 2 attack actions and it comes in handy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,just keep in mind you can respec in the first act d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-03,tbh creating a character is one of the best things!! i made a couple haha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-22,"idk why people treat fighter like this all rounder class that can fill any or almost any role in the party, cuz not really honestly. ultimately, for a well balanced, and optimal party, your party should consist of a frontliner, a healer, a mage, and a dexterity based character. this is fairly common sense and sentiment amongst anyone familiar with rpgs. and a fighter doesnt actually fit any of the roles besides frontliner. no real reliable team healing option, they are strength based so forget the dexterity, and only one subclass allows you to only be a hybrid of a mage and a brawler. so realistically no, fighter isnt actually this all rounder that people pretend like it is, its very much similar to the barbarian class, and fills the roles that that class would. the ranger is actually what everyone likes to descibe the fighter as. the ranger class can fill many different roles, the main 2 ability scores are dex and strength, along with its proficiencies can make it both good at a dexterity based role, and a frontline fighter, and on top of that, the ranger is also a spellcaster, capable of cast different spells and such. so yea the ranger is actually the true all round versatile class imho, and the fighter really isnt."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,my head hurts... and thats a good thing in this case.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-09,"human fighter only, human fighter always. from bg1 to bg3 and every other dd crpg in between."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-04,"2 for tanking your enemy, 1 for offensive spells, 1 for healing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-08,i only choose the barbarian because its the class with most health
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-02,i finally downloaded this game last night. i look at the clock. oh great i have about 3 hours to play before i should go to bed! 2.5 hours later i finally finished my character creation
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"im wizard all day in every fantasy rpg, i gotta ponder my orb, eat hot chip, lie, and use testicular torsion spell in everything"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-03,my character is going to be a female silver dragonborn fiend warlock who later multiclasses into a draconic bloodline sorcerer
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,i would choose either a ranger or rogue
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-26,"if you enjoyed this make sure to check out my latest challenge run, where i attempted to beat baldur's gate 3 as the unluckiest man in the world httpsyoutu.bey8bnxo3f5wk?si47jtclqwddcyckr"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"absolutely fascinating that the steel watchers actually have dialogue and functions for a pc that never killed anyone or anything, something pretty much nobody would do."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,most players you can only get minthara on an evil genocidal run proxy gets minthara by litterally not hurting a fly
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-24,"damn , did you hear about the hero dwarf that saved our realm by doing absolutely nothing but bonk a kid on the head that one time"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-18,"most companions seem pretty murdery, so i didnt recruit them recruits minthara"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-17,"i love how each of the chosen wind up being fed a heaping helping of karmic irony. ketheric is killed by the former source of his invulnerability. orin has her shapeshifting used against her and is knocked out rather than killed, which must be a real kick in the bhaals for both her and her dear old dad. gortash gets blasted by his own turrets, then gets finished off by his own invention. which is especially poetic when you realise that the steel watchers selfdestruct function was probably implemented to hide the truth about them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,the irony of leaving orin alive in this run when her entire thing is killing people at the altar of bhaal. i'm pretty sure that alone would make her more angry than actually killing her.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,this run is the entire reasoning behind not pulling the lever on the trolley problem
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,minthara being one of the party members for this is so funny
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,putting minthara in her own personal hell can't kill anyone and she has to hang out with gale
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"as a fun little trick i learned form my failed full pacifist run, you actually don't need any umbral gems at all i used one for the elevator, but that is besides the point. you can actually open the door at the bottom using knock as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,i am beyond impressed. especially by the steel watcher at the drawbridge recognising you haven't killed anyone. absolutely mad.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"419 look, i know she's a brutal and empathiless killer, but i can fix her! truly the mantra of baldur's gate 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,blows my mind that they actually included a your record is clean' line for the steel watchers. they've been waiting for you!!!  very cool challenge
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-27,"i must have sat the whole video watching with my jaw open, absolutely fascinating and such commitment to go through with this insane plan! would have never thought it possible! incredible job!!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-03,i find it very funny how my forever strategy for doing the balthazar fight came from this video lol thanks for the tip
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"the steel watch letting you into baldurs gate is crazy. i cant believe this challenge was possible, awesome video!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,"i was so ready to see you just cheese most fights with nonlethal damage, but was pleasantly surprised it was used only once."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"fyi you can talk the spider guy to give you a lantern and to go into the shadows. you can find them later possessed by the shadow curse, but you technically didn't kill them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-22,"i enjoy watching people do funky challenge runs like this, so this video was already fun for me just for that. but i'll also compliment the editing! turning that much footage into a tight 18min video is really impressive. kudos!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-11,"having yugir off himself via dialogue wouldn't have invalidated your challenge. any time an extraplanar creature expires on a plane that it doesn't belong on, it is just sent back to it's home plane. no mater what you do to him here he ends up showing up later in the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"we struck an alliance with this handsome young man  this will never not be funny haha. young gortash and his easy smile winning hearts left and right! a hella impressive playthrough, thank you for putting it all together, was throughly entertained! 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-21,"this was an insane challenge run. props to you, and props to larian for making the game so perfectly balanced that this is possible d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,the freedom of choice in this game is unreal. i cant believe you pulled this off. well done!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-08,"120 oh, okay. i was worried this was going to be a my character doesn't kill anyone, la'ze'l does it instead kind of thing. good to know that's out right away."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,i noticed when you where describing what's killing and not killing you used durge. i like that.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,a final fantasy character a handsome young man love the way you rag in gorty lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,had a ton of fun playing through baldur's gate and finding creative ways to get past things. if you're interested in seeing anymore like this let me know! although they'd probably have to be longer because it was difficult to cut a game this long down to 18 minutes
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,loved your narration. i'm so glad you picked minthara in your party she's perfect for the theme of this run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,you came across some serious road blocks but were able to over come them using your wits. truly an amazing watch!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-31,the mentality of every bg3 player. i can fix them
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,i can fix her. my man.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"turning gortash into a gondian was brilliant, couldnt stop laughing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,game of the year. amazing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-22,"okay but the important thing is, did the ghoul at the circus entrance still call you a murderer?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-18,man that was good! i've seen some no killing runs that took the easy way out and had a party member kill the bosses but this is sooooooooooo much more satisfying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,as a speedrunner of this game i clicked on this not thinking it would be possible and im kinda amazed you pulled this off
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"recently i've been wondering if it's possible to kill every last npc in the game and if not, how many are actually required to be kept alive. but this challenge seems even more interesting. great video!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,im glad you went through all acts. you're a real one. so tired of all these can you beat like this and they only do act one lmao.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-19,"something to note the 3umbral gem door can also be knocked open, just like balthezars door. i love it, cuz i hate the bridge trial. meaning you with that fly trick you dont need any gems."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-10,awesome! thats some real dedication  god level patience to do stuff like this. i was cheering you on the entire video! well done!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"this is hilarious and props to your ingenuity for finding ways to not kill anyone... directly. to be the devil's advocate, i'd say casting hold person or buffing an npc who will kill your enemies counts as being an accomplice and indirect killing. it's like giving an active shooter your gun, or extra mags so that they can kill people. i only thought of this since you counted convincing the enemy to kill themselves as killing and it won't hold up in court. well, restraining someone casting hold person so that someone else can kill them also wouldn't held up in court. and so i think if you see casting hold person, buffing npc, and setting up explosive barrels as not killing, then convincing the enemy to off themselves should also count as not killing and is okay to do in this run. all in all, amazing video, subbed for creativity."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"i played as a bard and had a lowkey similar challenge set for myself, but instead of going invis i used nonlethal strikes, worked everywhere except with the hag, which i avoided, most bosses went down with words my rules were a bit different xd, but i didn't even know that ketheric had a fight before he gave up, i thought it was a normal thing, and that my roll didn't really matter. i love your vids proxy, i can just see the passion and quality pouring out of them, and sincerely thank you for giving us this amazing mix of humour and useful info!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,wow i didn't even know steel watch could let the player into baluder's gate. i finished alr 3 playthroughs but bg3 still amazes me lol. also great content
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-08,absolutely delightful! husband and i are doing a goody two shoes run trying to be nice but this is next level! especially love that you really tried your hardest to not even hurt anyone. watching this video directly after the guy who killed everyone possible was extra funny ha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,"this was such a phenomenal video proxygatetactician. i don't know how many of these type of challenge runs you could manipulate in bg3, but even if the challenge is eventually concluded as impossible, i'd still watch the sht out of those future vids! congrats on the success of the video and cracking into the algorithm mate!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-17,"i wonder if using knock out still counts as not killing, even for the watchers. either way, extremely fun to watch play through! thanks for taking the time to do all this! 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,this was the craziest thing i watched in a long time. thank you for this .
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,absolutely loved this video! it's like watching a pacifist's guide to navigating a fantasy war zone. your approach was as skillful as it was nonlethal. the creativity and effort you put into this challenge was both impressive and inspiring. it's videos like these that add a whole new level of excitement to gaming
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-09,"ironically. as an intimidating soldier, i was able to convince the spiderdude to give me his moon lantern without combat"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"great video 358 you say you have to fight to get the moon lattern but you can convince the dyrder to give you the lamp and continue on without out, since it's the shadows that kill him it's not your fault he gave you the lattern."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,great work! the run is impressive and your commentary and editing are spot on. instantly subbed!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,"great video, learning that you don't need one of the umbral gems is clutch for me. i love how these challenges force you to learn and use underutilized mechanics like non lethal attacks"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-11,"dang dude, i know it's been most of a year since you dropped this  everyone's already said it, but the squidward triforce line was a banger. your tone of voice for that joke was perfect. cheers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-02,1702 rewatching this now and this helpful diagram is just incredible.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,i came here expecting for you to just use the non lethal option but daaaaamn i am mighty impressed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,incredible work! i expected you had to abandon the run at some point but you made it you magnificent person d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,"well done. not only your playthrough is impressive, but also the narration are very entertaining. congratulation on this achievement"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-23,"a living legend. my playthrough is not that pure since i take sides, but i'll definetely save this video to avoid most fights, cz i'm a lover, not a fighter d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-12,been working on solo hm runs so this video is absolutely perfect. now i know where to go to level before im actually geared up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"damn dude you make the most engaging and awesome bg3 videos! this was so much fun to watch. bravo, seriously clever problem solving, i absolutely loved it and can't wait to see what you come up with next!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,this is the best challenge run i've seen and i've seen alot
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,this is legitimately amazing. really impressed by the work that went into this video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-29,"i love the starcraft music in the background! i used to listen to the soundtrack just for fun it's a great one. also, i appreciated this video because i'm to to bg3 and as a newbie it's hard to figure out different ways to approach combat other than just murder lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-01,i love how challenges like this reveal such powerful paths i'd never even considered the buffs you used on dame aylin. brilliant.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"great challenge run, with a lot of creative thinking to avoid doing direct damage. thank you very much for sharing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,yet again the insanely high quality content. thank you for such attention to detail!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,what a fantastic challenge. i was worried about how you'd manage the netherbrain but that was great.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-10,"this was absolutely phenomenal! the right amount of humor mixed with creative, impressive strategies and just a pinch of cheese to top it all off. keep it up!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-17,"your self challenges are so amazing, but this one truly takes the cake in my opinion."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-14,"for limited defense of aylin, she was just released from 100 years of torment and isolation. i'd probably be murderous if i had undergone that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,that was freakin' amazing!! the amount of dedication and and planning that went into this are amazing. thank you so much!! 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-27,you can talk the drider into just giving you the moon lantern
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-06,"i havent even been able to get to act 3 let alone beat the game, and seeing you do some of the craziest videos doing it all with ease just makes me question every choice i've made so far. hahaha."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,the handsome young man quote is such a sick burn tbh hahahaha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-14,i really hope the devs see this. impressive work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,love the video and the dedication. you're easily my favorite bg3 content creator
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"edit replies have corrected me. this was patched in patch1. idk what difficulty you were playing on, but in act 2 inside of shar's temple, the final door that requires 3 stones to unlock can be opened with knock on balanced difficulty probably explorer as well but idk, never tried. that's how i bypassed it all in my very first playthrough only to find out that it's not possible on tactician anymore while doing my second playthrough d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,i always enjoy videos like this where the answer is obviously yes because you can just turn on non lethal attacks but theres always a more fun creative solution as well.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-28,"that is so good, amazing! also, i want to aknowledge, that the devs considered, somebody would do this and added this i guess? easteregg with your records being clean...i love stuff like this, makes the game feel alive for me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,"i love this video and your narration was insane, well done! i thought such a playthrough would be impossible!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,incredible run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"great job achieving this! also, your commentary is hilarious! loved the video!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-03,"this was something i had actually thought about but brushed aside as one of those impossible achievements, given the game's nature.. your absolutely amazing for having completed one whole sucessful run without directly killing anyone!!! made the impossible, possible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-21,"i'm absolutely obsessed with all those supercut style challenge videos of bg3. also, greaat video mate."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-25,"the way i met balthazar was that i was comically underleveled for the fight, so i save scummed like 50 times to lockpick the door and run away, and then out came balthazar to save my ass."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"705 you can open the door with knock since it's a non magical lock, so you can get there without getting any gems."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"getting the club of hill giant strength at the arcane tower and respecing your str into int would be really useful for a lot of the later ability checks. i havent watched most of the video yet since its 2 am and i have to go to work tomorrow, but i'd also probably dump con for wis. duegar's invis lets you basically ignore damage, and refreshes on the start of combat, so there is basically no need to get con. also, dipping one into light cleric for sanctuary and warding flare is really good for staying alive"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-25,"good job man, very fun watch, thank you for sharing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-13,in a normal playthrough you would kill hundreds of npcs. this challenge proves how versatile this game is. btw your channel is amazing. i appreciate your commitment to this game. maybe you can make a video about how many hours you spent for each challenge and the most challenging parts of them with including your thought processes.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-18,"the dedication? insane. honestly, good job on this because i deadass never thought this kinda play through wouldnt be possible"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-27,"you can convince the drider to give you the lantern, but have to roll dice 2 times. he gives it to you and leaves."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-09,137 there's a chest up there?!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,1100 so wait let me get that straight larian actually put dialog in the game just in case you did a peaceful run? go larian
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-14,"sensational, brother! very well done"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"it seems like you created bg version of dalai lama, that's awesome playthrough love dnd because of unlimited ways to resolve adventures"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-17,"you can talk the drider out of the moonlantern and then make him leave. so it's not you killing him, the shadow curse does."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"fun challenge, hope you do some more"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-17,all these companions seem pretty murdery i picked up minthara in moonrise towers lmfaooo
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-14,"this is actually amazing  as soon as saw the video, i thought but there's a bunch of fights your forced into and you showed them all haha"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,"here is the pinned comment the full series is out now! act 2 video can be found here httpsyoutu.be6ubfgxxliq act 3 video can be found here httpsyoutu.beuogimissdmm info on what tricksexploits are still working can be found below. update knocking out vendors no longer gives all of there unique items but it does give a few. update due to a balance change or possibly bug here is a new method to get pest control achievement. 1. use shovel in his invisible form or other invisible companions to destroy the two clusters of eggs that are furthest from the matriarch while outside of combat, before engaging the phase spider matriarch directly. this includes the cluster of eggs on the bottom level, as well as the cluster on the norther plateau, which can be reached by shovel by climbing down the vines to the south, then by moving them around the chasm to the north and climbing the cragged rock. the matriarch and other spiders must be far enough away for shovel to destroy the eggs without being detected. the final cluster of eggs is more difficult to destroy without alerting the matriarch. what i've found to work is use karlach to gain surprise on the matriarch with a flurry of blows. then use her action to throw a alchemist fire on the final cluster of eggs. if any remain unbroken, another party member can use a firebolt, magic missile, or other ranged attack to destroy them. sometimes the spider near the bottom cluster of eggs won't move away from them. in that case, you'll need to have another party member throw a second alchemist fire on that cluster while the matriarch and other spiders are still surprised. the matriarch will no longer die from falling in the chasm. however, major damage can be dealt by shooting out the web bridges from beneath the matriarch, which will cause it to take fall damage. you can also make use of potions of speed on karlach and laezel to help them kill the matriarch faster. as of 040624 patch 6 all of the following exploitstricks still work  how to get silver sword of the astral plane earlyin act 1. this still works to get the sword, but now seems to trigger an unavoidable combat. i would send in just one character the hireling to get the sword to drop. i would then have a character with high initiative alert feat, high dexterity, etc. run and grab the sword, then run backaway and flee combat. the hostile githyanki can be dealt with fairly easily upon reaching level 5 and it shouldn't negatively impact any questline. the game may determine that voss holds a crossbow instead of his greatsword. if that happens, i do not currently know of any way to get the silver sword to drop and it may not be obtainable. as of 040624 patch 6 the following still work as shown in the video  how to get all rewards from kagha encounter broodmothers revenge, pale oak, and faithwarden title.  how to get auntie ethels hair  still defeat her save everyone that can be saved. if you have to pick one, probably go with the hair!  how to give noblestalk mushroom to both shadowheart and derryth. if you have to pick one, derryth provides more tangiblemechanical benefits, once you get to act 3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-18,"the strict structure and sheer amount of work in this series is simply outstanding. i cannot understand why your pieces are not favoured by the algorithm because, as i hope you are aware of, they stand head and shoulders above any other similar content for bg3. your build tips alone are better, more relevant and more comprehensive than any other i've seen  and to be honest, i've seen quite a lot of them. for others new to the channel i most highly recommend the elden ring series, even if you have no intention of playing the game  it's that good. looking forward with great anticipation for act 2, and finally thank you very much for sharing your deep understanding of this genredefining game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-06,"i've been playing dd since it was released, and video games since they became a thing, and this is hands down the best tutorial  walkthrough i've ever seen. if you're not already, you'd make a formidable dm! thank you for all your work in putting this walkthrough together! i'm sure i'll be referencing it for a long time to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-01,"he is basically a human version of a perfect instruction manual for the game. i also realized, that i missed at least 60 of the game in act 1 alone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,"this guide is incredible. wanted so badly to enjoy this game but was constantly overwhelmed by it. this is the only guide that doesnt treat you like a dd master to begin with, but instead takes everything one step at a time so that youre a master by the end. cant endorse the effort and skills of this guy enough. he even answered my commented question from months later!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-12,"33803 if you don't get long rest triggered upon travelling to grymforge. take long rest whilst still in the creche, once rested then fast travel to grymforge and you should automatically trigger another long rest and the interaction with kith'rak voss."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-19,"i know some people really enjoy going blind into a videogame and im one of them, but after finishing act one completely on my own i really felt like i missed alot. so i paused my own playthrough and decided to follow along with a guide for a second playthrough and try and get everything and wow, i am so happy i found your guide! its perfect and im lovin' it, and so completely different from the way i played through act one the first time. thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,just wanted to say this guide has been a true life saver for me and my wife. this is the first video game she has taken a liking to ever and its my first turn based style so its quite a steep learning curve for me much less me trying to teach her. absolutely appreciate the detail and please keep it going!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-31,"anyone who wants the early act 1 silver sword of astral plane after patch 5. see below for extra guidance 1 do the same invisibilityblessing etc. setup shown except i just went with the hireling and karlach. 2 have karlach hide a good distance away on those big rock steps nearby is good and then do the disarming attack on voss with your hireling until he drops it. 3 at this point your hireling will just die from the fight so dont worry. 4 switch to karlach who shouldnt have been noticed and sneak while they are not looking to steal the sword, as soon as you steal go turn based immediately and then dash to safety without triggering any fight. 4 your dead hireling will be stuck in your party, to fix it at camp just have withers revive or entrust the body with him, then carry on. shatter happy new year and thanks for the guide i look forward to the next acts."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-23,"i simply would not have gotten into baldurs gate 3 if it werent for this guide, man. i bought the game, did the tutorial, killed gale with a healing potion by throwing it at him square in the jaw thinking that was how i could heal him and didnt pick the game back up. then like 2 months later i found these. tysm, mate. i love this game to death."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,thanks! you're guide is really super good have a beer! ive done it with a bardlock
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-07,"fantastic work! patch 6, balanced difficulty has me at 34 hrs to complete. differences with current patch cant knock out vendors and steal all the things you sold them. so money will not be as abundant. couldnt get asterion to bite me like in the guide. loaded save from day 3after getting withers, hit long rest and got it. thanks to another comment for that. couldnt get voss to visit at the end. got it from another comment, long rest inside creche, exit creche via walking, then fast travel to grymforge and he showed up. for spider achievement, i had to use karlach and a ranged weapon to destroy eggs as sneaking wasn't working like your run. looking forward to completing the guide, supporting along the way. hopefully patch 7 doesn't break anything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-25,i appreciate what you have done with this series. i did a valor bard in my play through and did what you did with the party members
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,this is the baldur's gate 3 of walkthrough guides. outstanding.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,"i had been looking for something exactly like this video and i never found anything remotely as helpful, i hate missing anything in a game as big as this and this video helped so much."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-04,"ive watching plenty of 'short' videos about the basics of the game, and they were all really complicated. didnt expect the 3 hours video to be more useful  thank you!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-21,i love enjoying 100 of a game and thanks to you i got to experience everything that act 1 of bg3 has to offer. thank you so much!

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-19,thanks! wonderful and comprehensive guide!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-14,"33112  i see what you did with that transition. i heard the 8bit noises and everything. thank you for this video, it's given me some great structure. i played all the way to act iii but had to take a rest, a year passed and now i'm trying again. act 1 is such varied beast but fantastic content, though it is nice to minimise time in the underdark. you don't know how relived i am to see the act 2 video is less than half the time of this video. 25 hours to get through act 1.. on my og playthrough i was over 50 hours but i want to smash act ii fast so you video will help greatly. thank you again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,"i just sank 200 hours into finishing the game. watching this, i realized i had no idea what i was doing and i now want to sink another 200 hours. thank you so much!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-15,thx you for making this guide. i imagine it took a very long time. your guide series on elden ring helped me tremendously
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-29,im so happy with this guide! i was so confused that i never finished the playthrough and now i have the confidence! job well done! you covered everything! thank you!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"something i found today completely by chance if you go to the druids grove, head to the makeshift prison and jump one more platform down from the secret exit. following the ledge, you should come across a pouch with an arrow of humanoid slaying and an arrow of arcane interface, as well as some silver. you can also get to the pouch by jumping through the hole in the roof where the paralyzed tiefling is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,"wow! im freakin impressed with your dedication to this guide. when i came across this, i fully expected it to be just gameplay with time stamps lol. in the first 10 mins ive alrdy learned 3 major features on controller i had no clue about after 30hrs. kudos to you sir"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-22,"these guides are life saver, im always paranoid about missing stuff when i play games like these and these honestly had been a god send!! thank you thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,this is for anyone not getting the arka grieving scene after the goblin fight in front the emerald grove gate. don't activate the fast travel sigil before going into the emerald grove as activating it will cause arka to travel somewhere else and you'll miss the grieving scene in this guide.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,13751 i cant steal the lockbox without only seeing me and neither of the guards even pay attention to the guitar playing lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,q how did you get karlack proficient in the returning pike as a monk?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-26,i have over 6 years of dming experience and you explain the larger mechanics of the ttrpg system better and more concisely than i ever have to new players and i mean that in the best way ive gotten so many of my friends behind bg3 through this guide
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-24,"i have followed this video all the way through, when i play rpg's like this, i don't have it in me to do a second playthrough, i really appreciate guides like this that give me a good direction to go in, knowing i won't miss anything thank you for helping this blue one! now for part 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-10,"man, i cant wait for your act 2 guide. hope it gets posted soon. love your guide. my party is on standby waiting for it. thanks for your efforts!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,mate ive got to say this series is just class ive always wondered just how much content and different methods of completing a quest there is so thanks so much man. also instructions were always clear to u do a good job bro
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-26,a quick note about the auntie ethel fight the only way i could get shadowheart far enough away to not get stuck in the conversation is to not have her in combat to begin with. the party does enough damage without the initial guiding bolt do make her bargain and then cast guiding bolt after gaining the hair. i hope this helps people who are stuck. i had to use an autosave right before descending to the bottom to get it right. ps my characters didn't hit lvl 5 until after the fight.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,damn this series is awesome and im sure took an insane amount of time to put together. thanks for helping us noobs out!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"after months of looking for a walkthrough  trophy run with feedback and as a bonus my favorite class sorcerer  finally i have found the ultimate guide for bg3, thank you so much for the effort you put in this!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-29,"amazing guide. seriously helped me through my first and second playthrough. though three things i found during both playthroughs in act 1 during the chapel ruins section i found that if anyone in your party can perceive it there is a button on one of the pillars near the sarcophagi that when used will deactivate the traps and that if you loot the entumed before opening the area where you would find withers it besicly defanges them, and limits them to only magic. also if you already have a scroll of misty step then when you leave the myconid colony to save baelen you could just do a strength saving throw to get it to him. with him far from there before i had karlach as a monk try for the noblestalk it was a lot less stressful and made it easer to get to it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-15,"for anyone trying to get the legendary silver sword in act 1 as of 41424 you can still get the hireling, but have only the hireling go and get the sword to drop. once the sword drops, pick it up as the hireling and move it to your inventory. the hireling will die but you will be fine if everyone else is sneaking a good distance away"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"in addition to my other comment, i would also like to show you gratitude with deeds"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-18,"14414 all of this is completely unnecessary if you don't free rugan before going to grab the stuff in the back. the reason they are hostile is not because you beat down the guys in the front but because you freed rugan. just leave him alone till you do all the stealth shenanigans to get the stuff in the back and then make a decision about how you want to deal with rugan. i was dark urge and just killed rugan because he is of no consequence later on in the game and...well...dark urge, duh. after i killed rugan, the guys in back were still neutral so no need for all the invisibility potion and jumping as it is a waste of resources and way too fiddly and over complicated."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-26,"i don't know where you came from, but detailing in a pleasant and understandable way a game as complex as this one, which has thousands of possibilities, that's not normal. you're out of the ordinary my friend, simply fantastic. thank youuuuuuuuuuu"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-28,i gave up on baldurs gate when it came out because i felt so overwhelmed and having never played dd before made me not get all that invested in the story. this may get me back to playing again and hopefully beating it. thanks.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-20,"hey man. amazing guide. thank you for all your hard work. just one note about the asterion bite scene. i followed along doing everything, but there was one point when at camp, i spoke to asterion, and he told me about being a vampire. i think this conversation voids the biting scene. i had been doing what you said saving at the beginning of every new day, and reverted back to the start of day 3. didn't do anything else other than long rest, and the scene came up the next long rest. just thought i'd mention it in case anybody else hasn't got the scene. thanks again for the amazing work. can't wait for act 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-29,24334 if you have near to you the king mushroom the companion they will attack you no matter what. make him go away by controlling it and talk to the guy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-13,finally someone made a real guide for baldur gate 3. everyone else is making guides for dd pros. thank you friend i appreciate your work.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,i remember this dudes guides.. theyre pretty much flawless and more informative than anything else you can find
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-26,for merkon i found that casting sanctuary on him helps a lot. he can't be targeted while its on him because he will never attack so it doesn't end early.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-03,i can't say thank you enough. i'd be so lost without these guides. thank you very much for sharing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-21,"thanks a ton for these videos. your elden ring series was incredible and now im on another journey in bg3, thanks for being my guide"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-22,"i just hope you have a amazing day. you have no idea how helpful this video is ! i love the game but is my first time playing anything like this, im completely lost in the most basic things"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-18,"this video deserves more views. havent seen a tutorial like this for a video game, ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,okay i've watched so many guide videos before playing the game. i finally got it last night and was so lost. i'm watching this guide now and i feel like everything is falling into place. now i can't wait to get home and try again fresh with a new character lol. i messed so many things up early on
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-08,"so i followed this guide from start to finish all 3 acts, and he got everything but 3 unique items. act 1 the club of hill giants strength in the arcane tower on the floor with bernard the robot act 2 the shadow blade ring at camp after you find arabella's parents act 3 duke ravengards sword in the underwater throne allows you to get the maximum charisma in the game past 22 if you do everything right"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-05,the best bg3 guide video by a long shot its not even close
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-09,"as someone who found your channel through your er guides, i was beyond excited to see you have bg3 guides too since i just started playing. thanks for the guides and the time you put into them!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-24,tried just playing and figuring out as i went along but after watching this video i saw so much that i missed. so many great tips.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,to save some people some trouble the knocking out the merchants has been patched. i also think knocking them out no longer makes them upset with just the person who attacked but because it showed my whole party as losing attitude so i ended up going back on my previous save and smipping it all together
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-17,watching and realizing just how much i missed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-18,"3720 i could be missing something, but i'm pretty sure this exploit has been patched out of the game by now. i made a few attempts and successfully knocked this shopkeeper out, but i found that his available inventory upon defeat was far smaller than what was seen in this video, with only about 5 items available to loot even after i sold all my junk. it also seems the shopkeeper's attitude towards the entire party was soured, not just the first person to attack. it may be worth updating the description of this vid so players know i gotta echo the sentiment of other commenters, this guide is incredible. i'll probably return and comment again if i find anything else that is outdated"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-28,bless you for making my first steps more easy. it gave me a better perspective on what is even possible in this game. i felt quiet overwhelmed.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-17,"as a lifetime gamer and a 2x war veteran with ptsd, this game has been huge for me.this is hands down thee best game walkthrough series ever created! goated!!. made one of the best games i have ever played 10x more amazing to experience. bravo! your hard work and dedication to this is appreciated bruv!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-01,obsessed with this video guide. it's helped me realize that there's so many more places to go in act 1. i did half of what's in this video and this video has helped me piece together the differences by doing things in different order. thank you for this video!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,i hate the algorithm sometimes. all your guide videos should be over 100k views given the quality of them and effort.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-03,"amazing guide, very detailed and thorough perfect for the beginner. regarding saza, im sure everyone knows after patch five you can recruit minthara using non lethal attacks but you can also knock out saza at the goblin camp after she turns hostile as well and she will also be in moonrise towers enabling you to get the achievement. you get more experience from clearing the camp than defending the grove and you dont put the no one left behind achievement at risk because of a tiefling dying during the raid"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-26,shatter your straight up killing it! i think i did maybe a quarter of this on my first place through and not nearly as well. im a little off script but im having a blast
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-04,"im 100 gonna replay this using this guide to give me a better understanding of the game ! i followed your black myth guides , they were awesome mate"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-17,your guide is amazing. it really has helped to fill in a lot of the blanks that the game doesn't bother to explain. you got yourself a new sub.thank you for posting.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-12,"aweseome video, love it, thanks alot. maybe worth mentioning spider matriarch pushing death is only patched out on tactical difficulty and higher. so for someone who doesnt enjoy the fight, turning down the difficulty just for this action might be worth it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-02,"many heartfelt thanks for your outstanding guide and huge respect for the work behind it  especially for people with limited time but joy and interest in bg3, it is extremely useful. if i may ask the following questions i have read the other comments, but haven't found any answers yet is there any reason not to use balanced as the difficulty level, instead of starting with tactican, if several playthroughs are necessary anyway, other than not getting that one achievement in this playthrough? 1. what should i pay attention to if my main character is a paladin? my party mainly includes astarion, shadowheart, and gale. i would like to cover the stories of the others as much as possible, but i'm not sure how to proceed without having to play mainly with other companions to follow your guide. what should i consider for this? 2. i've seen in many guides that traders are knocked out, but i wonder if there's any disadvantage to extinguishing the light sources around the traders and just stealing everything relevant with astarion and then teleporting away to a waypoint, so as not to get caught? this works multiple times in the same day without resting. 3. i noticed that you optimize resting very much and only take a full rest when absolutely necessary. this is probably maximally efficienteffective for strong players, but is there any disadvantage to being more generous and resting more often? you have enough camp supplies. does this prevent certain achievements? i would be incredibly grateful for answers, as i fear i might realize too late that i have made a mistake. for 2024, i wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-15,"32900 you should have 2 elixir of heroism at this point, with that and resistance cantrip, you should be okay. but definitely save first. you don't have to roll a critical 20. the roll is 30 on honor mode i got a 32."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,"i just want to say thank you for this guide, it's because these videos exist that i'm finally able to enjoy this game. i tried going in blind but the combat was so overwhelming and i didn't know what i was doing a lot of the time. what's worse is every time i tried looking up a guide to explain how combat, leveling, and companions work they all act as if you're already a master of the game and these systems and so were never helpful. thanks to you though i can now say that baldurs gate 3 is one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-16,it's much easier to follow your cues for cardinal directions with the minimap locked into north orientation. fantastic guide!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-27,"it was fun killing spider the normal way. took me a while .. used posion resist elixir aoethrow the potion on top of ur party than use it one on everyone except karlack and used poison resist spell on her from shadowheart to start. then sneak destroyed eggs like u said in ur comment, then waited for right time when mother spider was on web and used shift  spacce and used fire spell on her web to knock her down. and used speed potion on just karlack and beat the fck out of spider before she even got her turn. once shes dead rest were easy to clear. i dunno why but i got lev 4 right there doing the normal way. think they added bonus exp to her now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,after many frustrating attempts to push the spider queen down into the pit i did some research and apparently the devs removed the mechanic that allows you to push her into the chasm. i'm in for a difficult fight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-13,"love the content. the issue i can't seem solve is the swamp situation auntie ethel  the mephits all join combat no matter how i kill that first one. how did you avoid aggroing the whole place? edit i see you actually started with only the sorc on the field! i did the same, sniped the first guy on my own and it didn't trigger the rest. was able to port everybody back in after that!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,"was able to bypass killing masks and ethel summoning adds even with an unideal comp had wyll, astarion, lae'zel, and druid tav. turn 1 astarion throws water at cage, stopping ticking clock. then, basically just overwhelmed her with status to skip the summoning turn hunger of hadar, menacingtrip attacks, moonbeam. before her next turn had plenty of damage even unoptimized with astarion double hand crossbow peppering her, moonbeamhadar guaranteed damage, and laezel titanstring bow a few times. tactician not honor so take that with a grain of salt. no speed elixir, no hill giant strength  perfectly fine choices but i just want to emphasize how much flexibility this game gives you even 8 months after this video was initially posted. hope it can give someone some ideas  thanks op for the amazing guide that's dictated basically my whole path for act 1 even if i've done totally different things for fights."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-27,"just a tip for hitting level 2 before fighting the intellect devourers, you can either hit the middle button in the nautaloid ship so they give xp, or jump up to the chest above the locked door on the beech, right on the other side of the waypoint atop the arch. either will give you enough xp to level up. you should also be able to maim the intellect devourer friend, us, and then fight the other ones on the ship while you have laezel"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"it's actually super cool to see the work of multiple speedrunners have put into bg3 shown here even if a little. the mindflayer colony jump isn't as easy as bouch made it seem and is actually a run killer most of the time and it's nicknamed braincat jump as intellect devourers are technically brain cats 3 if you were ever wondering how the jumps through walls work, it's simply put a mixture of spamming the jump input and the clicking input to force the game to jump regardless of whether or not you could make the jump. you can do this almost anywhere in the game with varying results and it's actually really silly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-30,"after the adventure ends, the news read baldur's gate.. saves itself?"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"ahhh yes, baldur's gate 3  social anxiety edition."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-26,"1753 i can't stop laughing at what this must have looked like from myrkuls perspective out of nowhere the source of his chosens immortality is released from her bonds and as kethric turns towards this inexplicable event he is instantly torn apart by a dozen arrows appearing out of thin air in the opposite direction. reflexively, in an act of desperation, the lord of bones summons his avatar and in the same breath it fucking explodes. the god of death probably stayed out of mortal machinations for few centuries after that."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"i want a omniscient perspective where you see kedric thorm, etc get randomly killed and people just randomly dying"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"1910 that gith fight there is one way to avoid being spotted, but doing it requires talking to the pixie so it wouldn't help you in this run. you can use the animal form transformation from the pixie while behind that portal then long rest as an animal and you wont be put into ur bed. you can do the same thing to skip the entire kethric fight pixie transform can tp out of maps that are red. you can go straight to act 3 without even fighting kethric that way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"funny how with everybody making jokes in the last few videos about him eventually beating the game just by looking at it, he instead chooses to beat the game without the game seeing him."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-06,"regular people don't even know you're there. great villains only know that you maybe exist. interplanary beings are aware of you, but can never get you. and only a literal god and a slithery genie in your hand are the ones who have ever seen you"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"if dont worry, it will work itself out was an invisible halfling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"this is incredible, i say as i click on yet another bouch video that manages to exceed my expectations of what he can do in this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"418 if you're looking for the parasite, you can just take the headband from findal and use it to unlock the secret door past the poison vents straight to the druid library. just click on the gate with it equipped and it opens. using the same headband, you can exit the library into nettie's area."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-30,"you can actually get the parasite in the grove without being seen if you equip the crown findal drops, you can open the big stone door into halsin's chamber and get the parasite. it is the same one nettie wears and functions the same way, too."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-31,"i was so excited to see this video! it's unlikely you ever saw my comment, but when you jokingly asked for suggestions in the cheesewheelvideo, i commented about an allstealth run and to see this idea as a video now makes me very happy!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-11,idea 1. beat baldurs gate by only giving enemys conditions so the only way to do damage is through conditions. idea 2. only use improvised weapons. idea 3.ever level you need to multiclass. idea 4. kill everyone idea 5. only use parasite powers. idea 6. you cant pick up anything off the ground so no looting you can only trade with traders. idea 7. a pacifist. idea 8. get every companion to leave your party.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-08,"almost any time i see people do temple of shar, i'm surprised how many times i see balthazar usually appear at the nightsong encounter. he never did that for me, cause i was always like imma backstab this guy the moment i can, so i always kill him before then. i didn't even know he'll appear there, actually, until i saw it in some of your vids, and other bg3 challenge run vids from other youtubers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"hey, dm. i got an op build i wanna try for this campaign. where'd you find it? well, it's a baldurs gate 3 build nopenopenopenope banned but seriously though, imagine how badass this run is from everyone else's perspective. there's just a shadow roaming the land killing everyone. only few actually know their identity and only the gith actually seem to have any form of credible sighting of them. i could see this making for a really fun solo dnd campaign where you play as a shadow assassin that can never be seen, and if anybody ever sees you, especially confirms your identity, then you must kill them before they can tell anyone else."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-18,"440 the parasite saw you, run over"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,i can literally see this as a manga where the protagonist is too shy to be seen by anyone
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"this reminds of palarandusk the oldest living dragon in dnd lore, he is a gold dragon who is, 8000 yrs old, to the point that his body just stopped existing and he got stuck halfway through being dead, popping in and out of the ethereal plane, being always invisible, defending baldurs gate hey look at that unseen. he recently retired from the big city and is now defending a small gnome village in the mountains. he was known as the unseen protector and he is level 36 in dnd the level cap for players is 20 so yeah, absolute beast. also, when he pops into the material plane i deteriorates his body even further so he chooses to only pop some body parts for a few seconds at a timd, so imagine you are an orc raiding a random gnome settlement and suddeling, the head, just the head nothing else, of a gold great wyrm, that is, a head the size of a house, and drops a fire breath strong enough to reduce gortashs entire fortress into ash in less than a second."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,"by the way you probably know this but when you sell a pouch or any sort of container to a merchant and after that put all of that merchant's stock into the container, when you kill them all of the things inside of the container will still be there and that's a neat way to get all the stock of a merchant. you can also put all of the items in the container and after that take a partial rest and do it again so you can get a lot of scrolls of revivify, arrows, potions and scrolls."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-22,"killing mykul like that made me laugh. imagine you, a god of death, getting summoned and immediately die to 30 powder barrels."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-30,"by the way, if you kill findal under the grove, he has the crown to open nettie's lab from behind, so you could get the drow parasite without her seeing you. i know it's too late for this run, but it could be interesting to know for future playthroughs"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-30,bouch you are my favorite challenge youtuber
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,"i remember accidentally breaking the game like you did in act two and entering the mindflayer colony before finding aylin, so pretty funny that you used the same exact trick in this challange"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-29,i enjoy this videos so much and appreciate the effort u make to beat this gem of a game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-21,"since you killed findal in the cave towards the druid grove, you can loot the key of nature from him and enter the grove directly inside halsim's lab, and get access to the parasite there without even talking to nettie. to go to the lab, instead of following the rute that takes you to the grove's prison, you have to jump in the wall close to where the goblins are guarding findal, and you get to another secret door."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-31,that persona5 music in the background xd amazing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-31,huge plus for me for the use of the song price from persona 5. price fits so perfectly in that goofystealth catch  see me if you can  run

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,i really cant wait for patch 7 it will be a huge gane changer for console players as there gonna add mods....the chance to now be able to be a level 12 sorceror and a level 12 fighter will be fire
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-04,i despise turn based combat. but this game is something special
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,"it's funny this popped up for me right after i've decided to do another run through, this time rp'ing as a marine who got isekai'd with a usmc outfit, armor, and guns. it's so fun."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,"for me, this is the best game ever made. it's just incredible, a true masterpiece in every aspect...larian did amazing job"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"out of pure spite for dragon age the veilguard, i bought this game 20 minutes ago for 60.61 usd on ps5 lol and after playing the demo yesterday, i love it. super excited for this install to finish here in 5 minutes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-09,i really need to just un install all my other games and focus on bg3. ive not even put in 10 hours cuz when i load it im always overwhelmed
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-20,"ive never played a game with so much depth. im 5 hours in and feel like ive done nothing but i cant stay away. even the side quests have intriguing narratives, more so than some other aaa games entirely."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-04,"i have 28 hours in the game, just left act1, now on my way to moonrise tower. but, what i liked in dos2 is that every new map, you had a little town where you could trade. will i come across a place any time soon? i have lots of stuff to sell haha"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,the best game of all timeit is currently on sale on ps store. this game is at 20 off and dos2 is at 60 off.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,such a great game that came out of nowhere for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,i hope the patch 7 is finally gonna bring updated act 3 with vulkan optimisation. it's still feels like stuttery mess.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,still hope they eventualy give halsin a tent when you also recruited minhtara. also it would be good if they get doalogue with each others. cuz they totally ignore each other.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,"glad i finally got it from steam, 50 hours in and yet on act 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,"i spent 3,000 us on two gaming pcs just so my brother and i could play it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-10,its been a year already?? it just came out lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-30,glad i brought this game i was not sure at first but it is a great game and worth my money.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-26,"this game is phenomenal in so many ways. there are things that bug me though that i wish larian would address. the slow loading on ps5 is pretty inexcusable. it feels like i am back innthe ps3 days and not using an ssd. i don't know why its like that. for accessability and just to make the mini map objectives clearer, it would be handy if we could highlight the one we want to do with a different colour or marker. sometimes with so many yellow markers it is frustarting and hard to see. i tried using the custom marker and then it shows on the map but not the mini map. my other gripe and this one drives me mental. its not constant, but it happens is when firing a cross bow or bow, sometimes my character randomly walks forward even though all i am doing and telling the game to do is aim at an enemy. i wish the game would not do that, or randomly go up or down a ladder even when you don't highlight the ladder. small things but things that could be improved. outside of that though i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,"just started another playthrough. i have lost count how many. i plan on doing my first durge runs when 7.0 hits and a non durge evil run. i have played the game for thousands of hours and have yet to finish it with bard, paladin, sorc, wizard, several races. i have yet to probably even experience some 3050 percent of the game even though i have thousands of hours and can complete it on tactician."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,"just finished my second playthrough as darkurge. 300 hours total, going to wait a month and start a paladin playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,i usually like sports games and shooters but decided to try something different and bought this a couple weeks ago. best decision ever lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,i wish they would add keyboard support for the xbox. a lot of games already do
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,i just bought a ps5 and this game its amazing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,im at act 3 in honour mode and taking a break lol merkle broke my soul after fighting him 3 times
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-26,"a true masterpiece, in every sense."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,"this was the one game that topped the witcher 3 for me. i know they are wildly different games, but im just talking about the enjoyment factor. the witcher 3 was the best game ever made in my opinion, but this game topped it for me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,i loved bgii. dont know what didnt click me with bgiii
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,"i just bought it on sale on psn, man, it oozes quality, and i have played alot of rpg's in the past, but i absoluetely suck so far."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,1 year later? im still at the beginning of
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-07,"how are you going to say in spite of larian's track record? have you never played dos 2? when larian was selected as bg3's next developer, it was a sure bet this game would blow up in success. their style of gameplay development was the only choice wotc should have made, logically."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-16,"taken me a year to play it, and not even done with act 3. there's so much to do and it's a really hard game for me at least"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-21,why hasnt microsoft reached out for them to make a fallout spinoff yet?!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-13,i wish they would have fixed the multiplayer issues on xbox. this game is so fun with other players.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,"i took a couple months since i felt like act 3 was starting to lose me , might go back and give it a chance"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,i really want to try this game out but i'm not really into turn based games.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-22,"maybe its really late to ask this, but did the loading time on ps5 get any better? i saw a lot of people saying this game's loading can go to 3050 second or even 2 mins on ps5, is this still true?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,goat
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-13,"i always end up going back to elden ring and bg3, its almost hard to play any other games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,"game looks interesting, i never played this type of game im more into the soulike games but this gives me diablo style of game which i did enjoy but not really my preference. maybe when it hits the 20 mark i will purchase. also wondering is it hard going into this game not knowing anything and not haven't played this style of game at all?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,i'd start a third playthrough of it if i wasn't in the middle of octopath traveller 2.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,carlock? you mean karlach?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,what a game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,i'm still on act 2 trying to beat ketheric thorn and romance astarion
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-13,played like 95 of act 1 and like half of act2 i think with my old ass trash laptop on barely 30 fps and insane loading times.. now since im having an way better setup.. its an complete diff universe.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,"still waiting for crossplay. i bought bg3 for my buddy for christmas. hes on xbox, i'm on pc and we still can't play together."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-12,play now or wait for patch 8
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-06,im still trying to get through the game lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-04,"i'm sorry my dear gamingbolt, but with that huge patch 8 incoming, an avalanche of new features and content, you'll have to to that video again . no kiddin ? 12 subclasses ?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-02,its just a year why it wont be good? dragon age origins is still good and its from 2009 imagine a 2023 game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,i like storydriven games. is this a game for me?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-19,"...and game will stay a beast in 2030, and probably also 2035..  not to sound like a larian sycophant or anything, but bg3 is just one of the those games, you only get once a decade..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,i didn't manage to finish the game. my last save file was a section in act 3 when u are suppose to cross a bridge into the main city with an automaton guarding the entrance. i stop there and never touch the game since. reason? i think i played it wrongly. i have a total of 90 hours in just act 1 and 2. there are so much content it indirectly overwhelm me. i got burnout. but this is still one of those games you need to play before you die and i'm not even a turn based rpg fan.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,the video talking about technical issues is nonsensical on playstation anyway. i had zero issues through 860 total hours played except for 2 crashes. that is it. maybe issues with pc or xbox but not ps5.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,"so i dont follow these types of games at all, but it pretty well looks like a board game on a screen? people actually pay thousands of dollars on gaming rigs and hundreds of dollars on consoles and controllers to play this? i will never understand."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-18,"i still dont see how this game won goty, especially over zelda  totk"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,but why is the download size so big? great game but this type of game shouldnt take up that much space.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,if only your character didn't awkwardly stand around and get skipped over during cutscenes...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,the islam bots are back in the comment section again.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-11-18,"this game is quite an achievement, but it has a major flaw in my view, a deal breaker turnbased combat. in the tabletop version, it makes sense that combat is turnbased, but making a videogame version was an opportunity to free it from the constraints of the tabletop version, yet the developers chose to retain it. in a video game, it's absurd and counterimmersive that combatants take it in turns to put up no defence while taking a beating."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,sh too hard for no reason at all. i bought it but never recommended it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,"thanks to the mods that remove the queerdoness, this game is now topnotch!"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"oh evelyn my beloved, how much i wish to tell you how beautiful you are. like a supernova in the night sky, you outshine all else, neither the heavy void of darkness nor the radiance of all the other stars could ever match yours. never will anyone be able to suppress your beauty, when they close their eyes, your light permeates through their eyelids be it thick or thin. dozens of perfectly cut diamonds could never be worthy enough to buy one look from you into my eyes, you can relieve me of all my darkness which i have hoarded, milleniums worth of malignant evil eating away at my fragile soul, my conscience which has almost died. oh, oh, a look into your beautiful face made me remember the reason for my living, for a worthless human being like me to still think that oh, if i could only have you turn around and give me a glance that lasts even a split second, i would give everything and anything. oh dear evelyn, please turn to look at my side, even for a mere moment but it is not a wish but an only if but never forget my evelyn, if ever i achieve greatness, you are my reason, the one who's radiance broke through the walls erected by great evil although it could not oppose the purity of your raw beauty. oh evelyn, oh evelyn, pray tell, could i wish to god for you when i die? or are you something that i will never deserve. oh evelyn, oh evelyn, you have saved my drowning soul, thankyou"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"close to 3500 hours playing this masterpiece, 6 times i finished the game before patch 5 and honour mode, and now, i can't play on lower difficulties, gotten use to legendary actions, and after so many hours invested, i know almost every nook and cranny, suprisingly, i still find new stuff and equipment! finished honour mode 13 times now..my lates discoveries is ring that volo has in his offer, never thought to open a trade dialogue with him, and it's one of the best items in the game for a healer, gives everyone bless status for 2 turns when healing, combined with those gloves that zevlor gives you as a reward for dealing with kagha, they add blade ward for also 2 turns! speaking of kagha, once i realized she wears great necklace, i never try to convince her to see reason again  that necklace add 1d6 poison damage if someone heals you! in underdark region where fish people are, there's a secret ledge that contains a chest with great armor, that disengages you when you're healed, only, it's a dangerous place, there's exploding mushroom hidden in the corner, that throws you off the ledge, the answer is jumping to the very end of the ledge, to avoid triggering the explosion"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"now i'm playing dos2, i can't find any new game that would excite me the same way bg3 did, so i went back for their previous masterpiece! i like crafting system in dos2, i think that is the only thing that bg3 lacks, more intricate crafting system, not just alchemy, to create new stuff, and even improve armor and weapons, like in dos2 with eternal artifacts and elemental essences"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,my first play through and i know i missed stuff! my second play through will be interesting so much to do and see and fight with all your choices matter!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"great review, you will likely seal my decision to try the game out. almost feel obligated at this point lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,36 hours in and already considering a karlach romance run
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,1000 hours and counting. cant wait for patch 8!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,"i dont get the title if something worth it, than year dosent mater, unless its one of those launched bad but got better deals, or graphics matter to person which is a mater of personal tolerance, bg3s not really of either case."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-05,"ok, bg3 is gonna be worth it for another decade and more"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,"im on the fence between this game, dragon age veilgard and dragons dogma 2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"i love dnd tremendously but i don't love this game and i can't identify why. don't get me wrong, i like the game. i think it deserves all the praise it gets and more but something about it doesn't do it for me. i guess i wish the ui was more simple. and i wish the characters were less horny. my best guess is when i picture dnd, this version of it isn't what i have in my head."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,it will be a standout in 20 years
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,at 60 hrs i've only just begun
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"i would love to get this gane but my god , it just seems like it will take soo much time to play this , between all the micromanaging and turn based gameplay im not sure id have the time to stay eith it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,i have tried and tried i just cant get into the turn based combat... im having a blast with kcd2 though probably my favorite game of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,im tryna figure out if this is the video game from when i was younger lets seeeeeeee
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,am i the only one who wasn't able to get into this game? i finished witcher multiple times with dlc but for some reason i cannot get into this game. also kingdom come 2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,anyone else open the video to see if he tried to say no
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,i'll know when 4 is being released with zero news  the price of 3 will finally drop beyond a token sale price. games that get positive reviews always want to milk it hard and long.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-18,"i'm trying to find some motivation to continue to play past act 1 and the only reason i haven't deleted the game is because i spent so much time modding it. but it has been nothing but mediocre so far. would be even worse in its vanilla state. the whole dd system outright sucks for crpgs, it simply wasn't designed for them, which results in an awful combat system, unnecessary dialogue rolls etc. the companions are somewhat bleak and most of them save for lae'zel ... and shadowheart, i guess are very annoying, especially karlach. visually there's nothing to write home about either. the story is... well.. i can't be the judge of that yet. but anyway, i don't see what all the hype is about."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,all i wanna know is... jiggle physics or nah.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-01,cant decide if i should buy poe2 or this.... never played any of the other bg lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-13,it's been only a year ofc it's fucking worth it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-21,most pointless question ever. yes! lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-07,can i play with friends or run into randoms in the world?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"gg you sold it, im buying it now at 20 off"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,itll be worth it in 3025
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,gameplay and concept are great but act 3 is so terrible i quit. game is too woke
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"no. you cant play it for a few minutes here and there, it requires all of your time. generally you wont really level up very often, but hopefully youll enjoy walking and talking. i really dont care about gay or transexual people, but this game is so unrealistic with how absolutely everyone throws themselves at you the first chance they get the warrior party member, geth maybe, she hated humans one sentence, but was happy to have my human males babies the next. also, you get some druid at your camp from act 1, who was a pretty important character, but he immediately throws his  at you once hes at camp it was just laughable again, my white dude main . then act 3 was so laggy and bad, and i said forget these refugees, we need the ppl of bg to be safe and well off first and i was met with such hostility at every turn. its okay, devs, we get it. i spent 70 on it and got exactly 70 hours out of it. so i got my dollar an hour. but its so queer and contrite ill definitely never install it again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,love the game!but wish the character you pay voice the lines you pick. my only complaint of a amazing game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-17,reason i didn't pick it up is that i watched some cutscenes and dialogue and it all seemed written in that annoying contemporary millennial style that also turned me off from watching any tv shows or movies.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"bg 3 is like.....im sorry if im inappropriate, but....a healthy bodybuilder athlete in its prime competing at the paralympics. the others never had any chance. they were too busy being inclusive, special, strong and proud ok ok ok i'll stop. but yeah, in this sh'tfest industry it seems, the only thing you have to do to become a super extreme bestseller is .... being old. retro. oldtimey. just oldtimey, ok for nicer wording classic simple game mechanics, classic writing, classic characters. oh, and an actual focus on writing and decisions mean something. i mean, how hard can that be.....obviously for our stronk and proud industry....extremely hard!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,"i found the combat to be more boring than watching paint dry, im sure d and d fans love slow boring chess combat, and companions who dont do anything in combat unless you do it for them, but i prefer a fast paced combat game, and it has gay annoying companions with dialogue for 12 year olds , that game is a 210 for me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,best game of all time!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-23,i really dont like rpgs
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"i just dont like turn based combat and top down . if it was like witcher 3 style rpg , it would be awesome . turn base combat and top down view stopping me from starting bg3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,if it wasn't for the better graphics and sound i think the first baldur's gate was so much better
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"no,skyrim with a.i made bg 3 obsolete"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,bg3 is not a baldursgate game sure its good dnd game.. 5e alone is absolute trash
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,my comment got banned! comment again and like for yt algorithm
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,hey guys its zelensky
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"i just couldnt get into this game. to me, it was basically a walking simulator. the turn based combat was sooooo boring."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,lowkey hate this game its not that good and very frustrating for all the wrong reasons
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,boring ass game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,hello nyxson my name is isaiah and i have something important to say to you. god loves you and like any father he wants to help you and keep you safe especially from the devil. but i am not just speaking to you about this i am also talking to your fans about this god loves you all. an he wants us all to be saved not just from ourselves but from the devils clutches. do not be afraid to come to the lord for his love is for evreyone shalom shalom.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-01,patch 5 addressed a fair few of my criticisms which you can see here httpsyoutu.beqpyiql7k39e
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,a game that filled the hole in our hearts where bioware used to be
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,everyone this game will take years to fully experience! mort hold my 100.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,i legit cracked a smile when you said doing this allowed you to pay off your house. nobody deserves it more mort  much success to you and your channel.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i think one aspect that sets larian studios crpgs apart from other crpgs that it does not get a lot of praise for is the immersivesim esque approach to problem solving people have no idea how hard it is to develop these kind of gameplay mechanics, its not just an rpg from narrative and reactivity perspective, but also from a gameplay perspective spells and abilities can be used in and outside the combat, you see a fire? you can put it out, you see a corpse? you can cast a spell and question the dead, dead refuse to talk to you? well you can shapeshift into something else then talk to it again, cant jump down without dying? well you can cast feather and then jump down, thats what elevates bg3 from other crpgs for me and i hope more games will learn from it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"mort, i really appreciate what you do. if it wasn't for your channel, i wouldn't have even tried to get into content creation. love the work you put in."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"11 playthroughs..truly one of the hardest working gaming youtubers. massive respect to you, mort, and hope the channel keeps growing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,raphael works hard but mort works harder
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"congratulations on paying off your house mort! personally, i really enjoy your build ideas and would be happy to see more of those for bg3, rogue trader or other crpgs to come."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"at long last the coveted bg3 review and its movie length, congrats on finally getting this out mortismal!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"great review! we all know bg3 is a fantastic game, but thank you for being honest and pointing out it's few flaws. also, congratulations on paying off your house. being debt free sure feels good."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,two things i was most excited about when i got bg3 playing the game and the mort 100 review. looking forward to grabbing beer and listening tomorrow. congratulations man.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"i'm happy for you, morty. even during the worst crpg droughts i never gave up on the genre, and i can't wait to talk to all the new people that bg3 will hopefully bring into the fold. i'm excited for what might happen next now that bg3 has proven that, when done right, aaa crpgs can be both critical and commercial successes. and i'll keep tuning in here to get all the latest crpg news and reviews. as for the review itself, imo, bg3 is a game with a lot to praise, some nitpicks which don't warrant much discussion, and a small, small number of genuine issues. if larian fixes anything in a 'complete edition', i hope they 1 add a real epilogue, and 2 fix the act 3 performance issues. the way the game ends so suddenly is almost unforgivable after the epic journey that brings you there. and while act 1 ran buttery smooth for me, by the time i got to act 3 i was literally getting sometimes less than half the fps i started the game with."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,500 hours and 11 play throughs?! ive done about 150 hours and 1.5 playthroughs and im burned out! you're a machine
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,i feel like i just watched a tiger mom chastise her kid for getting an a instead of an a lol it's clear how passionate you are with games like this and it's great to see such an in depth review. thanks again for your hard work and i hope this video does well with the algorithm!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i don't own a pc and neither do i own a ps5 yet. i planned on buying a ps5 and bg3 on black friday this year because i'm such a huge fan of choice driven rpgs like this. that and i'm also taking a week off from work to play this game  thank you so much for helping keep the hype around this game alive. i can't wait to dive right into it after thanksgiving
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,wowjust wow..a truly herculean effort. congrats man! the only spoiler here is the way mort spoils us with the quality of his reviews.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-21,"im soooo very thankful i gave this game a chance! i have went on to 100 bg3 and beat honour mode, played through dos2 and im now probably about halfway through pathfinder wrath of the righteous. if it wasnt for bg3 i would never have even considered something like pathfinder and i am very grateful to mort for helping me through all above titles. if anyone reading this is on the fence about playing this masterpiece just give it a couple of hours and dont get disheartened at first if things dont go your way. it truly is one of the best games ever made and i dont say this lightly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-30,you know larian is the best when most of the small complaints mentioned in the video have actually been fixed since making this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,this is amazing. the quality of your videos are gold standard
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,12401 mortim bro.you are a rare breed my friend! truly happy to have you here. congrats on paying off your house!!! what a huge win! keep up the great work my guy!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i'm so glad your amazing bg3 content turned out to be so profitable as well. thanks for a glorious review, and for the rest of the content you're producing without drop in quality and quantity. i personally started to explore the crpg genre thanks to your videos, and i can't wait for rogue trader release and incoming flow of dedicated content on your channel"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"the legend strikes again! congratulations on another 100, specially on this one, mort!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,thank you for telling us about the unique scenes for each companion when you play as each origin character.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"your critiques are really fair. ive been shocked at the difficulty, as both divinity games beat me to a pulp at times just on the standard difficulty! i think my extreme familiarity with 5e is probably helping me, but im still amazed at how little tactician is challenging me. would love to see a video on what you think the future of the genre might look like after the unprecedented success of bg3, as well at looking at announced games in a sort of preview format. congrats on the success and the 100!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"as a crpgdd newbie struggling through explorer mode, its very hard to imagine tactician being too easy. but your guides have been a huge help, mort!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"abdel adrian is mentioned in a book in the counting house about the past dukes of bg. with minthara, talking about how she feels about us being the saviours of the city and how she thinks she won't be accepted due to her drow heritage, the player can say the previous duke was a bhaalspawn. just thought i'd mention that it definitely confirms abdel. great vid."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,well spoken about the negatives. bg3 is a fantastic game but i feel like the negatives get swept under the rug. act 3 just deflates after the buildup of acts 1  2 and made me actually take a break and instead play cyberpunks dlc. you easily feel how stuff was cut and how the 2 other big bads feel crammed in. you rightfully pointed out it does so much better than dos2 even with the enhanced edition but i hope larian learns how to fully stick the landing without any stumbles in the future
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-24,thanks!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,you deserve a medal for even considering the thought of 100ing this game!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"all right, i havent started the video yet. but one hour and 24 minutes? let me go get some popcorn and grab a drink oh and also let me not forget thank you mortim you are a grand soul!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i simply believe it is the best approximation of an actual tabletop setting that has ever been done, which, at the time, was exactly what the original baldur's gate was. a true virtual dungeon master for those who can't or don't want to find a reallife group. in that way, if not mechanically, it is a true successor to it's namesake titles. as for it's legacy, my gf has never played a single game like this. she is now on her second playthrough and completely obsessed. a difficulty beyond tactician may be added as dlc, or will be taken care of by mods ala sword coast stratagems for the originals. it seems to me focusing on attracting and enthralling normal people like my gf was a far better value for them to focus on."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,congrats! happy for you and always love hearing what you have to say
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"mort, amazing video. im so delighted to see your section about playing as origin characters! im trying my first origin run through as gale and im amazed in act 1 how much new content is there for him! wow!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,so happy you are able to do what you love. your videos are great. thank you
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"lots of good points. really appreciate the section on origin characters to get an idea of what to expect when going for another run. i agree with a lot of your points about the difficulty and balance, but i'll take a bit of an easier game in exchange for not having it be as cumbersome as something like the pathfinder games around 10700 where you discuss the need for prebuffing in them, i hate that kind of stuff, it's just so much pointless busywork."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"never played a crpg, or even any rpg games, never played dnd, my most played games before this were survivalpuzzlecosy games but bg3 is now my most played game of all time with 400 hours, and i'm running it on a crappy laptop. i absolutely love this game, the writing, the interesting mechanics and i especially love that the combat is turnbased, i typically don't play combat based games because playing with a touchpad makes them honestly kind of impossible, but turnbased combat takes what normally is a reactionmechanical skill based thing and makes it more like a really cool game of chess, keeping track of all the pieces and their abilities and having time to think about each move ahead of time and plan out a strategy, it gives me the same satisfaction as solving an interesting puzzle , honestly a lot of my hours have just been going back and reloading combat encounters just to test out new ideas or mess around with builds! and after all those hours im still yet to actually finish any of my saves  also, doing the jack of all trades achievement was such a struggle xd the minute i completed it i respecced my character as a super strong padlock as a reward for getting through it xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,congrats on finishing the video! hope you have a nice day
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"amazing, being waiting for this 100. i've been able and encourage to play so many crpg's because of your guides. wotr, bg12, poe12. greetings from per, keep doing amazing content and may we all wonder in wisdom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"having grown up with the original games, it's honestly so heartwarming seeing the life larians breathed into this franchise, the love it's recieved and all the new people checking out the genre."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"so happy for you, congratulations on your achievements!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,it's finished!!! congratulations mort
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i found your channel looking to get into the ees of bg12 and ive been watching nearly every video since i subscribed. no one deserves the success more than you. thank you for introducing me to my new favorite genre of games! now im going back to dos2 and pathfinder with your guides
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-22,"i like romances as a tool to tell tav's character development, and so i usually sketch out the general progress of the romance throughout the story right at the start but man, lae'zel was the absolute hardest person not to romance when i had other plans. her development was done stunningly."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"love your sentiment around your work and videos, mort"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i am a first time player to turn based games. this game has been a huge learning curve for me but i think i'm nearing the end of chapter 1 and slowly beginning to grasp it. having fun so far. i won't be watching all of this as i don't want spoilers but have enjoyed some of your other videos on the game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i'm so glad that making these videos has brought you so much success and enabled you to pay off your house. the quality of your work is always top notch and appreciate them so much!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"bg3 is one of those games that single handedly expanded my taste in video games. i've always been a fan of rpgs, ever since i was a kid, but i barely knew anything about crpgs as a genre overall and what little i did know, they didn't really seem like my kind of thing. but with the hype of bg3, i decided to check it out and ended up loving it. so much so i went out of my way to purchase the first two baldur's gate games, as well as planescape torment, divinity original sin 2 and pathfinder wrath of the righteous. i actually already owned kingmaker for free via epic as well. i decided to try out kingmaker after bg3 and while i haven't finished it, i absolutely adored it overall at least, it does have some issues and things i'm not a huge fan of and can't wait for my inevitably playthroughs of wotr. i've also since started dos2 and am enjoying it immensely as well. if not for bg3, i never would've considered any of these games, let alone fallen in love with any of them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i found your channel through bg3 and since then i have watched a lot of your backlog on other games. i'm super happy that things worked out for you in this way and your channel got a lot of more eyes!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,well let's hope that after 6 months to a year there will be a goty edition with a reworked last act and a difficulty where enemies have and use more abilities and might have more hp.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"oh this gonna be good! edit i am so glad for your success man,and i am glad that you can make a living covering what you love!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"very interesting perspective and review, for this type of game where there's so much content that the reasonably 'casual' gamer will simply never pick up, this type of content is godsend. just finished my 1st 50 hour playthru, probably not gonna do a 2nd one soon but still am interested in everything else i missed. great video, subbed."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"khalid was killed by irenicus? no, he died when heroically charged at three half ogres on the road to nashkel. very sad."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,i found this channel less than a year ago and enjoyed every video that has been posted on it. the details you explain and the time you put in shows in the qaulity of your work. cheers to you and congrats on your personal achievement. can't wait for the future of the channel and your personal growth. thank you for all you do. take a bow mort!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"1,5h video, we're eating good, guys! just in time as i'm in the middle of my 2nd playthrough"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,it's finally here! thank you so much for doing this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i am glad i you mentioned the new patch 4 performance issues because it has absolutely impacted my playthroughs, but specifically my cooperative ones. it has become very difficult to get through in act 3. that being said, larian has earned my full trust, so i will assume it will be ironed out soon."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i'm just really happy this game has made your channel skyrocket and get exposure. to more years of content like yours and all the best!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"great video! i know it's pretty standard for you, as i'm a fan of your content, but man is it just amazing to see the amount of time and effort you put into all of your reviews. you have become my favourite reviewer for all games you cover as i believe there is no one who is willing to do 100 reviews as often and as you do. now with my simping out of the way, with rogue trader approaching release, is bg3 your current front runner for game of the year, and if not, what other games are among that tier for you personally?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"congrats on the 100 review, it was worth the wait, thank you so much for doing it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,this man works hard...!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,been looking forward to this!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,the definitive review on youtube! thanks for all your hard work. you bring up a very interesting point about getting railroaded into helping the emperor until endgame. would have been much more interesting if you could side with orphaeus during that first fight and open up more narrative potential.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,very happy for your continued success. great review!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i've played many crpgs but i feel that bg3 really got many things right with scriptstory writing, game mechanics, quest decision variation and voice acting. it all comes together forming something so compelling to me."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,such a great video! i can't express how grateful i am to you and your content. i'm so happy to have found you as a creator because of bg3. you deserve this success and i can't wait to see what other new content comes our way through you! i'll be watching closely for rogue trader content! last two videos were pretty awesome! lastly i have to say your opinions on these is always a breath of fresh air. you don't nit pick the things that don't need to be but hold things into the light that do. i especially enjoyed your comments on the story line between bg 1 2 and 3. i was also an avid player of the first two during my youth as well. thanks again for such amazing content!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,the perfect companion to my morning commute. wonderful vid as always
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i agree very much with the epilogue not giving me satisfying conclusions for the origin characters. i barely did gale's quest line but he seemed to have the most to say at the end with me even though i spent way more time with shadowheart, wyll and astarion in my party. astarion seems particularly the worst since i completely finished out his story quest and helped him avoid ascension only to have him comically run off because he's sensitive to light again..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"your video essays make my work days way more bearable, cheers homie"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"a couple of things swen posted on twitter yesterday with some testing on series s that looks like it'll significantly improve performance issues on all systems. secondly, there's been an alleged 4th difficulty mode found in the game files, so it looks like that may arrive at some point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"finally! i have really enjoyed this review, morti! i feel i agree with you on so much. keep it up!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,better put my suit on for this one!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,congrats on the house mort !
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i have no experience with dd and played on tactician difficulty my first time around and didnt find it too difficult outside of a handful of combat encounters, most of which were in acts 1  2. in act 3 my characters ended up being so powerful i pretty much ran through the remaining combat scenarios without breaking a sweat. all that said, i agree that there should be a harder difficulty."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"sup mort, just wanted to let you know that you were one of the channels that inspired me to start content creation  can't wait to see you get the 500k"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"not sure if you'll see this comment, but i appreciate you calling out the act 2  act 3 railroad. i chose to play my first character as hardline antiillithid. never consumed any tadpoles, refused to make use of any powers, and going to any lengths to find a way to remove the parasite. reaching the end of act 2, the emperor's deception made me genuinely want to kill him. by chance, all the gith ended up dying before i zeroed his hitpoints, which immediately triggered dialogue where he commended me for changing my mind, and i was forced to continue on like nothing happened. worse still was that after the forced dialogue ended, i obviously still wanted to kill him. so i attacked...and attacked...and attacked... his hitpoints can reach 0, and absolutely nothing happens. nothing. at all. he doesn't die, doesn't warn you or fight back, he just tells you to piss off and that's that. i was genuinely so disappointed, and it was entirely because of the standard larian had set for themselves leading up to that point."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i just know this vid was a massive project , super thankful for these reviews love watching them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"completely agree with the ending. when credits rolled i was expecting more scenes to properly close it out. so in that sense it slightly soured the experience a little bit. apart from that though, for my part i played it on easy as it was my first time playing this kind of game, and noticed that the sub class system is locked out for anyone on easy. which i found strange. is it because the systems are more advanced?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-28,"i discovered mortismal after i played dos2 a few years ago and wanted more lore, since than i've watched a lot of your videos. you certainly are the best reviewer imo because of the fact you 100 every game and really understand it before critiquing it. love the voice, the way the videos are setup, thanks for making this 3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"won't play bg3 for a long a time, but i really was waiting for this. this is the review that matter the most."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-14,"this game did the unthinkable. it made me, some regular dude that works construction, love dd. big w"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i actually quite liked karlach's ending when i played. i played a bard and romanced her. i also did wyll's quest and pushed him to continue protecting people. my bard went down the illithid route and eventually went full mind flayer. so at the end when karlach was dying, wyll wanted to go with her to avernus, and my mind flayer bard went with them. the three of us against the hells. wasnt the outcome i wanted, but it was still pretty satisfying. also, im fairly certain this is the outcome that does the most good. orpheus canonically wants to continue his mother's work of exterminating with mind flayers, but also wants to conquer and enslave every plane."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-13,"yeah i think the first video i watched from you was on the full story of bg1 followed by 2 cause i was hyped for 3. i played them both as a kid but never beat either one and haven't ever went back to them, but i've read books on the lore since and have always liked the setting a lot. since watching those first two videos, i started getting other videos by you in my suggestions and have found some cool new games to check out and ended up subscribing which is something i don't ever really take the time to do, even with channels i watch a lot, just because i'm usually thoroughly interested in the games you cover and enjoy the way you cover them. thanks for all the hard work, glad it's paid off for you! cheers"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"what bothered me in the story was that there is no benefit in not using illithid powers. it is implied you lose humanity when you use them, that in fact you should not be using them. guess what  if you don't use them the only consequence you get is you are limiting your options in gameplay  have less powers for combat. regardless of whether you abstain from using powers or use them constantly, at the end you get the same story outcomes, e.g. turning into mind flayer when you free orpheus has the same consequences."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,thank you champ for always being honest and upfront with all your thoughts
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-02,"patch 6 has addressed so many quality of life issues, i think it's pretty close to being a near perfect game now."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-10,"bro i remember it was just a year or 2 ago when i found your channel and you were only getting like 5k views a video for the longest time, i used to think you were such an underviewed channel and wondered why people werent finding it, well now here you are with 103k views in 17 hours, congrats bro, happy for you that your hard work paid off!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,love the content but gotta disagree about minsc. i recruited him early in act 3 like you said its a lot so i specifically worked toward it and he added a ton to the last act for me. plus having him and jaheira walking around the city commenting on everything is a real treat. i think they have more lines than the origin characters in act 3 lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,congrats on the success! great to hear your work has paid off d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i think the major reason people resonate with bg3 is the full voice acting. i've had many friends approach me asking for games like bg3 they could play. the second question is always voice acting and the lack there of making it a no go. i don't know how you fix this other than allocating a rather large amount of your budget to va which would already be challenging when this genre doesn't typically operate in the aaa space. either way i can only hope we see even more crpgs in the future.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,congrats man! your hard work definitely deserves it. i look forward to your future vids
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i agree it was so stupid to force the player to side with the emperor instead of orpheus the first time. very bad railroading.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"congats on the 100 and this video. even if it doesn't end up as your most viewed video, it will still end up being gamechanging. onward to 300k. all glory to the algorithm."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"this is a great and fair review. like you, i have enjoyed all of larian's games. heck, even beyond divinity had a few enjoyable aspects. that said, my biggest complaint with larian that continues with bg3 is that they do not respect the story and lore of prior games. they didn't respect the lore of their own divinity universe, and so it's no surprise that they didn't care much about respecting the bhaalspawn saga. i hope that changes, but given that it has never been a priority for sven who never even plays his own games again after they're released, i don't expect that will change."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"congratulations on laying off your house mort, so happy youre able to do what you love and monetize it! thank you for all you do, it really is your hard work paying off. 100 reviews at the speed youre able to accomplish it really goes the extra mile and doesnt go unnoticed by your audience and many others still to find this channel"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"my only major complaint is that the evil playthrough feels way underbaked compared to the good playthrough, because most of the charactersquests are tied to the good playthrough and you just don't get as much interaction on the evil one. i really hope they flesh that out as they have done reworks of the weaker elements on their previous games. other than that the game is obviously a masterpiece."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,thanks so much for the hard work!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"i absolutely love bg3 and its now one of my favorite games of all time. i am so thirsty for a similar game but there is no game like it. i tried to get in to pathfinder wrath of the righteous but it just didnt click with it. the main problem isnt event the presentation which of course is many levels under bg3, but neither the story in the beginning nor the feeling of the game could hook my. my biggest complain is that the game does absoluetely nothing to teach you its mechanics and its unique rule sets and gameplay. so i just felt like i was at the wrong place because the intrudoction in to the story and world wasnt as smooth and good for a newbie as in bg3 and the mechanics are also extreme complicated. sorry but i dont want to have to watch hour long videos or guides about a game i want to play. the leveling alone and the class system and character chreation looks so more complicated and you just have no clue which is good or bad for the character you want to build. i think bg3 just nailed completely the balance of statisfying deep combat and many possible interactions with in the world  many physic objects, also something pathfinder is lacking  and is very addictive written in its narrative and story design and also gets it right to introduce newbies very good to the world and story. pathfinder wotr just feels like a game for pathfinder fans only, it just feels like it doesnt even want to try to get outsiders involved. i think this one of the main problems why many crpgs dont appeal as much in the mass as bg3. its not because they are too complex, its because they are often designed entirely with a mindset only thinking about people already extremely involved into the world, story and rule sets. thats why i am looking forward for warhammer 40k rogue trader, because i am a huge warhammer 40k fan and i am very into the lore and world of it. but i think if owlcat games wants to reach the same highs as larian in success, they need to give outsiders more attention. larian already did a good job with the divinity games well to introduce the players with the right pacing and story telling into its world and rules. also games such as disco elysium which i really love as well reall nail introducing players into its world and characters  even if its a bad comparison, because the games isnt based on a already existing pnp universe"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,i love all your guides for both bg3 and pathfinder
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,"a very good review that reflects a lot of my own observations on this game. while i do like it, i will also point out that this is not a sequel to the original games at all in my view. its dos with a paint job. as harsh as that may sound, its marketing and there it was a hit, not the least because the nature of this game all the fun stuff plays perfectly into the streamingyoutubeshorts crowd. remember how the made a big deal about the romances and sex scene, yet there is hardly anything of substance here and they are overall really subpar. but the halsin love scene gets the views, so a marketing success. the writing or better narrative really breaks apart in act 3, for some reason larian thinks rewrites late game are a good thing, they did this in other titles as well and it shows. especially the cut content hurts the ending really bad. a few months more in production could have done wonders. i also agree with minthara, who is still bug ridden to no end, and that minsk in act 3 was a mistake originally planed for act 1. overall i couldnt really get into the companions, they felt very generic to me, despite some interesting moments in their personal stories. in the hands of better writers this could have been amazing. its still a good game and i had a lot of fun with it. hopefully they will make a definitive edition and at least fix some really glaring issues with the last act. anyway, i will take pillars, pathfinder, bg original series etc over bg3 any time. i think you are spot on with the analysis that many people are so in love with it, because thats their first venture into this genre, so hopefully this will also bring some more attention to other titles as well."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,... such as cleave which allows you to hit multiple enemies at once it only allows me to miss multiple enemies at once
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,one tip that saves thousands of gold. use the character with the highest charisma to initiate the trade.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,my biggest fail was not knowing u could throw potions at your team. this can be so useful and save lives. definitely needs to be mentioned
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the 3 spells you need to cast as you finish the long rest speak with dead speak with animals detect thoughts the 3 of em are until long rest and rituals. no spell expended, useful all day for your resident charisma based character."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,for 15 i always have ask checked for reactions. i like to know in detail what is happening every turn rather than random spellsreactions popping off.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,a tip i'd add is to switch your characters back to their melee weapon after making a ranged shot so if someone runs past them they will make a opportunity attack
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,small tip attack with pommel strike before your main hand attack! pommel strike may inflict the dazed condition on the enemy. this hinders the enemy's ac armor class benefitting from their dex modifier meaning they are easier to hit. use the examine feature to seek out an enemy with a high dex and an armor granting dex bonus to the ac all except heavy armor and pommel them! they are now more likely to be hit for two turns and your main hand attack if you used it after
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one tip i would highly suggest is to not be afraid to long rest  lots of times i forgot or didn't think about long resting after a combat encounter just because i still had both short rests still available, but after a fight that takes up a lot of resources could be detrimental to any upcoming fight if you don't have spells available."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,i love the icon for turn undead in this game. no! bad skeleton! go sit in your crypt and think about what you've done.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-18,"as a fullon beginner to this game who just started playing a few days ago, this is insanely helpful. thanks so much for the tips."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"one big thing i learned. ritual spells are free to cast outside combat. so they don't use a spell slot. stuff like longstrider, silence, speak with animals, and etc. being free is a huge benefit."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"press t for quick inspect enemies. as a dd newbie it's so satisfying to use effective damage or avoid wasting a turn. i do wish there was some form of loremastering tied to this. btw i really appreciate how you try to keep these videos spoiler free, i've only managed to clock in 30 hours so far and since i'm exploring every single blade of grass i haven't even completed the grove questline still, so yeah very much appreciated."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"my biggest tip your spellbook isn't limited to daily preperation. you can freely swap spells within your spellbook as long as you slots to cast them or they don't have a rest requirement. of course you can't swap in combat, so do not be afraid to swap your spells around should you need one."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"after beating the game several times you sorta know when to long rest based on the upcoming encounter. but if youre new just know this, outside of very few instances where long rest does something, most cases you can long rest as many times as you want"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-15,one tip speaking from experience. using too many quick saves will actually make your cpu usage higher from memory leak. i had to move it back down to 10 and my game was playing better and have had no issues since
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,you can throw a health potion at a character to heal them or revive them when they need help instead of using a heal. great video wolf!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"my tip use the  button on your hotbar ui to increase the number of rows! first thing i did when getting each companion was take a minute to increase the rows and put all my spells in a standard order, sorting by melee vs range, level of spell, action vs bonus action, putting those ritual or onceperlongrest spells in a standard spot to make it all easier to remember and to find. it takes some up front time investment but man it has made it so much easier."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-05,"my top tip would be using jump for positioning. almost every time i can travel farther with a jump involved than by running overground. meaning my character can get to striking distance. when i started i didnt think much of jump, but now i use it on practically every turn!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-01,"oil or grease  any fire cantrip is fantastic for dealing with mobs. the grease spell in particular gets two chances to be effective if they make their saving throw against falling prone, you can now repurpose it as an aoe zone of continuous fire damage. and if they are standing next to a torch, grease will immediately catch fire. just make sure that you don't step in it yourself... when the floor is covered in blood it can sometimes be a little bit difficult to see where the grease patch begins."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"you are not wasting inspiration points. you are turning them into experience, which is also very valuable. i don't spend my inspiration on purpose"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"to note extra attack works with both weapon types, meaning you can swing a sword and kill an enemy with your first attack, then swap out to your bow by pressing f and shooting at another enemy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,if you come across a trap while in group mode it's a good idea to hit shiftg to ungroup your party members so you can safely disarm it without your other party members blowing you up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-12,"something worth mentioning regarding examining enemies is that you can do it without right clicking. the same button you use to expand items and spells t for pc can be used to examine enemies. just hover over either the character or their portrait in the combat order and hit t. it's a minor change, but it's nice to not have to do those extra steps in the middle of combat. especially against large groups of enemies."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-20,"this is the best card i've seen for a yt vid. you won this corner of the internet that day, good sir."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i love the old school feel and mysticism of playing without guides or tip vids etc, but i caved and some of these however just made me go duh, why am i not doing this, im certain my next log in will be much easier for having watched this, i appreciate you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"here's a tip that i missed early on when you use the revivify scroll, you can relocate the target. as a 5e player, i just assumed the spell worked basically the same way as 5e but it's way different. it doesn't require touch, it can be used on an ally that fell off a cliff a spirit orb thing appears that you can use it on and it can teleport them to a safer location. this is very powerful, and despite the ui saying something like click location i was ignoring it as just being weird text for picking your target and failed to take advantage of this feature until well into act ii."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"if you're only planning on playing on one platform, i'd highly advise you to turn crosssaves off in the options menu. i've ran into issues where i would save and then would sync to cloud save, but that notification would persist for close to half an hour, making me unable to save again, especially right before combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,"biggest mistake i made is not exploring act 1 enough, later realizing there were so many quests that i completely missed out on, like the monster hunter, laezels entire thing, wylls entire thing, like i never even met karlach or did the hag swamp quest and i regret it so much. i was paranoid that if i dont move on with the main story asap its gonna be too late or somthing lmao"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"potions last until your next long rest. drink them, giant strength, triple your distance leading, speaking to animals etc dont be shy to take your medicine."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"as an additional note about mage armor you can not cast the spell and then swap it out for a different spell! it must remain prepared unless it was cast from a scroll or somesuch or else the mage armor status will vanish. so if you're going to use it, be well sure that you plan to keep that specific spell preparation slot occupied by mage armor for the rest of that day."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"you should definitely use 't' to examine, especially useful on enemies who employ illusion as you can often spot the real enemy because unique equipment features don't replicate on the illusions!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,missile snaring is fantastic. lae'zel took all the ranged attacks in the goblin camp and just kept snagging arrows and mitigating damage while my party mopped them up.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"my one tip is take advantage of dipping your weapons via flame or poison, etc, before a fight kicks off. for example, you can use a candle in the environment without needing a candle in your inventory and dropping it into the environment to dip your weapons with. also, throwing torches from higher ground at your enemies is op!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"reckless attack and shield are examples of conditional reactions that you don't need to manually use. the game will wait for a situation in which they might matter, and show you the problem your roll will miss their roll will hit and then gives you the luxury of knowing, midattack, that you can use effects like this. it's like having a chill dm giving you a chance to retcon your gamble because it failed. very common in tabletop gaming lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"party inventory. it's not just for ease of moving items from one party member to another. any party member has access to any other party member's items while partyinventory is up. that means that during combat, partymember a can use a healing potion kept in partymember b's inventory with a bonus action as if the potion were in partymember a's inventory without penalty. it means your wizard can access the scrolls from another party member's pack through partyinventory and cast that lifesaving combatprotection spell that would save themthe party if only you had remembered to move the scroll to their inventory before the fight. good news! you didn't need to!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"you can also examine doors that you want to break down, indicated by them having an hp number. usually they have modifiers for at least one of several damage types slashing, bludgeoning, and fire. you can also get explanations of their traits. such as sturdy requiring 10 points of damage in a single hit to deplete the door's hp. in the case of a weakness to fire, hitting level 5 for firebolt to deal 2d10 helps reach that 22 point threshold for breaking down medium toughness."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"would suggest 2 things as well 1. do a hard save occasionally because you can name those whatever you want. it's better than auto save 39, which may not be enough information especially if you ever have to load a save from a while before. 2. if you need some type of potion for me, it's always potion of speed or crafting materials, you can go to camp, partial rest, come back and recheck the vendors. they get new stock everyday of many items potions, foods, materials. you may have to visit several vendors to get what you want. if you're still at a point where you can visit the underdark, definitely doing this partial save strat works to allow you to get materials and such from the 3 vendors that are in the myconid colony. it's a good way to stock up without having to hope you'll find the right materials or just stumble on the right potionselixirs you want."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"something i found interesting is if you place a crate in your camp it will stay in that position whenever that camp setup is used with the items you put in it. this can be helpful if there are items you want separated from the main camp stash. one example is the owlbear egg, a high value item which counts as camp supplies. in fact, next time i play i'll probably put a crate next to gale to store magic items instead of lugging them around with me or looking through the main stash to pull them out when he needs them."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i think it's good for new players to tick ask for every reaction, even the obvious ones. it's a great way to become familiar with the rules of the game and planning"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"this guide is actually also helpful for people beginning dd as a tabletop game, it's really impressive how the they translated how dd works into the game i know a lot of early video games used stuff from early dd but modern games haven't really managed to capture what dd feels like to me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,my main tip for crpgs and games with a lot of interacting with the environment is to use the button that highlights all interactable things in the environment constantly. set it to your side mouse button and just hold it down while your moving around the world
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,my evocation wizard was keeping my companions from getting hit with spells but then i forgot the cleric didnt have that and next thing you know my entire party is hit with flame strike
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"quick correction aid does not give temporary hit points, which is a proper noun term in this game. it increases your hit point maximum by 5 temporarily. this seems like a minute difference, but because temporary hp doesn't stack and you have to choose at most one source to keep at any given time, it's important to note that aid and any source of temporary hp do indeed stack!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-30,thank you for your video. i am a brand new baldurs gate 3 player. this was very easy to follow and it is very informative.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"to everyone who is used to rolling up a character and barely managing their own character sheet, and struggling to micro manage a whole party woo saaahh... breath in and out, slowly. 1. playing a bard will allow you to cover support, aid, and offense, as a jack of all trades. will also show you how basic systems work, like spell splots, cantrips, ext. it is an awesome class to play as the main character, because they can performpersuadedeceptintimidated, depending on how you set up your background and proficiencies. 2. you dont need asterion to lockpock stuff. but he will do it well. you dont need shadowheart to heal your group, but you can set her up to have two healing spells early on. you dont need gale the wizard for utility, but i always take him, because wizards are made for it you can play a mage from any other class, and use gale to do utility stuff, or, you do utility, and make him a heavy hitter all spells no stop."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"great video as always. the things i miss as a beginner are backgrounds about the lore, characters, places, chronicles, etc. missed opportunity of larian in my opinion. an ingame encyclopedia would be so cool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-27,"the other important reason to make reactions ask instead of go automatically is that you only get 1 reaction per round. if you have both opportunity attack and missile snaring on automatic, then whichever is the first to apply will go off and you won't get the chance to do the other. that means if you want to punish enemies from moving away, you don't want a random crossbow plink to take away your opportunity attack. and if you don't care about that opportunity attack, but there is a scary ranger that could potentially devastate you, you don't want your chance to missile snare to be taken away by swiping at someone."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"my tip that i always forget to do myself remember to rage, hunter's mark, etc, before you attack an enemy, not after. bonus actions can be used before your main action and it's often better to think about what bonus actions you can do that will help your main action be more effective."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-13,"1535 he was literally talking about people playing chess vs checkers which is a way to say that you need to think ahead to win, playing chess means thinking several moves ahead, playing checkers means to play reactively which could also be called acting emotionally typically ends in a lose...."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one last tip for mouse users especially lock your bottom tool bar when youre pleased with its set up. you can place containers back packs, sacks, etc and select items from that instead of having a ridiculously long tool bar slider. or you can put weapons unfortunately you cant stack a weapon and shield or dualwielded weapons like bg12 but maybe that functionality can come in a patch larian?. it still takes an action to swap but between containers on the tool bar and auxiliary weapons it can streamline your life. in bg3."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"one small correction, aid doesnt give the same temporary hit points as many other abilities that do not stack. aid and also the level 6 cleric ability heroes' feast increases your max hp and stacks with any temporary hit point you might apply."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,the tip about turning off spells with the x was so useful to me. i run into my clouds of daggers here and there even as a long time player. excellent guide!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,thanks for the video i've literally just had a war with that goblin place and it took me hours of fighting with my party because of my mistakes
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"alot of these bg3 beginner tip videos cover things that are very obvious to me or other intermediate to hardcore gamers. every tip in this video clarified more nuanced information that i still needed to test out myself, so i greatly appreciate how you cut straight to the point when most youtubers would just pad it with obvious info. u rock man"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-24,"cancelling concentration spells is really a mustknow thing for players using moves such as cloud of daggers, i've had a couple instances where the fight ends and my party members just strut right through it to get back to me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-25,for the first mistakes my suggestion is to make a custom hotbar only with prebattle abilities.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,i'd like to add sometimes armor can even lower your ac if you have a high natural ac. putting on armor can in fact lower a characters ac and their ability to make checks.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-16,"tips from someone who likes playing a bard too much, use your bard wisely to get an extra short rest giving health back and replenishing spells for warlocks, rages, bardic inspirations, ki, etc. a bard can make your party go 50 farther before needing a long rest"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-20,"643 'exploring your companions' ah yes, we do this a lot back at camp"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i've played 30 hours and i still needed to know all of this!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,lol im 40 hours in and honestly i needed this cause some of this ive found out the hard way
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"there are obviously more than 15 useful suggestions wolf has a solid greatest hirs tho and, for wizards i would definitely add dont forget to use arcane recovery. especially at higher levels. for bards dont forget to use song of rest first but let your fighter use their self heal skill skipping my brain now first. same goes for before a short rest. make sure that pc gets as many hp as possible."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-04,thank you. i don't play dnd so all of this will be new to me and this is quite helpful!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-13,"1340 the tip about the 4 point max i was so glad to hear that, i am playing the game for the 1st time, and i just noticed i was at 4 points recently, so this tip was perfect timing for me to find this video"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-11,"if you play a warlock, dont forget you have to re connect with your pact weapon after a long rest. many times i have gone into a fight without my second attack because i forgot to do this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"my additions 16. you can use a bonus action to drink a potion yourself, but you can use a full action to toss one at an ally to immediately heal them. 17. your characters don't necessarily always have to take their turns in order. so long as two of your characters are adjacent in the initiative, you can do their turns in any order, or even do part of one's turn before the other, then finish their turn. this can be really good if you want to drop an aoe but an ally is in the way. or if you need to get someone squishy out of melee range and don't want to give up their entire action to do so, you can have someone else shove the enemy or ally out of threatened range. this also means you'll have time to cast buffs on your front liner before they go in, or lock down the rogue's target before they take their attack. 18. you can shiftclick to select tons of items at the same time. click the first one, shift click the last, and immediately send your entire camp supply pack of food to camp instead of lugging it around or sending it one item at a time. the same for adding items to wares. if you find a whole chest of items your party just has no use for, select them all and add to wares. now when you go to a shop, just click one button, and all the unwanted goods are sold. 19. until level 5, playing a caster can be tough. the sleep spell can help you get through this. it doesn't scale into late game all that well, but there's no save, so you can just remove some enemies from combat and deal with the rest at your leisure. bless is also really strong, providing both offensive and defensive benefits to anyone it's on, and it's still useful lategame. it's not uncommon for a cleric or paladin's first level spells to typically be spent on this almost every fight until they need to bring out the big guns for a boss fight. 20. chokepoints. use them. keep your squishy casters behind the front line, and use your melee characters to trap enemies with the threat of opportunity attacks if they dare to pass. using doorways, staircases, bridges, etc. to funnel enemies into a kill zone is one of the most tactically powerful things you can do. especially if you have spells to drop over that area, like cloud of daggers, hunger of hadar, moonbeam, etc. and let's not forget the cleric in full plate with spirit guardians up that's standing in the way spamming blade ward."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"you can also have a hireling cast mage armor in camp then leave them there and have any non concentration, til long rest, spells without wasting spell slots"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-06,i like how they rebrand tv dinners for the stuck up gen z kids. are you too busy to eat? is your mom not there to make your meals anymore? that's the long and the short of those tv dinner delivery services. they just put a trendy label on the outside and say dietician approved and kids who can't take care of themselves but have their first job out of college will buy them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,"great tips! still on my first playthrough and, even with tutorials theres just so much to process."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-30,"the advice about using the environment is on point! i wasnt able to recreate the halfling barbarian barrel strategy to clear the entire goblin camp, but i did it on a smaller scale within the defiled temple by climbing boxes into the guarded room full of explosive barrels  also, it doesnt matter how far away a character is from the group, you can teleport items from any member to another no matter the distance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,the biggest one for me is definitely the access control you were talking about for your rangedspell casting characters. removing ladders or creating difficult terrain around them can turn a lynching into shooting fish in a barrel!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,good tip on entering turn based before buffing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"multiclassing is dangerous, but a 2 level dip in fighter for proficiencies and action surge can make any caster a beast"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,"another thing to add with the focus fire. your goal is to reduce the enemy's actions per round often referred to as action economy in tt therefore unless there is one enemy that just needs to die such as a wizard i tend to focus on the minions first, and leave the beefier targets for later say you are fighting a dude with two attacks and 3 minions with 1 attack each. you could very easily focus fire the minions, and if you knock all three of them off the board the enemy is getting two attacks per round instead of five, whereas if you only knock the big guy down to half hit points, the enemy is still making 5 attacks per round"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"important clarification on 1 and 2. if you cast a spell, hide, change weapons, etc then walk into combat within 6 seconds you likely will not have that actionba during round 1 of combat. wait 6 seconds at least to ensure it doesnt count for round 1, or as you mentioned, use turn based mode to avoid this risk."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"thanks wolfheart  few additions 1. use long rest itemsequipment after long rest too like spells rather than in combat. pretty sure you can deequip equipment without losing the benefits too. 2. there are  icons on the hotbar to make it bigger and smaller useful when you have more options than at the start. 3. i believe that some reactions may have requirements to work e.g., when counterspelling which is a super handy spell, float over the enemy attack name to see its level and counterspell with at least that level. 4. don't forget to use special arrows and potions, same premise as using environmental effects. for example, darkness arrows are super handy for creating defensive 'walls' against enemy archers and forcing them to move."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,"with that reaction tip, i also recommend turning opportunity attack to ask. often you'll have better reactions especially on casters than just making 1 swing with a weapon."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"another small tip potion effects override one another, when specified. ex bloodlust will override a potion of speed, if consumed secondarily. take advantage of that fact when an enemy decides to buff themselves with a potion. martialboss a chugs a potion of speed? toss a potion of arcane cultivation at the spellless jerk."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,"i dont comment often, but this is a great video! turn based rpg combat has never been my jam, and this game has been stumping me here and there. great tips."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"something i learned recently is that you can learn spells from scrolls you have with gale. make him the active character, go to his spell book and there is a scroll  icon button. you must meet the spell level requirement and have enough gold to learn them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,i quite literally removed hunters mark from my main characters hotbar because i kept throwing down cloud of daggers then very next move canceling it on accident with a hunters mark.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-16,"i'd add a few. 1 use coatings. poison is the most comman resist in the game, most often it sucks for merely damage. but there're certain items, like diadem crown, which give arcane synergy, need you to inflect a condition. poison is a cheap way to do that, it's too common to alchemy or very cheap and easily accessed at vendor and only cost a bonus action. some coatings like sharpness, accuracy are very good especially on low lvls when you feel like miss a lot. 2 learn light. i mean the cantrip light. just cast it on yourself or your companion, it light up the weapon and you don't need to carry torch any more. almost every caster can learn it. it's a hell of difference when you're in act2. 3 understand imitative. your dex, equipment, alert feat can give you different initiative. i think it also combine with a random roll to decide who do the turn first but in general the higher initiative would likely to go action first. so prioritize your party with initiative is always a good idea, you want the support class to act first so heshe can twin haste the dps. 4 understand initiative 2. while in combat, the top list from left to right is in order of initiative. that mean the enemies on the right side is likely not yet action. click on it will show their position, if you can kill them first, they will never take any action."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"a tip that i know but i am really bad at following myself when playing the game. baldurs gate 3 is a game that you can play once and your choices depend on how you want to play that campaign. but this is a very heavy choice game and it's also made to be very replayable partly because of the choices you make or rather dind't make in your first playthrough. don't be afraid of choices that you make. they might have consequences to them but nothing game breaking. like for example to ignore a certain quest that wants to you to give a important item to some rude people that claim it's theirs. i just fully skipped it once i knew what their intention was and will get to that in a playthrough that matches that kind of outcome better... i went to the place tried so many things but couldn't get the outcome that i wanted so i loaded a quicksave before engaging the finale point and turned arround. i think i wasted about 1 hour to figure out how to do the quest but with a my preffered outcome, and i realised some quests just don't fit certain playstyles and will force you into a situation where no answer fits my character. unless you meta game arround it by keeping certain party members in the camp so they won't hate you for making certain choices and then recruit them after the choices are made, but still that would go against my immersion rpg play style"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"loved this video because there are so many spells to keep track of! i knew about magic armor and im trying to write down on a notebook all similar spells to be cast at breakfast time or right before combat. i did find i was making a mistake with vendor attitude increases via barter but this probably deserves its own video. you can't just choose your highest charisma companion to sell stuff. the moment you dismiss it, the vendor's attitude towards your party resets to 0, no matter if you bring the guy back just to sell stuff again."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"aid also heals the amount of health it adds, so works as a decent in combat mass heal if you have multiple characters down."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"love allll the content! i am new to your channel, but i read the dark elf trilogy about 20 years ago, and you connected the dots... i had no idea at the time i was reading dd material.... but i really loved those books more than any others and they stuck with me.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-16,"i usually gravitate to more realtime arpg games, or similar games, but this game is just so good, i'm already hooked, and i'm probably only 3hrs in. i played dd years ago, so that could be some of it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-01,"one of the best things that helped me as a beginner was the shortcut t. it can keep open all the popups, and you can get explanations to all the highlighted words. that helps a lot in understanding the game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i suppose this might just tie into using the environment but i personally love to collect all the various explosive barrels you encounter throughout the game for a little extra advantage in particularly tough battles. with a little extra time and stealth you can setup some deadly traps of your own to tip the possible outcome in your favor! yes these barrels weigh a ton but you can easily send them to camp and also teleport back and forth to camp from your current location at your convenience. you also have two characters at a minimum who can detonate these from a range shadowheart and astarion with firebolt, if you lack those fire arrows and scolls of firebolt aren't that uncommon to find in shops or around the world. also if you're having some trouble getting these traps into the correct position remember mage hand can be employed to great effect here!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,i would say to use your bonus actions when you can. shove is the best bonus action. you can often give them fall damage or push them away so you can disengage without getting an opportunity attack on you.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,for spells like mage armour it really helps to get a hireling whose sole purpose is to buff the party at the start of each day then be swapped out and sit in camp while your main group head out buffed and with all their spell slots intact. this gets even better when considering classes like transmuter wizard for the hireling buff bot who at lv6 get a special stone they can give to another party member that grants con saving throw proficiency among other options.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-10,"as a new player to these types of games, this video was perfect for me thank you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"i didn't think i would learn anything from this, but i had no idea that you can only have 4 inspiration points, epic"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"excellent tips all around, and i'm sure everyone has forgotten these at one time or another. there is one more tip that you forgot to add. know what is in your inventory! just got finished with the spider queen fight. in chapter one, damn near losing many times because of poison damage. then, after the fight, as i was healing up, i noticed one of my characters had 4 potions of poison resistance. doh!!! thanks again for reminding us how amazing this game really is."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"as a ps5 player, this channel along with old mort is literally keeping me sane in aug. sept cant come quickly enough and you have just enough info for a fun first play without spoilers. ill get to your play throughs after my first. thanks brohahn"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"i would recommend having hirelings casting spells such as longstrider and warding bond on your characters and letting them wait in camp as those spells won't go away when they stay in camp. though it's a little tedious, you can save spell spots ans points."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-30,"i'm halfway thru act 2. concentration spells was the biggest mistake i made, i wasn't used to this rule, coming from other games i played where it didn't matter. another thing i didn't realize until recently is that you can swap out spells in your book after a long rest. so for example, you need to make a long jump, swap out a spell that you have prepared, let's say magic missile and instead pick long jump, cast it, do your jump and then swap back to magic missile. this is a hugely powerful feature compared to other games that use the dd spellbook. i do this for summons such as the quazit or elemental. cast the summon spell, then switch it to something more useful for combat. one thing of note if cast long strider, then swap it out in your book, it negates the spell. on that note ritual spells is something that i didn't realize early on, but are amazing. long strider for example is a ritual spell, it costs not spell count to cast, so cast it on all your characters so they get more movement in combat."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-15,"927 a level 3 warlock can take pact of the blade which allows the caster to make either a magic weapon or make a weapon magic, while also granting a temporary proficiency to the bound weapon"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin not looting things, not leveling up, and equipping things without proficiency is more chaotic than his evil decisions lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the fact that kevin managed to break the animations before he even started playing is just onbrand.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-02,"i initially questioned why he didn't choose the dark urge origin if he wants to be as evil as possible, but perhaps he didn't pick it because he wants every evil decision he makes to be completely of his own accord and not some compulsion on third thought, perhaps he simply didn't see it in the first place"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"kevin choosing you have awoken me from my slumber, now i crave your blood! for astarion is... hilariously in character. i love it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,i love how he failed to find 4 out of 6 companions and is using astarion and shadowheart completely incorrectly.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,this game will allow kevin to do anything he wants. the npcs are doomed...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"honestly, this just confirms my suspicion that kevin would be a fantastic person to play dnd with"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"kevin forcing the skeletons through a narrow opening, making their numbers useless, was just the type of strategic genius i've come to expect"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,i love how even when kevin tries to play the villain he still plays the bumbling idiot who is malicious in his goofiness
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,i was hoping for a kind soul line from astarion is extremely hilarious knowing its in callmekevin video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"could you imagine having kevin at your dnd session? dm you encounter a cow, but it is obvious that this creature is not what it seems... party ... kevin, the bard i roll to punch it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i didn't realize it was possible to be this bad... very entertaining. i love the part where he walked by gale, missed lazel, and did stuff in the grove that i didnt even know existed, yet he still didnt talk to wyll. dat 3 man party with an afk bard , an oom cleric, and a rogue using a spear . 1010"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,kev is so used to being evil to no consequence that this game is throwing him for a loop.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"i love how within minutes of reaching the first settlement, carl has managed to antagonize everyone by murdering their lifestock, robbing a little street urchin, harassing the other children, stealing the sacred idol of the druids and starting a race war, supporting the murder of a little girl, attempting to steal sacred texts and finally being locked up for his crimes only to break out of prison. and still he talks his way out of it. kevin would be a dm's worst nightmare at a dnd table. he is lucky this game has a reload function xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,i am begging for a full playthrough. make this a series please.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,kevin using the rogue without sneaking or sneak attacks and thinking he's the most useless is very funny.

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin, please make this a series. carl can create so much chaos, we need to see it!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"using astarion as a meat shield is so funny to me. that man is a wet paper towel, he's not even a glass canon he's a fucking cardboard canon, putting him in front of you to protect you from damage is as much use as a chocolate fireguard."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,watching kevin just faceplant through this whole thing and then somehow uncover the shadow druids by mistake was just... fascinating...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,it's so fun to watch someone with no knowledge of dnd play this game. the constant what the hell is that! never gets tired.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,literally of course kevin went with a bard. perfection.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,god please let this go on for a million episodes. your chaotic playstyle lends itself to so much content from this game. a1 work from the devs and kevs

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin is a dnd genius, the way he uses the wisdom character and the dexterity character to cast fire cantrips that are based on intelligence. it's also quite impressive how he managed to maneuver the map without picking up a fourth party member"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i like how the first thing kevin does when he is making an evil character is to give him the ability to make friends. only evil people have friends after all.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,finally a game where kevin can play as a literal demon.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,played so chaotically that he lowkey did things i didn't think you could do in act 1

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,please do a series on this game! the possibilities for evil deeds that are open to carl are damn near endless.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the hardest part of this video is watching kevin get annihilated while each of his characters have a glowing level up symbol on their profile pictures.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-16,"3614 ironically, letting astarion drink a bit of your blood during bite night is actually the best choice you can make in the long run to gain his approval and rockhard loyalty. you get two opportunities to tell him to stop drinking, easy rolls, and he will stop. no need to stake him. the game also gives you two opportunities to not do anything and let him drink you dry until you die.... then you only have yourself to blame. but don't worry, that's not a game over, next morning you wake up groggy but alive. either astarion used a revivify scroll on your or withers brought you back, as bite night only happens once withers is in your camp and is usually triggered by finding the drained dead boar with vampire bite marks on the road to the blighted village and then resting at camp. if you never meet withers the lich at the dank crypt, he'l just wander into your camp like a stray cat soon after, because he is incredibly important as a camp follower as he can raise dead companions. if your approval rating with astarion is high before bite night is triggered, he can also decide to come out to the entire grop in the middle of the day and admit, hey folks i'm kinda sorta, how do i put this... a vampire! teheh! it's such a hilarious speech."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,"ive been playing this game nonstop for the past two weeks, yet watching kevins video helped me figure out the solution to almost three puzzles i was stuck on. im not sure how he stumbled upon the answers but thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i've been waiting for kevin to play bg3 tbh, kevin always seemed like someone who would be fun in a ttrpg"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"the narrator voice doubling down on jokes never stopped being funny, kept cracking me up"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i have never wanted kevin to keep playing a game more, his energy works so well with the freedom the game gives"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-05,"seeing astarion just hanging out slightly behind carl, just watching scilently as that bard goes on to do the most insane shit... yeah, that's in character i think."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-25,i need area of effect stuff left gale in the portal. classic.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,as a dnd player i can confirm this exactly how chaotic an actual dnd game is
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"seeing how good this game is, a bit of kevin added to the mix should make it even better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"there's an origin called dark urge that opens up even eviler things, like kicking a squirrel for no reason."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-01,uses a ranged magic attack with the party rogue against an enemy within melee range how could i miss this attack when the enemy is right there?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-26,"this is quite an accurate bard roleplay. dm ok, the fighter attacked and the wizard casted fireball. bard, what are you doing? bard, playing the lute there goes my hero!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,kevin not realizing that being up close makes ranged attacks more likely to miss is so funny.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin likes to pretend he's bad at video games, but stuff like this proves just how good he is. he managed to do so well without looking anything up. we knwo he didn't look anything up because he took a single long rest..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,if this turns into a series we will have stuff to watch while eating for a good while
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,you can call me shadowheart i'm carl that contrast had my dying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-11,"the narrator and parchment was a beautiful creative touch. also even though it was a troll video, the events have played out completely different than other playthrough i watched, as well as my own. awesome game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,the fact kevin didnt go with the dark urge in his attempt to be evil surprises me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,consider that a divorce is a stroke of editing genius.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,imagine being call me kevin's dungeon master. i would explode lmao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-25,watching kevin complaining about astarion missing when he's trying to shoot them with a bow from like two inches away is a trip
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-29,my favorite part of this is that closed captioning is writing carol whenever he says carl and its just so right.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,this video was enlightening because ive never actually seen someone ignore shadowheart on the ship and i was curious what happens if you did.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"honestly, it's actually quite nice to see kevin be playing a good character for once. as a dnd player he is not nearly as bad as he could have been!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-06,ive never seen anyone play this game less proficiently. truly a marvel of not knowing what the fuck a single feature of the game is. you didnt even level up. you shot a bunch of people at point blank range with disadvantage and got confused when it wasnt working. you forgot to reequip your weapon and tried to fistfight kagha as a level one bard. astonishing with love
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-07,"kevin, running past the broken waypoint okay uhhhh i don't know what that is we're just going to ignore it  gale disapproves.  astarion approves."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,3250 the fact that its asterion saying this makes this so perfect and believable
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i love the voice overs, they really add depth to the character, so we really feel what carl is going through."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,im loving bg3 and im loving all the content coming out of it because its so open ended. kevins playthrough is my favorite by far. only kevin could screw this game up so badly. military genius
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i couldn't do an evil playthrough, but i know you can, kevin! i'm counting on you!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-04,"you're no thrall! yeah i'm just carl. which interestingly enough is a distinct class from a thrall. they're two of the three broad classes in ancient nordic society. thralls slaves, carls freemen, and jarls nobles."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,kevin reloading to nring astarion back from the dead when be was literally standing in the room to find withers is...very on brand
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i'm surprised kevin did not pick dark urge. it's not an origin character but a background, it will allow you to be an absolute psycho. for example! when gale is reaching out his hand from the swirly purple portal that kev ignore, a dark urge player can fantasies about cutting off his hand...and turns out, you did! and now you got gale's severed hand in your inventory."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,anyone else love to see rtgamer and kev play the multiplayer coop of this game? and possibly the spiffing brit too
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin really needs to find a dnd campaign to join, just once lol  also, leave ti to kevin to show us every outcome we've never seen lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-07,"as a dnd lover, there's something incredibly fun and endearing about watching a newbie discover its weird ass mechanics for the first time in balders gate reminds me of playing for the first time. also i love how well the chaotic energy kevin exudes goes with the game i hope theres more videos like this! also incredible that kevin, a natural born bard, actually picked that class!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-03-07,he missed! he was right next to him! yes kevin you have disadvantage with ranged weapons in melee range
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"kevin waiting so long to level up his characters is frustrating  and i never even knew about the shadow druids storyline! that's crazy how big this game is! please continue this game, even if it's like fable and you only play once a year!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i got a natural 20 at the swamp entrance check and was very confused why there were a bunch of goblins running around going baaaaah.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"it's so interesting watching other people play bg3, i've been through this part 3 times already and i'm still learning heaps of new stuff watching kev play"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-20,when kevin said i have one loose end to tie up i yelled out the sheep! lmao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,im going to be the most evil character makes lute player who wants to make friends with everyone
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"in the past when kevin had complete freedom to do what he wanted, it ended very badly for everyone involved"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"carl is probably one of the most normal looking characters youve created, and that knowledge scares me a little. lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,i want an entire series of kecin playing this game! it allows you to be legitimately evil in ways i haven't seen in other games and i wanna know how far kevin will take it!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-19,"the dark urge character has a serial killer story line and you can still customize them. i think that would suit you a lot. it has tons of rich story and cinematics, and honestly it's super screwed up too. reminds me of jim pickens."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-06,"honestly, kevin ignored gale for the same reason i did that looks dangerous, only i thought it was something to come back to because ive played older rpgs...not that i was supposed to interact with it. i still slap his hand first, because he should clarify."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,downloading a bunch of kevin videos including this one for a very long flight in a few hours so thank you in advance kev for keeping me entertained through that haha
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"the beauty of dd is you can try to do literally anything. punch a guard, piss on a king while he gives a speech to thousands, ignore the main quest and start a fast food chain empire instead. the best sessions are almost always the result of chaos"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-25,"she has an irish accent, i'm on her side! irish lads together strong"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-25,"1211 giving astrarion a disadvantage by being too close and using an arrow, so he's very likely to miss and then blaming him for missing"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,i legitimately never knew you could walk around the sunlit wetlands like this. the devs really thought of everything. i love it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,the fact that he found none of the other companions or at least none on screen i could see in camp is absolutely sending me
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i really hope kevin continues this as a series  there is so much more evil  i mean, sensible decisions carl can make in the world of baldurs gate 3. will we see shadowheart again? will astarion be carls only friend? who knows?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"i decided to be evil on my first playthrough because i can never manage to do it i feel bad for being mean to digital characters, and boy oh boy did some of the evil things give me ptsd. love that kevin has been enjoying the game as well! the game is long as hell but hopefully there might be a full playthrough someday!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,"i don't know if that was evil exactly but it was definitely the most chaotic dnd i've ever witnessed, and i ran a game where one of the party ran their horse off a cliff on purpose."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-23,i've got 3 money donates his 35 gold from the jade to the rich druid merchant in exchange for a worthless shovel
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,i am absolutely shocked that he didn't pick the dark urge. but this is still funny. poor astarion can't get a break in kevins run. xd i really hope he makes more baldur's gate videos.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,get the animal talking perk if you don't have it! it's hilarious and opens hours of conversations
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-17,"as a big fan of this game, it was hilarious and painful to watch you stumbling through it! d you discovered some things i missed though, so you were clearly doing something right..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-30,"he just passes by gale without even investigating.  man, this was hilarious"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-18,"i desperatly hope that kevin will revisit this game! it has so much depth in what you can do, he's barely scratched the surface. i've seen a lot of people play this game, but this video still had some things that were new to me, like the way he dealt with the guys in front of the crypt. this game is a playground and i want to see kevin play more!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-14,nearly everything said in this video is incorrect.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,correction even if you free halsin you can recruit minthara if you knockout her out by the final blow being set to non lethal at which in act two once you make it to moonrise you'll see minthara at moonrise being questioned then thrown in jail in the basement which after a few skill checks you can free her then send her to your camp
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,"so this is all wrong. like shockingly so. you can still get the absolutes mark even if you do free halsin by just leaving him in the dungeon while you go get ragzlin, or just getting the mark beforehand. similarly, knocking out minthara with a nonlethal attack will also allow her to be recruited in act 2, just like with the evil play through. and attacking the grove like he suggest locks you out of tons of stuff later on"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,never understood why halsin didn't just wildshape into a rat or something and escape that way.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,actually freeing halsin doesn't make everybody in the camp hostile to you instantaneously i believe that only happens if the three goblin children escape the room. you can also still recruit minthara in act 2 if you knock her unconscious
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,depending how you feel about gnomes shows a halfling
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,"freeing halsin does not make the whole camp hostile. nor does killinmg minthara or any of the other two leaders. if you knock minthara out instead of killing her, you can still recruit her in act 2. and the gnome is a halfling."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,halsins my boy! what do you mean don't let em free? you mad?!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,if you knock out minthara before killing droir ragzlin and shes temporarily hostile you can recruit her later on as a permanent companion even with halsin as of patch 6 or 7.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,"keep halsin out of the party and have him stay in the prison room. if you walk out and hes with you, every goblin will attack you. that leaves a high chance of him dying, being unable to be revived and his quest is gone, and his dead corpse shows up at camp where hed naturally would be if he is saved. either fight the bosses first or have him stay behind until the leaders are dead. the kids only notify the guards. if you use nonlethal and knock out minthara then you can recruit her later."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,yeah im gonna go ahead and shit all over this. destroying the grove and siding with the goblins locks you out of a ton of quests in act 2 and 3 and also costs you allies in the final battle. if you wanna rp as an evil character thats fine but dont try to make it out like its advantageous to go this route.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,i have an extremely ridiculous story idea that my teenage self would love  in fact i wrote a story in that universe as a teen that i never did finish. this is good advice!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,the guy who posted this has no clue. damn near everything in this video is wrong. bad advice. at least now i know not to subscribe or take any of his other videos serious much less even consider watching them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-19,"i don't know if you've noticed, but i am a drow and one of their leaders is, too. i cannot be seen murdering my own kind.  what are you talking about? you drows murder each other all the time.  you haven't been listening, i cannot be seen murdering my own kind. wait here and i'll take care of it. quietly. shadowheart approves actual dialogue between drow tavdurge and halsin, if you choose these options, halsin will hide in the prison room and the camp won't become hostile unless and until you sound the alarm or murder dror ragzlin."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-02,"you don't have to chose between one and the other   side with minthara and let her leave for the grove  once she's gone, clear the goblin camp  free halsin  go to the grove for the attack, betray minthara and defend the grove.  knock out minthara during the attack you get to keep halsin, recruit minthara in act 2, every quest merchand, xp and item inside the goblin camp and play the grove attack, one of the best quest in act 1. the only thing you won't get is the romance scene with minthara after the attack."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"basically, this was true and happening, but after a patch it changed. everyone yelling it's bad advice it wasn't for a while but that bug got fixed. og's knows the stuff"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"you can always recruit minny ever since patch 5, more than a year ago"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,sorry but you are wrong on most of your assumptions.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,"you can free halsin without actually making the entire goblin camp hostile, you also don't necessarily have to kill all the goblins eitherif you can just get the leaders"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"as long as you don't kill minthara, she'll still join you if you save her in act2"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,and you dont need to attack the grove and sleep with her to recruit her.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,you miss out on overwhelmingly more stuff by invading the grove and killing the teiflings.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,you can still recruit minthara if you knock her unconscious via toggling on non lethal attacks. the only catch is you can't use attack spells to finish the fight.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,you can do all of this and still free halsin
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,freeing halsin only aggros that room unless you take him through the camp with you. killing dror ragzlin aggros the entire camp
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-07,"the only reason why i hate leaving halsin is not curing the shadow curse in act 2. other than that, idgaf. sometimes it's worth the drussy."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"there's not really any reason to leave halsin in jail since you can knock out minthara and if you make the right choice later on, you can recruit her, idk about the absolute stuff tho never did it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,"guys, all the info here is false, 1. you can get absolute's mark regardless of freeing halsin or not 2. you can recruit minthara regardless of attacking on grove or not and regardless of freeing halsin or not you can knock her out with nonlethal attack at goblin camp 3. only attacking dror ragzlin turns the whole camp hostile. you can attack minthara and princess gut without the camp turning hostile."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,gotta have halsin to remove the shadow curse
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-22,"don't attack the grove, it locks you out of stuff. instead, get the mark from priestess gut, then ask her for help with the parasite and kill her in private, turn on nonlethal damage and knock minthara out, you should be able to loot her but see that she has hp but is just unconscious, and kill dror ragzlin, either leaving halsin in jail during all that and getting him after or freeing him before starting all that but telling him to wait there until you're done because yes, freeing him and taking him with you while everyone there is alive and able to fight makes them all hostile, but seriously destabilizing the operation without him around until after and not killing minthara lets you recruit her in chapter 2. now, i am aware this is the way to get her in chapter 1 and she has dialogue and commentary about what has happened and is coming and if you want be an evil character, you can absolutely do this and get her in chapter 1, but again, attacking the grove locks you out of stuff later, so don't do it this way."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,everything you just said is wrong
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"thats not true you can let him out and not have the goblin camp hostile, its only after you kill or knockout minthara in the emerald grove that they all become hostile"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,you can still recruit minthara later if you knock her out instead of killing her.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,my favorite part as durge is to get minthara just to snap her neck at the end of act 1 lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,"you can recruit minthara simply by just knocking her out in act 1. then free her from prison in act 2. congrats, you get minthara"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,freeing halsin does make all the goblins hostile just the ones in the pit. this is trolling or just flat out lies.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,dude maybe you should replay bg3 again
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,fair warning .. if u let the hogs loose while in dialogue with the bear .. the goblins and halsin will be hostile to your party .. .. ask me how i know
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,was this video made by minthara
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-07,i have 700 hours in and will never nor have never let the druids die. 7 runs in singlesave 2 successfully still won't run a non redemption ark for everybody.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,"so much wrong with this video. 1  freeing him doesn't make all goblins hostile, freeing him and having him follow you does. you can simply free him tell him to stay behind, and then go on your murdering spree, or even better yet, do all of the other stuff first and then free him. 2  you can get minithera still, as others have said 3  you can get the mark before freeing him"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,"in my last run i romanced minthara, destroyed grove, recruited halsin and wyll and karlach stayed with me"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-24,just tell halsin to wait go to minthara break war drum then steal something in front of her knock her out then kill the others make sure not to kill the hobgoblin until after knocking minthara out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-02,time for an evil guy play through.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-01,"you can free halsin and recruit her, you just have to knock minthara out, as long as she is still alive you can recruit her in act 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,knock out minthara not kill her and you can pick her up later after saving the grove.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,played through bg3 twice and halsin died each time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-19,"that's not true tho, literally just went to the goblin camp, freed halsin but told him to stay behind so i can kill the leaders with stealth and no one was hostile, i could still ko minthara to recruit her and do some others things in their camp without problem they are only hostile if you take halsin with you or once you kill the hobgobelin"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"this guy has no idea what he's talking about. first off, interesting is a subjective term, secondly, you can free halsin, and no one will know about it, you will have your regular reputation at the camp after the battle, thirdly, you can just knock out minthara and then save her later in act 2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,"nope you can recruit her either ways. just make her temporarily hostile, easiest way steal the chest behind her. use non lethal on her must be a melee attack. and kill the rest of the goblin camp. then in act 2 she will be question and jailed. rescue her help her escape and she becomes a permanent companion. this video is very misleading and misinformed"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"yeah thanks no. i'm still freeing halsin and killing minthara in all of my runs yes i am fully aware that i could recruit her by knocking her out, i just hate her."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-01,"you can knock out minthara, and then recruit both her and halsin in act ii"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-02,nah you can just knock out minthara and still get her in act to will doing the good end in act 1 you jsut cant kill her
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,you can just do it last as well
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,this is a misconception and shows this dude has not thoroughly played the game. surprised people still beleive this even after the game has been out for more than a year
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-20,people read the comments and take their advice instead.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,i've heard if you take down minthsra nonlethally she still appears in act 2
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,knock out minthara to recruit her killing the grove has wyll and karlack leave and potentially gale if you fail a check
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,you loose way more content by siding with the goblins
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-01,dont need to sleep with her to get her. u can reject her.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,are you playing a role play game or do you only care about min maxer?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,"this is a little outdated, just a little"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,bro knows nothing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,theres so many things wrong in this short
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,wow. every word in that short was wrong.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-06,1 just knock out minthara 2rescue halsin kill the other two leaders you get loot from everyone dror and gut and their rooms 2.5 if you dont let them attack the grove the teiflings and the druids both reward you bonus if you expose kahga as shadowdruid you get a new staff and hidden title if you convince her to turn back to the light 3go get minthara from moon rise towers she is being tortured in the basement right after you meet kethric have the the half ork go easy on her 4 plan the break out of the iron hand gnomes and teiflings speak to the teiflings first get caught by the guards then say are they gonna talk you too death then throw a weapon you dont need into the cell 5 kill the warden take her stuff go back get minthara free spell slot restoration 6 tell the gnomes its time to leave they break the back wall for a ship that goes directly to lastlight inn this gives the potent robes and the iron hands will give a bomb that can blow up the factory killing all the steel watchers in act 3 also if you save the gondians they can make a stronger steel watcher in the final fight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-17,theres a lot wrong in this video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,this video is really needs a update most of the information are not true
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-15,and have a really boring act 2 because of it is gone if you go bad in act 1.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,"so, none of that is true"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,this is false. i'm surprised people still beleive this after the game has been out for more than a year
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-11,"this is so full of wrong! nothing in this video is true. this guy must have played only once, enjoyed being a jerk and thinks his choices are the only ones you can make."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,"if it wasn't for the fact that i want to save the tielfings and lift the shadow cursesave thaniel, i would 100 leave halsin to rot in the goblin camp in my next playthrouhh  just so i could avoid him hitting on tav in act 3 i thought they fixed his dialogue where he didn't think tav was hitting on him, even when dialogue choices were neutral  but it's apparently still an issue."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,"wow, all of this is fucking wrong."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,a bunch of this is wrong. try againbut better
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,stop lying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,this video is pure misinformation just ignor it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-05,video is extremely outdated 1. just ask halsin to stay in that room and you can roam the camp freely 2. goblins only become hostile on sight after you kill ragzlin 3. since patch 5 you can knockout minthy with nonlethal damage and act 2 sequence with her will play out as normal 4. the grove confrontation has a dozen different outcomes depending on if you provoke druids to fight tieflings
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-31,"this is super outdated, don't spread misinformation"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,positioning your party to set up devastating ambushes by ungrouping your party before initiating combat can be so helpful with encounters that allow you to do so. i practiced by reloading the temple encounter just outside the nautilus crash over and over again until i could beat that encounter in 3 turns and it helped me understand the systems so much better that encounters now feel like fun puzzles rather than a punishing slog.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i killed every single goblin including all 3 leaders. it took me 6 hours but after leaving that castle i was so freaking happy. 1010 game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"another thing that helped me was, if you and any of your companions have their turns directly next to one another in the combat order, you can use them in any order that you want."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"side note during the why you're missing your attacks section. you can absolutely make ranged attacks with a strengthbased character keep some lighter weapons with the thrown property on them. handaxes, javelins, and light hammers are all strength weapons that can be thrown. daggers work, too, and are plentiful."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,one of the most powerful items in the game candle doesn't cost anything to drop it and then use a bonus action to dip your weapon for fire dmg. or drop it on oil..etc. to set it aflame.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-17,"i'm 30 hours long in bg3 and i still benefit greatly from videos like these so tyvm for taking the time. being completely new to the dd and turn based genre in general, this game has proven quite difficult to play well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-11,"great video! helped a lot. during the goblin castle encounter, when your main character is separated and alone with the goblin priest, i chose dialogue options which led to a fight. i lock picked the door with my outside characters and led them inside the room. i had my characters jump onto the upper platform and out of reach of the multitude of enemies. then, i noticed i could see an adjacent room full of flammable barrels. so, i waited patiently until several enemies barged into that room in order to reach me and attack. i then used fireball and blew up the entire room killing most of them and using line of sight and character movements while having this high ground to avoid getting hit while maintaining advantage on my hits. i did this before i really understood combat but knew that in this game you should always seek to use your environment to your advantage. really fun encounter and very rewarding game! never played dnd myself."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,for sneak attack rogue feature set sneak attack in your reactions to ask. and never use the sneak attack button. just attack and trigger sneak attack. this is because sneak attack can trigger on the first hit even your offhand dagger. if you use sneak attack button in game and miss you loose the sneak attack.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,this is a must watch for any beginner like myself. im at the library finishing up some work while the game is downloading at home. im beyond stoked to jump in the world.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i got to my first fight and had no idea what to do. so i opened up my youtube feed, and here this video was. incredible timing. i can't even find the button to register the bonus attacks  thanks for the tips!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this is actually a really good video for getting the basics ingrained in new players! very important to make sure you have advantage as much as possible, it makes you roll a crit twice as often, and makes your chance of a 1620 nearly 44. disadvantage does the opposite, making you roll the bottom half of the dice 75 of the time!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i've never played dd or baldur's gate before so this helped me understand a bunch of stuff. thanks for making it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i appreciate all the guides, but ones like this are extremely helpful. i was starting to feel overwhelmed because of all the mechanics. thank you."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"014 i was feeling pretty good about how that encounter went for me, coming from the other door way. then i see you effectively take out everyone with that one shot its fascinating the differences that can arise in the experience of play depending on the choices you make. that's something you don't get to see when playing dd at the table"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-14,"tldr have at least 16 in your main stat ability that powers your attacks, which gives a 3 modifier do not wear armor and weapons you're not proficient in be sure to get the 2 modifier from proficiency get better and more unique weapons throughout the game that by themselves grant a 1 bonusenchanted modifier and so on for attacks that do attack rolls, try to attack from stealthhidden and elevated positions, and try to attack enemies that are prone or otherwise incapacitated these give bonuses to your attack rolls for attacks that require saving throws usually spells from the defender, try to debuff the defender in the corresponding stat wis, cha, dex etc. so he gets penalties to his saving throw, making it less likely he will resist the attackspell effect remember that the defender tries to overcome the incoming spell's difficulty class use bless and other buffs that grants bonus to your attack rolls in order to defend yourself, use debuffs e.g. bane that gives penalties to enemies' attack rolls, which lowers their chance to hit you. conversely, buffing your ac armor class will also make it harder for enemies to succeed in their attack rolls. and having a high abilitystat score can also be from buffs or items can make it easier to save throw resist spells related to that abilitystat. remember to check if there is a bonus action that should be done before the action, like knocking the target prone first, and then following that up with the main attack try to get your melees close to the enemies' ranged, and keep your ranged away from enemy melee. ranged combatans will have a disadvantage penalty to their attack rolls if a melee is close to their face, and running away from such a melee will punish you with an opportunity attack of the type reaction, unless you've used 'disengage' or something similar. try to use cc spells to deny enemies their turn, so they're unable to do anything.then you can focus fire on the noncc'ed opponents and strategically wipe out your enemies one by one. other  make use of the environment using a fire bolt on an explosive barrel can knock out several opponents at once, and shoving an opponent off a ledge can sometimes be sufficient  dip your weapon in candles, torches, poisonous surface etc. before your ambush starts to get in a little extra damage  go into turn based mode ctrl  spacebar to easier setup ambushes and avoid enemy line of sight. also use g to split the group and move members separately to have them enter the encounter on their own term by stealth attacking for example"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"the blessing tip is quite literally a blessing. shadowheart can give your entire party a 14 bonus to attack rolls, this usually negates a lot of the miss bullshit you may encounter in the early game altogether."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-07,just bought this. never played dnd. this is overwhelming.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-11,"as a new person to dnd upon purchase of baldurs gate 3, this has by far been the most helpful video explaining combat mechanics. thank you so much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"grease is an amazing way to get enemies prone. u can use grease through spells and grease specific bottles. add in any form of fire and you make a bomb that can possibly knock over multiple enemies. additionally, hitting any explosive material grease, gunpowder, poison gas with an open flame torch, fireplace creates a similar effect. making sure u use ur actions to do as much as possible is key. this could look like saving an area of effect spell for when a group of enemies gather around a summon you had initiate combat or using party members who share initiative to create a grease bomb on enemies."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-23,"note that thrown weapons use strength, this will be your ranged option as a strength character. also, ranged weapons in the ranged weapon slot can affect melee or thrown weapons and vice versa. a common tactic for a ranged character would be to give them a shield because this will increase their ac by 2 even when they have their bow equipped."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,i have spent as much time watching guides as i have spent playing in the past 2 days. love it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"as far as gaining advantage, you can put your group into turnbased before combat to get in close as well and ungroup them to position them individually before combat. this is really important in some preset battles and you get some heads up when getting close because you can usually hear them talking or get a message like 'there seems to be some commotion ahead' or somesuch. that should be your cue to look ahead and see how the terrain is and make a rough plan on how to approach. if there is high ground, approach from that direction if possible, if you blunder in through a gully or valley chokepoint, don't cry when you find yourself surrounded."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,you have no idea how much i need this
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"re 317  some enemies can have an ac of 8, though they are few and far between. an excellent beginners guide, will be showing this to some friends who are getting into the game!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"a few extra points. keep an eye out for environmental opportunities. some barrels explode when attacked, others contain flammable liquids. a good example of this is when you fight the tomb robbers inside the ancient temple by the beach. outside, you can kill 2 of the robbers by shooting the pulley system that drops a weight on them and opens another entrance to the temple. you csn see the pulley at 752. shoving enemies off high ground is hilarious. it can often one shot a mob. you can even pick up and throw smaller enemies. or throw an exploding barrel, from above is best."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,you can use spells like mage hand to summon a helper directly next to an enemy which allows rogues to sneak attack them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"this video is a literal 11 for how playing 5e dd. i can't wait to get this game! as a dd player i'm really looking forward to this one. solasta crown of the magister is also a great dd game, only issue is that it only uses the 5e srd."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"turn off karmic dice in settings awesome guide as always, basically explains how to play 5e too haha. karmic dice artificially alters the randomness of d20 rolls to avoid streaks of success or failure!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the bonus push move is really good if you need to move and don't have the action to disengage
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"thank you for putting this together. whenever i ask others for help online, a majority of the responses are just get good or you might be too stupid for this game. go back to playing call of duty or something more your speed. i have never felt this dumb while playing a video game in my whole life."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"omg i had no idea you could hide your whole party in one click lol, that tip alone will help a lot."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this was one of the most useful videos i have seen on combat, i didnt realise that basically every attack is a dice roll, and your stats and positioning give you advantages and disadvantages, and now can max my build to hit attacks more"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"i play 5e frequently so i just wanted the game footage, which was appreciated. thank you. also because i like the channel and your guides a great listen."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-08,410 if you plan on taking a feat that grants a 1 to your stat at lvl 4 its well worth pushing for that 17 in character creation.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,the barbarian class with ragefrenzy is insanely fun for melee play. i was running around in battle with 'hidden companion' and picking up and tossing the sorry lot onto each other
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"i shared this video on the steam forum of the game, since i've seen countless topics about people complaining the game being too hard when it's really not, it's just a very niche and different combat system for people not familiar with dungeons and dragons. great work dude!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-19,"been playing lords of the fallen, done basically. going back to bg3, first run was rough but now after watching, sooo many things i shouldve done. great video"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this has cleared up quite a few things that were causing me to miss. thanks
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"just thank you, not sure how but in a video that is not that long, i have learned a lot more that in 20 others i have watched on bg3"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"getting advantage however i could made such a difference to me in combat, everything clicked after that"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,not sure if many have played it.. but the monk is hilariously good in bg3. their dash for a ki point fixes almost every gap closing issue. lae makes an amazing one.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"as a 5e player and dm a lot of this is 2nd nature to me, but what i love is the amount of interestexposure these rulesets are getting with bg3 which just means more people get dnd! great video dude."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this video really helped me. as much as buying new gear is common sense, you don't really know how much a small upgrade can impact. i bought my 4 all new bow's none of us having a dex focus but all of us are a lot more accurate and stronger. found actual useful gloves and even a pair of boots that gave me an extra armor class. truly can't say how much this helped so thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,so glad youre covering this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"one of my favorite parts of the game is the ai for the enemies, even on balanced tier of difficulty. when you put an enemy to sleep and his friend will spend a bonus to shove him to wake him up, they will use the potions and poisons they have, the will dip weapons for the damage bonus, they set traps and actually use them. it really adds a level of thinking to the game that you do not see too often, which is refreshing. also, i am only a few days into playing it and haven't even settled on a main toon yet. the only issue i have had with the game is i wish the party total was 5 instead of 4. i have a really hard time narrowing down to a party of 4, and my parties often end up just looking the same, or i have to exclude someone i really want to use because i need to have the slots used for specific roles."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"while i did somewhat understand the mechanics of the game good enough to reliably make it halfway through act 2, this video explained things i didnt knew and are incredibly helpfull, thanks a lot lad!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"great video  i played a ton of 2nd edition dnd games like bg1  bg2 back in the day, and some modern games like pathfinder that resemble that. but i am unfamiliar with 5e, so this video was great for getting me up to speed, for example learning exactly what advantage means. thanks!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-19,"631 bless is a great spell that isn't just for the early game. because combat difficulty tends to scale kind of linearly at higher levels, the 1d4 from bless remains relevant even at higher levels. the only reason you would not want to use bless at higher levels is if you had stronger spells which required concentration, and even then it's still a good backup for when you've already burned through your higherlevel spell slots."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,fantastic video. i have spent about 8 hours trying to get to grips with the basics of this very complex game and this video clarified a lot of things.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"this is god tier information, going to enhance my gameplay that's for sure! thanks, mr. bilzerian."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"i'll watch this again  first time ever in a game like this. playing on easy but struggling at the goblin place once we've found that 'bloke'. seriously i would say that 90 of my attacks from any character are at 50. i know i'm doing it wrong but i need to find out what. so, so many misses on almost every go. i do want to learn as outside of fighting this has me, but once fighting i am lost"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"1. pick up the blessing staff in the arcane tower. equip to cleric on bless duty. 2. barbarian reckless attack grants advantage. great combo with great weapon master feat. 3. wild heart barbarian gets a wolfpack ability which grants advantage for teammates. great if you have multiple melee attackers. 4. knocking prone grants advantage, among other statuses. command spell or battlemaster can do this well. 5. sleep or hold grants automatic crits. glyph of warding can also achieve this with a wide range."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-23,thank you very much! i'm twelve hours in and this has been quite useful!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-24,"instead of disengage, shoving takes a bonus action and if successful will give you room to move without triggering reaction attack and you still have an action"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-22,"thanks so much, fextra! this video clarified everything."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,thank you for these types of videos!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-10,thanks a lot! this immediately helped get me past the frustration in what is an excellent game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,the value of this video
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"addicted to bg3, but new to tabletop gaming rules. was having an easy enough time in game, but man, this just made me realize how poorly i was actually playing. great video."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-10,i need this video. i love pretty much everything this game has to offer up until actual gameplay and combat gets involved. its all so slow and restrictive that i actively avoid combat when i can just so i dont have to deal with it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,im looking forward to this game! i just started my first dnd campaign with my buddies a few months ago. this game is quite serendipitous lol also first!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-22,"bro ive had it downloaded for a few weeks, just trying to get all the information i can before jumping in. ive probably watched 10 hours worth of guides and best builds im gonns hop in and kill it im beyond stoked!!! no spoilers tho lol!!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"video idea first, thanks for this video, it is helpful. second, i have a video idea. there are so many icons and choices on the screen, that knowing what to they are all mean and what to press is confusing for someone new to this type of game. id find it very helpful to have someone walkthrough combat while explaining all of the different menus and icons that are used. cheers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-05-28,"i can't believe i've spent over 60 hours in this game with my monk, and never thought to use the bonus action first to knock the enemy over and make the next attacks easier. i always thought bonus actions were a last resort kind of thing. well i still made it to act 3 barely, but didn't know about the halsin lift the shadows side quest, and now i want to start over from the beginning!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"also cast all your aoe debuffs and buffs before combat, so youre not using turns casting them"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-09,"ive been mooching off your from software videos for a while now, had to subscribe after this one. thanks!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,im new to these kind of games and i ended up at the goblin camp for 7 hours. i had no idea you could set up fights and just blow everyone up before the fights begins. i love this game lmao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"as a complete novice, this was extremely helpful! thanks."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,"dude, you're killing it with all these guides, super helpful and probably the content i've enjoyed the most for baldur's gate 3! your feat explanation video helped me make a more informed decision regarding a feat for my paladin! thank you"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,tip most if not all enemies in bg3 are immune to harsh language even if you have the high ground while talking down to them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,this answered so many questions. thanks so much.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,this game gives me such strong dragon age  origins vibes. lovin' every second of it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-20,best video ever after looking for hours of content... thanks!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-10-11,"and after finishing this game, you'll receive a university diploma in mathematics."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-30,amazing video explaining how combat works and what you should be looking out for
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,quick tip for ranged characters. shoving instead of disengaging is better. the enemy wont get an opportunity attack on you and you still have an action afterwards
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-08,best video i have seen on attack mechanics!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,why do i feel like i'm studying applied mathematics at mit?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-09,"i have had some of the worst luck with rolls lately, constantly rolling natural 3s party wide. so seeing you miss that attack at 312 with a natural 3 was triggering lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-09-16,i'm playing on the lowest dif. and still losing.....i don't get this combat at all....level 2 goblin has a bomb and does 20 dmg. while me level 5 only 7 like wtf....idk i guess the game is not for me.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,thank you very much. very nice tips
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-21,this is the hardest game ive ever played in my entire life.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,i already played for some hours and just force my way by repeatedly did bad throws in battle. now i can make sense of the game more
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,1. barrelmancy 2. barrelmancy 3. barrelmancy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-13,"give whomever is your best ranged character three wooden boxes to carry around. when you fight out in the open with no high ground in sight, stack the boxes and climb on top. portable high ground."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,i thought monks could use quarterstaffs two handed. i think the requirement for monks to use wisdom or dex is simply proficiency. it would be a design oversight if quarterstaffs were not a monk weapon in every way conceived. i've encountered a lot of these sorts of design issues in this game so i wouldn't be surprised.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,"thank you so much, i needed this"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-08,imagine if this game had fun combat. probably would've made everyone's alltime list.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-27,thank you for the info. a lot of stuff i was just completely unaware of.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,be aware that you have disavantage when attacking prone enemies with ranged weapons or spells.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-18,great video! explained so much!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,yo i'm so bad at the combat i made the goblins look like gods
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-08,"thank you for this guide, has helped so much!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-07,play on easy difficulty. build what you think is fun. don't worry about viability. 4 druid party if you want. this is the way.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-03,awesome quick and dirty info!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-06,im still in character creation
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-08-31,"these are some great tips thank you. i just got the game and i admit i don't know what's going on. the combat system is unlike anything i've ever played, i have no clue which parts of the world i should discover first where i'll run into harder encounters etc i already lost count of how many times i just restarted from save. i like the game and i can tell it's good but gods help me idk what i'm doing at all."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-03,i understood nothing.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-12-02,"what ive learned is just dont expect to beat an encounter, especially one with multiple enemies on your first try and dont be discouraged. keep looking for weaknesses and use examine a lot before fighting to see their resistances and stuff."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"larian is a brilliant company. i applied for a job with them, and although i didn't get a job, they replied without condescending me. they said they would send my cv to their various departments and thanked me for applying and enjoying their games. every other gaming company ignored my applications. larian is a class act. if they care aboutrespect the people they don't want to employ, imagine how much they care about their employees, their product, and their customers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,i finally finished my original play through after over 500 hours because i couldn't stop making new characters and builds. it might be the greatest game of all time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,me and my wife never got to finish our first play through because our first baby was born and we just recently started a new one and its one of the best games to come out the last 10 plus years for sure.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,i have been playing bg3 every night with friends and almost done with my first playthrough. this is an absolute masterpiece
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,the dark urge custom playthrough alone sets this game apart its insane how well implemented it is with the story and the now new endings.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"ive only done one 140 hour playthrough so far and then put another 40 hours into multiplayer. never thought i'd love a turn based game this much, when all is said and done in 10 years time i think it will go down as my favourite game of all time."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-29,"you forgot to mention one thing, the fantastic music this game has, this is the first time ever that i find myself listening to the music outside the game in over 2 decades, it is truly enchanting and it transport you somewhere else, sublime"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"btw, any race can be the dark urge. you dont need to play the white dragon"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,this game should be sent into space so aliens will know what humans are capable of.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-03,"another thing worth mentioning is that larian isnt done yet. the upcoming patch 8 will add 12 new subclasses, crossplatform support, and photo mode"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"played it for the first time this year and it's easily my new favorite videogame ever made, ever, hands down. yeah, it holds up better than ever, especially after all the updates and fixes."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"it's sealed its position as my favorite game of all time. 7 playthroughs, over 1000 hours. going to hop back in after the next patch"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,short answer yes long answer yessssssssss
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,you haven't lived an evil play through until you added my gurl minthara to your group.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"the only larian origin character i've enjoyed was the dark urge, because it is fully customizable, and you dont lose out on a party member by picking it. while it has a history and backkstory is still truly felt like my character similar to how the exile and revan felt like my character when i played through kotor 1  2."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i think i've done all the subclasses by now minus some of the ones provided by origin companions and i'll say  monk open hand makes the game pretty easy when it comes to combat. i chose monk for my first honormode run and even scarier encountersfights weren't that challenging thanks to the insane amount of damage a monk can put out in a single turn.  any high cha characterclass makes the game easier when it comes to interactionsdcs and trading. this goes for any of these classes but especially bard which is one of the most enjoyable and versatile classes all around. plus you get some very interesting unique dialogue options with bard. if you're more into direct fighting either melee or ranged, go college of swords. if you want more of a castersupportstyle character, go college of lore. i would also highly recommend a durge playthrough if you haven't done it yet. lots of unique dialogue and scenes you'll never get as a nondurge character. i would also, also recommend a true honormode playthrough as i found that having to rely on a single savefile makes things feel so much more consequential. plus you'll earn yourself a set of golden dice if you finish it, so there's that.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,its such a shame so much rpg time is dedicated to the memory of bioware and bethesda when bg3 is out there not getting 16 videos a week
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-10,it's simply the pinnacle of rpg games. sheer excellence. i'll never forget this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i'm currently balancing 3 playthroughs at the moment. my tiefling rogue who is in act 3. my druid woodelf who's still in act 2 and my gith rogue who is in act 1. i spent christmas eve playing through cazador's home with astarion. the reason this game is so amazing is the story and the studio behind it. they are the reason this game is still so hot a year later.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,merry christmas to you and your family!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i recently started my second playthrough, using the dark urge as well. i do have to say that playing tactician mode with an expanded party is a great way to play. the increased difficulty offsets the combat advantages of having a larger party. i hate having to choose which characters you get to know by including in the party. this opens it up to experience more with each playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-09,im now convinced i want bg3. never played bg1 or bg2. went down the youtube rabbit hole on bg and now waiting for a steam sale. no gaming pc but i can still play handheld on the steam deck and on my 55 inch through its dock. i cant wait to lose myself in this game. i have a feeling ill be learning the bg world for years to come. im so damn excited but not excited enough to pay full price.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,the magic of this game is that every play through is completely unique. ive played 4 characters now so far and i literally find something new every time
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,finished my first complete run just last month! 1300 hours in game. 36 of all my gaming time this year has been bg3. i may need to seek professional help  anyway have a cool yule everybody and may 2025 be as awesome as you deserve
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,it's beyond peak
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,"baldurs gate 3 is the epitome of video game perfection. knew nothing about dd prior to the game, and i absolutely fell in love."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"literally considered getting to play this with my friend today, matty knows"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,playthrough 9 here. and i put it down to wait for the new classes. playthrough 9 will continue once that patch comes out
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i got over 1000 hours in it, i played every origin character, some more than once and i gotta say playing as durge seeking redemption is the best of the best of them all. trying to be good dark urge. withers is just top notch, one of his interactions literally made me tear up."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"i've been playing this game since december first of this year, i have 154 hours in on ps5 on my first playthrough and let me tell you this is effin badass. i literally can not stop playing this game its so so worth it. last time i played a baldurs gate game was in the ps2 era and even then i had fun with that one, so i was familiar with the franchise but bg3 is an entirely different beast."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"this is the best game ive ever played and im not even done with my first playthrough. in my head nothing could top ffvii or the witcher 3 or even oot but damn, im happy to admit bg3 did it. definitely 1 million recommend if you havent played it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-06,"im on my third play through, which im doing as shadowheart and playing as an origin character is pretty cool. you get some more in depth information, like what shadowheart experiences when her scar hurts and the gauntlet is very different and unique but besides that its just new dialogue options. its worth doing but there is so much out there to explore"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"babe wake up, new matty vid. also thought id let you know that you can actually change your class by talking to withers aka bone daddy in camp and paying 100 gold which also allows you to respec."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,nice commercial
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"after 20 playthroughs and loads of mods, this is the best game ever made."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,i'm in my first playthrough on my ps5 right now and it's pretty fucking awesome. this game is role playing masterclass.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-11,"my playthrough 3, playthrough 2 coop'd i chose the dark urge and in act 3 when we stumbled on a game changing conversation we were all so floored and excited. larian really just made a masterful video game. origin story playthroughs are fun when you're in coop with a friend who hasn't played yet"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,dark urge was pretty much the default backstory. first mod i want is the one that let's you pick your own background for the skills as dark urge. i don't think i'd ever really bother with all the other npcs as i'd rather have just had their content be part of the main story rather than their own play through
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i recommend both gabe combat ai and adjustable party limit, along with the whole better ui mod's. to play tb with just one player and let the ai play your companions in combat as a very cool alternative playthrough you can make the ai play all. i really would love to see larian do autotoggle tbai in the game too make it even better than the mod. completely viable way to play and it brings in more players that want less tb."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"the durge play is very fun, where you can be both the hero and the villain."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-05,"when i was a young warthog, i didnt have a lot of games so i would play the same games on repeat. if i had baldurs gate 3 then, it would have been heaven. so much replayability."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"imo, best mods is adjustable party size bring all your companions so you get all the story notesquips etc. missed so much raphaelmizora dialogue, as well as all the fun jahieraminsc interactions on my first play through. with the 11 party members, also need tactician enhanced mod to scale difficulty and hp with the extra party members. but roaming the world with the whole crew is 10000 worth it"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,i've heard that wyll's origin playthrough is a lot of fun! i also wanna play karlach and do the astarion romance since it's fascinating how the romance plays out with him when physicality is off the table.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,started my first play through a few days ago. im so grateful i picked this game up! its amazing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,the best game i have played in the last 45 years.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-31,"just fyi, penultimate means next to last. not superultimate."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,crazy to find you posted this yesterday. bought last night after wanting to play but being intimidated for so long
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"this just shows larian is not only way up there, in terms of quality developper, but is actually also next level. i cannot think of another company, today, that is merely close. maybe warhorse is there, too. and that's it. i cannot wait for larian to be given the opportunity to develop a fallout iteration... one that's a praise to the old black islesinterplay standards. godd howard, hear me out!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,3 things i have learnt playing bg3 1i don't enjoy dice roll mechanics. 2i don't enjoy strategy games that involve controlling multiple characters in combat. 3this game is amazing and i am mad i don't enjoy it more. edit 4 i don't enjoy playing in controller
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"imo a romanced laezel has the most and best character growth. my first few playthroughs, she stayed at camp unless i needed her for a specific story purpose. but romanced, she becomes pleasant."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,"just clocked 800 hours. 3 completed playthroughs, many more started. been a gamer for 30 years. bg3 is now my all time favorite game. it's outstanding and clicks with me in all the right ways."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-03,i gotta play this all the way through. for the first time. iv had the game since launch.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,gonna be booting it up again with the next big patch. cant wait to see all the new content i havent seen over the months.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"i bought it twice, ps5 and now on my rog ally."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,playing my first play through with a buddy. i cant believe how expansive this game is. and quality across every inch. i love this game so far. probably put in 70 hours and i dont see the end in sight
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,just did an honor mode multiplayer run through with 2 randoms today. lots of good moments if you dont take it seriously
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"larian has stated that dlc was not done because increasing the level cap would involve spells and skills that would be incredibly difficult to implement with the same detail as the original game. while i'm disappointed i do understand. i played an epic campaign once and that was insane. my favorite character though, a dark elf who was a mate to matron baerne in menzoberanzan. but she sacrificed him to the shadow realm, and after a few hundred years he found a way out but because of his time there he had shadow abilities. it was pretty cool."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-07,"have about 20 hours split evenly between a solo playthrough and a coop one. hands down one of the best gaming experiences storywise ive felt in forever. got the same feeling from when i first played skyrim and learned about the world as both were my first entries to the ips. please play this game if you havent yet, especially if you have a friend to play it with"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,absolutely no one is ready for what comes next from larian. its almost scary.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,got 500 hours and i just finished it once. great game i bought it for 60 when it came out and i got a full game with native mod support. best buy
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,fromsoftware and larian are the 2 best studios right now.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"i'm replaying it from last year, and god darn it only gets better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,"perfect timing. i stopped playing after a couple hours at launch because it was just too overwhelming. i just started a dark urge playthrough yesterday and even though i'm only a few hours in, i'm loving it. i will say you have to be in the mood to dive deep in order to really get into this game."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"i had to constantly try and convince a friend of mine to grab the game and while it took me about a year, she finally did. we just arrived at the grove and she's already enjoying the story, for me this is the first time doing coop and while the conversations can be tricky to trigger together properly, the experience is amazing!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"every origin playthrough feels like a unique experience, especially shadowheart. but honestly the dark urge is the canon main characher. if dark urge isnt there, then shadowheart is the main characher. not only does she have the artifact, but act 2 is pretty much all wrapped around her characher"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i got a physical copy at the start of the year and it's still in the plaster as i just don't have the time to play a game that big while studying my masters. as soon as i graduate i know exactly what i'm doing
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,you can customize the dark urge character however you want if you didn't know that! i'm on my third playthrough on dark urge tactician with a female warlock
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-02,i also finally bought this game on sale. i just downloaded it last night. can't wait to get off of work to try it.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,im downloading the game right now for my first ever playthrough of any larian game. excited
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-15,the single best replayability from a single player storydriven game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,the mods got me back in playing bg3 i never cared for them until now but bg3 is still goated though
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"im saving my second playthrough for the big path with subclasses, but its so tempting to start again just to see all the extra stuff theyve added since i finished it back in january."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"with mods, even on console, this game is in the top 5 games of all time for me. doing major battles with a party of 6 or more is simply awesome and having more party members along adds great dialogue. one of the best games ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,bro in the thumbnail looks at bg3 as if he's bg4 lol
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i have almost 2000 hours and i'm still coming across new things, it's wild"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"i have played it 17 1644 each time ,i have tried different characters and races, including all modes, including honor mode. played single player party and 6 player party. mods have made it even better"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-11,after 1500h i am still so much in love with this game! ty larian for this masterpiece!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i only ever play as durge now after my first play through. such a beautifully written character whether you embrace the darkness or seek to redeem yourself.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-28,"bg3 was really different for me. my first playthrough with a paladin lasted around 20 hours. didnt much care for the combat and was confused. then i did some research into mechanics, dove into another run as a sorcerer, and did a full run for about a 100 hours. truly up there alongside witcher 3 and skyrim as an all time great rpg, despite being very different than those two games."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"on my third play through approx 600 hours, played monk, wizard and fighter. every play through i find new stuff, new places and wtf moments. from one not really delved into turn based combat, it's such fun. the thought process involved over button mashing is addictive. bg3 is the best game i've ever played hands down, not only that is larien the best studio? so based, so player focus and not an activist in sight. they need a protection order"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"lol i've finished about 3 playthroughs, have two in act 3, have one in limbo at the end of act 2 and one at the start of, and a karlach playthrough in limbo in act 1. and many more deleted. and i've never done an embrace durge run. and now with mods i'm loving my modded mystic class with full party and new hair with a decked out new wardrobe. and i've found something new about every playthrough. i also left a second playthrough of dos2 in limbo in act 2 sometime this year. i love larian and i have no regrets upgrading to a ps5 last year just for bg3. plus they've got 12 new subclasses and etc coming in the next patch  they've been so good to us"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-27,there is a book about the quarians in mea... consider yourself glad your question wasn't answered. d
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"the charismatic monk mod is awesome. all the awesome monk stuff, plus high charisma. perfection. it's like playing dragon ball and naruto in dnd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"thanks for the nonspoliers. even though i got the game in ea and have some 100 hours into it, i still haven't got passed act 1. the main reason, beside rl getting in the way, is that i haven't been able to commit to what characterclass i want to play as. the fresh starts have been many."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,"man i've been debating on buying it while it's on sale or playing divinity original sin ii on switch  especially after finishing dragons dogma ii and getting the true ending, i want more fantasy slop"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-01,as someone who played baldurs gate 12 on their release i have waited all those years waiting for bg3. i always new it would be a best seller. i am determined to see and experience every line of dialogue every single quest every class of character as a pure build and then multiclasses. i have completed about 12 full runs now and the only 1 i think was slightly worse than the others was my dark urge run. there just aren't that many truly evil characters to support the dark urge. so slightly underwhelming compared to my other runs but this game for me stands as the ultimate rpg
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-02,"finished my first play through after 360 hours. just started my 2nd play through as a storm's thunder goliath dark urge vampire, death knight lol. shit's about to get crazy!!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"absolutely and it will be a very, very long time until something tops this."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-08,"i have just started today. i was overwhelmed when it first came out but today i have started and i am going to really take my time and really think about what i am doing, i know that i just need to invest my time and the payback will be massive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i did my second playthrough with my sister who plays much more pacifistic compared to me. i saw conversations that never even triggered for me. early on you can talk to a hyena and passing the roll means it helps fighting against the other hyenas making the it much easier.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,ha! kevduit mentioned. i love his 10pc nugg psycho runs.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"i have almost 2000 hours playing bg3. there's soooo much i haven't done or seen yet. trust me, if you think you've seen some crazy things, you've just scratched the surface. just playing durg has deep branching paths going many ways of finding redemption or pure evil. and they are about to add 12 new subclasses!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,i recently finished the game a couple months ago. it's the new standard for greatest rpg of all time. another other rpg will have to be compared to this if it is to take that title away.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-24,this game is so massive that my brain catches on fire every time i go to play it. so i'm still in act 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-06,"i was a little late to the party with this one. i'm on my third playthrough now and, despite taking my time on my second run to explore as much as i could, i'm still finding new interactions and quests."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-30,"i haven't got round to bg3 yet as i'm working my way through the trails series, so taking on another 300 hour rpg seemed like madness. currently on cold steel 3 though so the end is not too far on the horizon! stoked for bg3 when i finally get the chance."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,"always enjoy seeing love for my girl shadowheart. man, now i need to start new bg3 playthrough."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-26,"only had baldur's gate on ps5 so now with all the console mods, the game is so much better than it already was. also this time around i'm playing as the dark urge as a selunite paladin. it makes the romance with shadowheart more interesting and i've enjoyed becoming an oathbreaker as well."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,finally finished honor mode about a month ago. now to enjoy the mod playthrough
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-12-25,game of a generation masterpiece i'm waiting on my second playthrough . so stoked
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,yelling look out fggot to astarion is the funniest shit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"frank reynolds would not only survive with a parasite in his head, he would thrive."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,frank is the playthrough that we know we want to follow.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-18,"how chaotic evil do you want this character to be, fam? get me frank reynolds."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-04-20,"i just realized, the guy who played this must have played a dwarf, gnome or halfling to get all the characters to always look down when addressing frank. that's a great touch!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,frank fits perfectly with the freaky nature of this game.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"this is literally perfect. i made frank in a playthrough as a warlock, and my whole strategy is so anyways, i started eldritch blasting!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"okay, but why didnt you just call out your friends name? there was a lot going on! i needed something that would really cut through! i mean, as soon as i said it. everyone knew to look at astarion! even withers!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-16,"this entire thing is sheer gold, but frank nakedly trudging out of the portal is when i officially died"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-06-27,suicide is badass will unfortunately never fail to make me laugh.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-13,"let's be honest, the whole group pretending to be art collectors to steal the orphic hammer would be a fun alternative way to do the quest, with lots of charisma checks and subversions via dialog."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"dont judge me, this is art!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,i'd love to see everyone in bg3 mistake frank for a halfling and he doesn't know whether to be offended or flattered
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-17,frank reynolds dark urge warlock gold dwarf. favorite spell eldritch blast.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-08-01,i like to imagine that frank has been cured this whole time due to the mind flair parasite dying from alcohol poisoning
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,"frank calls mystra his dead wife. this means he was somehow alive before the spellplague or earlier assuming its midnight he's talking about and not the previous mystra, which would make him even older. he could be the reincarnation of laduguer, the former dwarf god of magic."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,extra points for not even needing the i started blasting and oh no you dont clips to still be hilarious 1010
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,its always sunny in baldurs gate sounds like an awesome sitcom.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-22,"as someone who's never watched much of always sunny, hearing look out, fggot! caught me offguard and i died laughing."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-28,"wow, he's really going crazy as the dark urge. dark urge?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-12,can i offer you a githyanki egg in this trying time?

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"dev only now figuring out reactions actually fits lae'zel's character. one of the things i hear her say the most in bg3 is action, not reaction! d"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,if you hurt this sweet little baby boy who's never done anything in his life karlach 2025 3 haha thank you! this is session is the actual shannenigans dnd w your friends ends up being like 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,did i already watch this entire thing in person? yes. am i going to sit and watch this entire thing again? absolutely.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"all those times wyll lectured tav about making deals with unsavory entities, and he got the crew involved with an archhag. bravo, blade of frontiers."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,"there was a youtuber whom looked into the question would any of the party members survive without tav?  well to keep it short, the answer was no  and this is another expample why xd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"the dm is not just trying to mitigate through chaos, she's fueling the chaotic flames..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i'm laughing so hard right now at how devora gets more and more chaotic with every dnd session.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,alternate title poor wyll's absolute worst day
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,you know from the shorts i did not expect the divvying up of astarions bodyparts to be the first scene.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,lae'zel and wyll ultimately sharing one singular braincell in making decisions is my new favourite trope. edit rewatching again and i just admire the growth lae'zel and wyll's relationship has taken. from lae'zel peer pressuring wyll into doing idiotic acts to wyll initiating the idiotic acts. two peas in a pod the pair of them.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,"the more i see theo in these the more i need to see of him . wyll can get drowned out sometimes by the bolder characters, but when theo gets his chance he absolutely delivers! i cried laughing when he threw up directly onto lae'zel and when helped his friends... with fireball . didn't lie when he got a nat20 on charisma, he doesn't need to be loud like the others, he's just got such pure relaxed natural rizz i swear  edit i was not ready for the shades during the eldritch blast at the end, the rizz"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,this is why tav demands everyone stay at camp when not with them.  the pure chaosdriven shenanigans!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,dev just makes laezel canonly unhinged every time she plays dnd and i fucking love it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"the way my jaw dropped when aabria mentioned a left hand, and sam and neil clicked in on what it is too..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i don't know what plot did abria have in mind when she planned her oneshot... but i doubt it was anything remotely close to this utter madness... and i loved it! true representation of what your average dnd session looks like xd
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"quick,someone get dev and brennan lee mulligan in a oneshot together. there will be no plot,but will be hilarious."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i love aabria so much. shes so good with navigating chaos and teasing out incredible character moments
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"i'm gonna help my friends... i cast fireball. i love you, theo."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,the announcer on aabria's intro... all the cool things ...but not baldur's gate 3 omg dead and the very aabria response of that's not on me! so great!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,i want to give so much props to aabria for her ability to take control of such a rowdy table full of largerthanlife personalities and reel them back into the game. i would wither on the spot with anxiety and nerves
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,neil wearing sleeves is the real surprise
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,wyll i will help my friends me aww  wyll i am going to cast fireball me  12337
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-10,im gonna help my friends  im gonna cast fireball  iconic
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,oh man she's an incredible dm!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,i love how rewarding yet brutally punishing aabria is
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i love how they got into deep shit immediately
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,astarion at the end sighs ill go get tav
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i'm just imagining astarion and karlach returning to camp and tav is all where are the others? pauses and what happened to your pants?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,karlach being the voice of reason today was not on my bingo card.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"theo solomon is so cute  love seeing him in these, really hope he comes back samantha and aabria have such great chemistry, and im obsessed with the way the session went at the end. so good i havent played dnd, just the bg games, but i feel aabria would be the most amazing dm for a first timer"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,11646 time to get litch or die trying!!! is such a great line!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i've got consequences incoming  not something you'd normally want a dm to say but this is pure hilarity so go ahead aabria throw your consequences at em
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,neil giving dev the 2 middle fingers has me absolutely crying
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,the shade of frontiers made a comeback

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,aabria is such an incredible dungeon master. the bullet time moment was absolutely brilliant improvisation.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,everytime i see theo play wyll or just see an interview with him i am sadder he wasnt involved in his development from the beginning. i feel they would have leaned into theos natural charisma much more. he plays wyll so cute
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-11,aabria is an amazing gm omg. her banter and sass with these players that shes never played with before and still being easy and considerate to different knowledge levels. gm goals for real
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"as entertainment, this was amazing. as a dd game, this is a what not to do  not to allow your players to do video. and it rocks for both."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,not even 15 minutes in and aabria has lost control of the table  and i dont think she minds one bit
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-01,i am in love with this dm. she seems like so much fun.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,"aabria is such a good dm. i didn't realize she was so good! she really jives incredibly well with the whole cast, encourages their shenanigans and yet  keeps them on track."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,one point of boop damage.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,lae'zel we'll give you astarion
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,we need a part two!!!!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i didnt ask how big the alleyway is. i said i cast fireball.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,i've noticed that devora doesn't really do the lae'zel voice during dnd. it's more like chaotic dev throw into the bg3 universe with the other characters vibes
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,12317 fireball solves everything.  wyll
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"this is the single most beautiful trainwreck i've ever seen. kudos to all of the cast and crew, 'twas a fricking blast!"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,"you've learned nothing, you've learned nothing  sounds like every dm that has chaos monkeys at their table."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,it's insane these voice actors are still doing stuff for the game! you don't see that very often.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,baldurs gate dd part 2 the rescue of wyll and lae' zel???? im excited!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,15026 betwixt the cheeks?!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,being bisexual means having a crush on every person on that stage
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,devora has no idea about this game and that is perfect to play la'zel. what a great energy they all have. and theo is the introvert in a group of extroverts. love this group. they really should do a whole campaign
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,my headcanon is that tav was on a date with shadowheart while gale was stuck in camp nursing a sore tummy from eating someone's magical shoes. halsin and jaheera were probably talking to animals in the woods. minsc was trying to convince minthara to be less evil via an arm wrestling contest.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"'this is neil speaking, this is not good' i don't know much about bg or dnd but this is delightful"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-09,"2859 ngl that line goes hard. its not a matter of can, its a matter of dont feel like it."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i love how these guys keep doing these sessions. this is the third one i have watched and they are just so good with these characters.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-07,i love that wyll and devora started as brand new first time players at the launch of the game and to see them come so far and having so much fun with it is great!!!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"honestly this is so refreshing and so much fun. a lot of actual play shows offer quite a curated, polished experience. the way aabria leans into the chaotic nature of her crew, and turns their relative newness to the game into part of the fun is absolutely glorious."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-17,"the way wyll could at any point interject and point out that he currently has one eye, two horns, and his entire existence bound to a devil because he made a pact but doesn't is sending me. what a polite guy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"aabria is amazing as a dm. there's something that she makes it so incredible and interesting just to watch. everyone here is amazing, don't get me wrong. but a great dm is what makes a great campaign."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i love aabria just letting these guys absolutely butcher the rules of this game lmfao
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i was front row for this show. what an incredible experience! they were so charismatic of course and all of the ridiculous antics were so fun to feel in person! love you all! do it again!!
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-12,"lmao wyll's va is such a natural as the blade of frontier and justice. in the face of a fearsome relic, his first concern is oh no we are working for a criminal"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,"damn, karlach scolding laezel made me feel like i did something wrong, truly the team mom."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"timestamps for myself  gonna keep updating as i watch 654 the gasp i just gasped 2530 i had to stop and play the theme song 2828 keep your friends close and your enemies closer  3440 live action odysseus vs his crew  ohhh and the bag disintegrated did not expect that  sometimes i forget bagsboxes.. are not invincible  4314 loll 4323 that tsk'va delivery was so good omg 4344 wylltheo trying to wipe it off 4444 i love how in bg3 if you allow him astarion can get ahold of the necromancy of thay and now in this little adventure he gets ahold of a vecna relic.. is it time for me to multiclass him into a necromancer in my next run? 5310 gasping gasp 5348 good shit from neil! the deal taking advantage of wyll's kindness, a man of good heart, a man who would save his friends  it's great because it's similar to mizora's words when she first appeared to him  what is going on haha  10029 why do i hear boss music 12337 wyll wants to help his friends! 12849 dungeon master samantha  13015 ah, in that case, stab won't work 13529 hands are gone !!  at this point i'm surprised there has been no need a hand? jokes future me i stand corrected  13732 little blessing 15026 second butthole for the necromancer 15358  15656 this whole section is just chefs kiss 21840 guys?   and with that, the video has ended. if you are not me, and you're a stranger reading this, have a great dayevening! much love to everyone involved btw! this was such a nice treat to watch after work lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-03,people are calling out dev for derailing but tbf shes doing exactly what id do if i had to perform a game of dnd in front of an audience while not knowing how it works and trying to role play a character you didnt make
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,devora legitimately reminds me of myself when i first started dnd. i appreciate this level of chaos
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,this might be their most chaotic oneshot to date and 90 of it was caused by devora
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,"guys we have new lae'zel types we got mage'zel, flop'zel and shart'zel"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-06,wyll just going... guys... guys help me... i can see this in the game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,samantha's outfit eats so hard omg
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,props to samantha portraying the serious guy so the comedy can shine even brighter.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"i love how the bg crew truly own their characters, especially devora leaning more and more into lae'zel is becoming as unhinged as her rigid military life totally would make her"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,i'm glad to see so much positivity in the comments on this stream here cause anytime a clip from the bg3 cast playing dd is posted on twitter people are mad for some reason.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-04,"you know who is dnd experienced and who is not, by the virtue of them knowing or not knowing when things smell of danger '3 either way, it was as entertaining and fun as i hoped it would be and i'm so so happy to see them play again!! also tav's selfcare will end up not even lasting a day, huh? x'd"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,please keep doing these. they are so dang fun to watch! could we get like a full campaign?
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,"012334 theo solomon, i had to stand up out of my chair in this moment, much like neil lol"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-27,this was so much fun to watch live! i think i'm gonna make an animated short of lae'zel and astarion. i don't wanna spoil the scene for anyone but let's just say they get hands on in the mission
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,samantha's dress is absolutely gorgeous. 3
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-25,the stone of madness launches on 1282025! preorder today httpswehy.pey5toyhouze
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,the other hand of vecna is a joke since it is still attached to vecna. kas used his sword to cut off the main when when vecna was ascending to godhood which is why it was left behindand the sword can destroy it
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"you can play paragon and still get very high approval with astarion in act 1 through camp dialog choices, giving him the necromancy of thay, letting him feed on you, and agreeing to sleep with him. to avoid a lot of disapproval, leave him out of your party when doing stuff like rescuing arabella, rescuing councilor florrick, and rescuing the gnomes in grymforge"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,those gloves would sure be helpful if someone was wearing them when winged horrors gank them with paralysis claws...
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-27,i like that my reaction to the thumbnail was no way you can become a vampire only to watch that part of the video and remember that i literally did that on my 3rd playthrough. this game is fucking massive
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"vampire spawn, not a true vampire. you become the same, enslaved weakling that astarion was prior to his ascension. a true vampire has more fancy abilities than just biting people."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,astarions juice box was basically the theme of my first character
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-25,"pretty sure if you look in isobels room in the inn, you can get two sets of those robes. no need to attack her at all"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"the gloves that cast auto restoration requires you to have learned the spell , i guess they forgot to add it to the gloves"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"for those last two items, it could be that it needs to be an enemy causing the saving throw or status effect, not an ally. i mean, i'm not 100 sure if the game actually makes a distinction between the two, but it seems like a possibility"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-29,1042 omfg her expression is just pure gold
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"on my second playthrough i decided to wait and let the vampires kidnap astarion, because i was expecting something similar to rescuing the wardens from fort drakon in dragon age origins. and i was so disappointed when there was nothing. just some dialogue and some checks and than nothing when astarion escapes or reunites with the team. and the vampires are so easy to defeat, it actually takes some effort to let them kidnap him..."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-21,"053 well this explains something that i got extremely confused about when i got to this point in the game. i distinctly remember my character and astarion not receiving this curse, despite karlach and wyll both getting it, though i never thought to attribute it to their vampire status."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-03,"ive seen the crusder in one of my runs before, me and a friend would begin the fight then open the door so balthazar would join the fight, once he and flesh left we would arcane lock the door shut and hide, letting them fight and getting all the xp"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-25,1001 oh my fucking god thank you the faithleap trial is the worst part of this game
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-27,"remember all. the best necromancer is a lvl 6 druid of the spores and level 6 wizard necromancer. druid of the spores gets the fungus summons which are individual, and dont replace animate dead or another fungus summon. you get four if i remember right and they dont use spell slots. then with animate dead upcasted you can get three from battalion. 4 when you reach high enough in necromancer. a druid is tanky and has lots of cc spells. with symbiotic entity you get a healthy level of extra health. and it's a spellcaster class so when you multiclass into wizard you can still get into the good stuff and fill in gaps with learning from scrolls. dont forget dance of the macabre for the extra 4 summons! have shadowheart cast a high level aid and voila. tanky undead summons that propagate more with crawling gnaw, cc when enemies are forced to deal with them, and a tanky druid to cast spells."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-14,"this astarion scene is extremely interesting, never saw this one bcs always found the spawns before they found us"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,i always use the other moon lantern from moonrise as a light source for the faith leap trial
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-08,regarding to fate leap trial.... right in front of the altar there is literally painting on the floor revealing the right route.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,why you even bring vecna if you cant? this was a complete bait
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-16,"maybe for the janel's gloves, you need to have lesser restoration as a memorized spell.."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-27,"if you want a funny weird interaction, you can cast seeming on polymorphed and wildshaped people. you can also cast it on the emperor at the end of the game and he is naked, it's pretty funny."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-13,"for the robe each successful st causes the source of the st to take 14 radiant damage. meaning, shadowheart uses a spell and the enemy the source of the st passes the st, the enemy still gets 14 radiant damage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,"308 spoilers talking to the other spawn does not make astarion change his mind about ascending. in fact, hes the only origin character that cannot be influenced by past actions to not want to ascend. for example, depending on your actions, gale will choose to not become a god or shadowheart will choose to not kill dame aylin if you choose good options leading up to those moments. all origin characters, except astarion, will have an option for the playable character to say that its the origin characters decision to make, and whatever they choose is determined by the options the pc had chosen during the course of the journey. however, the pc does not have a dialogue choice where they can say its up to astarion to decide. instead, astarion will always want to ascend and you will be forced to pass a really high dc to persuade him not to. ive played and fully completed the game multiple times, always romanced astarion, and no matter what good options i chose, he was always firm about wanting to ascend. your only choices are to kill least 1 of the 6 siblings, have only astarion open cazadors coffin alone, or pass the 18 dc to convince him not to do it you can get a 15 dc instead in order to persuade him, but you have to first pass a 20 dc insight roll. he will remain in the party this way. however, if you simply say no to him, then he wont ascend, but will leave the party. if you have him open up the coffin without the pc but with any other good companion, then they will not help him see his scars minthara and dj shadowheart, on the other hand, will automatically help him, so he wont ascend, but will again leave the party."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-25,"number of pitfalls to avoid man, astarion is after my hog more than gale."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-18,faith leap trial was such a terrible design choice but i found in my recent play that if you do the line movement  so you press the button and the curser appears with the tether you can zoom in and see when it dips and goes low meaning drops sure you got the map by the altar but hate the trick but this helped me a lot seeing the dips in the line to see where to avoid
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-28,"1115 you know crit fails sometimes has unique scenes, right?"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-26,"dude you dknt need to decline to help people what matters more isvhow you treat astarion,be patient and undsratanding with him show you respect his autonomy"
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-02,astarions little juice box
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-04,i actually managed to get two of the circus ones on my first playthrough. i didn't realize they were that rare.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-08,faith leap trial. just increase game brightness to the max.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-12,"since most players probably don't slay isobel... not at last light, no, but i think i've had her survive the ketheric fight like once, ever."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-27,"i would have interpreted selune's protection to mean that when the wearer succeeds on a saving throw, the source that caused them to make a saving throw takes 1d4 radiant damage."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,i think larian forget to add the spell to the gloves
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-18,"isobel's gloves are on the fixeslist for patch 8. not sure why they would fix these when other, more easily accessible gear are still nonfunctional or only partially functional. the facepaint from the mummyvendor isn't just a nice little visual gag, it also seems to serve a greater purpose. it'll protect the party from that dribblesimpersonator's hammer which can apply tasha's hideous laughter upon a hit. funny how this stuff is on sale like 20 meters from where the dribbles fight will take place. plus if you want to use the clownhammer yourself once you looted it, the facepaint is pretty much mandatory. the hammer will apply its onhiteffect to both its target and wielder, so if you want to use that thing effectively, you really need that facepaint."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-02-15,"shouldnt astarion become a full vampire if you use his vampiric bite ability on cazador during the fight with him?  not a vampire ascendant, just a full true vampire. i guess the game wont let you do that, because vampiric bite cant be used against undead. but based on what astarion told you earlier, if he drank his masters blood, he should be free himself  doesnt mean his master has to consent to that."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,the vampire stuff is garbage in this game. they are incredibly nerfed and you can only get it by going fullevil and romancing astarion or playing as him.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-01-26,it sucks how the only way to become a vampire outside of mods is to do the worst possible thing for astarion and make him an ascended vampire
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-13,"ugh such a disappointing video. sure i learned 1 thing i didn't know which was the astarion torture cutscene, however since my first playthrough i've been trying to figure out if you can do anything with the hand of vecna. gg on giving me false hope by saying you did exactly what i tried and it does nothing."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2025-03-05,if u fail survival checks for buried chests you can still get them by going to your inventory and clicking on your shovel and using dig in the area around the chest
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-24,"one big tip i can give is to have at least one of your characters have a spell or item that alters the area in some way like grease or chromatic orb. they can combo very well with other actions, and deal with multiple enemies well when used right. they can also make doors and tight spaces dangerous for enemies to get through."
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-02-28,you can use the bard thing with non bards. just make sure they get a performer feat and background like i did and they can lure people while your rogue does something else. its also just fun to play while afak checking your phone or just wanting a little break from gameplay

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-07-04,"my wizard carries all the potions, spells, arrows, books and other useful items in different pouches, with a single item under each one to label them. my strongest character, usually lae'zel, carries a backpack with 10 or 20 backpacks, you take one out, you fill it with trash to be sold, you send it to camp, the next morning you can sell it easily. in the camp chest, place a bunch of chests or pouches or whatever and label them to store all the excess potions and food or equipment, it's much easier to play the game and make cool builds with an organized inventory"

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-11-20,i am testing a summary bot. i would greatly appreciate if any feedback on how well it works. here are the summaries for this video 1. use bar abilities in combination with npcs. 2. steal items by using npcs around you. 3. heal multiple allies with a potion by throwing it between them. 4. don't overlook animals as they can reveal secrets. 5. observe your surroundings before initiating a battle. 6. consider hiding before a fight for a significant advantage. 7. use quick saves to replay decisions. 8. pickpocketing npcs can unveil secrets and provide keys for locked doors. 9. inventory is shared between characters. 10. use scrolls or drag potions from companions during battles. utilize the camp option on items you don't currently need to save space. adjust game difficulty at any time.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-09-24,"even after you roll as long as you stay on dice roll screen you can quick save for a redo, it usually save scum but this has decreased the amount of forward thinking to save before you click for the die."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2024-01-11,"click an item, hold shift then click further down. it'll select all items in the range, you can send them all to the camp at once. much easier. invisibility is the best way to surprise enemies for certain, utilize it especially on difficult battles. if your on hardcore permadeath, leave one companion away from your party so if you die during a fight they can revive your team and you can finish them off on the second encounter. for some battles this may not work, such as fighting raphael. on permadeath, maybe don't fight him at all, bosses are significantly buffed on permadeath, and raphael is the hardest by far."

RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-08,i remember thinking i could use the throw trick with a potion of healing myself. but unfortunately i never thought of aiming at the ground as i thunder cunted a potion of healing into gales face.
RPG,Baldur's Gate 3,2023-10-28,if you want to multiclass but it's not available on your difficulty just up it. lvl up whatever you want to do etc. then change the difficulty back.
