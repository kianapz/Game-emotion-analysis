Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@brub1738,"Personally I’m really excited for the game and after playing the network test all of my (honestly pointless) worries went away, coming from someone who absolutely loves rougelites (hades, RoR2, Balatro, Skul the hero slayer, etc.) and souls games this was a match made in heaven. I genuinely can’t wait for the full release they are cooking.
Also I don’t get people who are complaining about the lack of content like it’s a network test the main goal is to test the game’s network not too mention this from what I understand is a 6 month old build of the game and the game seems to be on a fixed seed.
My biggest complaint is no crossplay, I hope it gets added in a future patch or maybe for release if enough talk about it, I just wanna be able to play with my pc and Xbox bros.",0

It took me a min to realize that beating him not only gave you an amazing perk but also pushed the night back and gave you some extra time to grind some levels.

in addition it crushed every 15-30 mins.. i never made it to an ""endboss"" or something like that.. 
what would be the motivation to play it? skins? boring.

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@eddiebernays514,the biggest issue with games in genres like this is keeping people coming back. this game will die really quick if theres not regular content updates. im not saying every week but maybe every 1-3 months.,0
Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@SkeleTonHammer,"I just don't understand. It's Elden Ring with MUCH less content where you repeat the same exact hour of gameplay over and over with slightly different stats?

I watched several people do several runs of this game and it's the same thing every time. You run around as the same 3 characters in some severely limited Limgrave-looking area and fight the same old enemies and bosses.

Why is this a $40 game and not a mod? I can play through an actual 100 hour experience with two other friends using Seamless Co-op for Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree. Would this concept even last 10 runs before I got bored? Not from what I've seen.",1

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@GeoCaesar,"Here’s my take, it’s making a few logical leaps but given that there’s eight characters and eight nightlords, and potentially eight different worlds, they may relate thematically to the characters, like, the wolf boss seems to be like wylder, with the chain and the explosions, and wylder feels like a limgrave style characters, so my guess is that we’ll get areas that relate thematically to each character, like the character with the sekiro parry might have a sekiro themed nightlord and world, that kind of thing, obviously this is a huge ask but they already have all of those assets, so I don’t see why it’s impossible",0

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@michaelbird,"Something needs to be done with the three-player mechanic. Whether it was people dropping out or network falloff, about half of my rounds that matched three only started with two. Also, when the team isn't working together, which you can really tell at the start of the game, leveling is much more difficult and it makes the rest of the session a slog. They have to do something about this in order to make it a more consistent experience since they're so fixed on balancing for three players. That was their vision for it so it's kind of on them to figure this issue out. I do think the in-game communication is something most players can adapt to, but it can be very difficult to know and coordinate what a player's intentions are. Balancing needs a lot of work, not least of all for Guardian who fails as a tank in almost every respect. Finally, I think they could do with a lot fewer discoverables. After a little while their presence was more of a distraction/annoyance than a help. Put good, high-quality weapons in a few very important places (like how they do with talismans). Make some consumables infinite when you find them. This CNT  had a lot of polish, but you can definitely tell it is a work in progress, and my fear is that it will continue to be for months after release, much like the vanilla game was. The question is how many players will stay with it through that growing process.",0

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@itsyaboiguzma,"My criticism/nitpicks for nightreign reside currently with 

the perk/boss loot system. They rarely provide any unique build defining buffs. For every on dodge cast lightning, every sprint cast ice storm, theres 10% max health, 10% extra runes, more stamina, 15% phys defense, etc. Id like to see more things that change the way I approach the game rather than find a good weapon and get secondary weapons that buff current stats.

Class selection I personally dont think you should be able to have duplicates or a full party of the same class. Kills variety for the game especially on duchess. 3 duchesses with communication is disgusting. I got lucky and found frost scaled raptor claws for bleed and frost procs, pair that with duchess illusion to double the damage and have 3 people use the ability and you melt literally everything within seconds. 

Relics by far have to most build importance as they have skills that are game changing like wylder has a flaming strike follow up on a grapple, duchess as a 10 second team wide invisibility period on riposte/backstab, recluse has cast terra magicka upon magic siphon, I didnt find any for guardian but relics like that will make or break the game. Since theyre going off seemingly the bloodborne blood gem system where characters have specific relic slots. I can see that being very annoying not getting skills you want for classes due to it being a different color. I got 3 yellow recluse gems that are completely unusable due recluse not having any yellow gem slots.

Map variants I have faith this will change because we we're only given 2 in the test but theres needs to be at least 10 because after 2-3 runs you already know the exact layout every time and general route to take. Especially when you get the exact same layout 13 times in a row before finally getting the other layout.

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@lorenzovanzolini8074,"yeah i'm not paying 40 dollars for a randomizer set in fortnite limgrave. 
i think nightreign is a very cool randomizer with survival elements, but it's definetly not a rogue like. 
you can have fun playing it like a ""use what you see"" and have very different equipments between runs, but the upgrades u get do not stack up vertically at all, making it impossible to create unique builds. u cannot have a build centered around bows, status ailments, consecutive attacks, miracles, fire damage, ecc; whatever build you have in mind (eccept guard counter builds, the only build i found that has a sufficient amount of upgrades that stack on top of each other to even be called a build). 
first of all you have no way to manipulate the rng so there's almost zero control on your build, and even if you had control, there's nothing that stacks up. 
you can have lightning roll, star shower walk, group healing, whatever you want all on the same character, but it's not a vertical build at all, just a bunch of abilities that do not synergies and don't give you, as a consequence, a unique playstyle for that run.

Being Brutally Honest About Elden Ring Nightreign...,axY8spXs5Cg,@rushsoccer1355,"I had an extremely great time in the game. This being a really early  build of the full game is really promising. Although there were only 2 world seeds with a set order for bosses and locations, it was still a great experience to essentially play Elden Ring with more freedom of build variety and randomized loot and buffs. In ER, your build kinda just centers on one weapon type despite the hundreds of weapons that are acquire. In this game, you aren’t punished too heavily on picking up a random weapon and just using it for a short time then replacing it. You are actually encouraged to just pick up every weapon for the passive bonuses and are free to try it out. I really hope they’ll continue to update the game post launch with custom expeditions like in Monster Hunter  with cosmetic rewards. I could see them doing like a DS1 themed run with Smough and Ornstein being one of the night bosses and basically every enemy being from DS1. Or just a straight up boss rush with like 30 evergaols placed around the map with increasing rewards based on the number of bosses killed before the night is up. It was really fun using randomizers and mods in the original game and just seeing random enemies pop up in spots where they had no business being.

Speaking of the skins...a merchant that sells skins for in-game currency, the primary goal of the game is akin to a horde mode/boss rush with survival elements and uses a mission hub matchmaking system just like God Eater...and Bandai Namco were the ones that made GOD EATER. Nightreign is God Eater mixed with Elden Ring and if we push Bandai, maybe they'll get Fromsoft to throw Dyaus Pita, the Susano'o and maybe one or two other iconic GE bosses in as secret Night Lords as an Easter Egg lol.

""I feel like NightReign ICP isn't the ""OG"" soulslike player base. Don't make it Souls Fortnite, please

The game removes the possibility of a solo run, sometimes your friends can't play it with you, and it can be unenjoyable to play such games with people that you don't know.

The network connection is a little better when compared to the previous games, but it still lags a lot, rubberbanding, etc. For a multiplayer game, the server connection must be top-tier.

It would be nice to have a ""party"" system, in which you can easily invite your friends. It is awkward to set the password and start the queue not being sure if the rest of your party will be able to join.

The game felt silly and pointless :( Mainly the shrinking area. It would be way cooler if the game had waves of enemies, or dungeons, where you would be gaining access to new areas after defeating all the enemies or bosses.

It would give the player to, at least, explore the areas properly. With the shrinking zone and massive map, I felt overwhelmed multiple times. I wanted to explore everything, but I couldn't, because I needed to run to the safe zone.""",2
