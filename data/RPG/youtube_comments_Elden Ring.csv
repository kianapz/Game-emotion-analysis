pZTrEetKagE,@tribeval,"it's 100% a BR style game, this is literally designed for that genre of player base to purchase and there's just no argument around that. They just remade it into something more like COD:Ghosts extinction mode, while using the name and image of Elden Ring. 

 either way, it's a squad based drop in world. That needs to be ""escaped"" after X amount of time from an encroaching instakill.  While traversing the open terrain and collecting loot from various points along the way to strengthen and defend yourself, along with upgrade stations.  These days that's called a Battle Royal, even if it's team based.  Thank Fortnite and Warzone for that.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

pZTrEetKagE,@fire_dragonhd9105,"1 of the BIGGEST reasons and MISTAKES why ppl dislike it, is because ppl are/were expecting another SOULSLIKE game. Ppl were expecting a grand journey exploration game with tough combat, challenging bosses, amazing areas and scenery, with crazy deep lore, etc, however this is NOT the case and thats everyones BIGGEST MISTAKE going into this game. You shouldnt be going into this game thinking that because THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF GAME THIS IS, and if you do go into thinking/expecting another soulslike you WILL be disappointed, because this is NOT that type of game. If you want to enjoy this game, you have to alter your mind into expecting a ROGUELIKE, once you start plaything the game like a roguelike and thinking of how roguelikes play and how they function, youll start to realize that this game does a pretty good job of being a roguelike, NOT a soulslike. If youre making these complaints that nightreign is not a soulslike, stop it!

Yet it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. theyre clearly working towards a new game and just utilizing the leftover mechanics of their old games to try and create a new experience. i probably will give in, because it does feel like a best of souls games, but from what theyve given us... a fornite-esqe map shrinking soulsborne roguelike where you just run around collecting loot and then meet up to fight bosses? idk doesnt seem to enticing to me.",2025-02-14T00:55:32Z,0

This allows you to break the enemy stance when you block their attack. From here you can go right into a guard counter and deal good damage.

NLdZ8Zex1cw,@peaceofmind5819,"I have been obsessed with the starting class. I'm only 120h into the game and this is my conclusions, but I'm looking for either affirmation or corrections on these if you wouldn't mind stopping to read.

Warrior: Main melee DPS and Keen Ash of war mastery. Does well to punish large enemies with big recovery times. Best used as a Cooperative Finger if the host is a Confessor or Vagabond. 

Samurai: Attacks at every single opening possible making it the most consistent dps of all classes, never needing to pause for a break due to its high stamina. Sacrifices versatility of the Vagabond class in exchange for higher DPS and an immediate ranged option.  Struggles against heavy armored opponents due to the lack of staggering power and enemies immune to bleed. A contender arcane for amplifying it's bleed katana and dragon spells, but not much use for its discovery since it's starting armery is all you need.

Vagabond: Highest HP of all classes. Widest range arsenal. Best suited against human and middle sized bosses. This class is most likely to do the most exploring as they can equip armaments to deal with anything.

Bandit: easily amasses resources from dispatching lackies and has dragon sorceries for bosses. He can opt to go into the caves anyway to quickly max out multiple weapons for the highest early game power spike.

Hero: Highest stance damage of all classes. Not quite as tanky as the Vagabond. Deals with above human sized bosses. Can make space for other cooperative fingers to recover through repeated stance breaking and parrying. Excellent at absorbing sorceries and incantation damage. A surprising arcane stat that hints, like the bandit, may be possible to use dragon spells together with their brute force.

Confessor: The ultimate all around class; the widest arsenal and adaptability. Bloody Finger specialist after the holy immunity cut off in the mid game. 

Prophet: Ultimate support Cooperative Finger. High burst damage and heals. Can choose incantations that bosses are weak to. No incantations are above their reach.

Prisoner: superior combat advantage in a 1v1, high colosseum ranking. Has trouble dealing with multiple targets and opponents with high poise. One man damage machine.

Astrologer: Backline caster. Highest sustainable ranged DPS of all classes. Will not survive the lands between without the use of spirits, summons, and Cooperative Fingers.",2024-08-29T15:14:12Z,0

You will meet your first Black Knight and you will die. Then you will meet the Taurus Demon and you will die. You might reach the first bell but you‚Äôll die some more. Hell, you might even make it to Blight Town where you‚Äôll probably just uninstall the game.

Yeah. Fortnite is a good fucking game.* There are reasons for its popularity. It's a good idea to steal the good mechanics from it.

*conceptually, at least. I'm not a huge fan of shooters, so I'm kinda lukewarm on fortnite as a whole. However, I think it's undeniable the general speed, the airdropping, the storm, and the loop of ""find good stuff to get stronger to fight better to find better stuff"" are compelling.",2025-02-18T14:02:30Z,0

I hope they improve Nightreign more than this, like adding more events, and possibly re-hashing the terrain, but besides that, kinda hope this is good. (But as it is currently, I‚Äôm kinda concerned you will get tired of it fast :/ )",2025-02-18T13:59:47Z,0

0gPFoIUA1s4,@robertlivezey7891,"I participated in the network test. Calling the game weird is pretty accurate.  My worry is that it replay ability will get old quick. Some of the bosses, were not entertaining imo.  The Draconic Tree Sentinel with two horseback knights was actually the harder of the boss fights even compared to Tricephalos (Cerberus), and personally felt like the fight was disjointed and not enjoyable. IDK, to me it didn't capture what I love about FromSoftware games.  It was challenging but it didn't feel very rewarding.  I do agree that playing with friends will make it better.  My concern however is that if a game requires friends to be present to be enjoyable... then how good is the game in general?  I have done some pretty dumb stuff with friends that would not be entertaining normally, however my friends make it fun. Just an honest question/concern.  I love FromSoftware and played most of their games. I just think this one misses the mark.  

Just my opinion.",2025-02-18T13:23:57Z,0

You spend it running away, going into dungeons only to make it to the boss and lose everything because you‚Äôre not ready. Then you try to get better but you don‚Äôt know where to begin: weapon, armor, affinity, talisman, level ups etc. everything is tied to ruins(exp. And currency).

Despite much of the game being spent on your mount, the chosen mount is not customisable and its graphics are abysmal.  It's like riding a children's pony. The double jump feature is also childish for this type of dark and gory setting. They could learn a thing or two from RDR2 and the way horses felt real and you could develop a bond with them/improve them/customise them/care for them. Otherwise , the levelling and ashes of war systems are unnecessarily complicated. Replacing these with simple Exp level up and ability points with a skill tree  would make more sense. Not to mention zero storyline. Positives: really liked the combat which was entertaining.",2023-09-29T12:31:31Z,3

E3Huy2cdih0,@Abnormal_dromen,"Let‚Äôs start with Dark Souls‚Äîeveryone hypes it up for its brutal difficulty, intricate world-building, and methodical combat. But here‚Äôs the thing: Dark Souls didn‚Äôt create the formula, it just perfected it. And if we‚Äôre talking about the real pioneers of tough, skill-based action games, Zone of the Enders (2001) was already on that path, setting the stage for what Souls would later refine.

What ZOE did differently was combine precision-based combat with multidimensional movement. You weren‚Äôt just locked into one plane like in Souls. In ZOE, you could fight on the ground and in the air, constantly shifting between 2D and 3D space. The fast, fluid combat system wasn‚Äôt just about timing‚Äîit was about adapting to your environment, something that would later influence other franchises.

Speaking of which, let‚Äôs not forget Ninja Gaiden (2004), which came before Dark Souls and is often regarded as one of the toughest action games of its era. Ninja Gaiden was all about high-speed, precision combat‚Äîcombos, dodges, and counters. It was unforgiving, yet the gameplay was intense and required mastery of fluid movement and timing. What‚Äôs interesting is how Ninja Gaiden and ZOE shared that focus on adaptability in combat, although Ninja Gaiden was more grounded in a traditional 2D plane, whereas ZOE pushed the boundaries with 3D movement.

The thing is, while Souls brought a more methodical, slower pace to this style of combat, ZOE and Ninja Gaiden were all about fluidity, requiring players to think on their feet and execute under pressure. Both ZOE and Ninja Gaiden had systems that rewarded precision, but the way they approached combat was a lot faster and more dynamic than the Souls formula we know today.

So yeah, Dark Souls made the formula famous, but let‚Äôs not forget the games that laid the foundation. Zone of the Enders introduced multidimensional combat, and Ninja Gaiden refined the idea of fast, unforgiving action. If anything, Souls just slowed things down and focused on methodical combat, but it‚Äôs clear that the roots of all these systems were planted years before.

Margit is your professor: ""Foul Tarnished,  in search of the Elden Ring. Emboldened by the flame of AMBITION..."" He teaches you that Elden Ring is not a game to kill the boss and change the area. You are ready for the rest of the game once you defeat him with not too much complications. The immersion and the feeling of actually exploring to improve are unique and magnificent. Elden Ring is the actual GOAT of the video games, and I bet it will not be surpassed for a long time.",2024-08-15T04:04:42Z,7

For me this game's combat is very basic and story isn't very involving. I don't know if I am feeling this about the combat is because I played this one after finishing GoT. Personally in my opinion the only perk this game has is it's bosses, that's the only engaging thing about it, but currently in a RPG game, I expect a proper interesting storyline and a decent combat system which I find missing. Again, this is all my personal opinion, no offense to anyone.",2024-07-22T07:11:29Z,0

I play Apex with my friend sometimes (I do not care for Apex much) and we always seem drop in the same spots because they have the best loot. All the other teams know this too, and its always a fight for survival. When Im Jumpmaster, I often hear ""Why are you dropping us there? Theres nothing. Go to [the same places as always] so we can get good guns!"" Like... theres an entire map to play in, and explore. I want to go other places, take in the secenery, but theres never anyone, or anything worth while to do/find in those places, and I either become a pinata of mid-low tier loot, or I die immediately trying to get anything worth while in the hot spots. I dont competitive game anymore. I like to explore, and really appreciate what these game developers work so hard on. imho, for games like this I want random, but sensible loot, and enemy spawns. I want ""We have to find some strong enemies to hopefully get good loot! If we cant find them, well need to play more strategically in the next day."" instead of ""Okay we need to go here, here, then here, so we get the best loot, so we can fight the boss easily."" Maybe I dont know what Im talking about though.",2025-02-17T13:16:19Z,0

7xjW5oGlcUM,@Perjoss,I think it might be good if they have more than 1 method of matchmaking. I would like to see a regular queue mostly for people that know what they are doing and are playing to win. and a casual queue for people that might not be as good at these types of games and will be taking their first 10 or 20 runs (or more if needed) to learn and test things out. Or lets say someone plays the magic caster role for 50 or so matches but then wants to try out a totally different role and knows they wont be playing as well as they did previously. The last thing I'd want is to frustrate good players with my learning sessions,2025-02-17T11:29:43Z,0

PN7YFKHOR9Y,@FightinCowboy,"Welcome to the walkthrough. This series will cover everything needed to obtain all trophies in the game, in addition to making an effort to acquire every weapon, spell, armor, etc. that you can in a single playthrough. The first few episodes are going to be a bit fast in our pacing as I'd like to cover a lot of various starting items for a variety of playstyles. 

Also, if it's your first playthrough I highly recommend you play blind. If you want to follow this guide from the start that's your choice, but you'll never get back the discovery of things that comes along with your first blind experience.",2022-03-03T02:28:30Z,2406
PN7YFKHOR9Y,@blackwolf4735,"Stone sword keys over everything else is an interesting choice in my opinion, because albeit without knowing 100% I'm willing to bet that there's enough stone sword keys in the game to unlock everything that requires them and still have a good deal more because stone sword keys can be acquired and used in second new games and when compared to Golden seeds there are more then enough to get Max upgraded flask in just one new game and that wouldn't make sense that there not only wouldn't be enough of another similar item when there's more than enough golden seeds despite the fact you'll never need to use them again once you get max upgraded, I personally think that pretty much all of the options don't really matter too much if at all in the grand scheme of things once you've done everything, except for technically one which does hinge on your feelings toward and regarding it but the lands between Rune can only be ever acquired once and only at the start of the game, it is a completely technically unique item so unless you want to be technically 99.99% complete on having every item then I'd just choose it to know that I'll get it and will always have it",2025-02-15T15:23:57Z,0

FEOxXsGZsMs,@Icetubexd,"WOW, what a run. The dedication and focus required is very impressive. 

Having just played through the entire game and DLC after a year long break, it was very interesting to hear your thoughts on the balancing and game design. I fully sympathise with your gripes and boss design, it goes entirely against your play style, and to some degree, against the design of previous Fromsoft bosses.

That being said, I personally love the way they approached balancing. I''ve played all Souls titles and enjoyed them immensly, but Eldenring especially reminded me that I'm first and foremost an RPG player through and through. I've always approached challanges in these games by using EVERYTHING in my tool kit, half the fun for me is in trying out different spells, items and summons. Probably cause I suck and learning patters and staying focused for long periods of time.

However, using all your tools well completely trivializes entire sections of the game. And holding myself back to make it more balanced is not very fun for me. This is why I rejoiced when the Dlc basically expected me to summon, when it made me gather fragments and resistance items before facing the new bosses. THAT is what I'm good at, that is what i love about this game. Figuring out the right spirit ash, damage type and resistance/utility items is BY far the most satisfying thing in the entire game for me and the DLC being balanced around doing just that is PERFECT in that case.

3 months late, most likely no one will read this comment, but I REALLY wanted to share my perspective on Eldenrings game design haha.",2025-01-29T11:51:53Z,3

QsC7hWgCjHM,@codfin846,I agree with most of what was said but i do disagree with some. First the maps are going to be randomized on release but they were set in network test. That said i prefer the upgrades being scattered and having to find them i think it feels awesome to have to decide to go get to this or that and not having time for all things everytime. The poise damage could go up a tiny bit for larger weapons but i feel if they do too much in a game like this it will take away some challenge and make lighter weapons useless.  I think if you upgrade a weapon with Smithing stones it should separate that from the ones you found and let you use the ones that you upgraded at any level but if you found one you will still have to meet the level requirements. But thats just my thoughts I thought it was fun overall and cant wait for the full release.,2025-02-18T09:37:25Z,0

QsC7hWgCjHM,@someguythatdoesstuff7658,"- I hope they bring demanding enemies like Bellbearing Hunters, Divine Beast/Horned Warriors, etc. that are difficult and not just straight up lifts. The mini bosses and the Night bosses could use some work and better selection. I was also expecting more from the Centipede Demon (like a combination of Demon of Hatred's long-range melee attacks, and The One Reborn having a lot of attached yet independent parts that target different players).
- Just like how each avatar affects different appropriate weapon class movesets, the Recluse should have a spellcasting overhaul, like being able to jump attack, roll attack, run attack, and backstep attack for some spells (or even attack while normal walking).
Dragon Age: The Veilgard did this and I thought it was cool.

- Also, they should make it so that you can sell stuff to merchants. Idk, they are MERCHANTS, traders. Kinda weird you can't sell.
- Like you said, there should be a ping system. Not only would it be great for communication, but it would add a lot character to the avatars.
- I personally wish there was at least one or two more avatar skills, but that's just me. I like me my skill expression, but I just know that something like this will rock the balance.
- Make weapon looting more appropriate to each avatar. If it's a Wylder, they should be getting greatswords. If it's a Th3BirdMan, they should be getting halberds and greatspears and so on. This is to make finding weapons less tedious and the classes more distinct.
- Apart from just the gem system, I hope they incorporate something like Hades' Mirror of Night which is it's own leveling system that affects the beginning of each run.",2025-02-17T23:47:54Z,0

I‚Äôd also love to see better-mixed maps from all across Elden Ring, not just Limgrave, as well as classic FromSoftware bosses reimagined in this new style‚Äîimagine fighting Artorias, Lady Maria, or Orphan of Kos with Nightreign‚Äôs mechanics.

I really like the ultimate skill being on a cooldown, but it would be great if they added a buff that could shorten it, similar to how Diablo games handle cooldown reduction.

I also hope the other classes will be diverse and well-balanced, and that the full release will include weapons and talismans from Shadow of the Erdtree.

I genuinely want this game to succeed, and if it does, FromSoftware could use it as a foundation for future projects. Anyone who dislikes the changes still has all the classic titles to go back to‚ÄîI‚Äôll definitely be playing this.",2025-02-17T19:43:51Z,1
QsC7hWgCjHM,@RandomChannelTMBE,"As someone who played the Network Test i disagree with a lot of these complaints, they seem a bit far fetched. 

The pinging system works just fine, the relics are like blood gems but that isn‚Äôt an issue; Hell you even say that the game is meant to be fun so they shouldn‚Äôt play it safe, but also say characters should unlock movesets for certain weapons types that would lock them into a certain play style for that character, or that multiple of the same character shouldn‚Äôt be allowed?

It‚Äôs not PvP, it‚Äôs meant to be fun. Let people have fun with it man",2025-02-17T19:21:10Z,0
QsC7hWgCjHM,@ShuckleII,"-No crossplay because consoles have always been segregationist agents, ignorance.
-No text chat because soulsborne fans are extremely toxic and ableist. Same with voice chat. They don't want to moderate the community because almost all of it is garbage and everyone would be banned.
-No leaderboard because cheaters would ruin it.
-No competitive because Fromsoftware already knows it's community is full of social cannibals and invasions have always been systems to make it's playerbase team up against social cannibalism, ignorance.
-No social media LFG system because ideally everyone should be okay with playing with everyone and if they're not okay with it they should be forced to learn to be okay with it. I'm not even describing a utopia, it's merely basic coexistence, something very lacking in this mentally ill species.


-Pinging and voice lines would be good.
-There should be no problem with solo play, every single Fromsoft game until now has been solo-focused, they have the formulas, they know how to balance it (for the most part, and I'm really worried about whoever balanced and designed Shadow of the Erdtree combat because they're the problem).
-You can make everyone on the team be the same class, you just have to balance it well. If they notice a problem in same-class teams, I think they can fix it. If they don't notice it... That would be bad. Fromsoftware seems to have a problem with synergy. They don't know how to handle synergy. They always add multipliers on top of multipliers on top of multipliers for exponential damage increase and then wonder ""oh, why does this one-shot bosses level 1?"". They should make sure there are no unbalanced synergies between different and same class teams, because otherwise half (or more) of the playerbase will play only the meta. There's a lot of players obsessed with speedrunning and who disintegrate from anxiety if they have to wait one second (ADHD probably).",2025-02-17T19:15:16Z,1

QsC7hWgCjHM,@benevolentduck9598,"Most of the raplayability hinges on loot tables, itemisation and enemy variety. What we got to play was just a network test beta with an old build so it‚Äôs still too early to tell how good it will be on release. The same applies to the balance issues. The playable characters felt polished as far as abilities go and the Night Lord is awesome so if they can keep up that level of quality for the rest of the game with continued updates then I think it could go far. The core combat of Elden Ring is really good after all, but I do hope that runs will have more variety in terms of length and difficulty, not just random field bosses.

Some ideas if I was a dev I would try to put on this game to make it better:
Polishing and QOL changes, example :
fix bosses constantly relocating to spawn point, near enemies will die instead of keep trying to attack after a mini boss is killed, more easily recognizable items on the ground, availability of upgrading the initial weapon more easily, remove head-scratching animation and pivoting from the dash. 
Show visibly on the bar how much FP is spent on each spell. 
Bestiary with weaknesses and resistances of each mob and Boss, perhaps even select the smaller enemies as training dummy. This way you have knowledge to get equipment that is strong against specific bosses. Character with more customizable equipment, up to three unique weapons. 
Who knows, maybe rare drops from bosses? 
Coins buy new weapons and can add active and passive effects by changing ash of war and elemental damage. 
More customizable relic system and with different sprites, not just plain recolored stones. 
Customization of the round table. Different skins that don't just change the color. 
Voice communication and crossplay.
Improved ping system.",2025-02-17T16:18:21Z,3

Character classes make a bit of sense, as does taking away any of the weapon scaling stuff and leveling, but ultimately this game just feels like it could've done a bit more with progression beyond being a lootfinding roguelike.

The fact that Miquella abandoned the one thing that caused him to feel for this world in the first place,  and he discarded it. All while building up to the fact that Miquella is an absolute monster at this point.

Plus, the personal 'how can you save everyone if you cannot even save yourself' second half had me staring blankly for a bit.

E2ViP3nO8pc,@redbone9553,"Can't believe we'll have a Mohg Prepare to Cry. (Though it's kind of Ansbach, but Mohg is also a real victim here).  

And he really does have some argument being a tragic character. Like Morgott, he was abandoned in the sewers. But unlike Morgott, who wishes to defend those that spurn him, even if it means believing himself to be a monster, Mohg chooses to believe in his omen nature. That being birthed an omen is not wrong, and that it is something to be honored by. We can see this with how he'd grow his horn to the point that it even gouged his eyes out, never considering cutting it. And from the Land of Shadow, we learn that Mohg was right. Being born an omen is not wrong, it is simply something Marika enforced from her own prejudice and spite. 

And so, unlike his brother, who remained in the capital, Mohg fled the sewers to create his own dynasty. Only, it wasn't only the surface. Perhaps it's from living in the sewers for too long, or perhaps he knew that as an Omen, he wouldn't have a place to belong up on the surface, he created his dynasty deep below the ground, where none could disturb him. He found a god who would love him and found people that would follow him and from it, he began to build his own dynasty. And this dynasty he wished to create must have been something glorious for Ansbach, the most inquisitive and wise character we know, to have pledged himself wholeheartedly to Mohg. 

Alas, despite his demigod status, he could not contend with Miquella's power. Charmed, Mohg was used from life to death, nothing of Mohg's honor was spared. In life, Mohg became a vehicle for Miquella to use to enter the Land of Shadow, and in death, his body became the tool for Miquella to bring back Radahn. Even Mohg's dynasty has likely become a tool for Miquella's purpose. After all, the Bloody Finger exists for the express purpose of hunting and killing Tarnished who are a threat to Miquella's coming age, given that they follow the guidance of grace. And by having the Bloody Finger, a faction that exists solely to hunt and harm, continuously hunt down Tarnished, it would no doubt bring people to hunt down and end Mohg, something that once again, Miquella would want. 

Ansbach wears the Pureblood Knights set, and its description says how the ""embroidered crest of the Pureblood Knights has now all but faded away"". Obviously, this is a sign of the time that passed since Ansbach's pledge to Mohg's fealty. Yet when we received a Pureblood Knight's Medal from completing Varre's quest its item description states ""Proof that one is a glorious knight of the new Dynasty of Mohgwyn that the Lord of Blood will inaugurate."" A clear contradiction is there. How can Ansbach wear a crest of the Pureblood Knights for so long that it has all but faded, while the Pureblood Knight's Medal we received states that the medal is for a dynasty that is to come? There are two ways the interpret this, one, is that Mohg is still trying to inaugurate his dynasty after so long. Another way, to interpret this is that Mohg had once established his dynasty, with his Pureblood Knights. But after Miquella's charm, Mohg's own vision was corrupted and replaced by his blind affection for Miquella, and his once-established dynasty crumbled as Mohg began to rebuild a new dynasty for his new vision. His former Pureblood Knights either abandoned their post from their Lord's lost vision or like Ansbach tried to restore Mohg's sanity but ultimately failed. It is likely from there, that the Pureblood Knight, something that represents Mohg's pure vision, was then replaced by the Bloody Fingers, who represented Mohg's corruption. 

The true tragedy is that in all of this, Mohg never lived for himself, despite his aspirations In childhood, he had never known the love of a parent while living in the dredges of the sewers. And when he was finally allowed to carve out his own future, his own destiny, he was robbed of it again by Miquella. We ultimately never know who Mohg was, as the Mohg we knew was merely a puppet enchanted by Miquella. 

Ansbach's final word to us when he dies is ""Righteous Tarnished. Become our new lord. A lord not for gods, but for men."" And maybe that was what Mohg had promised Ansbach and earned his loyalty. After all, Mohg is someone who knows all too well the world's injustice and prejudice and has experienced firsthand the folly and failings of the gods. Despite being told that his existence was wrong and that he was a monster, he had learned to love and embrace himself. And it would not be hard to believe that someone like him would want to create a place where people are free of such prejudice and folly.",2025-02-01T06:18:27Z,0

Then I realized I had already watched the latest one and got sad, lol. But I just had to let you know that I really appreciate you, your crew, and all that goes into to making these. I love the way you tell the stories, and with the gameplay visuals, the moving images, and the character dialogues, I'm immersed into the story and the world of Elden Ring.

it's all cinematic and all, it looks cool, but for several reasons it doesn't feel as emotional and interesting as I know you'd like it to be.
I am not going to watch a longass video about a character I already know the story of, with game footage I already experienced, and extensive scenes that serve no purpose. so I still watch it while doing something else at the same time, but since I'm not that implicated, when it ends it feels quite empty.

I think that Marika was a great influence in the practice of the living jars, maybe even starting it, as a way to secretly pay homage to her kin that endured this hellish treatment and comparing them to the brave warriors that were buried in the jars of the lands between. 

Another thing I'd like to argue is about Marika's rise to godhood (which you did say is for a later video and I agree) I think that maybe instead of Godfrey being the lord that Marika partnered with during her ascent, it was Radagan who was her partner and that Marika HERSELF was the vessel. This might explain why they share a body, and it could explain why Marika is seen alone as during her rise to godhood. We already know from Mesimir that Radagan and Marika had a relationship before the Lands Between, before the ErdTree.

It simply is. It creates life, encourages evolution, and does so with no regard to anything. And that is blissful in its own way. The beauty and majesty of nature is a powerful sight to experience, no matter how little it cares for you personally.

LJP3V3PW-vQ,@blorbothefrog,"the whole highlander idea of finding companionship in beasts via subjugation honestly makes me think of Godwyn being the son of Godfrey (aka hoarah loux, post finding his beast companion). I mean godwyn very famously befriended and partnered with fortissax after defeating him in battle. perhaps the dragon cult of leyndell was only as intrinsic as it was because of how long standing the ties of beast companions were in culture anyway, not just because of the show of strength

and talking of Godwyn, is it possible that he inherited some shaman capabilities from marika? I feel like it may be entirely possible that it was this connection to the melding flesh of shamans combining with the recyclable idea of erdtree burial that godwyn most certainly would have received that may be responsible for death root. after all, it's the erdtree that absorbs and redistributed life energy. and if godwyn had taken in part of destined death and he also carried the capacity to meld with others like shamans, it's entirely possible that is what spawned deathroot and it's capacity to spread across the entirety of the lands between, even going so far as to infect both the living and dead (which we see both in skeletons but also for example in rogier who gets infected)

and just following the thought tracks here, but is it at all possible that miquella, who failed to deliver true death to those who live in death, and failed at Castle sol to restore godwyns soul when the eclipse never came (likely due to radahns meddling with the stars), is it possible that he went to the land of shadow in search of the rumours of shaman abilities to ascend? I feel like it's entirely possible that his intent may have been to revive godwyn instead of radahn, and mohg was only intended to be the access point past the veil instead of the ultimate vessel

 I may be just making things up based on limited recollection, but I honestly believe its possible that godwyn and miquella had a strong connection in youth (after all, the vow memory never refers to radahn specifically, just ""brother"". and miquella has referred to his lord brother in godwyn via that one sword he made to commemorate his death), and miquella may have found godwyns companionship with fortissax to be emblematic of the compassion he was striving for. it may have followed that miquellas plan after godwyns death was to access the shadows via mohgs curse, and to use radahns body as vessel for godwyns soul. it would make sense, especially if it was radahns meddling that caused Castle sol to fail, and it is godwyns soul that needed restoring, potentially to a new body. personally I'm a big fan of that theory",2025-02-07T18:21:19Z,0

LJP3V3PW-vQ,@kirangokin7444,"i like the idea that placidusax and the godskin queen were consorts and previous inheritors of the elden ring, reigning over a realm of death and subjugation of beings viewed as lesser for their ambitions. forcing beasts to accept sentience whether they liked it or not, hunting down the drakes still partaking in primordial savage combats, slaying gods to wear their skin as marks of pride.

Destined death belongs to an order that is not the gravebird's or any other outer god's and while multiple orders can simulteanously exist, over time one order always manage to prevail to reign supreme, if only for a temporary period of time. this is what makes me think that the stars and the natural forces are the same beings. outside lifeforces, guided here by the attraction of the moon, that influence the earth with whatever they're made of just as naturally and breathing for us, but viewed from two different perspective: the one of intelligence with the sorcerers and the one of faith with the different civilisations. they see the same magic at work, but interpret it differently from each other. this is very much why ymir's staff scales with intelligence and arcane and metyr's staff can bend both sorceries and incantations.

a god with such power over the dead and that capacity to slay gods were very surely huge threats to the hornsents of the tower and an act of blasphemy to their eyes obsessed with harvesting the divine. maybe this is why they were even more happy when marika took the source of this power for herself by having maliketh kill the queen in her name, and also genocided the fire bending giants on the way. If Marika was killing rivals that were using the divine ""wrongly"" and were a physical threat to their society even though no war was declared, no wonder the hornsent thought of her as an ally grateful for her godhood, proving that their methods and ways to view the world and the divine and moreso treat others were right.

maybe maliketh saw in marika how he and his kindred beasts were abused and enslaved, and maybe this is how he managed to separate the god and the lord and to ultimately kill the godslayer empyrean, as maliketh marika's shadow but still in disguise of gurranq the beast clergyman. whether it'd be hoarrah loux, placidusax, or maliketh, or even ourselves, following a god til the end maybe requires a lust for power, or perhaps having fallen deeply in love with the god in question. where miquella very ironically wields love like a weapon, this is very likely that it was also affection that moved ranni's allies, with us, maliketh, placidusax, and godfrey to such heights to help their chosen gods, and more importantly moved them to continue to trust in their god even after having been abandonned.",2025-02-07T14:51:40Z,0

You can leave and go and level up and come back later, Because the world is so big and there is so much to find. It wasn't a chore to go and Level up.

B8HvfirR4S4,@raidear_official,Okay well this is for Dex builds if you want to start as a strength build go vagabond if you want to go for an int build pick the astrologer or if you're just going for one of those Faith builds I would either recommend the prophet or the Confessor because both of those are actually pretty good for an early start for faith incantation builds. But don't be afraid to make your own bills and your own designs there are literally thousands of armor pieces in weapons in this game some are the best some are pretty s*** if you were mostly one trick ponies but they still work nonetheless overall find something that's easy for you to play or that you want to try an attempted but if you want to beat the game easily first to understand the full game before you make a build I would suggest going pure strength since now they are considered the best build with the biggest and strongest weapons in the game that will crush bosses trust me it will be easy.,2024-08-23T15:03:40Z,0

PWYsbnUexJI,@tarasouthwell6132,"random thought i had during the rellana fight: i wish that for her boss weapon that they had gone with an aow that was more like her 2nd phase combos than having what amounts to a 2nd sword of night and flame. it would've been nice if the aow self buffed the weapons, and if the aow utilitized both magic and fire at once. you could still make it a stance with 2 different combos, and i think it would've felt more seamless, going from the weapon's standard move set to the aow and back. and the standard move set lends itself well to multi-hit, but the aow really doesn't, so it feels clunky to optimize. i also feel like the aow is still underpowered compared to SoNaF: when i was playing around with it (i dropped it to myself using cheat engine) on a fresh character with just the stats required to wield both weapons, SoNaF just seems to hit harder.",2024-10-25T09:20:14Z,1

I'm honestly disappointed with the lack of ANYTHING in the world.
Basically, everyone hates you, you can't force positive relationships. You can't buy a home, you can't romance, you can't go shopping, you can't do anything except fight.
I understand it's a fighting game, but 99% of this is fighting.
It's supposed to be a role playing game. I find myself so bored of fighting and wanting to do something different, but there is NOTHING you can do.

If these honest reviews were honest they would say to stay away if you don't want a fighting game all the way through.
I really feel like the creators of elden ring have really lost out on a big audience. (Those who like skyrim) those who want the freedom to play at their own pace and do as they wish.

I will say, as a oure fighting game, it's amazing. I just think the creators were very misleading.",2025-01-03T11:19:07Z,1

Also, I really love BG3, but my biggest issue is there‚Äôs waaaayyyyy too much customization and variety, I have never gotten past the early stages of the underdark, and I‚Äôve probably played Act 1, 8 different times, yes I‚Äôm aware I likely would‚Äôve beat the game by now, but the variety in customization and story are immediately obvious and too damn intriguing at the start.

My wife absolutely hates video games and will make snide remarks just because I decided to chose my hobby as a way to unwind and relax, so I get roughly 2-3 hours of play time at night when everyone goes off to bed.

k2KYvx_LAos,@Silent_Ellipsis,"Thank you to everyone, even if you disagree with me. I encourage you to continue offering feedback and ideas in the comments, but there are some frequently repeating comments that I'll address quickly:

1. ""The scaling is wrong"" - Keep in mind that most of the overlays I show weren't made by me, but by people trying to prove the Central Sea Theory correct. They picked various principled bases for scaling and all got the same basic result that I show, that it's too big. My own version, a simple 1:1 scaling, isn't meant to be different and surprising, but show the same problems I already established with other maps. If you have a different scaling in mind, then make the map and I'll take a look at it, but before making this video I searched for other overlay attempts and what I'm presenting is what I found.

2. ""Shouldn't it be the size of Limgrave?"" - This is in reference to a Miyazaki interview that was talking about the size of the DLC in terms of gameplay content, not lore. Since a significant number of players only make it through Godrick, Limgrave is the most common reference point for players about gameplay experience. What's more, most people treat this quote as Miyazaki trolling, since he was obviously underselling the overall size of the DLC. But even if you did take this literally, it's not at all obvious how to scale the LoS to be the ""size of Limgrave."" By surface area? East-West extent? What we have is the size of the Realm of Shadow as it actually appears in the DLC, which is simply bigger than anyone expected.

3. ""Ok, so the maps don't line up, that doesn't prove anything."" - I don't need it to. The only reason I bring the maps up is that I have seen so many others, including established lore channels, hold these exact same maps up as proof that the Central Sea Theory is true, and my point is that they don't actually show that. Also, I personally think that everything else I say is more important than the maps, so if your response is to any one of the points I've raised, then there are a still a dozen others that conflict with the CST (as commonly presented anyway).

4. ""The land could shift over long periods of time."" - I agree. If we're considering geologic periods of time, then the lands could change a lot. However, the more we want to attribute to geologic shifts, the more time needs to have passed, so in general, this is a point that works in my favor. I know that the Golden Order itself is very old, but the deeper history of the LB goes back much, much further than that, and I'm trying to encourage us to think on grander scales here. If we're thinking in geologic time, we're thinking past the bounds of the current order.

5. ""Maybe it's both?"" - Sure! I think there are several ways to reconcile all of the facts, and one of them might even be correct, but in order to get there, we first need to understand what the problems are that any theory would need to address, and that's what this video is trying to do.

6. ""Your own theory is unsatisfying, though."" - I haven't actually presented a full theory yet. In fact, I do have a theory that reconciles everything, but it involves more speculation than I wanted to go into in this video, and as I said, first we all need to agree on what the problem is before addressing solutions.

7. ""Then the lore just doesn't make sense!"" - I understand this feeling, but I actually do think that the lore can be totally cohesive. Sure, there are compromises that had to be made for gameplay or development reasons, but that doesn't mean that we can't still connect the major lore threads. If you feel frustrated by all the contradictions I raised around the Central Sea Theory, then the easiest solution is to give up that one theory. This doesn't require us to give up all that much! The only things I think are clearly shown by my argument are (1) that separation of the Realm of Shadow is older than most think, and (2) that the Realm of Shadow has a special connection to death. Any theory that can embrace those points and avoid the pitfalls I brought up might be true.

8. ""Central Cee!"" - It didn't even occur to me that this would sound like the name of a British rapper, and I will remain agnostic as to whether you can find an appropriate map scaling that would allow the Realm of Shadow to fit inside him.

Hope this clears some things up, and again, than you for watching and engaging even if you still disagree with me.",2025-02-14T21:37:32Z,66
k2KYvx_LAos,@laserbeastman7447,"One of the things that always confused me about the ""Central Sea Theory"" was the placement of the Jagged Peak. Why would Bayle, who had just made himself the enemy of most, if not all, of the ancient dragons, flee to a mountain like... 10 feet from where it was implied Faram Azula was? Yes its defensible, but uh... mountain fortresses rely on the fact that your opposition aren't entirely a race of flying siege engines.",2025-02-18T16:02:40Z,0
k2KYvx_LAos,@DirtyMcMills,"There is evidence of the lands dramatically shifting. The item description for the map of Mt. Gelmir says the geography dramatically shifted and changed due to the Shattering. The influence of Rykard‚Äôs greed and gluttony drastically changed the terrain of the mountain. I believe Jagged Peak in the Realm of Shadow has an item description somewhere that says something similar. The landscape became more intense and jagged because of Bayle‚Äôs influence. There are countless other examples of this. The maps may have perfectly lined up  with the central sea at one point but the geography has long since changed due to natural and unnatural influences. I‚Äôm not sure exactly where I think they would have connected, but I do believe they were definitely connected at one point. It has just been an extremely long time and the geography has changed over time as well. Even our own Earth is constantly changing.",2025-02-18T15:42:34Z,0

Do I personally agree with it? I‚Äôm not so sure, I still pretty firmly believe the Realm of Shadow is veiled from existence as the key centerpiece of the Lands Between. But that‚Äôs my own perspective, and I also personally believe the map is rotated somewhat and various areas of the realm align more clearly with various regions of the base map areas, especially when accounting for things like significantly higher elevation and the passage of time being shifted.

But no matter what, this video and discussion has opened my eyes to  new possibilities and ideas, so now I have all the more renewed interest in diving back in and discovering more. What a beautiful thing that is. The Soulslore community is a gift. And as a fellow first-run purist, I gotta appreciate that you didn‚Äôt do any research or info diving until you had your own adventure.",2025-02-18T09:53:15Z,1

k2KYvx_LAos,@blockhead134-x9p,"I think a lot of people will miss the forest for the trees. Marika, and all the gods in Elden Ring, are not people. They are to be treated as more like historical or philosophical concepts. Marika came from The Shaman Village - and that Shaman Village likely predates the Eternal Cities. If not that, it existed at around the same time as they did, before they were sent into the annals of history (which is what the underground of Elden Ring is). The Shadowlands are therefore, the even older, even more forgotten history - the history that cannot be linked to our world. 

The moment Marika split the lands is the moment the Erdtree was created. The act of splitting its shadow from the tree‚Äôs light is the act of splitting the lands. You cannot have a world of radiant light, when the light‚Äôs shadow also exists. 

I think people trying to overlay the Shadowlands map is like trying to overlay the underground map over the overground map - the Underground is history. Undergrounds and valleys are often Lands of The Dead in mythology - so the analogy is that when an Empire dies, goes underground, it becomes history, becomes forgotten. Inversely, the Underground wasn‚Äôt always an underground. The Eternal Cities were above at some point. And before them, the Uhl civilization was also above. The Shadowlands is a different take on a similar concept.",2025-02-18T01:04:23Z,1
k2KYvx_LAos,@di11_9,"To be fair Marika didn't seal the fire on the mountain top for a good reason because she did eventually shatter the Elden ring and there was no way to burn the thorn's besides burning it so she must've been planning to betray the golden order eventually considering she must be thousands of years old doing practically nothing, also I do believe the realm of shadow was in the middle, from a creator point of view it's kind of hard and time consuming to shape the entire map around the center of the base game and still have a lot of creative ideas.

k2KYvx_LAos,@BBQRavenWings,"At 7:24, look at how the sky is red and reminiscing of Rot. If you do the rotation of the sadutree map, the scadutree would sit above raya lucaria and under it a lake of Rot from something great and dying, the fumes permeating the caverns below. I believe as my friend does when we went through map placement. Everything lines up and the talk of the Erdtree whom no one can recall in the Scadutree map, however they know of another, the Crucible Tree, which I believe to be deceased at the time of Elden Rings MC. Look at the map of the lake of Rot after putting the map into place with the Mushroom like growth stemming from what looks to be a massive tree husk underground beneath Raya Lucaria, given time would cause the ground above to shift and give, resulting in a massive sinkhole since the corrosive power of Rot is far greater than most. Also would make sense as to why Rot is so powerful, reminiscent of a great and dead tree trapped beneath the world as it is the ""Shadow"" of another tree, locked away in a time before it died. even looking differently than any depiction of the Erdtree has even given. Also it's Sap is leaking constantly, given credit to either it dying or someone splitting it open. The first is more realistic and more reasonable.

The Scadutree Map fits perfectly into the center of a rotated axis of left I believe. Even the placement of the tree gets put over a lake of Rot and Decay, mushrooms growing at the base.

k2KYvx_LAos,@HeevaEgo,"This is actually a really compelling argument for the Shadow Lands‚Äô separation timeline. I didn‚Äôt quite buy this theory until the very end portion, talking about the Two Trees.

It‚Äôs there when it hit me. George Martin was clearly inspired by Middle Earth (Miyazaki confirmed that the name ‚ÄòThe Lands Between‚Äô ‚Äî similar to ‚ÄòMiddle Earth‚Äô or ‚ÄòMidgard‚Äô‚Äî was created by Martin himself) from Lord of the Rings and Nordic mythology when creating the history, alongside many other things. Miyazaki himself stated specifically that Lord of the Rings was one of the major influences. One of the most obvious connections between the two stories are that their worlds are connected by Trees. 

In Middle-Earth, in times of history, there used to be the ‚ÄòTwo Trees of Valinor‚Äô, the Gold Tree and the Silver Tree brought Light to the Lands. Two separate trees, they were. In Elden Ring, there‚Äôre two different trees: the Gold(light)Tree and the Shadow(dark) Tree. Going by your theory that the Two Trees are actually different‚Äî and that the Scadutree itself used to hold significant importance in ancient past before the Erdtree ‚Äîactually reinforces the inspiration from Lord of the Rings even more.

Of course it‚Äôs going to be hard to get used to this theory, as it surrounds itself with shaking up the very foundations of the Lore to make it fit well. But the Two Trees theory really sold me on it. I‚Äôm going into my next playthrough with a little bit of a different perspective",2025-02-17T14:52:41Z,0
k2KYvx_LAos,@liammiller299,"I may not agree with the theory as a whole, but I do like a lot of the points presented and how they're presented.

1. I like that you don't outright say that because the maps don't fit together, it disproves the central sea theory. A lot of people want to use it to reinforce the idea that the Land of Shadow is the carved-out piece of the Lands Between, but the final map is very different from the concept art. While I think the intention was for the Land of Shadow to be a central piece to the Lands Between, I think it more likely that the Land of Shadow was sa large island in that center nook, not a homogenous landmass.

2. Everything involving the Scadutree. Standing completely independent from the rest of the video, I actually love this idea as a concept. I do think that Smoughtown is correct, given that the Scadutree Avatar remembrance says more or less verbatim what he does. That the Scadutree was ""Born of dark notions that bear no sense of Order."" Note that it specifically says born, not made, meaning that the Scadutree was like that from the very start, but it may not have exclusively embodied those concepts. The Scadutree's double meaning could be an allusion to it being a shadow of its former self, with the Erdtree stealing away all concepts related to Gold and Grace, and leaving the Scadutree with what Marika would consider the refuse, leaving it brittle and withering.

3. The Veiling. I like the idea that there was something special about the Land of Shadow that makes it uniquely suitable to veiling. I also like the idea that the Land of Shadow's unique relation to death stretches beyond the Golden Order. After all, lands that exist not under the Golden Order still have a concept of death, and things were dying long before Marika lived. However, I think this only more firmly cements Marika as the one who veiled the Land of Shadow, and gives it a definitive place in the timeline. I don't think it's a coincidence that the shadow sunflowers are ""covered in impenetrable thorns,"" using the same terminology as that which seals the Erdtree, nor that Enir-Ilim can only be accessed by using Messmer's Kindling to burn the sealing tree, in remarkably similar fashion to Melina burning the Erdtree, or that the shadow that obscures Enir-Ilim so obviously takes the form of thorns. These are deliberate choices that imply a singular, common source of sealing. 

So at the very least, Marika is the one that sealed away Enir-Ilim, but it's possible the Land of Shadow itself was veiled prior to that. However, thematically I believe it makes the most sense for the Land of Shadow to have been sundered at the same time as the Rune of Death. Marika's removal of death is the most prominent event, maybe short of Godwyn's death, and the fact that both the rune of death and land of death have been removed from the Lands Between seems like too similar a parallel to ignore. As for why the Rune of Death couldn't be sequestered away in the Land of Shadow, I'd argue that we just don't have enough information. Marika sealed Destined Death within Maliketh's blade immediately following his defeat of the Gloam-Eyed Queen. Marika, as far as we know, never dispatched Maliketh after that, instead relying on Radagon to lead her crusades. Sending Maliketh to the Land of Shadow with Messmer would have been a huge risk, as if the Hornsent got their hands on it, she would have put the only weapon she feared in the hands of her most hated enemies. We don't know how or when Maliketh ended up in Farum Azula, but it's almost certainly after the Night of Black Knives, and as a place populated by Ancient Dragons which now stand as tentative allies to the Golden Order, it would generally be a much safer place to house the Rune of Death.

4. Marika is said to be of the Numen, which come from ""another world."" However, importantly, the actual Japanese is ""Ikai,"" which can mean also allude to the afterlife or a spirit world. Of course, the Land of Shadow is ""that place outside the Lands Between,"" but I think it's also very explicit that the Land of Shadow is no longer considered ""part of the Lands Between"" by the world itself, let alone the ordinary people passing stories around about Queen Marika.

5. ""A wizard did it."" The only point of the video that I actively dislike. Yeah, that reasoning can be... really thematically underwhelming. I can understand the desire for there to be something more to the story, but I think there's three problems with the ideology of wanting there to be more to this. First, that it places immense value on the ""why"" of the Land of Shadow being hidden. So the Land of Shadow was hidden because Marika did it. It doesn't stop us from delving into what existed here that she wanted sequestered away, versus what was caught in the crossfire. It doesn't stop us from thinking about when it happened, or how she did it. It simply places a defined motivation for the person who executed it.

Second, the idea that we would stop delving into the Land of Shadow's history, just because ""Marika hid it away."" The entire point is that the Land of Shadow holds a rich history of civilizations that vastly predate the Golden Order. This gives us a window into a time before Marika decimated the cultures and civilizations of everyone that opposed her. Evidence of these cultures likely only exists in the Land of Shadow because she hid it in the way she did. Presuming that ""Marika hid it"" or ""a wizard did it"" would in any way dissuade people from looking into the lore is... rather shortsighted. If the Nox civilization existed underground because ""Marika buried it,"" it wouldn't stop us from delving into what their civilization was like, what they believed in and worshipped.

Third, the implication that we should choose an interpretation serves our purposes better. Although ""a wizard did it"" may be an unsatisfying narrative, if it is the one that was intended then that's that. Choosing an interpretation that creates more exciting and interesting possibilities or narrative payoffs is seeking satisfaction to the exclusion of the story's true intentions, which I find disingenuous at best. Much in the story is left open to interpretation, and it is these places of ambiguity which allow room from theories that interconnect webs of disparate stories and lore descriptions together. To speculate that the Land of Shadow may have been veiled before Marika is fine. To argue that it should be an accepted interpretation not on the merit of supporting evidence, but on its ability to produce more compelling narratives is getting dangerously close to a ""death of the author"" vibe that I find personally distasteful. I imagine that the wording of the video probably was intended to be more along the lines of ""we should keep this train of thought open, instead of settling on one specific interpretation,"" but it came across as ""we should run with this interpretation, because I think it opens the story up to more exploration."" That might sound good in theory, but we want to understand a story, not rewrite it. Sometimes a story is going to be underwhelming, sometimes a story really is as straightforward as it seems. At least in the case of the veil, I firmly believe that it is as straightforward as it seems, and that the veil does not need to be given value with ambiguity in order to reap the benefits of exploring the culture, history and beliefs of the land and its people. Rather, I think that trying to do so would harm our wider understanding of the story and tinge our views of other pieces of lore and skew us away from the intention of the authors.",2025-02-17T12:05:18Z,0
k2KYvx_LAos,@aidanfilby8824,"I like this but it feels slightly like this is trying to rigorously define a soft magic system as something more hard rather than just accepting it. 
A few points:
- I don't see Marika as deliberately creating the land of shadow as a realm of death, more so that it was an unforseen consequence of attempting to ""remove death"" from the landsbetween.
- Shrouding the land of shadow can be more than just physical. Perhaps the very idea of it was removed from the memory of many beyond it
- There's also something mystical about the landsbetween as a whole concept where distances and exact geography are not perfect in many places. Perhaps part of this is game design. But it feels like a similar idea to previous fromsoft titles where time and space are somewhat damaged by the state of the world and everything is brought into a kind of melting pot. 
- The central point of the landsbetween may not fit perfectly on a map but who's to say the central point is the central point of the ""map"" or even the towers. It's all about perspective I guess.",2025-02-17T11:04:24Z,0
k2KYvx_LAos,@TRIC4pitator,"22:25 ok , I have an actual observation:
Since the release of the dlc most of the community has looked at the scadutree as a dark tree coiling the straight Erdtree, but considering all the spiral iconografy, and the depiction of The Crucible, in Enir Elim, as a twinned tree, I believe that's how it originaly looked. Simmetrical.
The reason the tree looks crooked is because one half was straightnent, uncoiled, given priority.
Now the tree is unbalanced, all light stolen from the shadow realm, all of it sent to the lands between.
On top of that, going off of the description of the scaudutree fragments, this is entirely deliberate.
Marika clearly planned to FULLY sacrifice the Scadutree, since the fragments say: ""It is said that when the Scadutree crumbles from its core that it will scatter across the entire realm of shadow. The people of the Erdtree collect the splinters and use them in prayer.""",2025-02-17T10:44:43Z,1

-It is painfully clear that the center of the base game map was hit by a meteor. The concept art makes this more clear, it is an impact crater. Of course it is Farum Azula that was located in the center of the base game map; it was hit by a meteor and affected by the time/gravity magic inherent in meteors as seen throughout the game and most notably in post-Radahn Limgrave impact site.

-There are no Farum Azula ruins in the DLC despite the impact happening AFTER the war with the dragons, as evidenced by the Dragon Cult Prayerbook in FA (that ‚Äúnever reached the lands between‚Äù)

-No coffin boats in The Lands Between, only on the Cerulean Coast (which, as an aside, would not be a COAST if it was in the middle of a continent.)

-Smithing Stone 8 states that the Erdtree was born at the same time as the war with the Giants. VERY hard to reconcile this with the idea of the Erdtree being born in The Land of Shadow, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this but clearly has a place in this theory.

-The ‚Äúveiling‚Äù of the tower is not a pre-crusade event (Spiraltree Seal implies the tower was not yet sealed during the invasion) and it stands to reason that the ‚Äúveiling‚Äù of the entire realm is recent as well.

-the most common contention is a Miyazaki interview in which he states that the Land of Shadow ‚Äútechnically occupies the same space as The Lands Between, the same universe, but has become physically disconnected from it (..).‚Äù Most people ignore the ‚Äúsame universe‚Äù part of this statement, which simply states the obvious, the Shadow Realm was part of the Elden Ring universe but now is physically inaccessible. This interview is NOT saying what most people want it to: ‚Äúthe shadow realm must be part of the base game map‚Äù. 

‚ÄúThe Lands Between‚Äù could easily be a set of islands.

There is one more factor to consider: 
*Adoption is a prevalent theme throughout the game.*

And as Enia, the Finger Reader, states: 

*_""Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring._*
*_But remember one thing. The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.""_*

Ergo... No Great Rune = not direct offspring.

[20:10]
Áï∞Áïå„Äåikai„Äç""Spirit Realm""...""World after death""...(lit. ""strange...curious... world"").
This character combination is only one character off from the common fantasy theme of Isekai: Áï∞‰∏ñÁïå

From this base definition it would be sickeningly enticing to attribute the Land of the Tower, as the homeworld for the Numen. Or rather, Á®Ä‰∫∫„Äåmarebito„Äç""A rare person from afar.""
Yet, Marika, and the other Á®Ä‰∫∫ women, that instigated the Night of Black Knives, *_were descendants of the Nox._*
*Do we find Nox architecture, anywhere, within the Land of the Tower?*

Not even in those most ancient of ruins, that precede the Horn-folk, the ruins of Rauh, is the architecture of the Nox found.
But within Nokstella, and Nokron, the Ghostflame is ever present. 
The very same flame that is more ancient than the ruins of Rauh.
Found deep within the geologic strata... far below the ocean.
And was the marker used to identify the Nox, as it was the core of their burial practices:
[From the Ghostflame torch]

*_""When the band's last embers were used up in their long search,_*
*_they began to burn the bones of their fellows,_*
*_acquiring the cold ghostflame,_*
*_but sealing their fate as dwellers of the underground for all eternity.""_*

[20:40]
As King Vendrick, of Dark Souls II, states:
*_""The brighter the flame... the deeper the shadow.""_*

There is another bit of evidence to incorporate. When transcribing aerial photos to maps, or simply comparing maps, cartographers will seek for common features found in both geographic areas. The only feature common to both maps... is the Erdtree... listing.

Further still, there is already an example of a place connected to the Lands Between, but... cut off. 
Only accessible through a study hall... with a small, uniquely crafted, statuette.

k2KYvx_LAos,@MrStrangeUsername,"My interpretation was that the land of shadow used to be physically connected and in the central sea in the time of farum azula, but became separated afterwards around the time the erdtree began. I think it's now a functional place, a sort of filtration step. The Erdtree processes all kinds of death through its root network, and excretes what it cannot purify into the shadow lands. The reason the shadow lands are now crumbling is the same reason why Those Who Live In Death are now appearing everywhere in the lands between--the Erdtree is broken. Without a functional Elden Ring giving it instructions and its physical form burned down, it's got a very tenuous ability to dispense grace or process death, so a lot ends up not processed at all or malformed. This reconciles the states of things in both worlds, explains why Mohg was needed at all to break in, how Marika could have backdoored a way in via her control of the Erdtree, and even how the hell Deathblight got there (the system is broken but not entirely nonfunctional, a little leaked through). I think it also makes more sense than just saying the shadow lands were always a death land, for no particular reason, even though most other things in the setting behave in a specific way because a higher power made them that way.

As far as it not fitting in the gap, I just figured that was scaling not being literal. None of the game's politics make any sense if you assume the distances are literal, but even if they somehow could make the world to-scale, nobody wants to play Desert Bus on Torrent between every site of grace. The scaling factors probably just aren't literal or consistent.

Lastly, while I don't think that Marika has the capacity to section off a particular place into the shadow lands, I think that was probably an automatic process the Erdtree just did on its own during its setup phase, she could likely hide the truth the same way she hid the fact that she's Radagon in plain sight. It already doesn't make sense that the Carian royals forgot a sister, or that nobody remembers Messmer, or that Enir Elim has no extant depictions.

k2KYvx_LAos,@kallax7172,"You missed the main narrative of the DLC. The betrayal of Marika. Marikas kingdom was seperate territory from the hornsent kingdom. She was not their ruler they had an alliance. She betrayed them by sending Mesmer and his forces to attack and sealing the area off. That‚Äôs why there are no roads connecting the two areas, because they were separate territories and due to the blatant racism from both sides they didn‚Äôt get along. The reason it was sealed away differently than the fire giants is that it was a losing war. She couldnt cleanse all of the hornsent. So she sent them and their lands away from the lands between. 

You forget to mention some of the benefits of the central sea theory. Tons of secrets from the main game map rely on structures in the DLC. 

A major one being how did the divine towers get made. The towers are all in precarious places that it would be really hard for them to be built without land connecting to them. Look at Malanias tower sitting in the middle of the ocean. Who thought let‚Äôs create this massive structure and put it on an island we cannot get to without ships in a sea that‚Äôs so turbulent we can barely get the materials to it safely. 

The entire dragon cult worship and religion sprouts from the massive dragon communion in the DLC. The rot priests and their connections to the other outer gods. Ancsbach finds knowledge on the outer god of blood mohg was calling upon. The mother of the fingers lives in the shadow lands, and the finger imprints in the lands as conduits of power and song. That‚Äôs the origin for the finger creepers in the base game. The frenzied lord of the 3 fingers of chaos. The Golden order didn‚Äôt stop the worship of outer gods in this land. These are all things Marika would have wanted sealed and separate from her golden order. 

The churches of Marika are numbered in the order of Godfrey‚Äôs crusade. In order he conquered the mountain top of the giants then caled then limgrave. The DLC map would connect from mountain top to caled. Then at that time the shadow lands were not conquered due to the hornsent, and Liurnia was not conquered due to the carina mages and their academy. Radagon was sent to deal with Liurnia and Mesmur was sent to the shadow realm. Godfrey then set himself up in stormveil castle on the boarder of Liurnia. 

Mesmur utilizes the man made fire giants that were based on and made from the remnants of the Giants killed by Godfrey. 

Faram Azula is another land that was ripped and sundered from the lands between. You see that its geography is very different from what it used to look like within the tornado of time.
The lands between and the shadow lands were separated for longer than you‚Äôre making it out to be and would have also experienced similar erosion and changes over time. So the maps don‚Äôt have to litteraly match up and over lap. Every region in the base game has unique architecture and cultural differences about the people who live there. The geography and the people diverged and changed over time. 

To conclude on 1 final point. Your interpretation of the Suppressing Pillar. It does literally say the center of the lands between. Kind of damning evidence this is where the land is from. Secondly, the line where the dead wash up here. That can describe the entire lands between themselves. We are standing on a structure older than the distinction of Marikas Golden order and the hornsent. The first thing we do in the base game is wash up on the shores of limgrave after dying. This has always been the case in these lands. Extending beyond the shadow lands to the entire lands between. 

The central sea theory explains more about the structure of the base game than your theory. Your theory ignores important aspects about the shadow lands and the base game lore.",2025-02-16T17:40:53Z,0

I also wouldn't take the geological inconsistencies on the map at face value. In-universe these maps were likely hand-drawn by men - in an age of limited technology. They're supposed to give you a general, rough estimation of where you should be, but nothing more. I don't think it makes sense to take them literally 100% of the time. 

Lastly... I think Scadu Altus is a dead giveaway.

If the pre-Golden Order ""empire"" that built the roads spanned the entire Lands Between, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for them to just ignore the center. And honestly, the Scadutree theory fits the vibe of the game. Like, if Marika most likely *stole* godhood (I‚Äôm simplifying, but some lore theorists think she usurped it from Metyr or GEQ), then why *wouldn‚Äôt* she ""steal"" the gold for her Erdtree?

But for me, the timeline gets way too messy at this point.

k2KYvx_LAos,@Aiden-Ed,"Edit: Anyone who is not convinced of the Shadow Realm being the afterlife/ Helphen realm, please read this! 

I remember soon after this dlc released I actually had a similar theory. I‚Äôll copy paste it and I haven‚Äôt seen the whole video because I have to drive somewhere but there might be details here that strengthens your claim:

Claim: Land of Shadow is the spirit realm of Elden Ring (Lands Between).
We start with the Helphen‚Äôs Steeple item description; ‚ÄúGreatsword patterned after the black steeple of the Helphen, the lampwood which guides the dead of the spirit world.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe lamplight is similar to grace in appearance, only it is said that it can be seen by those who met their death in battle‚Äù
The greatsword in design matches the architecture of the cathedral in the Shadow Keep, a castle encompassing a giant dark tree with golden luminous sap / resin. The color of grace is a luminous gold. It is said that they can only see its luminosity from dying in battle, which may also mean genocide and war. This may be the reason not many of the dead actually wind up at the church (there is still many) though. But the problem here may be that we don‚Äôt have proof of the Land of Shadow actually being a realm that spirits are sent to, but this is where my next piece of evidence comes and it will loop back to more stuff found in the Church District.
Near the Dragons Pit, there is a place called the Suppressing Pillar. When you go to the top of the pillar you find a gravestone stating the following; 
‚ÄúThe very center of the Lands Between. All manners of Death wash up here, only to be suppressed.‚Äù
This proves that this is where the dead end up, here in the Lands of Shadow, the center of it all. But the extra interesting part here is that those that are dead are suppressed. As is obviously known, Messmer has his castle built around the Scadutree so the dead can‚Äôt reach it. And when we reach the church district we find the spell Mantle of Thorns which lends credibility to a twist coming up;
‚ÄúSorcery of those who abandoned the practice of incantations after devout faith rewarded them with only despair‚Äù
Why would faith lead them to despair for any reason other than I will infer? It lead them to despair because they died in battle and had faith in the Grace of a great tree, the Scadutree, because‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs what they did in the living world with the Erdtree. But the answer to those who have died in battle was one that they couldn‚Äôt accept in a world corrupted by Marika and one where they are suppressed by her child or children. It‚Äôs that they needed to become a god or a lord. And this is why we find Miquellas Great Rune after entering the church and finding the base of the Scadutree, cause after Miquella died, he actually took that next step. That or they simply needed to reach the Scadutree roots to get back to the Lands Between but at this point in the journey of an undead soul just trying to find peace, it may have been an extremely depressing thing to find out about your life cycle, which may be a second reason for people to find disparity in faith.

There‚Äôs also just extra details that aren‚Äôt super correlated to these things directly but may be important to discuss. First here is the fact that the Land of Shadow clearly has many many many forms of death appearing all over the place. Ghosts, revenants being summoned by a Tibia mariner, Gravebirds, a Death Rite Bird, and skeletons being extremely prominent enemies found. Like the amount of spirits in the Realm of Shadow is absolutely ridiculous and there is no way that the realm itself isn‚Äôt one that is primarily inhabited by spirits. But a question arises, why are they all hornsent? Well perhaps all spirits gain horns after going through the tree roots and how concepts relating to the Crucible may affect them, but more importantly is that those that are undead finding the church aren‚Äôt purely spectral and there‚Äôs spirits that seem to take shape of what they are seen as by others in fact. There‚Äôs spectral gravesites that may literally be a projection of someone‚Äôs soul from the Lands Between, and those from the Lands Between that can‚Äôt permanently die like an undead fleshy Tarnished (the exact kind we find at Shadow Keep) may end up at this spirit world seeking a conclusion to life of some sort. The second thing is just how the Shadow Keep actually has unused Tibia Mariner boats even though they‚Äôre something that would be found in a place that either is indeed the spirit world or a place that can have something from the spirit world physically in it.",2025-02-16T03:48:39Z,1

The bestiary sanctum, farum azula, the jagged peak the warrior tribe Godfrey hailed from of fighting bears. All these indicate they were physically connected when marika ruled. 

The mistake I think you are making is that the multitude of world shaping events happened close together.

Marika becoming a jar saint, Marika finding Godfrey, Marika usurping divine power, the birth of the primodial crucible, the creation of the erdtree, the creation of the golden order, becoming the vessel of the elden ring, fight between Bayley and plasidusax, war against carians and liurnia, the war against the giants, long march of the tarnished, veiling of the shadow lands, all of these events could have hundreds if not thousands of years between them.

He obviously doesn‚Äôt want to spoil or ruin the surprises in the DLC. Of course he‚Äôs going to say ‚Äúthis Land is separate from the Lands Between of the Basegame, and you‚Äôll teleport there separately!‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Instead of ‚Äúoh yes, The Land of Shadows is the centre of the Lands Between, a place of great importance to the history and nature of the Lands Between, and was removed from the fabric of reality within the context of the basegame‚Äôs Lands Between by Queen Marika herself.‚Äù 

Like, you see the difference?üòÖ the game basically answers all these questions, regarding the nature of the Land of Shadows intrinsic connection to the Lands Between, in the very first zone of the region. And plenty more reinforcing evidence piles on this confirmation throughout the expansion (like Messmer‚Äôs ‚Äúflight‚Äù, existence of a ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù Altus, the Dual-shield literally telling us about the connection between TLB and TLOS). Of course, these things were never going to be spoiled to the players before release. It was a surprise.

The Scadutree itself is ambiguous, but answers the timeline. Some believe it‚Äôs the real Erdtree, some believe it‚Äôs another tree, some believe it‚Äôs the literal manifestation of the Erdtree‚Äôs shadow. No matter the case, the Scadutree is meant to depict the Erdtree of Shadow, meaning, it was created with the creation of the pure Erdtree in its light, almost religious form. The basegame already states that the Age of Plenty ended when the Erdtree lost its functional purpose, and instead became a faithful object. The DLC kinda just confirms that the separation of Light and Darkness marked the end of the Age of Plenty. Meaning, the Lands couldn‚Äôt have been veiled until VERY later on in the timeline. Or at least, closer to the Shattering than the Origin Marika‚Äôs time in the Hornsent culture.

As for the anatomy of the Lands. I think the locations of places are incredibly lore-important to the Lands Between (I.e- Jagged Peak located east, the Coast located south, ancient ruins strong population being north-west, shadow keep being in the upper-centre of the map, etc.) I think, location-wise, they all match up with locations of the Lands Between. But people believing in the ‚Äúthe Land of Shadow was always a different realm‚Äù idea are wayyyy too focused on the actual size of the map. This is a Fromsoftware DLC. They wanted to show out from a gameplay perspective, as is the case with most From DLCs. They wanted to make everything better, from a mechanical perspective. The actual SIZE of the region has nothing to do with the Lore. It‚Äôs all gameplay, for allowing Miyazaki and From have a creatively-driven and unrestricted development process. Having the map size actually be lore-accurate would have likely prevented some of the most creative minds in Fromsoftware from working their magic. And it‚Äôs for this very reason why we are NEVER supposed to see the Lands Between and the Lands of Shadow side-by-side. From a lore-perspective, it‚Äôs because the Shadow Lands were later removed from the Lands between by Marika: but this aided from a gameplay perspective too, the separation allowed Fromsoftware to create a Large, expansive, and dense new world without worrying about the lore implications, since we would never be able to make a side-by-side comparison unless you‚Äôre Zullie the Witch. They could‚Äôve made the Shadow Lands BIGGER or SMALLER than the Lands Between, for all I care, and it still wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything from a lore-perspective, it still would be outside the view of the Erdtree, making it impossible to make a side-by-side comparison, allowing them to create a map as dense or as big as possible",2025-02-15T13:16:26Z,0

Downscale to fit and look geographically instead of just putting map overlay and looking geographically!

Also i forget who did it but they lined up farum azula with the city of ephael! Before it got hit with the meteor! The reason death is hidden in farum azula is because its frozen in time

Burning the tree doesn‚Äôt affect the shadow lands because we are choosing to become the new lord but marika still remains a god now celestial",2025-02-15T13:08:31Z,0
k2KYvx_LAos,@capollyon,"Well done. I think you have managed to address same concerns i had when trying to fit Shadow Realm into story and world of Lands Between. I believe same as you, that Scadutree is not literal shadow of the Erdtree, rather than its symbolic shadow. Marika did not veil Shadow Realm by physically separating it, she veiled the path to Shadow Realm by removing Death from Elden Ring. Shadow Realm is indeed Underworld for all manners of Death to drift to. However, Marika wanted world without death, so she removed it, and as such, veiled the path to the Lands of Shadow and that is the reason why it is so difficult to get there from Golden Order.",2025-02-15T11:49:28Z,1
k2KYvx_LAos,@jones6471,"You know there is probably some mileage in considering the lands between to be representative of the great runes comprising the elden ring. In other words, by removing the rune of death Marika removed the land of shadow from the lands between. Just a small half baked theory to get the juices flowing.",2025-02-15T11:30:58Z,1
k2KYvx_LAos,@cozzycosgrove3361,"Geographically speaking if they were both lined up, the erdtree and scadutree lining up specifically since those two need to occupy similar space, then the ruins of Rauh line up with the ruined labyrinth, Liurnia of the Lakes area with the statues and ruins similar yo Ruah, complete with a Golem guarding the well entrence. The Jagged peak and the dragons presence connects up to the dragon barrow, the plateau shares the signature golden glow of the flora. Another thing thats being ignored is that the shattering happens 5000 years BEFORE our character even does anything, and the removal of the realm of shadow put under a veil of illusion by Marika, who is linked to Radagon, who utilizes illusions often. So stuff that may not line up perfect has to be taken under a microscope and assessed under realistic erosion, cliff faces will be chipped away at, things will occur after its veiled away, such as the surplus of spirit graves, death, and other factors would have effected the environment and the people around the realm of shadows, not to mention that Messmer continues the purges long after she leaves causing this upsurge of death",2025-02-15T11:10:08Z,0

TcgqS-8-yqY,@HISPEEDLEVEL,"I DON'T LIKE IT.    The worst thing that can happen in a game where the biggest part of the audience are fighting and fence fans is to speed up the gameplay. Aren't we satisfied with plenty of slashers and fast action games? Do they want to turn the series into some kind of Tekken or Mortal Kombat or pubg?

To be honest, I would really, really like to see a couple of games in a more hardcore and realistic form from Fromsoftware or other manufacturers. That they would be in different settings, from European and Middle Eastern, to Central Asian, Indian and even feudal Japanese. But the main point would be that the fighting would be more realistic, you could say that the ghost of Tsushima was partly close to this on maximum difficulty (when one blow could kill, but not only you but also the enemy, everything is fair). And if you are in armor, then you calculate every swing of the mace, if you are in a light kimono, then you understand that any missed blow of the tati will cost you a serious wound or a cut off hand. Well, or something like that.With slow real pace and with less quantity of weapon but with better its look and quality and physics and feeling. 

This whole race and pop hack and slash and speedrun is really boring. Imposed by youtubers with egomania who love not the game but bragging like look how fast I can do everything, led to the fact that in games the character in armor jumps like a goat, or does something completely absurd like tumbling like a Greco-Roman wrestler at a tournament.

This co-op mode was the one thing me and my friend were looking for since the first gameplay trailer of elden ring showed up. The one thing I wished they added were better animations when enemies are hit. 

I guess after playing monster hunter wilds beta. I‚Äôm spoiled from the animations from anything.

1 - Mais personagens
2 - Mais mapas

--LCwCVW-Wg,@Kevin61733,I did 2 playthroughs trying out different weapons and builds and this 3rd one is only spells. Full mage build using spells i collected the first 2 runs and its fun but the timing is kind of annoying as any hit just knocks you out of casting. I also am just completely mixing and matching spells so its not boring spamming lightning bolts. There is some spells I need to get but imo at least for me it seems to be way harder than just using weapons. I dont have the spell ive seen people use that locks down the boss but after a combo from the boss I full charge the spell. Lightning bolt so far is my bread and butter if I just need quick damage while the fire rain is fun to use if they are big enemys or staggered.,2025-02-16T01:18:20Z,0

to whoever said the dlc needed more time to cook, i heartily agree. we were all so hyped for it, but we need to be patient and give them time to make what they're capable of making, instead of shoveling out something that's less than what we've come to expect

darkmoon greatsword was the easiest run i've ever done. yeah, death's poker is very good, but it's only good because of the aow, and how you can one-shot bosses with the right rng. as a melee weapon, if you're leveling for the aow, it sucks. dmgs is so much more multi-faceted, and synergizes with so many things. and you can frost-proc malenia out of waterfowl with the r2 projectile, so there's that lol

golden halberd is an excellent example of a somber weapon that lets the side down. i know nobody uses it for anything other than the buff, but if you put golden halberd side-by-side with commander's standard, the golden halberd is outclassed in every way.

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@launcelotdulake8075,"Great video bro! I have something to add which relates to your point about difficulty and dying at 2:42. When I'm trying to help a new player, I always stress the proper mindset to approach this game with. Facing difficult, complex bosses is one of the most fun parts of the game, but only if you're not afraid to die, and only if you're not eager to hurry through all the content. If you just wanna get past a boss, it will be frustrating, and this is why a first playthrough is so hard, because you just wanna see all the new content and you don't wanna get stuck, so this mindset does not come naturally. But if you can find the fun in simply fighting, dying, and gradually increasing your knowledge and skill against each boss, then each fight will feel immensely rewarding.

Enjoy your time with each boss, because once they're dead, you can't fight them anymore. Patience is key!",2025-01-06T17:15:24Z,26

But def need to learn how to run and dodge because Im use to being aggressive in game play and this is my 1st souls like game.
Neighbors probable think Im crazy cause this game will cause you to yell your azz off, chatacter is super slow in all movements while bosses are hella fast, its quite irritating to be honest but the game is pretty dope, def going for 40 HP before I get killed 30 more times by that damn dog (wolf) appreciate the video.. And yes I have been upgrading my sword and double sided spear, your Goat your ridding also help attacking some of these side bosses or mini bosses.
Also hate when I try to dodge he fuggin rolls or I try to run and he fuggin rolls.. Also why did they put the Gestures as the same button as picking shit up or climbing or trying to enter the yellow dillys. every time I try to do one of these he stsnds their and does a gesture and I get hit, hella irritating",2025-01-28T06:11:58Z,0

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@yanakaizzz9335,"Just gonna say that I'm two bosses away from earning the Elden Ring all acheivements trophy and I did this on the Dark Souls games also.
That said - this guys guide is spot on. It balances between aluding to more while keeping only to the essential fundamentals with acompanying visual expalnations. Excellent!

I wish I had this when I rage quit DS1 all those years ago only to return to and finish it (and DS2) totally after beating Dark Souls 3.

Diabetor's Five;
1) Level Vigour, {please do this, for everyones sake}
2) Upgrade Weapons often {let this define your difficulty preference}
3) Use Buffs, {anything from fall damage negation and invisibility to simple damage buffs later learning the weaknesses of your enemies}
4) Practice dodging and avoid becoming over loaded
5) Dont get frustrated ;)

Folks who do level 1 runs with fist only do this because they've realised in new game plus, eventually everything one shots you and armour never mattered. Also all bosses have more health. So NG+9 can be simulated with no weapons or levels...if only a bit dry. It's not for the pain, it's for the memory puzzle and focus challenge.
The lesson for us normies: you define the challenge - nevermore-so than in Elden Ring.

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@kayleemichelson4019,"I started less than a month ago. As always with any game I play, the rule is that if I die, I delete the profile and start again. I'm also not good at games where you have to react fast or perform complex actions on a timer and prefer more of a turn based or pause always available style.

Elden Ring so far is not difficult at all and watching this, I didn't follow any of those rules really. What I did was take the portal to Caelid and farm the vulgar soldiers using glintstone pebble and then great glinstone shard till 80 intelligence before touching any other stat. Next mind to 20 and vigor to around 40-50 since these don't really matter when farming but do matter when going out in the world. 

I of course died. 3rd try now. Level 180, it was pretty easy to unlock Mohg frog farm around level 80 after a few hours farming the vulgar soldiers. Then got the crystal staff, staff of loss (off hand), night comet. Upgraded the Crystal staff to +6, got the golden scarab and farming the frogs. When in doubt, overlevel, use spirit ashes and the game can't be easier. I can't dodge at all and get hit like half the time or more from bosses but that doesn't matter if I stay at range, let my minion tank them and kill most of them in seconds with magic. Everything up to Leyndell has been a cakewalk and the only danger I face is pretty much falling off a ledge now.",2025-01-14T15:31:16Z,0
