This allows you to break the enemy stance when you block their attack. From here you can go right into a guard counter and deal good damage.

NLdZ8Zex1cw,@peaceofmind5819,2024-08-29T15:14:12Z,"I have been obsessed with the starting class. I'm only 120h into the game and this is my conclusions, but I'm looking for either affirmation or corrections on these if you wouldn't mind stopping to read.

Warrior: Main melee DPS and Keen Ash of war mastery. Does well to punish large enemies with big recovery times. Best used as a Cooperative Finger if the host is a Confessor or Vagabond. 

Samurai: Attacks at every single opening possible making it the most consistent dps of all classes, never needing to pause for a break due to its high stamina. Sacrifices versatility of the Vagabond class in exchange for higher DPS and an immediate ranged option.  Struggles against heavy armored opponents due to the lack of staggering power and enemies immune to bleed. A contender arcane for amplifying it's bleed katana and dragon spells, but not much use for its discovery since it's starting armery is all you need.

Vagabond: Highest HP of all classes. Widest range arsenal. Best suited against human and middle sized bosses. This class is most likely to do the most exploring as they can equip armaments to deal with anything.

Bandit: easily amasses resources from dispatching lackies and has dragon sorceries for bosses. He can opt to go into the caves anyway to quickly max out multiple weapons for the highest early game power spike.

Hero: Highest stance damage of all classes. Not quite as tanky as the Vagabond. Deals with above human sized bosses. Can make space for other cooperative fingers to recover through repeated stance breaking and parrying. Excellent at absorbing sorceries and incantation damage. A surprising arcane stat that hints, like the bandit, may be possible to use dragon spells together with their brute force.

Confessor: The ultimate all around class; the widest arsenal and adaptability. Bloody Finger specialist after the holy immunity cut off in the mid game. 

Prophet: Ultimate support Cooperative Finger. High burst damage and heals. Can choose incantations that bosses are weak to. No incantations are above their reach.

Prisoner: superior combat advantage in a 1v1, high colosseum ranking. Has trouble dealing with multiple targets and opponents with high poise. One man damage machine.

Astrologer: Backline caster. Highest sustainable ranged DPS of all classes. Will not survive the lands between without the use of spirits, summons, and Cooperative Fingers.",0

Really fun until the game makes you play it for how it’s meant to but there is no tutorials in game to show you how. You spend it running away, going into dungeons only to make it to the boss and lose everything because you’re not ready. Then you try to get better but you don’t know where to begin: weapon, armor, affinity, talisman, level ups etc. everything is tied to ruins(exp. And currency). Now you been leveling up a certain stat for a certain class for a certain weapon then oh sorry you need to level up this if you want to use this. 30k ruins for the next level lol back to running around hiding and cheesing lol.

0uav6zQKiMQ,@MrCAF01,2023-09-29T12:31:31Z,"My first Souls game. IMO this game is lacking in some areas. Despite much of the game being spent on your mount, the chosen mount is not customisable and its graphics are abysmal.  It's like riding a children's pony. The double jump feature is also childish for this type of dark and gory setting. They could learn a thing or two from RDR2 and the way horses felt real and you could develop a bond with them/improve them/customise them/care for them. Otherwise , the levelling and ashes of war systems are unnecessarily complicated. Replacing these with simple Exp level up and ability points with a skill tree  would make more sense. Not to mention zero storyline. Positives: really liked the combat which was entertaining.",3

I was so bad at it when I first played it. It was my first Souls game, and I was horrible. But replaying it is odd because I'm surprisingly good at it now. I beat Margit on the first try and had an easier time with bosses who used to give me so much trouble. I beat most of them within 3-4 tries. I feel so happy.",0

E3Huy2cdih0,@Abnormal_dromen,2024-11-13T13:52:05Z,"Let’s start with Dark Souls—everyone hypes it up for its brutal difficulty, intricate world-building, and methodical combat. But here’s the thing: Dark Souls didn’t create the formula, it just perfected it. And if we’re talking about the real pioneers of tough, skill-based action games, Zone of the Enders (2001) was already on that path, setting the stage for what Souls would later refine.

What ZOE did differently was combine precision-based combat with multidimensional movement. You weren’t just locked into one plane like in Souls. In ZOE, you could fight on the ground and in the air, constantly shifting between 2D and 3D space. The fast, fluid combat system wasn’t just about timing—it was about adapting to your environment, something that would later influence other franchises.

Speaking of which, let’s not forget Ninja Gaiden (2004), which came before Dark Souls and is often regarded as one of the toughest action games of its era. Ninja Gaiden was all about high-speed, precision combat—combos, dodges, and counters. It was unforgiving, yet the gameplay was intense and required mastery of fluid movement and timing. What’s interesting is how Ninja Gaiden and ZOE shared that focus on adaptability in combat, although Ninja Gaiden was more grounded in a traditional 2D plane, whereas ZOE pushed the boundaries with 3D movement.

The thing is, while Souls brought a more methodical, slower pace to this style of combat, ZOE and Ninja Gaiden were all about fluidity, requiring players to think on their feet and execute under pressure. Both ZOE and Ninja Gaiden had systems that rewarded precision, but the way they approached combat was a lot faster and more dynamic than the Souls formula we know today.

So yeah, Dark Souls made the formula famous, but let’s not forget the games that laid the foundation. Zone of the Enders introduced multidimensional combat, and Ninja Gaiden refined the idea of fast, unforgiving action. If anything, Souls just slowed things down and focused on methodical combat, but it’s clear that the roots of all these systems were planted years before. Open your eyes—ZOE was the game that pushed action games forward.

What ZOE did differently was combine precision-based combat with multidimensional movement. You weren’t just locked into one plane like in Souls.

I remember my first steps... getting slapped by Margit and forced to explore to improve my skills and equipment. The first time I saw Sifiora River was pure magic. The scarlet rot lake, omg... I suffered badly with that dragonic knight. What a masterpiece. Anyone who hasn't given an opportunity to this game, please, I'm begging you to give it the chance. It may be hard at your first steps, but after some hours of exploration the feeling of fear and hardness change and get transformed into confidence and empowerment. Margit is your professor: ""Foul Tarnished,  in search of the Elden Ring. Emboldened by the flame of AMBITION..."" He teaches you that Elden Ring is not a game to kill the boss and change the area. You are ready for the rest of the game once you defeat him with not too much complications. The immersion and the feeling of actually exploring to improve are unique and magnificent. Elden Ring is the actual GOAT of the video games, and I bet it will not be surpassed for a long time.",7

For me this game's combat is very basic and story isn't very involving. I don't know if I am feeling this about the combat is because I played this one after finishing GoT. Personally in my opinion the only perk this game has is it's bosses, that's the only engaging thing about it, but currently in a RPG game, I expect a proper interesting storyline and a decent combat system which I find missing. Again, this is all my personal opinion, no offense to anyone.",0

DDHpaAq8uC8,@JayDarwin,2025-01-03T11:19:07Z,"My honest review.
I love skyrim, I really like dragons dogma 2.
I decided to buy elden ring and the DLC. I am shocked how difficult it is to begin with. I'm only 5 hours in and I'm exploring and trying to open the world.
I'm honestly disappointed with the lack of ANYTHING in the world.
Basically, everyone hates you, you can't force positive relationships. You can't buy a home, you can't romance, you can't go shopping, you can't do anything except fight.
I understand it's a fighting game, but 99% of this is fighting.
It's supposed to be a role playing game. I find myself so bored of fighting and wanting to do something different, but there is NOTHING you can do.

If these honest reviews were honest they would say to stay away if you don't want a fighting game all the way through.
I really feel like the creators of elden ring have really lost out on a big audience. (Those who like skyrim) those who want the freedom to play at their own pace and do as they wish.

I will say, as a oure fighting game, it's amazing. I just think the creators were very misleading.",1

DDHpaAq8uC8,@josephsharkrage4305,2024-10-17T03:16:53Z,"I did watch before buying. I liked every word. But there's one thing you never addressed and failed to mention: pretty ugly characters. That’s one thing you didn't mention when you first started for character. creation that is obviously known and can be clearly seen.
You may or may not have been aware of these, and those are Sliders🤷🏻‍♂️
I did try it and she turned out great.
Also didn't mention that the controls (PC) are very confusing not Dark Souls III level of confusing, this causes the game not to be fun. 
Oh, yeah on a little personal note it messed up my PC system causing to immediately request a refund from Steam, that I know is actually my PC and not because of you:)
So, yeah, good video, lovable content, elements, and narration (as always).",0

I've lost countless levels worth of runes because I died on the way back to collect them.  There is NO quest log which makes it near impossible to follow any of the quest lines.  I'm not asking for the map to be littered with quest markers.  I'd just like to be able to read what the last NPC told me I need to do within the quest line.  I could go on and on about what I dislike about Elden ring, but I'll run out of space to type everything.  I wasted 274 hours playing this game.  After taking thousands of deaths, I'm done with it.",5

DDHpaAq8uC8,@jakobcrockett4256,2024-08-05T17:22:27Z,"A few questions. I’m a casual gamer, I tried playing BloodBorne, but early on it was clear I was going to have to spend a few hours just learning how to play the game, does this game have an easier learning curve? 
Also, I really love BG3, but my biggest issue is there’s waaaayyyyy too much customization and variety, I have never gotten past the early stages of the underdark, and I’ve probably played Act 1, 8 different times, yes I’m aware I likely would’ve beat the game by now, but the variety in customization and story are immediately obvious and too damn intriguing at the start. I did the same thing with Cyberpunk and haven’t finished it. Will I have the same issue with this game? 
I’d like to add the context that I have 2 kids and am married. My kids love video games, but we obviously can’t be playing them all day everyday. The downside? My wife absolutely hates video games and will make snide remarks just because I decided to chose my hobby as a way to unwind and relax, so I get roughly 2-3 hours of play time at night when everyone goes off to bed. I have 3 unfinished RPGs in my library, Wasteland 3, BG3, and Cyberpunk. Should I add this to my list of RPGs I’ll never finish? 😂 gosh I’m a mess, sometimes fantasize about being a kid and getting to spend uncaring hours on gaming.",0

This as a full game - doesn't work for me. Souls-like with their methodical pacing and tight combat doesn't work for me with combination of Fortnite. It it's like mixing spaghetti noodles with whipped cream. Can you do it? Yeah. Will it be ok? Well, I guess. Is it good combo? Hell fking no.",1

0gPFoIUA1s4,@dfi_named_ion,2025-02-26T01:47:18Z,"I was invited to the Network Test, and the funny thing is, I had to play using an Xbox controller (I'm a mouse + keyboard player) via the remote play feature from the Xbox app. It was pretty funny to watch. For me, the gameplay was decent, and I mean not bad, not okay, not great, just somewhere in the middle. These sessions are fine for playing 3-4 of them in the evening after work. Progression is straightforward: you kill a boss or a great enemy, you get a reward, mediocre. That fortnite circle is a very debatable thing. It's nice to have some something that pushes you forward, but the way they implemented it is BS in my opinion. After the last session, I caught myself thinking that the game itself feels like a spinoff of the original game, in a bad meaning. In my country, the base game costs 1200UAH, which is too much considering the Elden Ring DLC costs the same. I don’t like the trend of rising game prices! It’s not cool to pay this much for something that feels like a Frankenstein mix of already-used elements.

I see this game as a fun way for people who want to get a taste of From Soft's games, without NEEDING to delve into the madness and grind of them; since this really just a spin off. 

To have people griping about it being ""a cash grab"", ""soulless"", ""slandering the Souls formula"", etc, I don't see it like that at all. The game isn't going to ruin Elden Ring, or any new projects From Soft might have in the future; if anything, I see this as a way for them to try new things, as well as keep fans snacking till a new game comes out. Hell, it's even cheap to get too, well, half the normal price of a Triple A game.

Ps the whole ethos of the game is to rinse and repeat until you're stupid, swerve at all costs, and buy a game that at least can be story moded. Instead of you being stolen from because you can't reach the end(the game is 3/10) it's pathetic!",0

I love the two hand running r1 cause you can just keep running after it, but there's a delay, and the r2 one is more quick in start up but more committal with its ending lag. And since it can hit on the sides of you pretty well, you can just dash past things while killing them. I don't know how much this applies in pvp outside of mixups but it's damn cool",6

Having just played through the entire game and DLC after a year long break, it was very interesting to hear your thoughts on the balancing and game design. I fully sympathise with your gripes and boss design, it goes entirely against your play style, and to some degree, against the design of previous Fromsoft bosses.

That being said, I personally love the way they approached balancing. I''ve played all Souls titles and enjoyed them immensly, but Eldenring especially reminded me that I'm first and foremost an RPG player through and through. I've always approached challanges in these games by using EVERYTHING in my tool kit, half the fun for me is in trying out different spells, items and summons. Probably cause I suck and learning patters and staying focused for long periods of time.

However, using all your tools well completely trivializes entire sections of the game. And holding myself back to make it more balanced is not very fun for me. This is why I rejoiced when the Dlc basically expected me to summon, when it made me gather fragments and resistance items before facing the new bosses. THAT is what I'm good at, that is what i love about this game. Figuring out the right spirit ash, damage type and resistance/utility items is BY far the most satisfying thing in the entire game for me and the DLC being balanced around doing just that is PERFECT in that case.

3 months late, most likely no one will read this comment, but I REALLY wanted to share my perspective on Eldenrings game design haha.",3

PWYsbnUexJI,@tarasouthwell6132,2024-10-25T09:20:14Z,"random thought i had during the rellana fight: i wish that for her boss weapon that they had gone with an aow that was more like her 2nd phase combos than having what amounts to a 2nd sword of night and flame. it would've been nice if the aow self buffed the weapons, and if the aow utilitized both magic and fire at once. you could still make it a stance with 2 different combos, and i think it would've felt more seamless, going from the weapon's standard move set to the aow and back. and the standard move set lends itself well to multi-hit, but the aow really doesn't, so it feels clunky to optimize. i also feel like the aow is still underpowered compared to SoNaF: when i was playing around with it (i dropped it to myself using cheat engine) on a fresh character with just the stats required to wield both weapons, SoNaF just seems to hit harder.",1

7xjW5oGlcUM,@6Suicidal6Sinner6,2025-02-27T11:40:34Z,Wow this game really does look awesome and I'm glad that people like you and your friends enjoyed playing it and had fun. Sadly for people like me I won't get to play this game. I love the soul series and Elden Ring is for sure a part of that for me. Being that I suck at these games and have to be over leveled to even get a chance at getting to the end. along with the fact for whatever reason I can't no matter how hard I try I can't do anything on the fly. I absolutely HATE games that have timers in them for me it becomes so disheartening and really makes me feel shitty. That's only a personal problem I understand that respect to all the people who enjoy and can take on games like those. I need to be able to take my time and yeah being that I suck playing online is just asking to have a really shitty time as elitists rule the online world and at the end of the day I would rather just let them have it. As much as I wish I had friends I could play online with I have to stick to solo play games which personally I have grown to be perfectly fine with. I'd rather have fun then have constant assholes insulting me and or going out of their way to mess up my game by killing me over and over again. If you're still reading I promise I'm not looking for pity I know I suck and I realize I just have to deal with that. I still love these games no matter how much hair I have ripped out and although I would love to get to play night reign myself but I fine playing vicariously through people like you. Thank you for making the videos you make. I truly adore your channel and your hard work and all those that help you have not gone unnoticed.   Oh just a side thought I'm fine with how hard they make these games I get that challenge is good for the soul but I really wish they would punish players for sucking. Making it harder for your team to raise you when you die more ok I guess I get it but all I see is people getting shit on for wanting to play an online game but their teammates have to constantly insult them because they literally are making shit harder for them. DS2 also comes to mind and how u were punished for not being a no hit run player. Idk I just think that's cruel u can punish us but don't single people out because they happen to have hand eye coordination issues like myself or whatever reason they are held back. I'm sorry If this is too long but thank you regardless. may your channel continue to grow for as long as you do this.,0

7xjW5oGlcUM,@TheWolfInTheGrass,2025-02-21T18:45:41Z,"Honestly, I'm not a fan of this. It feels like Eldon ring, special forces edition. 
Originally we were promised three expansions, and then 10 cent screwed that up when they tried to make the bid and said they wanted everything on mobile. 
So Miyazaki decided that it would be too much work to try and fit three expansions on a mobile device. And we ended up with nightreign... 
But, the depth just isn't there. This is straightforward, run as fast as you can, go go go, kill the boss, get out. It feels very much like a mobile game, and I assume was originally intended to be that. 
But, I just don't think it fits very well into the paradigm of a dark souls/er game really. 
Especially the whole ""I have an ultimate"" thing, sort of defeats the purpose of strategy in a lot of ways. Starts to feel like a summon in final fantasy instead of complete tactical combat like Eldon ring or dark souls. 
I wish they would just give us another two expansions for Eldon ring.",0

Here’s my concern there’s no way to not progress in a regular souls game you die.

PN7YFKHOR9Y,@FightinCowboy,2022-03-03T02:28:30Z,"Welcome to the walkthrough. This series will cover everything needed to obtain all trophies in the game, in addition to making an effort to acquire every weapon, spell, armor, etc. that you can in a single playthrough. The first few episodes are going to be a bit fast in our pacing as I'd like to cover a lot of various starting items for a variety of playstyles. 

Also, if it's your first playthrough I highly recommend you play blind. If you want to follow this guide from the start that's your choice, but you'll never get back the discovery of things that comes along with your first blind experience.",2415

--LCwCVW-Wg,@Kevin61733,2025-02-16T01:18:20Z,I did 2 playthroughs trying out different weapons and builds and this 3rd one is only spells. Full mage build using spells i collected the first 2 runs and its fun but the timing is kind of annoying as any hit just knocks you out of casting. I also am just completely mixing and matching spells so its not boring spamming lightning bolts. There is some spells I need to get but imo at least for me it seems to be way harder than just using weapons. I dont have the spell ive seen people use that locks down the boss but after a combo from the boss I full charge the spell. Lightning bolt so far is my bread and butter if I just need quick damage while the fire rain is fun to use if they are big enemys or staggered.,1

to whoever said the dlc needed more time to cook, i heartily agree. we were all so hyped for it, but we need to be patient and give them time to make what they're capable of making, instead of shoveling out something that's less than what we've come to expect

darkmoon greatsword was the easiest run i've ever done. yeah, death's poker is very good, but it's only good because of the aow, and how you can one-shot bosses with the right rng. as a melee weapon, if you're leveling for the aow, it sucks. dmgs is so much more multi-faceted, and synergizes with so many things. and you can frost-proc malenia out of waterfowl with the r2 projectile, so there's that lol

golden halberd is an excellent example of a somber weapon that lets the side down. i know nobody uses it for anything other than the buff, but if you put golden halberd side-by-side with commander's standard, the golden halberd is outclassed in every way.

The balance of weapons and abilities is nonsensical and all over the place. The fact that the ash of war on the starting weapon does as much damage as a CHARGED HEAVY ATTACK on a colossal weapon says enough on its own.

Then you have the fact they added summon ashes but didn't even try to balance the game around it, just turning up endless combos on boss.

It's a good game but wildly overrated and the widespread praise is an offspring from a mix of classic mob circlejerk mentality and stockholm syndrome.",2

I'm absolutely loving the game—it’s definitely one of the best open-world RPGs I’ve ever played. Your content has always been top-notch, and I’ve been a huge fan since 2013!

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@launcelotdulake8075,2025-01-06T17:15:24Z,"Great video bro! I have something to add which relates to your point about difficulty and dying at 2:42. When I'm trying to help a new player, I always stress the proper mindset to approach this game with. Facing difficult, complex bosses is one of the most fun parts of the game, but only if you're not afraid to die, and only if you're not eager to hurry through all the content. If you just wanna get past a boss, it will be frustrating, and this is why a first playthrough is so hard, because you just wanna see all the new content and you don't wanna get stuck, so this mindset does not come naturally. But if you can find the fun in simply fighting, dying, and gradually increasing your knowledge and skill against each boss, then each fight will feel immensely rewarding.

Enjoy your time with each boss, because once they're dead, you can't fight them anymore. Patience is key!",32

I have been preaching this shit since dark souls.  Level your fucking vigor Stat people.  😂  I do enjoy 1 shooting people but when I can out someone with literally 1 well-timed attack, it's not fun anymore, and I'm just walking around like the John Wick bored.
When I last played before the dlc dropped I would join in on a ganking squad watch the other phantom die wait for the host to run to me just so they could watch me single handle dispatch them. I enjoyed turning ganking parties into fight clubs with 1 goal beat that mother F'er right there. 😊 f gank squads.",0

Ive killed the 1st two bosses yet Im stuck on that damn Red Wolf who moves to damn fast, he hits you 4 times and your dead and my HP bar is very long I think 30 something, maybe Im using the wrong charms or whatever their called. But def need to learn how to run and dodge because Im use to being aggressive in game play and this is my 1st souls like game.
Neighbors probable think Im crazy cause this game will cause you to yell your azz off, chatacter is super slow in all movements while bosses are hella fast, its quite irritating to be honest but the game is pretty dope, def going for 40 HP before I get killed 30 more times by that damn dog (wolf) appreciate the video.. And yes I have been upgrading my sword and double sided spear, your Goat your ridding also help attacking some of these side bosses or mini bosses.
Also hate when I try to dodge he fuggin rolls or I try to run and he fuggin rolls.. Also why did they put the Gestures as the same button as picking shit up or climbing or trying to enter the yellow dillys. every time I try to do one of these he stsnds their and does a gesture and I get hit, hella irritating",0

Still, i didn’t understand stat distribution. So I was running around with high strength faith and intelligence. Mad bc I didn’t understand how to use incantations lol.

Then a buddy watched me attempt him for the umpteenth time, and was surprised that I was fighting him at base level with an un-upgraded weapon. I had somehow wandered all the way to him without ever meeting Melina, or even finding a smithing table. 

Leveled to 20, and got a +2 Morningstar and MELTED him. Even just a little helpful guidance can go so far in this game.",3

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@yanakaizzz9335,2025-01-17T06:39:50Z,"Just gonna say that I'm two bosses away from earning the Elden Ring all acheivements trophy and I did this on the Dark Souls games also.
That said - this guys guide is spot on. It balances between aluding to more while keeping only to the essential fundamentals with acompanying visual expalnations. Excellent!

I wish I had this when I rage quit DS1 all those years ago only to return to and finish it (and DS2) totally after beating Dark Souls 3.

Diabetor's Five;
1) Level Vigour, {please do this, for everyones sake}
2) Upgrade Weapons often {let this define your difficulty preference}
3) Use Buffs, {anything from fall damage negation and invisibility to simple damage buffs later learning the weaknesses of your enemies}
4) Practice dodging and avoid becoming over loaded
5) Dont get frustrated ;)

Folks who do level 1 runs with fist only do this because they've realised in new game plus, eventually everything one shots you and armour never mattered. Also all bosses have more health. So NG+9 can be simulated with no weapons or levels...if only a bit dry. It's not for the pain, it's for the memory puzzle and focus challenge.
The lesson for us normies: you define the challenge - nevermore-so than in Elden Ring.

Thankyou to Diabetor for making this guide!",0

Mzbyr70v7Q4,@kayleemichelson4019,2025-01-14T15:31:16Z,"I started less than a month ago. As always with any game I play, the rule is that if I die, I delete the profile and start again. I'm also not good at games where you have to react fast or perform complex actions on a timer and prefer more of a turn based or pause always available style.

Elden Ring so far is not difficult at all and watching this, I didn't follow any of those rules really. What I did was take the portal to Caelid and farm the vulgar soldiers using glintstone pebble and then great glinstone shard till 80 intelligence before touching any other stat. Next mind to 20 and vigor to around 40-50 since these don't really matter when farming but do matter when going out in the world. 

I of course died. 3rd try now. Level 180, it was pretty easy to unlock Mohg frog farm around level 80 after a few hours farming the vulgar soldiers. Then got the crystal staff, staff of loss (off hand), night comet. Upgraded the Crystal staff to +6, got the golden scarab and farming the frogs. When in doubt, overlevel, use spirit ashes and the game can't be easier. I can't dodge at all and get hit like half the time or more from bosses but that doesn't matter if I stay at range, let my minion tank them and kill most of them in seconds with magic. Everything up to Leyndell has been a cakewalk and the only danger I face is pretty much falling off a ledge now.",0

Yet when you go to infuse them, the blacksteel weapons get higher AR off of flame art, and the fire knight gets higher AR off of sacred infusion. On my 80 faith build with no boosting equipment or talismans it's like a 60 point difference between sacred and flame art so while not huge it's not insignificant either.

Simply because you will get overall better stats and a lower level meaning the few early levels will be cheaper which in the long run means you get the same strength for less runes than other characters will need to pay.

B8HvfirR4S4,@raidear_official,2024-08-23T15:03:40Z,Okay well this is for Dex builds if you want to start as a strength build go vagabond if you want to go for an int build pick the astrologer or if you're just going for one of those Faith builds I would either recommend the prophet or the Confessor because both of those are actually pretty good for an early start for faith incantation builds. But don't be afraid to make your own bills and your own designs there are literally thousands of armor pieces in weapons in this game some are the best some are pretty s*** if you were mostly one trick ponies but they still work nonetheless overall find something that's easy for you to play or that you want to try an attempted but if you want to beat the game easily first to understand the full game before you make a build I would suggest going pure strength since now they are considered the best build with the biggest and strongest weapons in the game that will crush bosses trust me it will be easy.,0

Marika actually wanted to Free the Lands Between from the Greater Will.
The Greater Will, an outer god, uses the Elden Ring as a tool to enforce its rule over the Lands Between.
Marika may have realized that this “order” was actually a form of oppression, trapping the people in a cycle of suffering and stagnation.
Her act of shattering the Elden Ring might have been a desperate attempt to break free from this divine control.
The fact that she hid Miquella away and he later sought his own path suggests that she may have wanted a different future than what the Greater Will intended.",3

I think that Marika was a great influence in the practice of the living jars, maybe even starting it, as a way to secretly pay homage to her kin that endured this hellish treatment and comparing them to the brave warriors that were buried in the jars of the lands between. 

Another thing I'd like to argue is about Marika's rise to godhood (which you did say is for a later video and I agree) I think that maybe instead of Godfrey being the lord that Marika partnered with during her ascent, it was Radagan who was her partner and that Marika HERSELF was the vessel. This might explain why they share a body, and it could explain why Marika is seen alone as during her rise to godhood. We already know from Mesimir that Radagan and Marika had a relationship before the Lands Between, before the ErdTree.

That the hornsent are no more special then humans, who are no more special than a bear in the Crucible's eyes. They are all living things, evolving, changing, and competing. And that ultimately the Crucible doesn't care. In fact, it might not even think. After all, I can't actually remember someone talking to it like they do with the Rot or the Formless Mother. It simply is. It creates life, encourages evolution, and does so with no regard to anything. And that is blissful in its own way. The beauty and majesty of nature is a powerful sight to experience, no matter how little it cares for you personally. 

And that is a truth the hornsent could not bear. To be just another creature is their worst fate. So they denied the Lamenter and sought to create their own god instead, eventually leading them to the Greater Will and the Erdtree.",0

LJP3V3PW-vQ,@blorbothefrog,2025-02-07T18:21:19Z,"the whole highlander idea of finding companionship in beasts via subjugation honestly makes me think of Godwyn being the son of Godfrey (aka hoarah loux, post finding his beast companion). I mean godwyn very famously befriended and partnered with fortissax after defeating him in battle. perhaps the dragon cult of leyndell was only as intrinsic as it was because of how long standing the ties of beast companions were in culture anyway, not just because of the show of strength

and talking of Godwyn, is it possible that he inherited some shaman capabilities from marika? I feel like it may be entirely possible that it was this connection to the melding flesh of shamans combining with the recyclable idea of erdtree burial that godwyn most certainly would have received that may be responsible for death root. after all, it's the erdtree that absorbs and redistributed life energy. and if godwyn had taken in part of destined death and he also carried the capacity to meld with others like shamans, it's entirely possible that is what spawned deathroot and it's capacity to spread across the entirety of the lands between, even going so far as to infect both the living and dead (which we see both in skeletons but also for example in rogier who gets infected)

and just following the thought tracks here, but is it at all possible that miquella, who failed to deliver true death to those who live in death, and failed at Castle sol to restore godwyns soul when the eclipse never came (likely due to radahns meddling with the stars), is it possible that he went to the land of shadow in search of the rumours of shaman abilities to ascend? I feel like it's entirely possible that his intent may have been to revive godwyn instead of radahn, and mohg was only intended to be the access point past the veil instead of the ultimate vessel

 I may be just making things up based on limited recollection, but I honestly believe its possible that godwyn and miquella had a strong connection in youth (after all, the vow memory never refers to radahn specifically, just ""brother"". and miquella has referred to his lord brother in godwyn via that one sword he made to commemorate his death), and miquella may have found godwyns companionship with fortissax to be emblematic of the compassion he was striving for. it may have followed that miquellas plan after godwyns death was to access the shadows via mohgs curse, and to use radahns body as vessel for godwyns soul. it would make sense, especially if it was radahns meddling that caused Castle sol to fail, and it is godwyns soul that needed restoring, potentially to a new body. personally I'm a big fan of that theory",0

Destined death belongs to an order that is not the gravebird's or any other outer god's and while multiple orders can simulteanously exist, over time one order always manage to prevail to reign supreme, if only for a temporary period of time. this is what makes me think that the stars and the natural forces are the same beings. outside lifeforces, guided here by the attraction of the moon, that influence the earth with whatever they're made of just as naturally and breathing for us, but viewed from two different perspective: the one of intelligence with the sorcerers and the one of faith with the different civilisations. they see the same magic at work, but interpret it differently from each other. this is very much why ymir's staff scales with intelligence and arcane and metyr's staff can bend both sorceries and incantations.

a god with such power over the dead and that capacity to slay gods were very surely huge threats to the hornsents of the tower and an act of blasphemy to their eyes obsessed with harvesting the divine. maybe this is why they were even more happy when marika took the source of this power for herself by having maliketh kill the queen in her name, and also genocided the fire bending giants on the way. If Marika was killing rivals that were using the divine ""wrongly"" and were a physical threat to their society even though no war was declared, no wonder the hornsent thought of her as an ally grateful for her godhood, proving that their methods and ways to view the world and the divine and moreso treat others were right.

maybe maliketh saw in marika how he and his kindred beasts were abused and enslaved, and maybe this is how he managed to separate the god and the lord and to ultimately kill the godslayer empyrean, as maliketh marika's shadow but still in disguise of gurranq the beast clergyman. whether it'd be hoarrah loux, placidusax, or maliketh, or even ourselves, following a god til the end maybe requires a lust for power, or perhaps having fallen deeply in love with the god in question. where miquella very ironically wields love like a weapon, this is very likely that it was also affection that moved ranni's allies, with us, maliketh, placidusax, and godfrey to such heights to help their chosen gods, and more importantly moved them to continue to trust in their god even after having been abandonned.",0

MfJxchw-QbU,@brenbar5736,2025-02-21T02:54:39Z,"Elden ring is easily the easiest soulsborne game simply because of the ability to overlevel before entering an area or boss fight. Do all of limgrave/weeping peninsula then go for Margit if you’re struggling heavily. Over level, use ashes, etc. you get some genuinely cracked items early on such as the sword of night and flame which is viable for end game builds and is pretty easy to get in the first 20 or so hours.",0

MfJxchw-QbU,@PPonyo,2025-02-20T23:27:13Z,"⚠️ALERT⚠️: The statistics in this video are deeply flawed. The metrics, such as the percentage of players to reach a specific achievement, only apply to PC players. Furthermore, the creator continues to misuse quantitative information at 0:16 by applying the 22.5% steam metric to the total (all consoles, including PC). This simply doesn't work, as the creator's data states that every copy of Elden Ring ever sold has been through Steam; this couldn't be farther from the truth. Finally, you incorrectly state that FromSoftware made $330M from players that didn't get the first achievement, which is another example of the creator applying Steam metrics to every console. Being realistic and assuming (based on the rough average of Steam ownership estimations from Gamalytic, VG Insights, and PlayTracker) that Elden Ring sold ~14.5M copies through Steam, then FromSoftware only made $195.75M. 
TL;DR 
1) Creator misuses statistics. 
2) Creator applies misused statistics to FromSoftware's profit.",1

Pp8y6E8kob8,@VictoriaForSale,2025-02-19T20:08:31Z,"I just started watching and I have to make a statement about red fruits or vegetables in our world and blood. Red wine helps with thinning blood, red beat and red cabbage are good for producing blood cells or purifying them, blood oranges helps against high blood pressure. Even though these are not the only natural plants helping our health, it's notable that color is important in the real world too. Red mushrooms are most likely to be poisounos.  insects and birds have specific colors against others, among them using red. There exists a flower that only blooms after it's seed got heated up by a bush fire. It's color is red. Red is a color connected to life and danger alike. Not only humans acknowledge this but animals do too as far as they are able to see colors.

I just wanted to state that. Maybe it helps understanding the intentions by the creators. Our world is a world of colors. And even the worst, frightening occurrence in the universe is accompanied by Beauty and color.",0

With your impaled heraldry observation, maybe he was wed or otherwise promised to a high ranking Hornsent family (maybe Romina and she was convinced to betray her own people to boot?) to bind them to the Erdtree. Weather he was commanded to betray them later on by Marika or it was part of her plan all along I can't begin to guess, but he does also curse Marika with his final words, betraying her trust in him.

In the Western culture it is perceived that the world as worth living in despite all the suffering we see and endure in our lives. Life is considered singular meaning „you only live once“ In the East, especially in the Buddhist cultures life is presented as a cycle of rebirths and sufferings, which we and the 90% of NPCs endure in the game as well, as we die and respawn at sites of grace together with the enemies we have killed already. And the only way to stop it, is to stop the cycle of rebirth so suffering can finally come to an end as well as all existence",0

TcgqS-8-yqY,@HISPEEDLEVEL,2025-02-17T12:40:14Z,"I DON'T LIKE IT.    The worst thing that can happen in a game where the biggest part of the audience are fighting and fence fans is to speed up the gameplay. Aren't we satisfied with plenty of slashers and fast action games? Do they want to turn the series into some kind of Tekken or Mortal Kombat or pubg?

To be honest, I would really, really like to see a couple of games in a more hardcore and realistic form from Fromsoftware or other manufacturers. That they would be in different settings, from European and Middle Eastern, to Central Asian, Indian and even feudal Japanese. But the main point would be that the fighting would be more realistic, you could say that the ghost of Tsushima was partly close to this on maximum difficulty (when one blow could kill, but not only you but also the enemy, everything is fair). And if you are in armor, then you calculate every swing of the mace, if you are in a light kimono, then you understand that any missed blow of the tati will cost you a serious wound or a cut off hand. Well, or something like that.With slow real pace and with less quantity of weapon but with better its look and quality and physics and feeling. 

This whole race and pop hack and slash and speedrun is really boring. Imposed by youtubers with egomania who love not the game but bragging like look how fast I can do everything, led to the fact that in games the character in armor jumps like a goat, or does something completely absurd like tumbling like a Greco-Roman wrestler at a tournament.

This co-op mode was the one thing me and my friend were looking for since the first gameplay trailer of elden ring showed up. The one thing I wished they added were better animations when enemies are hit. 

I guess after playing monster hunter wilds beta. I’m spoiled from the animations from anything. I can’t even imagine me and my team stun locking an enemy over and over… without it really putting a fight. I’ll have to see more gameplay but looks good to me either way.

I was well practiced before going into Elden ring. I don’t think any one would say Elden ring is an open world expansion of dark souls. I think a stand alone spin off was a fair decision.,0

I hated that they basically ruined parrying in ER with the idiotic windup animations. It's just faster to jam R1. They are know for amazing level design and they don't make games using it anymore.

My biggest concern and hope for this game is that there is eventually a Post launch content patch or a DLC that allows you to port over your elden ring character maybe with some balancing caveats such as disabled leveling or something. I think it would be good for newer players to become introduced and incentivized to visit the base game,0

This was my first souls like game experience and trust me, I was very, very intimidated and yes, I used guides on YouTube too. Help me on my way. But ultimately, what I loved most about this game was There is no difficulty level and the game is as hard as you allow it to be. What I mean by that is if you go and rush off, do encounters that are difficult. Where the enemy kills you in one or two hits. You can leave and go and level up and come back later, Because the world is so big and there is so much to find. It wasn't a chore to go and Level up. In fact, I would go and explore as much as I could before doing the main parts in an area so that 1 I faced the hardest enemies in the area. I was already so powerful that the fights really weren't that difficult.",0

Torrent can do a sweet trick during a double jump.  Idk if it can be done on M&KB, but with a controller if you double-jump and do a super fast 360 with the left joystick immediately after the second jump input, Torrent will do a sick 360 in the air.  Great for swaggin' on hoes.

There were some cheap ass deaths and the certainly were some fucking bullshit enemies, but overall this is the easiest souls like game from FromSoftware.

It already was day 1 and it still is nowadays. I think that the main problem was that, since the game is so easy most of the time, you get caught off guard once it goes back to (what ultimately is) normal FromSoft difficulty lol",1

D1H4o4FW-wA,@joshmcdonald1758,2024-12-29T17:23:47Z,I definitely think Elden Rings overtuned difficulty has increased the games longevity now that the playerbase has had time to fully exploit the games mechanics and tip the scales in the favour of the player. I even think that the godskin duo is a great fight and one of the most well rounded fights in the soulsringborn franchise. However I do think that for a new player the game is nearly impossible to progress though in a way that is logical.,3

Also put dodge roll on L1,  guard/magic on LB, and weapon art on the normal dodge roll button. 3 way swap cuz guarding and charged magic just feels right on a bumper, while rolling needs the more tap-responsive button. I learned to clawgrip for DS1 and my setup does require it to use flasks while walking but I find it a lot more bearable than having to do it every time i want to sprint-jump. The fact that you can't equip things or put them in the pouch from the inventory screen is unbelievable, amazing how good the game is that stuff like that gets overlooked. From UI is ass in general in a lot of ways but learning to manage it is part of the fun.",0
